Unfortunately, Quinn doesn't pack the same punch. Her characters are mostly unsympathetic, the story lines are too wacky to be believable, and the whole thing could have used some tighter editing. For example, early on she describes a restaurant frequented by celebs and says patrons gave a spontaneous standing ovation to Springsteen. Not on your life. That ain't New York, baby. She gets it right later in the book when she says New Yorkers are blase about celebrity, but the earlier scene should have been edited out. Ditto for the dialogue about postprandial sonnets, which is repeated nearly verbatim toward the end of the book in a different scene. This is more lighthearted fiction (with the occasional erotica scene thrown in to spice things up) than witty social commentary. Take it to the beach, but bring along a back-up book just in case."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"This book is terrible and so CORNY! There is NO other word to describe it. I am definitely an avid book reader and I know a good book when I read it. I love a good \\"brain candy\\" book as much as the next girl and that's what I was looking for. For example : \\"The nanny diaries\\", not deep or intense but smart, realistic, and fun to read! ( All of the things is book isn't). The main character is lame and unbelievable and pathetic. Example: \\"Ivy\\" catches her husband having an affair with the wife of a co-worker. Later on in the book \\"Ivy\\" has the woman over for a BBQ and introduces her to people. Ummm ya puke!~ Would never happen. Example: She has a client ( little girl) pretend to be black to get into a private school by changing her name and going to a tanning salon! No I am not making this up. Um can you say LAME! OH MY GOD ! This author should give me my money back. Seriously this book was such a waste of time. WHY it is being made into a movie is beyond me ! READ SOMETHING ELSE! NOT HILARIOUS OR FUNNY! LOL"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"As an avid reader I am always exploring new and interesting writers this book landed on my lap after much searching for a good read. This book provides that and some. A fun and head slapping book that leads it's reader to try and become the characters sound mind. I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"The blurb says \\"ferociously funny\\" but to me, a single mother getting sacked, cheated on, ... etc! and under so much pressure her kid feels she's being neglected,just isn't funny."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"As a matter of fact if the author could give me back the day of my life that I wasted reading this junk, that would be a suitable refund. One of the WORST books ever written."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I'm so tired of over-simplified chick-fiction that features a nice, tidy resolution in every chapter provided by SOME EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCE. Come on! Deus ex machina might have sufficed in the Middle Ages, but I need something more challenging, even in my escapist reading. In fact, I read the first five chapters, skipped to the last chapter, and still knew exactly what had transpired in between."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"This is not my typical read...I generally read non-fiction biographies or history. When I do pick up fiction I usually prefer Tom Clancy techno thriller or even Dan Brown's symbolism mysteries. A friend recommended this book to me and I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed it. From beginning to end it is a wonderful light hearted read that both amuses and tugs at the heartstrings. I look forward to Karen Quinn's next work."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"More \\"chick-lit\\" garbage in an industry that's already overflowing with junk.It's amazing how nonsense like this actually gets published. I'm suspecting the\\"author\\" (and I use that term lightly) had a friend in the publishing industry. How otherwise to explain a useless waste of paper?"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Save your money and time for 2 reasons:1 - The protagonist is a whinny, shallow, stupid, lying, cheating woman who is very difficult to identify with. I felt like slapping her to her senses at many points through the book.2 - Some truly unrealistic events. (Alligators eating three people at once when a ship sinks? Alligators don't live in deep water and ships don't go in the swamps, not to mention that alligators don't eat people - duh.)"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"With a 4 year old applying to schools (and acceptance due this week), I picked up both The Ivy Chronicles and Admissions at the airport last week on the way out to LA. If this is a topic that interests you nearly as much as it occupies the life and conversation of everyone I know, forget this piece of garbage. It was so bad, I left it behind on the plane."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I rarely read novels. I guess I'm a bit of a snob that way. But, I was at a Lunch with the Authors function last week and thought \\"Why not?\\"I purchased The Ivy Chronicles, had Ms. Quinn sign it, and finished the book in 2 days. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!! I came of age in Manhattan so, for me, it was an amusing - and often wicked - nod to my hometown. Her characters and writing style had me in stitches. I e-mailed her to thank her for writing such a fun, delicious book. =-)"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I love books on CD!! Nothing makes a road trip go faster -- but The Ivy Chronicles tops them all. I just heard Karen Quinn's last words of this book on my way in to work -- and I didn't want it to end. Living in Central New York I am not familiar with Julia Gibson's stage work, but she is so gifted at reading this story. Every character comes to life.I found myself laughing out loud all the time (and being slightly embarrassed driving along laughing -- with no one else in the car!!) Can life really be this outrageous among the rich and really not so famous? Oh to be a fly on the wall in their homes!! Ivy is truly lovable -- every flawed inch of her!! I especially loved her timing of calling for God's help -- I could definitely relate to that.This is the best chic lit yet. Buy it for yourself or any girlfriends who need a good beach read -- or buy the CD to listen to on the way to the beach. You won't regret it. Karen Quinn -- we want more!!!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Ivy Ames is having a very bad day. First she loses her job, then she finds her husband cheating on her. To surport herself, Ivy decides to become to kindergater advisor to New York's riches families. But Ivy has no idea what she is in for. Parents that would do anything to help their child into school including, backmail, lying or anything else.I really liked this book in the beginning, but as the book progress, I began to dislike Ivy, she just seem so shallow and for a woman who worked with children, she did not have much time for own. Its a light read but not much more."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I loved Loved LOVED this book. I bought it last year and finally found the time to read it. Now I'm sorry I waited so long. Karen Quinn's writing style is so funny and unforced, she had me in stitches all the way through. Seriously, if you saw a woman on the subway, in Starbuck's or at the back of the room at jury duty laughing out loud with a book in her lap, that was me.You probably already know what this book is about from the other reviews--a woman who starts a business getting the children of wealthy families into posh pre-schools, which are suprisingly and unbelievably competitive. But what I loved most about the storyline was the incredibly revealing peek into the lives of the rich and richer of NYC. As a NYC resident who lives on the Upper East Side, the neighborhood where many of the tony day schools referred to in the book are located, and having to see these kinds of privileged folks every day, it was intriguing to know such intimate details of their real and often unintentionally hysterical lives.As a professional writer, I also appreciated Quinn's uncanny ability to make dialogue sounds so natural. It often felt as though my best girlfriend was speaking right to me. For her first book, that's a major accomplishment. In fact, the writing was so wonderful, it was often difficult to believe that this was really her first book. I can't wait to get my hands on her next one!To sum: Buy this book. Then don't put it aside. Read it and enjoy it right now. This great, fun escape is worth it!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"From the first couple pages, I guarantee any reader will be drawn into Ivy's world. The character is easily likeable and you route for her with anxious excitement till the end. It is filled with laughs, love, dreams and shock (sprinkled with a bit of laughs, of course). The characters are well developed and the plot never slows down. This book was very well written."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Wow...I finished this book hoping that the main character would redeem herself, and she never did. A truly disappointing read."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"As a writer and a tough critic, I must say that this story is beautifully-written, informative, and hilarious. Quinn collides reality with humor in this honest, outrageous portrayal of high-brow NYC folks vying for the few coveted spots in the most prestigious private schools. The absurdity is what provides the humor. I mean, we're talking about kindergarten. But the lengths parents will go through to get their kids in would lead one to believe we are talking about medical school. Quinn vulnerably portrays how she, too, can get caught up in the cut-throat world of private school admissions and must make some very difficult ethical decisions. She is human and we love her for it. Laugh, learn, and enjoy the ride in the dog-eat-dog world of kindergarten private schools, where anything, and I mean anything, can happen."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Ivy Ames had it all, at least she thought she did. She is unceremoniously downsized from her high-paying financial job. Ivy comes home to find her husband, Cad in their jacuzzi with another woman, the wife of the executive who just replaced her. Desperate to find a new job, she starts sending out her resumes with little results. Ivy has to sell the apartment Manhattan and moves with her two girls to Brooklyn. At the urging of her fabulously rich friend, Faith Lord, Ivy markets herself as an admissions counselor for parents looking to get their children into kindergarten at the schools known as the \\"baby ivys\\". Ivy obtains a wide variety of clients wanting the very best for their offspring. Her notes and conversations with her clients are very entertaining. After divorcing Cad, Ivy only wanted the very best for herself and her girls and would only settle for someone who was fabulously wealthy. Ivy finds the man of her dreams but he's not even close to whom she pictured herself with in the future. Well written with a light touch."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I picked this book to entertain me during a long flight - and entertain it did. I received several \\"looks\\" from fellow passengers as I laughed out loud chapter after chapter. It is engaging and funny. I couldn't put it down. The perfect read!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Ivy annoyed me. I'll just put that out there right from the start. I found her character grating at times. She was whiney and pathetic, as well as devious and mean. Combine that with the very preach tone of a lot of the book, and I should be rating it a lot lower than I am. And yet, somehow, the book was still tolerable - and I'm not sure how. Looking back on it, thinking about it analytically, I should have hated it. But I'll rate it as 'just okay'. It would be a good commuter audio book, I don't know that I'd invest free time in listening to it."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"If you enjoyed The Nanny Diaries, you will enjoy The Ivy Chronicles. A fast, fun read that will appeal to moms, teachers and the like. Take advantage of this great bargain price and buy it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"As a busy teacher, I have been waiting for the chance to read \\"The Ivy Chronicles\\". Now that I have completed this story, all I can say is that I wanted to throw this book into the garbage after getting two thirds of the way through the story. Ivy, the main character is a self-absorbed snob that miraculously never goes through any true hardship in the story, but the author really pushes the idea that she is a poor and pitiful character. Ivy, similar to some real people, neglects her own children while complaining of others that are doing the same as her. By the end of the story, men are at her beck and call just begging to be with her and there is no accounting of her despicable actions. Characters that are written as antagonists are all inexplicably punished by \\"karma\\", yet the protagonist gets all that she has desired through out the novel by means of manipulating and never really growing as a character. Then there is the unrelated and/or underdeveloped revelation on the main character's half that there are racist people in the world. It appears that the author through this in towards the end as an attempt to make Ivy a sympathetic character. Also, there was no real ending. I seemed that Karen Quinn just decided to stop writing when she saw there was no were to go with this book, she just stopped writing with an obligatory \\"happy ending\\". To put it modestly, this story just doesn't work. It lacks the basics: character development, a climax in story, and an actual end. I have seventh graders that write better then this; not worth the $6 or what ever the price may be now."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I listen to samples of new audiobooks even when not interested, just to see what is being listened to; the description of this book had not interested me but the short snippet completely hooked me and I bought it instantly - it is so funny and smart. I don't usually listen to fiction, but this was outstanding. Set in the upper echelons of NY society (or a fictional one, anyway, how would I know?) the social lampooning is so much fun. Also as an American living abroad it makes me feel closer to various things that are happening in US society. Fun!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I'm a writer and a mom of young children and when I read this I was looking for some enlightenment...at the very least some entertainment. This is a poorly written book with a remarkably thin, assinine plot and a ridiculous main character. I think it appeals to some moms out there because they've truly lost their intellectual capabilities and identities by focusing all their attention on their children and spending most of their time in coffee klatches with other like-minded moms."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I bought this book thinking I would be reading another Nanny Diaries (which I loved). This book doesn't even deserve to be in the same room with the Nanny Diaries! It was fake, forced, and completely unenjoyable. The dialogue was overdone. It was inconsistent and contradicted itself many times. Most of the characters were completely one-dimensional and/or not credible. Doesn't Faith Lord have better things to do than focus entirely on Ivy's life and cater to her every whim? And Ivy is such a pushover, it made me sick when she couldn't confront a single person of the many who have wronged her.I couldn't do it! I forced myself to read about half-way in hopes it would get better, and then I had to give up. And I never quit books! I can't rememeber the last time I didn't finish a book, I love reading so much.As Italians say, there is no worse thief than a bad book. I feel robbed!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book! I thought I'd read a couple chapters on my quick beach trip, and ended up finishing it the next day. Ivy Isn't a perfect person, but I ended up rooting for her. Her internal dialog was a hoot, the characters were fun, and the ending is satisfying. Being from Cleveland, reading about obsessed New York parents was a bit like reading about a foreign culture, with laughs. Give it a try on your next beach trip...."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"It's been quite a while since reading a book made me laugh out loud while taking public transportation. Karen Quinn's light-hearted, over the top satire of the crazed world of corporate life and that of wealthy parents is a hoot. It's a fun, feel-good read!!!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I bought this book on Wednesday night and finished it this morning. There are indeed some laugh out loud moments and I enjoyed the read. The scenes involving the children are a scream. Sure Ivy should have seen what Phillip was up to long before she did, but the author kept me reading to find out what that was really about. Thankfully I have never been faced with private school admissions, living in an area with excellent public schools, but I can appreciate the absurd situation NYCers face. In less rarified air, parents just move into the best school district, buying houses they stretch to afford, all to get the best education for their kids. Parents just want the best for their kids as this book humorously points out. It' a light, fast read and will have you laughing during the day and smiling when the story ends."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Disappointing. Why is it so many female lawyers drop out of law and turn to novels?? Big mistake. Many should go elsewhere; they are not very entertaining. Case in point: this transitioned to novel writing attorney, Karen Quinn, had two careers and has yet to find her forte. This chick lit miss held promise in the first three \\"teaser\\" chapters then became monotonous and predictble and over-the-top unbelievable. The heroine was unsympathetic, the story, slapstick. Nothing flowed or held together well; it was as if she made an outline of all the outlandish surreal events that were to happen and simply plugged them in. There was no flow or coherence. I kept putting the book down and skipping around. I took forever to finish. I was never compelled to do so. When I finally read the last few chapters...I thought boring, boring, boring...the two men were bland cardboard troll sorts.. without magic or elan...the ending silly, predictable. I realize nowadays women have to make a living; but please don't all go into fiction...unless you're inspired...and have a unique vision....and a soupon of \\"talent\\"."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Finally, a fresh, entertaining novel that isn't predictable! The Ivy Chronicles was a great read that I finished in only a day or two. I could hardly put it down.What I thought to be the best thing about this novel was the fact that I was kept guessing until the very end. Most books in this genre tend to be predictable, following a cookie cutter plot with the same main character. Ivy, a single mother of two, is a breath of fresh air. With her fun personality and talent for getting into more trouble than the average person, Ivy kept me laughing.A terriffic read for the summer. Check it out!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Ivy Ames is in trouble. She caught her husband with another woman, and has been fired from her job- in the same day. Finances are tight and she must make changes in her life. No more nannies, expensive private schools, nutritionists, maids, or feng shui experts. Changes must be made, and to Ivy and her children after living this wonderful expensive life in the upper parts of Manhattan this changeit is one of the most difficult things to do. Needing money Ivy decides to start a business to help children get into kindergarten in the top private schools in the city. Application processes include interviews (for both the child and parent), testing, behavioral observation, essays, and of course include the slightly more subtle issues of who are you parents, how much money do they make/are they willing to donate, and what personal favors will you do for me. Ivy takes on a number of children, and their families, who all prove to be interesting and eccentric in their own ways. This novel intertwines the lives of Ivy, her clients, and the new friends she makes in the building. And will she be able to drop her high class, money grubbing ways- you'll have to read to see. It is an interesting, fun, and exciting read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"The Ivy Chronicles is a joy to read. As a woman living abroad, the story brought back my own memories living and working in New York City.

It is fast moving, and I look forward to Karen's next novel."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"If you are looking for something fun that you won't want to put down, this is it. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. The characters are engaging and the story thoroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I read Karen Quinn's THE IVY CHRONICLES cover to cover this weekend. My first thought was - What fun! My second - Are over-privileged New Yorkers really that nuts? I'm afraid they probably are, and that's what Quinn has satirized so archly - that obsession with place, privilege, status, at all costs. And the unfortunate tendency by these privileged, pampered parents to view their children as objects and status symbols. Yet Karen Quinn keeps it all fun and makes sure that those who deserve it get their (at times hysterical) just desserts. Just as she allows her heroine to make mistakes; yet in the end, Ivy makes us all cheer by Doing the Right Thing, after all.A terrific debut novel by a winning author!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"My wife loved this book so much she kept reading me the funny parts aloud--which meant I got no sleep. Okay, okay, I admit it... I wanted her to keep reading aloud because those funny parts were really, really funny."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"If you liked books likeThe Devil Wears Prada,The Nanny Diaries: A NovelorThe Right Address: A Novel, don't bother to read this book; you'll be disappointed. The Ivy Chronicles book is filled with Manhattan cliches and stereotypes. While I am well aware that the business of getting one's child into a private school can be cut-throat, Ivy Ames of The Ivy Chronicles is a terrible advisor thrust into the business of admissions counselor by a string of improbable events. I found none of the characters particularly interesting or compelling and the story was often wooden and forced. Watch a reality television show or something on the Lifetime channel rather than read this book."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I am sure this will make an excellent mainstream film--the book is so one-dimensional, it hardly warrants many changes to make it into a screenplay. There are no inner monologues or ethical/moral struggles to translate (the central ethical dilemna is a blithely rendered as the descriptions of Prada suits) , nor are there any complex, non-stereotypical characters to one-dimensionalize (a pink-haired lesbian and her partner who travel the world collecting African art! A simple deli owner with a heart of gold! A evil lady CEO!)At first, I was thoroughly engaged in this novel and excited to find a smart, bitter and often shallow hero whose commitment to motherhood was of the 1950s-father model (read: provide for the children without nurturing them) and who subscribed to the Demi Moore school of relationships. However, shallowness is only interesting as long as it is plausible and karmic retribution is hardly a compelling conclusion.This novel demands nothing of its reader, nor of its heroine. Amusing for the Red Dress crowd, disappointing for the rest."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I never put this book down- I read it in a couple of hours. It was hilarious. As smart and as ridiculous as some of the characters appear to be - those of us who work in Corporate America and live in NYC now how true to life these characters actually are!

Some of the reviewers called it \\"empty\\", but I disagree with that description. It is a satirical depiction of the Manhattan well-to-do's state of mind. The people who are not familiar with the situation regarding the admission into private Manhattan schools would have a hard time imagining what the parents are prepared to do in order to get their child into one of these schools. Of course, it is a grotesque, but the point about decency bordering with indecency, and abnormal being accepted as normal, is very well made.

The family went on vacation to visit in N.H. and I stayed behind for the week. I just ordered a few books recently and read this one first because I needed something on a happy scale to read. It was written well and made me laugh. Karen Quinn did an excellent job at this and I hope she continues to write more light hearted books. With so much going on in the world these day, this kind of reading takes you away from all the world troubles. My son is in the army and has been over seas 3 times already. This book took my mind off of all the BAD things going on over there. Thank you so very much Karen.... I can't wait to read your next book and all others that follow. Good Job!!!!! Good Luck to you and keep writing. You are a great inspiration to me.. thank you again, Rosalie"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I received The Ivy Chronicles as a gift and found I just couldn't put it down. Ms. Quinn's writing style is fast-paced and fun, bringing the reader into a world of kindergarteners with resumes that is both shocking and hilarious at the same time. I can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I began the book expecting a nice, light, amusing story about rich people and private school kindergarten. I couldn't put the book down as I experienced Ivy's world of ethical paradoxes. It is a story of reality often too weird to not be true. The pace is perfect and continues evenly start to finish. I was never bored. The characters are well developed and I had a good sense of their look and voice; Ivy's perspective is refreshingly honest and hopeful. It was hard not to laugh out loud at the outcomes of unpredictable series of events. It was fun escaping into Ivy's madcap world, even if for a short while."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Beware of fiction-lite. Particulary fiction-lite packaged as chic-lit. I did get this book out of the library because it appeared to be light and fluffy and was not particularly disappointed.In The Ivy Chronicles by Karen Quinn, Ivy Ames seems to have it all. She has an amazing job on Wall Street that provides her with enough cash to send her daughters to private school, hire nannies for them and keep a full staff employed at her Park Street job. Then, one day, she is downsized and returns home to find that her husband is having an affair with the woman whose husband finagled his way into her job. What's a rich, unemployed and cuckolded girl to do? Start her own business of course. In this case, Ivy decides to help up-scale New Yorkers, like herself, get their toddlers into the most exclusive kindergartens in the city. Private schools of course. The novel follows Ivy, her family, her friends, her lovers and her clients through the kindergarten application process.I had no expectations of this novel besides that it would be an easy, mindless read that would distract me from the stressors in my own life and that expectation was fulfilled. While Ms. Quinn does try to develop moral and ethical difficulties for Ivy to handle, she fails miserably. Things are wrapped up too neatly. Things that would have gotten a normal person arrested or charged with perjury or another crime fail to happen to Ivy. The end of the book finds her happy and unscathed and not much different from where she started. No character development occurred in this novel at all. The characters were shallow and predictable as was the plot. Good no brainer beach book but not a good book if you're seeking a challenge."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"This was a book that I tried to give the benefit of the doubt and really wanted to finish (against my better judgment). It was hard to care about these characters, though, especially Ivy and this made it hard for this reader to get through it. The book was not very well written either (please tell me she didn't actually use the sentence \\"It was extremely cool.\\")."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I laughed when I read the previous negative reviews. The Ivy Chronicles was one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time. I stayed up all night and the next night to finish it. It is fresh, irreverent, farcical and yes, sometimes over the top. But as any parent of a private school kid in New York City will tell you, it is not as far from reality as you might think. The insanity involved in getting a child into kindergarten in this city is so real that Karen Quinn's book, by the end, only seemed to me a mild satire. The reviewer before me who thought the child whose skin turned successively darker and darker until she was ultimately admitted to a school was too farfetched-well, stranger things have happened in this city in the pursuit of admissions! I have given this book as a gift to many friends and they've called me immediately to thank me for one of the best reads they've had in ages."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Wow, crazy sounding/ridiculous and it really happens! Can't imagine being THAT rich (oh what a lucky girl that Faith is- except for the 3x/wk thing :)) Anyhoo, though I couldn't identify, I still enjoyed reading this book. Hilarious! I laughed out loud several times. After bringing home over a dozen books and not getting through any of them, I'm so glad I finally found a good one. Ignore frequentflier's comment. This is not crap. What a mean thing to say! That's over the top negativity. It's fun! I had kind of low expectations because it'd been so long since I found a fun read. She made me laugh and I couldn't wait for the next chance to read. And that's hard with a 2 year old and a baby!I didn't give it 5 stars because there were some ridiculous things, esp at the end bouncing between 2 guys, come on, keeping the reader in suspense who she was going to pick?"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I know that I should hate this book. Ivy is shallow, shallow but she somehow manages to attract love and attention by EVERYONE in her surroundings.

I laughed in a few spots and basically just enjoyed this thing.Who knew?Is it great lit? NOPE, but if you are looking for a lightweight but fun read, buy this."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Well these parents top it all! They lie, cheat, threaten, bribe, and the list goes on! Not only are the parents doing it, but Ivy who has had the worst luck with her job and husband and needs money to support her own children is involved.Although I do agree she didn't redeem herself fully, this book was entertaining and laughable. I don't live like them, so I have no clue about that kind of lifestyle. It seems none of them appreciate what they have, or realize that these are CHILDREN but it was entertaining and I did enjoy it. Isn't that what a book is sometimes? Away from the world, a place to escape and fantasize?"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"It's been a long time since I've disliked a protagonist as much as I hated Ivy Ames. While the premise of the book was intriguing (an insider's view into the cut-throat world of the Manhattan elite), my antipathy for Ivy overroad any hopes of my giving this book a good review.She continually baffled me with her amoral stance and her ability to turn everything into a one-woman whine-fest. There was almost no one to cheer for, save some of the stereotypical \\"underclass\\" children. I almost quit reading several times, but somehow convinced myself to carry on.It's unfortunate, because Quinn is a talented writer. She just needs to work on creating some likable characters -- maybe some with morals."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I usually \\"have\\" to finish even books I don't like - but I got about two thirds through this one and just couldn't take any more. The premise was amusing and the beginning of the book held a lot of promise. But it just got dumber and dumber until I finally bailed out and couldn't slog through the last 100 pages. I can see why it is compared to \\"Nanny Diaries\\" but it doesn't even come close in quality. Don't waste your time - there are way too many great books out there!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I read this book for my book club because it was supposed to be funny. It isn't. The author couldn't get me to care about anybody in the story. I'd never read another book by this author, and I read a lot. For a really funny book with a much better plot and sympathetic characters, read The Undomesticated Goddess by Sophie Kinsella."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Maybe the most poorly written book I've read in a long time. Not funny. Not Involving. Not even worth wasting my time writing this review but I just found it so darn annoying!!!!! Try Charlotte Simmons (now Tom Wolfe, there's someone WHO CAN WRITE!!) Try Admissions. Try Prep. Try Private Schools for Dummies. Try to avoid this dreck."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I could tell you things about unrealistic plot and characters, and they would be true, but here are the things that really made me stop reading.1. Page two, main character explaining why she doesn't make her unemployed husband get the kids ready for school: \\"Plus, let's face it, wha man takes charge of the morning marathon?\\" This is a GREAT formula for ensuring that men will continue to not do their share of the child-rearing. Not to mention perpetuating 1950s gender roles generally.2. There is a character named Sassy. Who is sleeping with Cadmon but married to Drayton, who works for Konrad. I could go on.3. Page 36, final straw: A former boss is referred to as a \\"she-boss.\\" Book was published in 2005, not 1955.If you like this kind of book, I suggest that you buy something by Jennifer Weiner or Marian Keyes instead."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Other readers have compared this book to Admissions, another tale of what parents will do to get their kids into the best private schools in Manhattan. However, I thought The Ivy Chronicles was funnier and more memorable.The story follows Ivy Ames though a grueling year, as she loses first her job and then her husband. As a result, she is forced to give up her old apartment, her children's private school, and doggie day care. While the scenario is a bit contrived in the beginning, Ivy's decision to help upscale New Yorkers get through the admissions process is interesting and funny. Like anyone else, Ivy is only human, worrying about her weight and whether or not the author downstairs likes her.Ivy takes on about seven clients, including a mob boss; a Jewish/Gentile couple whose father won't allow his grandson to go to a Jewish school and tries to bribe Ivy at the tune of $ 1 million; a woman who tries to bribe the members of the Board of Trustees at every school to which her son applies; her housekeeper, who wants a better life for her son; a man who continually threatens to fire Ivy and tells her to encouage his daughter to cheat on the ERBs; and a gay couple with a disabled adopted son. Some of the characterizations seems contrived, although the humor is genuine. There were some characters I would have liked to see more of, others I would have liked to have seen less, but the author does a wonderful job of tying the pieces together.The only thing I have to gripe about the book was its predictable ending. Hoever, it was wonderfully written (for someone who is not by profession an author). I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"An entertaining chick lit book about the dreaded private school admissions process for kindergarten in NYC. Absolutely crazy. Ivy Ames looses her job, her husband, and her Park Ave apartment and is forced to move with her two little girls to the lower east side. With the help of her fabulously wealthy friend, Faith Lord, she begins a business as a private school consultant, helping little 3 year olds get into New York's most elite private schools. This novel provides a hilarious and depressing account of the desperate measures parents will go to in order to get their kids into the \\"baby ivy's.\\" Could hardly put it down because it was such delicious fun. 8/10"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Maybe it's because I work in an admission office at a secondary school, but I completely adored this book. I laughed out loud and couldn't turn the pages quickly enough. Karen Quinn has a real gem here. Her characters were hilarious, especially Ivy Ames herself. Some of the things in this book aren't as far off as those foreign to the world of prep school parents might imagine. As I got further in the novel, I came into work brimming over with the stories, to which many of my colleagues and I could relate. Overall, I thought The Ivy Chronicles was funny and well written."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"What a fun read!!! Ivy's ups, downs, trials, and tribulations kept me hooked the whole time. This was definitely a sneak peek into the psyches of over-achieving parents and the ramifications it poses on their children as well as themselves!!! For a good time, you must read this."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Ivy is not particularly likable, but one must admire her pluck in the face of her challenges!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Like Admissions, Nanny Diaries, Devil Wears Prada, and others of the genre, Ivy Chronicles is a light-hearted page-turning escape novel. The best part comes at the beginning when we see Ivy Ames as the quintessential corporate manager, recognizing the realities of life at the top.As other reviewers note, Ivy becomes an admissions counselor to the rich status-seekers of Manhattan. And that's where the book straddles the genre fence: part satire, part romance.Ivy's clients provide the satire: a mafia don, an egomaniac corporate head (\\"me? fly commercial?\\"), whiny-voiced mom and more. Ivy abandons any pretence of ethics in the spirit of winning the admissions game. Some strategies are so over-the-top they're Saturday Night Live fodder.Then there's the romance. Forced to move downtown, Ivy ends up in a charming Greenwich Village apartment, complete with not one but two romantic possibilities, both SNAGs: sensitive new age guys.And then there's the spoiler, at least as far as I'm concerned. Ivy's good friend Faith just happens to be married to a billionaire older man. Faith paid a high price to get those millions (and we learn just how high when Faith describes the anatomical details of her pre-nup).When Ivy gets into a crunch, it's Faith to the rescue -- and that's bending the chick lit rules. We want a heroine who pulls her own weight and gets herself out of her own messes and into her new world.As a light-hearted romp through the preschool world, Ivy Chronicles can be fun. But I'd have liked to see just a tad less fluff and a lot more grit."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I had some hopes for The Ivy Chronicles, and for the first 150 or so pages, I liked it enough to continue reading. The plot idea was very interesting to me, and I love a good satire. However, the story becomes increasingly absurd to the point that I simply could not suspend reality any longer. I stopped short of finishing it."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"This was a pretty good book. It was yet another book that I had never heard of before spotting it on the bookshelf at the local library. It was quite a bit better than many of the books I find that way, and many that I've heard of beforehand.The characters are interesting, though many aren't sympathetic. Of course, I don't think that they're supposed to be considered sympathetic, since this book is clearly pointing out the spoiled nature of the private school system and what a life of privilege is like in New York City. Most of the characters that I was turned off by when they were introduced turned out to be the schmucks that my gut had been telling me they were.There were times when unimportant parts of the book seemed to drag on, but there were also times when it seemed like some (more important) things were just skipped over completely. I guess that inconsistency is part of why I didn't give this book more stars. It was a bit of a sloppy story, which is something that I don't enjoy.The best way to describe this story is that it is basically a grown-up Clueless, moved to the Upper East Side from Beverly Hills, and dealing with spoiled socialites (and wannabe socialites) getting their kids into private school school to gain the approval of their peers, as opposed to socialites in the making trying to gain the approval of their peers at their high school. The same conniving and petty crap that you would expect from high school students is exhibited in so many of the characters. Most, if not all, of the characters are willing to sacrifice any sense of morals to get ahead. While that made some of it humorous, it also made it a bit disturbing.If you enjoy random chick lit, you will probably enjoy this book. It's also possible that if you like stories about sociopaths, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"OK, so I randomly picked up this book at a book fair because it was about someone with my name and I never come across anyone with my name, not because it is the normal genre of books I read. Bad reason to choose a book? Probably.What a shame I could not identify with Ivy Ames in the slightest. Despite the fact that she's disgustingly rich (yes, even after she goes broke) and I am close to poor and am excellent with a budget (if I do say so myself), I don't understand her in any other category either. I can sympathize with the fact that one thing goes wrong for her after another, but she is shallow and I was uncertain if she had truthfully learned anything by the end of the book.Here's the problem. When Ivy lost her job, she went through her ridiculous budget, which included things like $70,000 a year for hair and nails, and couldn't imagine what on earth she could eliminate. I, like most readers I imagine, thought \\"uh, pretty much everything.\\" I guess she did eliminate pretty much everything, because she went as far as to leave her apartment, sell her car and un-enroll her daughters from private school (kind of weird considering the whole book was about the desperation of getting your kids into private school... and she took them out pretty quickly). Ivy had commented that she and her husband had made $2 million a year together, and yes, he had been unemployed for a few months, but still... no savings?Next, I got tired of hearing Ivy talk about how she couldn't afford anything. A car. A bikini wax. A present for her boyfriend. When she started her business, she got $120,000 up front! ($20,000 times 6 clients, since she was kind enough not to take all of Ollie's savings.) Then she actually got away with charging her clients $300 an hour to tutor the kids, because that apparently wasn't included in the $20,000 fee. But she couldn't afford a new car. A used car. I can respect not wasting $250 on a bikini wax because that's pretty frivolous. But she couldn't afford a birthday present??? Where in the world did all her money go?I couldn't understand why she was so tempted by that million dollar bribe... the one she would receive for betraying her clients... ugh, what a dilemma! Someone like her, it wouldn't even help. She actually even said she could retire. Is she kidding?! $2 million in one year (year after year I assume) and once she was out of work she was in the poorhouse and couldn't afford so much as a birthday present within weeks. She thinks she can make a million last more than 8 months? Most people could, but not her!*Spoiler alert!* I have to complain about the end. I absolutely cannot believe she dumped Phillip simply because he wrote a book about her experiences without telling her. (He did mention he wanted to about halfway through.) \\"At least I was honest about my lies!\\" she says! \\"Let's burn the book,\\" she says. He says no, he can't give up the money. How would he live? So the book is more important that she is, huh? Well, that sure is easy for her to say, AFTER she has gotten all of HER money! I didn't see her returning the million, since she didn't actually go through with the bribe! So what happened with Phillip, anyway? Was it that she quit being superficial 20 minutes before he did and therefore they had nothing in common anymore? I think it was because there were only 4 pages left in the book and among the many over-dramatic things that had happened, the fact that 2 men were totally in love with Ivy was still unresolved. This incident made it just a little too easy for her to know which guy to pick. It was a bit annoying because 2 pages earlier she had decided to choose Phillip.One last comment. So it seems there are \\"Baby Ivy\\" schools in addition to Ivy League colleges. How nice. If only people would think of that when they meet me, instead of saying, \\"Your name is Ivy? You mean like poison? Haha.\\" Like I've never heard that before. Sigh."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"The Ivy Chronicles is a laugh-out loud story about the cutthroat and corrupt kindergarten private school admission process in New York City, specifically, Manhattan. These wealthy and eclectic parents will stop at nothing to get their little darlings admitted to the top tier kindergartens known as the Little Ivies. Karen Quinn actually navigated these waters and her accounting of the ups and downs and her crazy clients are positively hysterical. I haven't laughed this much in ages!

Ivy makes some immoral choices but they are realistic (most people in her situation would do the same things)."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"to be perfectly honest, this book was entertaining. Sure, many of the characters were unrealistic and one dimensional, but at the end of the day, you just read chick lit for entertainment purposes. Read this if you are looking for pure fluff that you will forget about a week later."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I actually listened to this book on cd because I drive a lot and it helps make my driving less monotonous. So, I may not have enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed listening to it. The main character, Ivy is terribly shallow and part of the irony of the book, I found, was listening to her chastise others for their moral foibles while doing the same things herself. The tongue-and-cheek parody of all the characters and some of the over-the-top situations made me laugh out loud at certain points. The whole book was a clever dig at high society and who doesn't enjoy that? I recommend it for anyone looking for a bit of fun and snarkiness to bring some levity to your day. I also did appreciate that Ivy genuinely tried to be less shallow by the end of the book, although, I doubt she was able to keep it up that long."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"This book is an easy and somewhat pleasant read that you will forget almost as soon as you've read the last words. Rather simplistic, it doesn't venture to provide any keen or original insights and is not even particularly effective as a guilty pleasure since it does not provide more than a cursory glance into a world most would never get to see."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Overall, the book was enjoyable to read. It did tend to read more like a movie script, though."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Not a bad book, but I found the main character hard to like.

For starters, the authors of The Nanny Diaries actually had talent.If you can even get past the fact that most of this story is utterly unbelievable, you will quickly grow to dislike the \\"heroine\\" of the story, a shallow, mewling, spoiled woman named Ivy (wow... the subtlety is amazing). I put the book down after one too many fat jokes.When I pick up chick-lit, I'm not expecting Pulitzer Prize quality, but the character was NOT likeable, the plot was completely unbelievable, and the writing was so childish.

The charcters were compelling, the story was lively, and I even found myself laughing out loud. Ivy's not a heavy story, but a great \\"weekend\\" read.

The book -- populated with outrageous (but true!) characters - delivers an insiders look at urban-style deviousness and drive, along with giggle-a-minute pleasures and an underlying theme that tends to linger as food-for-thought.What at first-blush may appear to be \`chick-lit' cannot be dismissed so lightly, because \\"The Ivy Chronicles\\" has the kind of urbane sardonic edge that approaches the flavor of Tom Wolfe."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"The Ivy Chronicles is hilarious!

The woman who read the book also did a fabulous job - I didn't want it to end. I read a great deal and this book is somewhat lighter fare than I often read, but it was well done, humorous, and very enjoyable. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Flower Ornament Scripture: a Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra","review":"As a hit-and-miss Buddhist practitioner and amateur world-religions scholar of some thirty or forty years, alas with only a B.A. in Philosophy to show for it all, I must say that having gotten about a hundred-or-two pages into this 1600-page divine monster, that it is one of the greatest projects of religious literature of all times. As a man with OCD and a hungry interest for every detail, I start out every book by reading every word in the glossary and index, ever appendix, every introduction, etc. Usually, by the time I finish all the ancillary materials in a major religious text, I see the range of the work and am usually disappointed. However, being the product of the workaholic, puritanical, guilt-ridden, self-loathing, production-oriented society that I am, I will finish a work, however lugubrious the task may appear, often, in a hypochondriac way, stating to myself, \\"How will I ever live long enough to finish this?\\"But in spite of all these considerations, I have great news on a kid of \\"so-far\\" basis. Even the hundreds of pages of ancillary materials are great, and, far from making the prospect of actually finishing this leviathan seem daunting, I actually hunger for it more as I learn more about this. I have read Copleston's entire 4,000-page History of Western Philosophy and several thousand pages of the University of Chicago's ongoing Mahabharata, (that is, I've finished reading all they have been able to produce up to this point), and of course the 3,000 pages of Proust. Incidentally, I've read the Koran Twice, the Torah a dozen times, the New Testament a hundred times, and the entire Bible three times, etc., etc., and yet never has any scripture of this massive size felt so energetic. I've read the entire Rig Veda and countless other sutras, commentaries, and so on; and many of the smaller ones, like the Diamond Sutra, and the Gita, sizzle with life and quickly and easily raise one's consciousness. However, the long sutras tend to be even more self-indulgent than my own poetry, [...], and other long scriptures are so self-referential and self-praising that they become anti-climatic, (not that I could blame anyone for these qualities, since my own work is based entirely on my ego). That is, they say over and over again, \\"I shall present something great to you for 900 pages,\\" but then, after all, fail to. I don't believe this will be the case with this book, which becomes more like a divine psychedelic acid trip with every page I turn. I was put off by the length of this, (since I'm always in so many huge, thousand-plus-page projects), that I kept evading this one. And also the sheer expense of a book which, when not on sale, lists for $100! put me off as I am understandably very poor due to the fact that my utter self-absorption makes it difficult for me to succeed in a real-world job.This review is, to some extent, a speculative review, (since Amazon sent an email asking for a review two weeks after I got it, which may be about two years before I finish it.) And I've decided to give a \\"progress report\\" based on my vast experience and my high-percentage intuition. (Please excuse the immense arrogance of my whole approach here, but I am shockingly arrogant, so, for now, that will be the kind of writing I will do.) Stunningly, I am essentially claiming to know, by sampling a couple of hundred pages, that the following 1400 pages will be great. However, I think I know it will be great, having been down these roads so many times with similar projects, and based on what I always end up knowing this far into any game, to use a football analogy. My prediction is that I will continue to be very pleased with the remaining pages as I was from the first page.If, for some reason I end up wrong, or my overview changes as I plunge deeper into this abyss of bliss and cosmosity, I shall write another review recanting it all. But for now, someone has to try to say something in something resembling real-world time. And so I give you this preemptive, know-it-all review and basically request your blind faith at this point, (as I must do, I suppose, in all my romances as well). Many blessings to you all. May you all end up more humble than me, if for no other reason than that will enable me to get more publicity than the rest of you."},{"Title":"The Flower Ornament Scripture: a Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra","review":"But you might want to smoke some really nice weed when you read The Flower Ornament Scripture, simply because it is, as alluded to by a few reviewers, a hypnotic text that is quite unlike anything that has been published or is likely to get published in the near future.

Cleary's comments are helpful but a bit sparse. He compares FOS to other major works (e.g. Prajnaparamita & Lotus), provides concise chapter summaries, & introduction to the Chinese commentary. Cleary's complete translation replaces standard Sanskrit terms--\\"enlightening beings\\" vs. Bodhisattva & \\"Universal Good\\" vs. Samantabhadra. I found this refreshing but you may not. He says, it employs very grandiose terminology, p. 46: \\"specific characters of the scripture are \`fictional' uses p. 52: \`being-time,' & it's for p. 6: \`people of superior faculties.'\\" The 1st 38 Chapters display overwhelming hyperbole, mythology, & symbolism. Of course, understanding of the physical universe was limited millennia ago (p. 999: \\"Just as the ocean water flows under the continents & islands, so that all who drill for water find it\\"), mythology was not arms-length as now, & norms differed (e.g. p. 581's gifts of women). I don't claim to be a person \\"of superior faculties,\\" but it was boring to me. There are some gems: Cleary--p. 29: the nirvana or Buddha-nature cannot be cultivated by practices, because practices are fabricated and impermanent, and it cannot be realized by mind because mind has subject and object [i.e. transitive]. Thus, its essence [Nature of Mind] cannot be cultivated, its principle cannot be witnessed by the mind. Mind itself is the essence--there is no further subject or object.\\" This is reflected in chapter 39's experiential journey. NOTE: bracketed words herein are mine not Cleary's.As usual, there are some interesting parallels to Kabbalah: in Ch. 1, Buddha is described ~God in the Shi'ur Koma (On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead: Basic Concepts in the Kabbalah (Mysticism & Kabbalah)) literature pp. 274-5: \\"the Buddha may be called...God of Gods...the Buddha may be called...King of Gods\\" & p. 1591: Li Tongxuan--\\"These are not worldly measurements.\\" FOS has a dream-like feel to it (p. 1496: \\"It was like someone asleep seeing various things in a dream\\")--probably to exemplify the imputed dream-like or mirage-like nature of reality ~fairy tales [Jungians take fairy tales seriously & symbolically--see von FranzIndividuation in Fairy Tales (C. G. Jung Foundation Books)& ChinenIn the Ever After: Fairy Tales and the Second Half of Life]. The symbolic, non objective nature of FOS is also revealed in its use of numbers, esp. numerous groups of 10. I enjoyed the lovely verse reminiscent of the wonderfulThe Wheel of Sharp Weapons& Tilopa's SongTantra, the supreme understanding: Discourses on the tantric way of Tilopa's song of Mahamudraas well as still-relevant prose p. 829: \\"enlightening beings do not abandon actions, according with the doings of the world, yet have no attachments to them,\\" supporting Thich Nhat Hanh's engaged Buddhism. Modern Buddhism follows its attitudes of non-duality, abandonment of conceptual clinging, & non-attachment to the physical: p. 1091: \\"Great enlightening beings know that all phenomena are like the tracks of birds in the sky.\\" It may seem strange thatShingon - Japanese Esoteric Buddhism(~Tibetan Dzogchen) uses this as one of its 2 main texts, but p. 1163: \\"The ground of all phenomena, oceanic source of all things\\" sounds like the \\"Ground of Being\\" to me; p. 1361 the Vairocana myth parallels that of Padmasambhava--born from a lotus. Further, pp. 1537-8: Prajna's Scroll translation of Ch. 39--\\"Sudhana asked, \`Is it realized by hearing talk about transcendent wisdom?' Suchandra said \`No.' \`Why not?' \`Because transcendent wisdom is realized by seeing the true essence of things. It is impossible to personally attain enlightenment by hearing & thinking'\\" reminds me of Mahamudra & Dzogchen pointing-out instructions. Indeed, the entire book exemplifies their \\"magical display of reality.\\" See Longchenpa'sKindly Bent to Ease Us: Wonderment (Tibetan Translation, ).But, it also makes some unusual assertions-- p. 1150: \\"It is also like the case of the celestial spirit born together with a person & always associated with the person--the spirit sees the person, but the person does not see the spirit.\\" Cleary says Ch. 39 disagrees with parts of prior chapters, supporting his contention that FOS developed over time with many contributors. This parallels Professor Moshe Idel's argument for authorship of the Zohar inKabbalah: New Perspectives.\\" Furthermore, Ch. 39 (pp. 1174-1520) is Sudhana's quest for enlightenment, ~Joseph Campbell's The Hero With A Thousand Faces,\\" is more knowledge-dense though even it is rather \\"empty.\\" FOS seems more Feeling & Sensate (much ornate detail) from a Myers-Briggs perspective or perhaps more Bhakti vs. Jnana from a yoga perspective.The commentaries (Cleary's pp. 1545-64 & Li's 1565-1630) are better read in parallel with Ch. 39--section by section. Sudhana requests practical instruction from Master to Master w/o getting it--instead he experiences various states of being with his many benefactors who show him (vs. tell him)--up to Maitreya (pp. 1452-1502)--IMHO the best part. Ch. 39 reminds me of the Egyptian Book of the Dead & its many visualizations provide a basis for Vajrayana (Tibetan & Shingon) Buddhist practices--even p. 1599 a precursor to Chod. The commentaries are concise, easy reading vs. the flowery, ornamental text (thus its title?). Cleary says p. 1546 it was promulgated by Nagarjuna who \\"recovered the teaching of the Flower Ornament Scripture \`from the ocean.'\\" I read this as the Dzogchen Ground of Being ~to the legend of Jigme Lingpa's text received from long-dead Longchenpa. Does this poetically indicate authorship?There's considerable wisdom herein, but you must dig deep for it:p. 1572: \\"Since the fact that an individual word or sound has no inherent identity underlies infinite words & sounds infinite words & infinite sounds are one word and one sound. Therefore one and many revolve around and embellish each other. All mundane phenomena are trans-mundane phenomena, and all trans-mundane phenomena are mundane phenomena.\\" [form is emptiness & vice versa]p. 1584: \\"Play is Buddha-work\\"p. 1592: \\"When knowledge enters compassion, it is harmonized & becomes comfortable.\\"p. 1620: \\"In the clamor without making clamor.\\" [i.e. be in the world but not of it]."},{"Title":"The Flower Ornament Scripture: a Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra","review":"The Avatamsaka Sutra (The Sutra of the Garland of Flowers) is among the largest and greatest of the scriptures of Mahayana Buddhism. It is 12 volumes in Chinese, and 1600 pages in this English edition published by Shambhala. As with most Mahayana scriptures, it treats Buddha not as merely a man of ancient India, but as a cosmic principle. Differing from the austere and non-theist Theravada scriptures, it is full of gods and goddesses, heavens, jewelled trees and imaginary beings. The Avatamsaka Sutra became very influential in Chinese Buddhism, and was responsible for the creation of the Hua-Yen school.This edition by Thomas Cleary, THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, is excellent. It includes not only his translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, but also a book subsequently pinned onto it (the 400-page Gandhavyuha, or \\"Entry into the Realm of Reality\\"), the Chinese mystic Li Tongxuan's seventh-century commentary on the Gandhavyuha, a glossary of difficult Mahayana concepts, and an incredibly helpful translator's introduction.Dr. Cleary ranks among the foremost translators of Asian religious literature and always succeeds in translating works clearly and precisely. In THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, his years of experience have enabled him to produce a stunning translation, and I can only admire his persistence in translating such a massive work.This edition is really a treasure for Buddhist students. Or, should I say, serious students and scholars. At 1600 pages and a high cost (though much more inexpensive than several years ago), this tome is for the dedicated. THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, however, is an excellent translation. Dr. Cleary has benefitted Westerners greatly through his singular translation."},{"Title":"The Flower Ornament Scripture: a Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra","review":"A book translated by Thomas Cleary is worth its weight in gold... and then some. The Avatamsaka Sutra is a powerful and profound piece of work worth the investment of time to ponder, and meditate upon. I sat down one summer evening, to begin the journey, and after the first few pages I was transformed by the beauty and wisdom I found woven within the words of Mr. Cleary's absorbing translation. In my opinion: this is the apex of ALL Buddhist text."},{"Title":"The Flower Ornament Scripture: a Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra","review":"For anyone interested in the highest, most lucid and profound written teachings of the Mahayana, Cleary's translation of the Avatamsaka-sutra is essential reading. Every line is beautifully rendered, and the only problem I have with it is the translation of &quot;bodhisattva&quot; to &quot;enlightening being,&quot; which is accurate but not usually done. Aside from that petty qualm, however, this book is perfect. Even the physical design is very well crafted and aesthetically pleasing. This is surely Shambhala's and Tom Cleary's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Flower Ornament Scripture: a Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra","review":"Thomas Cleary is one of the best all-round translators of East Asian and Sanskrit literature, as well as Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian writings. If I have the option of purchasing a work I have never read before in various translations, I will gladly go with Cleary. Some of his works, such as the astonishing edition of the Art of War and his beautifully poetic rendering of the Zhuangzi are the best of their kind, while others (particularly his translations of Zen literature) are rather lacking and weak. This mammoth translation of the Buddhavatamsaka-sutra, however, represents the best (in my opinion) in Sanskrit Buddhist translation. All English speaking Mahayana Buddhists owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Clearly, for rendering one of the largest, most elaborate, and most important Buddhist scriptures into English, with a flair of style and poetic imagery that surpasses almost anything else I've read in Buddhist sutra translations. The Avatamsaka Sutra, or the Flower Garland (Flower Ornament) Sutra is the earliest sutra spoken by the Buddha. It is, along with the Lotus Sutra and the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, one of the most important teachings of the Buddha. The Chinese Huayan (Jap. Kegon) School (Huayan/Kegon: Avatamsaka), one of the most prominent and influential schools in the history of Chinese and Japanese Buddhism, is based on this scripture, which emphasizes the mutually unobstructed interpenetration the Dharma realm, the interactions between principle and phenomenal worlds. The Avatamsaka Sutra is one of the Vaipulya Sutras, meaning that it is, in effect, an incredibly large sutra comprised of several smaller sutras (other Vaipulya Sutras include: the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, the Jewel Heap Sutra, and the Nirvana Sutra). Because of its incredible length, many of the English translations are available only as partial translations, or translations of particularly important sections. Here, however, Cleary has translated the entire sutra, which takes up almost 1500 pages. However, it is a must-have for any English Mahayana scholars. Readers may be amazed at the vast range displayed throughout the sutra. Some chapters are elaborate, miraculous, and joyful in nature (as is much of the Lotus Sutra), while others are strongly philosophical in a style reminiscent of the Hinayana or Perfection of Wisdom Sutras. Especially important are the chapters concerning the Ten Stages (Dashabhumika-sutra) of the Bodhisattva Path, the Ten Devotions, the Ten Practices, the Ten Concentrations, the Ten Acceptances, and the Ten Abodes. The second-to-last chapter is a magnificent summation of Mahayana doctrine and the practice of the Buddhas. The final chapter (which takes up 400 pages by itself) is the \\"Entry Into the Realm of Reality\\" (GAnda-vyuha), which is the most famous section of the book. It describes the pilgrimage of the young Sudhana, guided by Manjushri, as he requests the teachings of 53 masters, including the future Buddha. The final section of the Ganda-vyuha occurs when Sudhana meets Samantabhadra (Universally Good), and concerns the Ten Vows of Samantabhadra, which is, by itself, probably the most important and available part of the book (numerous translations of this one section exist on the internet). All in all, I thank Thomas Cleary for finally allowing me to read the complete Flower Garland Sutra (a task which I have been unable to accomplish for years, due to the lack of availability of complete translations). Stunning."},{"Title":"The Flower Ornament Scripture: a Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra","review":"The Flower Ornament Sutra (FOS) is often overlooked because it is not as available (now out of print probably as a result of not being widely used by the laity), but it is a superb Sutra a comprehensive (if any single text can be called truly comprehensive)expression of Buddhist (particularly Mahayanist)Vision. I say \\"vision\\" rather than \\"thought\\" or \\"philosophy\\" because FOS is first and foremost an inducer of meditative trance or vision, rather than a doctrine or treatise. One reads The FOS to experience the Buddha consciousness in a very personal, mystical way, not to \\"understand\\" it intellectually.Thomas Cleary's translation is probably the most accessible to the American mind and heart. I haven't read all other translations, only a few are available here in the USA it seems. One caution: I would beware of \\"contemporary\\" or \\"condensed\\" versions of FOS, if you find them, because these adaptions to contemporary mind will surely lose the original consciousness, some of which is undoubtedly lost already even in a careful translation like Cleary's. That consciousness is why you would read FOS in the first place.Better to go to the source, however formal or repetitive and overcome any initial sense of \\"boredom\\" you might feel. With FOS you should suspend logical critical mind in favor of an open and receptive heart. The deeper you go in this way the more vivid and profound the \\"vision\\" becomes.Ultimately it is like a spark. At some point the spark jumps to you and lives in you independently of the text - or it doesn't. FOS is an instrument to self-discovery not a \\"reality\\" to cling to. Any Buddhist knows this, but FOS is a very valuable, effective and precious instrument of delight and enlightenment if you are open to it.The hardback version I got published by Shambala is beautiful, as good a copy as you could hope to find these days.

Mahayana buddhists regard this book as the &quot;king of all kings.&quot; The Buddha spoke this sutra during the first 21 days after his enlightenment. He spoke it for bodhisattvas, as a rising sun can only be seen by high mountains. After this, the Buddha &quot;hid the actual and revealed the provisonal.&quot; The story of how this sutra first came to the humans is fascinating. Supposedly, Nagajuna, during his meditation, revisited the dragon king's library. There, he saw three versions of the Avatamsaka-long, medium, and short. Nagajuna read the short version and memorized it. When he came out of his meditation, he wrote the sutra from memory, which became more or less the Avatamsaka sutra translated here.

It is another one of the gems that was put together from a series of articles from 'The Studies in the Scriptures'(These were taken from articles that first appeared in 'The Studies...' in 1932,1933 and 1937).What is also fascinating about this book is that two other publishers have taken some of the same articles that are included here ,and combined them with other articles from 'The Studies...',with different titles but dealing with the same subject,that being various aspects of God's saving work. The titles of the other books are 'The Doctrine of Salvation'published by Baker Books and 'Genuine Salvation'published by International Outreach(located in Ames,Iowa). This is also the second publisher that has put this same book in print,the first was Reiner Publications. The interest that various publishers have shown in these articles should not suprise those who are somewhat familiar with the life and ministry of A.W.Pink. What Pink has written on the nature of salvation are among his most searching and insightful writings that he has penned on any subject. One astute observation (there are dozens that could be given)will suffice:on p.5 Pink's observation as to why the Phillipian jailer (when he asked,what must I do to be saved)was only instructed to 'believe on the Lord Jesus Christ',(as opposed to being exhorted to 'repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ'),writes \\"thus it was no giddy,careless,unconcerned person,who was exhorted to \\"simply\\" believe;but instead,one who gave clear evidence that a mighty work of God has already been wrought within him. ... In his case there was no need to press upon him his lost condition ,for obviously he felt it; nor were the apostles required to urge upon him the duty of repentance,for his entire demeanor betokened his contrition.\\" Another interesting feature of this book is that in the last four chapters we have Pink's Bunyanesque take on a worldly professor and a child of God who is struggling with assurance. This dialogue has the editor(Pink),having a conversation with Mr.Carnal Confidence in the 19th chapter and with Mr.Humble Heart in chapters 20 through 22. Some of the serious maladies that plague this generation in preaching,christian books and personal evangelism would by God's grace be remedied by a prayerful and careful reading of 'Studies on Saving Faith'."},{"Title":"Studies on Saving Faith","review":"I have the paper back edition on this extensive study on true evangelical faith as opposed to a non saving faith.The book gives adequate biblical testimony to what the Holy Spirit actually does in infusing true faith in sinful man.This is one of the finest works on this subject ever written,those who are familiar with Arthur Pink ,will not be disappointed in adding this book to their library.Five stars also for amazon for providing it for kindle users"},{"Title":"Studies on Saving Faith","review":"AW Pink is superb as always!

Counterfeit Money (v. 1)","review":"If there could be such a thing as a text that 'exemplifies' Derrida's thought, one that meticulously and clearly explains the strategies of 'deconstruction,' while at the same time distilling not just its own theory, but also producing a critical reading of several other prominent thinkers and their texts (and one that of course demonstrates the practical ends of the expos&eacute; of his theory), then \\"Given Time\\" (\\"Donner le temps\\") would unequivocally be that book. It is that good. In fact, it is superb. For those who have read Derrida's texts of the late 60s and early 70s, and know where they stand regarding Derrida's ideas, this book acts like a kind of overview or survey of his thought, a matrix or map of his thought, an architectural plan, even a game plan.The primary text is a story by Baudelaire, and Derrida uses this two-page story to explicate the relations he has with his own masters, the lessons learned and the major points that he has taken from them and transformed. Husserl on the notion of the gift and the necessity to zigzag (a \\"Zick-Zack\\" or \\"mouvement en vrille\\") between bound and free idealities; Heidegger on being and temporality and the impossibility of appropriation or presence; Bataille on excess. All through a refreshing reading of Baudelaire's story together with Mauss' seminal essay from 1923 \\"The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies\\" (often considered the most influential work of anthropology, focusing on the social customs of exchange and the obligation to reciprocate) which conceives of a total social fact of gifting that Bataille had himself begun to unhinge in his 1949 \\"The Accursed Share\\" by implicitly laying waste to Hegel's philosophical economy - a multivolume work that was itself greatly influenced by \\"The Gift.\\"From a map of thought to Derrida's Joycean world\\"Given Time\\" is a brief treatise on the layered notions of the 'gift' in several important works (in Husserl, it means what is given to us in the world through the 'immediate experience' of our senses; in Husserl's phenomenological reduction or \\"epoche\\" what is intended is separated from what is given. Derrida, in his earliest critical works on Husserl, analyzes the conceptual foundations of the intuition/intention relationship, and while he critiques Husserl's formal limits of the two, he maintains that the \\"epoche\\" is indispensable for transcendental phenomenology and for his own work. However, via Heidegger, Derrida will insist that in every act of being given there remains by necessity an aspect of the gift that holds itself back, is not given, and that gives nothing - the flipside of giving, as Deleuze noted, is theft. This temporizing aspect of the gift is reflected in Derrida's title \\"Given Time\\"). Derrida's thesis is that giving is only possible through a splintered 'time' of originary difference, which produces a doubling-effect of the notion of the 'origin,' and which means that the only possibility of authenticity will always be that of inauthenticity, which doubles and splits the difference. In other words, contamination occurs between the concepts of authenticity and inauthenticity: authenticity is impossible without the possibility of inauthenticity. Much like all 'counterfeit money' (which is also the title of Baudelaire's story) you can't tell whether the coin is or isn't truly money that you can buy a commodity with and truly possess something. Is it or isn't it fake? It's a split decision that Derrida patiently explores the 'logic' of. (By the way, art historian Georges Didi-Huberman has written a wonderful book, \\"Phasmes\\" (1990), partially translated as \\"The Phasmid,\\" on deception and pretending; search for it on the net.) This important concept, which also runs throughout Deleuze's work, is a term he calls \\"the power of the false.\\" But to give credit where it is due, it comes first of all in Heidegger's critique of his own project of a fundamental ontology (very arguably, to my mind) in Section 72 of \\"The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics,\\" where he speaks of the assertive logos as \\"false,\\" \\"deceptive,\\" and \\"pretending,\\" and discusses the as-structure that will be so crucial for all of Derrida's work - in fact his explication of the true/false pair in \\"Given Time\\" explains this operative concept of 'relation' without naming it. 'Relation' is one of the most important concepts in Derrida's thought, and he explicates it at length in \\"Given Time.\\" Derrida shows how there is indeed a beyond to the binary couple of truth and falsity, authenticity and inauthenticity, by exploring a catachresis that simultaneously surpasses each of them (suggesting that they are impossibly pure concepts, as each implies the other as its limit) but that also makes their 'false' opposition possible (and that they must therefore mix or contaminate each other). Derrida has given many strategic names to this notion, such as originary difference or diff&eacute;rance (which Leonard Lawlor has suggested is Derrida's reinscription of Husserl's notion of intention). This relation of possibility to impossibility is very clearly laid out in \\"Given Time\\" (\\"on one hand\\"...\\"on the other hand\\"), and gives the reader a penetrating insight into the importance that Derrida ascribes here and throughout his work - especially his more recent works \\"Aporias\\" (another very clear book of his, and highly recommended), \\"The Politics of Friendship\\" and \\"Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness\\" - to the counter-intuitive and non-oppositional relationship between impossibility and possibility (which is an important redrawing of Kant's condition of possibility and the notion of 'limit' and critique).Also, one can read the entire book as a long commentary on capitalism, one which places Marxian thinkers in an uncomfortable position and that tries to think through capitalism a little bit further from within 'deconstruction': Derrida's most overt attempts at this are 'From restrictive to general economy' of 1966 (a superb essay with a very pretentious title that plays on Einstein's 1905 and 1916 Nobel-prize earning work \\"Special [aka \\"Restricted\\"] and General Theory of Relativity\\" - although his 1921 Nobel was technically awarded for his \\"contribution to photoelectrics\\") and \\"Specters of Marx,\\" from 1994, with a title that's cribbed from his mentor and colleague Louis Althusser's book \\"Specters of Hegel\\" as an homage. One also has to remember that this book was originally a lecture course from c. 1979. Derrida is of course using transcendental phenomenology as the guiding thread to discuss literature and sociology, and makes something really interesting occur in each, along with modifying our concept of capitalism. From anywhere you stand you can see Derrida's French qualities: literature, anthropology, the belief that philosophy has to engage with capitalism if it is to be considered at all relevant. All are relevant to deconstruction, and are considered game for being folded into it, so long as they take you somewhere else, produce different thoughts regarding the world we inhabit, and permit these thoughts to be formalized.There is no other book written by Derrida that lays out the material and the method so clearly and patiently (although again, \\"Aporias\\" is highly recommended). It does assume familiarity with his earliest programmatic works. If one looks at pp. 71-75 of Derrida's brief and incisive \\"Introduction to Husserl's Origin of Geometry,\\" for example, one glimpses the thematic affinity between that earlier, more programmatic work, and how Derrida's conclusions there are extended in multiple and different directions in \\"Given Time\\" (those pages discuss the troubled constitution of ideal objects and how they can always be false and inauthentic in their expression. If Derrida chooses a work of fiction by Baudelaire on counterfeit money, it is in part because all truth must pass through fiction, or to put it differently, the necessary possibility of inauthenticity).In sum, this is one of Derrida's most elegant and accessible treatises on his own philosophy and how its relations extend to other modes of thought that on the one hand he himself is influenced by, and on the other hand he radicalizes as he engages them. It is a book that thoroughly transforms the interrelated concepts of the gift that exist in separate disciplines - not least of which is philosophy, which is often said to have 'begun' in wonder or amazement at the world and what is supposedly simply presented or given to us. Derrida takes a critical step back (&agrave; la Husserl's method of \\"r&uuml;ckfragen,\\" that attempts to account for the structuring of tradition) to explore how this presencing comes about, and how the 'there is' (es gibt, in German) appears, and then goes a step further to explain how we relate in our everyday, societal lives via an uncanny and counter-intuitive 'structure' or 'logic' (as well as mediated 'experiences') of giving and receiving, and how these open onto the issues of responding responsibly (which is a theme that Derrida explicitly explores in his works on forgiveness and on hospitality).As to the translation, which is polished and luminous, it is one of the best translations of Derrida's work into English."},{"Title":"Given Time: I. Counterfeit Money (v. 1)","review":"I read the comment on this book that called it \\"deconstructionist wool gathering\\", and after butting my head up against some of the tracts in it, I can see where that reviewer is coming from. Basically I'm reading Given Time to trace a thread of explication from Boas, Mauss, Bataille, Baudrillard through Christopher Bracken( \\"Potlatch Papers\\", \\"Magical Criticism\\"). I want to understand and assimilate those people's ideas into my own developing political and cultural thought in order to understand what Christopher Bracken is talking about. For me, if it has to be through Derrida, Hegel, Heidegger etc., I'm willing to do the \\"homework\\". Fundamentally, I do have a dilettante's interest in anthropology of the 21st century.All this does have another pragmatic end, I'm just tired of the dead-ended revolutionary rhetoric and discourses that have been taken off the shelf at the museum, dusted slightly, and reused by the Occupy Movement here in the 21st century. The last time I visited the Occupy headquarters here in Portland, Oregon, it was like going into a museum of revolution. All the obsolete grand narratives, you know, like Marx, political economy, on and on.Maybe there's a more valid and potent approach to be found in tracing the thread I describe above to arrive at a fresh political outlook, for me at least.So, my advice: read this book like poetry- it's precious, esoteric, and abstract, with some lucid and salient points made at various junctures. This may be a very synoptic distillation of Derrida and his writing at a point in time, but to tell you the God's honest truth, I can't formulate a summary statement of him after reading this book. But after all, I'm not really interested in doing that. If he feels he's incomprehensible, what the hell am I supposed to say about it, try to make sense out of his incomprehensibility?"},{"Title":"Given Time: I. Counterfeit Money (v. 1)","review":"Given time, I would love to write an extensive explication of this text. Life being too short, I will forego the urge. A phrase begins to accrue to Derrida, &#34;not for the faint of heart&#34; and &#34;Given Time&#34; qualifies. It's not for the faint -- is it feint? -- of heart. What it is is an exploration of being in terms of the Heideggerean &#34;it gives.&#34; Being [not beings] isn't. It escapes the question of &#34;What is?&#34; Heidegger notes that the German phrase for 'there is' is 'es gibt' or 'it gives.' and explores the idea of whether 'being' might 'give.' He does so without much analysis of what 'give' might mean. Enter Derrida. Couple to Heidegger's exploration the Heideggerean understanding the 'time' is at ground of being and you come to Derrida's position of what 'being gives' can mean as 'time gives,' and this with variation of formulation. There is: Es gibt, Il y as, It/Id gives. Being gives. Time gives. Time gives Being. . . But what Derrida brings to the 'seance' is an examination of what 'gift' might mean principally through the text of Mauss, but not exclusively. The 'gesture' is pure Derrida. How might the understanding of gift in 'other' usage inform the ontological question? What did Johnson say about Shakespeare. &#34;Read him.&#34; Suffice to say that if you work out the allegory of Madam Maintenant's (sic) letter, you'll be well under way to understanding this rather difficult text.E"},{"Title":"Given Time: I.

I have decided at least five times that 'this is my favorite poem' to change it just in the next moment to 'no, this one is it'.

You're literally better offcrumpling your cash money and throwing it in the trash rather than buying this disappointment."},{"Title":"Data Structures and the Standard Template Library","review":"This may possibly be the worst programming book I've ever seen. The author has a habbit of talking about something, assuming you already have the knowledge, and then explaining it later, sometimes chapters later. Similarly, when using a class, Collins will state what the class is supposed to do, but not include the implementation until later, which would be good, but you've already been bombarded with so much other stuff you forget what the thing did in the first place. There are also no full examples included with several sections of the book, which are definately needed to learn the material.Finally, when it comes to the data structures (most of the book), Collins explains what they are, and shows pieces of code, but never full implementations. For example, he shows how to adjust a heap, and delete nodes from a heap, but not how to start from scratch. Also, he uses templates containing classes without telling the reader what they mean.I am currently a sophmore in a data structures class, and have talked with at least 5 students in my class. All of them agree that the book is absolutely worthless, as it only gives partial information that's hard to understand.

I had never heard of Terri Blackstock before I received the Suncoast book as a gift. I will be reading more by Terri Blackstock once I get all the stuff I neglected while reading Suncoast caught up!"},{"Title":"Evidence of Mercy/Justifiable Means/Ulterior Motives/Presumption of Guilt (Sun Coast Chronicles 1-4)","review":"A Christian version of suspense queen Mary Higgins Clark? Terri Blackstock's skill at writing suspense fiction reminded me much of the mystery queen. \\"Evidence of Mercy\\" (available as a separate novel, or as one of four best-selling Blackstock novels in the \\"Suncoast Chronicles\\" anthology) is a humdinger of a suspense story, revolving around the lives of three main characters. The main protagonist, Lynda, is a Christian lawyer whose life is threatened by an unknown killer. The second central character is the atheist Jake, who becomes a paraplegic after crashing on Lynda's sabotaged plane while test-flying it as a prospective buyer. The third main character is one of Lynda's clients, Paige, a single parent trying to avoid her abusive ex-husband. Suspense mounts as the mystery killer and his motive remain unidentified in the first half of the story.The first story in this collection, \\"Evidence of Mercy\\", is a terrific and captivating story that draws you in, and at the same time gives you much to think about, because the characters not only battle a mysterious killer, but also their own personalities and weaknesses. Much Christian fiction falls into the trap of featuring an artificial conversion story. Terri Blackstock shows that writers can craft a mouth-watering Christian story without artificially sprinkling it with an obvious theological twist of this kind, and yet retain a deeper spiritual significance. In the afterword, Blackstock explains that the idea of her book came after a personal struggle with her faith, and the growing awareness that faith needs to be put into action. \\"I thought I believed, I said I believed - but I did nothing to put the belief into action. I was neither hot nor cold, but luke-warm, and absolutely fruitless.\\" The title \\"Evidence of Mercy\\" describes this important spiritual theme that Blackstock wants to convey. The struggles of the three characters mirror Blackstock's own struggles, as she explains: \\"the characters interested me because their own spiritual battles were so much like my own: Lynda, a lukewarm Christian who would let someone die without witnessing to him; Jake, an agnostic who couldn't give up the pilot's seat in his life until it was taken from him; and Paige, a spiritual infant on the verge of belief, who lacked the faith to make the final plunge.\\" For instance, Lynda comes to conclude \\"she'd made a god of an airplane, an altar of her job, and an idol of her ego\\" (p.38), and Jake realizes the folly of relying on his good looks: \\"If I'd known I was going to be left with just my character, I'd have worked harder at building some.\\" (p.135) Without taking on an preaching tone that many Christian writers unwittingly do, Blackstock brings out these important spiritual truths by showing them in the lives of her characters in a convincing and persuasive manner. The other three stories in this anthology are equally good. In fact, I find them to be on a higher level than Dee Henderson's popular books.Terri Blackstock's novels are a welcome addition to the ranks of Christian fiction. The genre has been dominated especially by the historical romance, much of it inferior to secular fictions on most levels. With her successful efforts in suspense fiction genre, Terri Blackstock shows that it doesn't have to be that way (aside from an unnecessary kiss in the last pages), and that Christian writers can successfully take on new genres, and do so with style. As a fan of suspense fiction, I'm grateful to see Christian writers provide exciting alternatives to secular novels in the genre.

She obeys the Sahi's instructions and does not call the sheriff. Tom couldn't have killed Mildred, Boyd couldn't have killed her, and so, who could have killed her? It is inconceivable that the Sahib killed her. Leaf Trace, an author, could not have killed her. The list is too short and the island too small to arrive at a likely killer.So, the mystery is presented to the reader in interesting fashion. As good mysteries are, it is a puzzle. Mildred had called the Sahib senile. Tom is surprised some of the others don't want to find out who murdered Mildred. They want him to elope with Sister to give himself an alibi or to prevent her from testifying against him.The mystery has psychological ramifications. Someone among the characters agreeing to sell the publishing business formerly owned by the Sahib has caused the result of one and then two deaths. Murders on an island resemble a country house mystery. It is colorful and spooky."},{"Title":"Witness at large","review":"--Book Description--Death walks a fog-shrouded island. The pretty young girl called Sister sees Tom, the man she secretly loves, pulling a woman's body from the water--or is he dumping it?--while holding a hammer in his hand. No, she's certain that Tom would never kill. But if they report the death as a murder, Sister's testimony will surely make Tom the top suspect.At the urging of their adoptive father and his lawyer, Tom agrees to present the death as a tragic accident and marry Sister so she can't be forced to witness against him. But the unknown killer is still out there, and Sister saw something that she doesn't realize is significant. As she tries to figure out who the murderer is, the murderer moves to strike again...--My Review--\\"Witness at Large\\" is a suspenseful mystery with a historical flavor since it was written in 1966. The details about the characters and setting were good. The suspense was created from the relationship tensions (including Tom's fiancee trying to win Tom back when Tom and Sister suddenly marry) and the subtle threats the murderer is leaving for Sister. The characters were interesting but didn't have much depth. While I did suspect who the murderer was, I wasn't sure until very near the end and shortly before Sister figured it out. So it was an enjoyable \\"puzzle\\" mystery.There was no sex. There was a minor amount of bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this novel as an enjoyable mystery that's similar in style to Agatha Christie's."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub always has some interesting ideas but I don't think he handles them all that well! Others disagree... This novel about a couple of schoolboys who discover the secret of the heir to a lineage of wizardry has good suspense and some haunting moments, but the ending is VERY disappointing. This would actually have been a better novel WITHOUT the magical aspect, which is largely irrelevant! The brutalized-by-WWI explanation is a bit weak too, IMHO."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub is a very intelligent thinker when writing about occult matters. However, I found this book very confusing at times--wondering what was happening. In many places Straub could simplify his language rather than drawing out the entire plot with unneeded pages of action and details that bare no significance whatsoever. Like at the end, where you want the novel to end, he builds it up without giving a very specific ending. He wastes time on imagery that we simply don't care about, whereas in other areas of the book he is very stingy and cheap with details--making it very hard to understand what is happening.His allusion to other Literature is very thought-provoking, though it helps to have read these stories beforehand, otherwise you might get a little lost in the symbolism in his story.Finally, if you don't know who Eliphas Levi and other characters like Aleister Crowley are, you will be doubly lost. They are writers on the occult and some, like Crowley are practitioners. However, I find it remarkable how Straub includes non-fictional characters in a fictional story and uses this as a basis to interject his own personal thoughts on them. Straub gives us his opinion on various things like Christianity--that the true religion is Jesus' learnings, not the modern day preversion of priests and ministers. He draws many parallels and employs the use of metaphor heavily throughout Shadowland.The story becomes cliche when the characters take on a Jesus versus the Devil theme later in the novel. It becomes rather gaudy when Straub tries to create an allegory to Christ and his crucifixion, by actually using one character to represent Judas--who is later referred to as \\"a Judas.\\" If that wasn't enough, the main character is crucified and must find the power within to resurrect himself, so to speak, from the in and out states of consciousness he experiences.If you're familiar with any of the author's works, the occult, or Stephen King's works, I highly recommend Straub's Shadowland. It is a good story in and of itself, though it takes a while to digest, and many people will probably put it down after the first 100 pages where it appears to resemble a Harry Potter story for grownups."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I have read some Peter Straub books that I absolutely love, like, for instance, Ghost Story. Then there is this book. The magic of this book is that when it is over, you still have no idea what is going on. That is truly magical. I thought the characters in this book were weak and the story moved along at the pace of a retired snail on holiday. There are much better books out there. I think I will be haunted by the horror of how bad this book was forever."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I goofed! In my original review, I made references to a character named &quot;Spider&quot; -- who does not exist in the novel! You'd think someone who'd read the bloody thing as many times as I have would know better! Oh well...The character I meant to name was, of course, Skeleton Ridpath, son of the school's football coach, the &quot;heavy&quot; of the piece and a major character. I called him &quot;Spider&quot; because...well, never mind. You'll find out on your own. My apologies for any grievous mental confusion I might have caused."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Why is it that I always end up believing the hype about this guy and never learn from my mistakes? I don't know. I've wasted far too much money on Straub books and Shadowland is, I hope, my last time. I realize he's considered one of the best and has lots of fans, but I just can't get past page 50 of any of his books without yawning so frequently I have to stop reading for the tears in my eyes. Few writers have managed to put me to boredom-induced sleep like him.Shadowland: Right from the start, in typical Straub fashion, I hated the characters, the locations, and the circumstances. Arizona has never seemed more \\"dry\\" to me than it did in this book. It's written so that right off the bat you're wondering halfway through the page \\"who's saying this to whom, where, and in which time frame?\\" His descriptions of places, events, and memories are so ridiculously mixed and confusing it's practically retarded.Nothing made me latch on to the characters except my never-ending desire to see them all killed by page 50 so the misery can end. Arizona? His version you might as well nuke because it's a mental degradation to the reader's brain.Have you ever read a book and found yourself so bored you unconsciously began thinking about the binding, the quality of material used for the pages, the type of ink it was printed with etc. while your eyes are still reading? No? Then read this and find out what it's like. Because there's nothing better than realizing you just spent the last 30 minutes reading words that you instantly forgot and then had to backtrack to the point you lost interest and start over again."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"THE END IS REALLY FREAKY WITH THE GORE ALL OVER THE WALLS.

And I must report, Shadowland had me SCARED TO DEATH. Yup terrified that I could lapse into a coma any moment out of utter boredom. Ok it did pick up about 2/3's of the way through and it was interesting, as well as creative, well written and stylistically sophisticated. (not that I'm a writer...those are just my impressions). An interesting book by a skilled and talented author. But it was not, repeat NOT scary which is truely unfortunate because it possessed several elements that, properly nurtured could have produced a terrifying story."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"You will recognize each word. You will understand each sentence. But you will have no earthly idea what is going on.The problem with this book is that the events are described too vaguely. You'll read a sentence and wonder if it's a metaphor or a hard description. For example, if he says an audience's faces are animals staring at the main characters, is that just a metaphor or do they really have animal-faces? This kind of thing happens over and over and makes it a real chore to read this book.When I got to the last 50 pages, I finally fixed myself a pot of coffee, and after having set it aside for a couple months (finding the 2000 Election more exciting to follow), I resolved to finish the thing. It was a 50-yard dash up a cliff. (That was a metaphor, folks).All I can say is that it isn't worth the time invested. It's got an interesting concept, but it has boring characters, a boring plot, and a boring conclusion.One exception: The very beginning of the novel, which is set in a boy's school, is written in a more conventional style. You will be able to follow what is going on, but once you get to the meat of the novel - the Shadowland - you might as well hang it up. You'll find yourself struggling through pages, rereading paragraphs, flipping back to ask yourself, &quot;Have I missed some pages?

Employers don't like it much when an employee doesn't come in to work when they call out sick, but they like it even less when the employee doesn't call out at all because they're too engrossed to pick up the phone.The best way I can describe this story relative to current fiction would be to say \\"think of Harry Potter in Hell ... Hogwarts as a place you might wish to escape from, and Dumbledor as a most malevolent tutor\\" or words to that effect. A terrifying story that induces shudders on every imaginable level.

Shadowland is a tale that has endured through the years and when you listen to this adaptation you'll understand why.Briefly without divulging spoilers the tale involves a dark, forbidding Arizona prep school. The year is 1958 when freshman Tom Flanagan hooks up with richer than rich orphan Del Nightingale who also happens to be an amazing magician. These two aren't very popular on campus, which is an understatement. They're hazed by older students, especially one Skeleton Rid-path who gives new meaning to the description scoundrel.What ensues is a burning field house in which Tom's friend, Brick, dies. Skeleton was responsible for the fire but escapes punishment. Tom accompanies Del to his home in Putney, Vermont. It is Uncle Cole's strange home called Shadowland.Not even in your wildest imagination can you come up with what happens next. Shadowland stands alone among contemporary horror stories - enjoy.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This was a favorite book of mine when it came out (I was in junior high when it came out in paperback the first time). It is creepy, full of magic &amp; menace, and quite well written. (As an adult, I did notice a glaring point of view problem in the first part of the book--see if you can find it). It's the story of two boys who become friends at a private school amidst strange goings on. They spend the summer together in New Hampshire with the uncle of one of the boys who happens to be the world's greatest (sinister) magician. This is one of Straub's best to date and probably one of his two or three least known books. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I bought this book after reading The Talisman, which Straub cowrote with Stephen King, and I loved it. While there were times that it felt (only slightly) disjointed, there was nothing to take away from my enjoyment of the story, and the characters.While I was rooting for different outcomes, and different paths for certain characters, Im extremely pleased with where Straub took them. I definitely enjoyed the stories Coleman Collins told (The King of the Cats in particular), but the grande illusions he cast could have been defined a bit better for my taste. Either way, it was a fantastic book that made me late for work on more than one occasion, as I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This is Straub at his best.

It is such an all around &quot;good book&quot; that I am still recommending it to friends over 15 years after I first read it."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This is an exceptional novel, although it is difficult to classify. The characters are intriguing and complex. The use of interwoven story lines and memorable imagery makes the book one that will hold your interest to the last page.

Sound's creepy. Well, I don't know if I should buy it. Well, the main setting of the story is in a deep dark forest where a young boy's uncle lives, an uncle who happens to be a magician and gets drunk often. CREEPY YET!So you have never heard of this guy: Peter Straub So.....WHAT! I'VE NEVER READ A BOOK IN MY ENTIRE LIFE SO CREEPY AND WELL-WRITTEN!Part 1 Tom, a young boy who starts high school. He meets Del, who is studying magic. They have many mishappenings, and, while defending Del from bullies, Tom learns that the school itself is part of Shadowland. When I finished Part 1 I rolled right along to Part 2.Part 2 Del and Tom go spend the summer at Del's uncle's house, IN THE WOODS. Tom already suspects Del's uncle when he tells Tom never to go into certain rooms. (HMMMM) During this time Tom is also taught the basics of magic, and he comes to realize that magic is not made up of illusions, but it is real. Tom also falls in love with Rose, a girl he meets there who is controlled by Del's uncle.Part 3 Del, Tom, and Rose decide to leave. But during their escape, they get caught and sent back to the house for their punishments. Del's punishment: Getting beaten up by his uncle's massive servants. Extremely strong.

I don't know why I bother with Straub. He's got such great ideas, but his books are so frustrating.It's a great story (if a bit odd at times), but put together rather oddly. And as usual with him, it just feels like you have to fight the book in order to be able to understand what's going and to figure out what he's trying to say. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could finally put the thing down and move on. The sad part is that I actually did care what was going on and in the characters.

I really question that review. I never felt drama or fear. I never connected with this story. To me, this was a long story where the author tried to impress the reader by weaveng creative, colorful fantasy fairytails in a \\"horror\\" story. Not worth the read."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub tells the story of two prep-school classmates, Tom Flanagan, and Del Nightingale who spend a summer apprenticed to a master magician.The novels first part chronichles the formation of their friendship, and their involvement in both stage and occult magic. This segment is fairly conventional, and well told. It succeeds in effectively building an atmosphere of menace, and thoroughly introducing the characters and themes that will be futher developed in the second half of the book, which is much more complex.In the second half the book, all the laws of nature are uprooted, and magic and menace become the rule rather than the exception. The setting is confined to an estate in vermont, Shadowland, which is the domain of the wizard Coleman Collins. Coleman's origins are spelled out in an elaborate series of hallucinations, staged events, and magical illusions, or some indefinite mixture of all three. Straub is very effective in creating this fantastical setting, and in initiating the characters, and the reader, into his world of magic.Unfortunately, this is where the story, and the horror, break down. In a story featuring a protagonist who can fly, transform himself, levitate objects, start fires with his mind, etc, it is a bit hard to generate any kind of menace or horror. (it is especially galling that a character who can fly is kept captive by a tall fence-) Thus what should be the climactic conflict pitting master against apprentice comes across rather flat, despite a phantasmagoria of imagery. The images can be interesting, perhaps even scary, but their ephemeral nature undercuts the significance of the consequences of this action.Don't get me wrong, Straub weaves a rich tapestry that is compelling in places, but ultimately, in the big picture, falls utterly flat as horror, despite its richness and lyricism.If you want clever references, occult themes and an intricate plot and a satisfying finish, perhaps you should read Foucault's Pendulumn, by Eco Umberto.If you want a horror story with occult themes, look elswhere."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"&quot;Shadowland&quot; is two stories in one book. The first is set in a strict prep school, the second is set in the confined house of a madman. Though this book had strong imagery and allegory, I found the story to be too complex. Straub tried to tackle too many issues at once and just barely scraped by. The characters are developed well, but I was unable to grasp the emotion of the love between Tom and the mysterious &quot;Rose.&quot; If you'd like to read a book with a well-written love affair that is also black with horror I recommend reading &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot; by Stephen King. Overall, I found Shadowland to be too long, and the ending is unsatisfying and abrupt."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was the first Peter Straub I have read, and since then I have also read Houses Without Doors. Peter Straub is often refered to by those who need labels for things as a &quot;more intellectualized Steven King&quot;. There is some truth to this, but not a lot. Straub's writing is less colloquial, less immediate, than King's, and he lacks King's instinctive (some might even say addictive) sense of humor. In other ways, though, many similarities can be drawn between their writing, which is why, although it has been called a lesser work, I enjoyed the Talisman (and Black House, too).Back to the matter at hand.Straub's writing is quite beautiful. There is a penetrating lyricism in it. In his hands, the mundane becomes as terrifying as the bizzare, and a simple glance at a passerby out of a train window can be as numbing, or more, as the macabre violence that eventually follows (and, rest assured, it is indeed to follow- one scene towards the end literally turned my stomach- you Will realize what scene I refer to when reading it, I am sure).The story is of two friends at a decaying authoritarian prep school in the Southwest. The second story is of these two boys' apprenticing under one's uncle, an aging magician who is on the brink of madness.There is such a clean break of setting between the two large sections that it creates some problems- which Straub effectively fixes.Almost.A web of interconnected images and characters connect the sections to each other, and these are well acheived and fascinating. However, the division is almost unbridgable. The novel works as a whole, but it is a whole that is like two countries, the first of a undercurrent of crackling, quasi-Dickensian unpleasantness and uncertainty, the second of surreal, neo-Fairytale horror. While the bridge between them is a strong one, it is still possible to fall off the side, and one of the dangers of reading this book is that, such a clean break being drawn, the reader might put it down to take tea after the first half and not pick it up again. Lest this sound pejorative, let me say that the reader who does this will miss a hell of a good conclusion.Now that I have gotten my complaints out of the way...The characters are strongly drawn and effective, acting out a story which is ultimately about the seduction of the forbidden and the loss of innocence. Magic is the catalyst for and the observer of these transformations, and when the bottled up energy of the first section explodes in an apocalyptic climax, Straub spares no punches in the surreal fervor- midnight covens in the woods, characters who may be either real or not, supporting roles for both the Brothers Grimm and Humphrey Bogart, etc.While there are some uncomfortable things happening structure-wise, this book is worth a read. In the end, the divisions that throw you at first are rubbed away by the protaganist's conclusion that &quot;Shadowland&quot; is not only the name of the old magician's estate, but it extends to the happenings at the school, and, overall, to a state of being that characterizes the book perfectly."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Shadowland is a ambitious novel, and Peter Straub deserves praise for having attempted it at all, let alone for having seen it through to its publication in 1980. Yes, this is a diplomatic way of saying Shadowland is a good concept but the idea doesn't quite find full realization on the printed page. It is a rare example of when a screenplay might have been able to flesh out a plot better than a book can. Maybe one day it will find its way to the big screen, and in the right hands it could be powerful.Shadowland is Straub's tip of his hat to the genre of dark fairy tales, magic (and magick) and the gritty fantasyland we all love deep down in our souls. When Tom Flanagan, and Del Nightingale, two teenaged friends from a stern, second-rate Arizona prep school, each preoccupied with stage magic, travel to spend the summer at a foreboding New England house called Shadowland, guests of Del's notorious uncle, Coleman Collins, a retired theater magician, they are soon sucked into Coleman's demented and fantastic world in which magic tricks are quite real, time exists in a vacuum, and creatures from tall tales walk among them. The novel soon becomes a story about moral good versus self-serving ambition, the corruption of dark desire, and the loss of innocence and identity.Shadowland is a tragedy. It is slightly sad from beginning to end, and only in a few masterfully-composed chapters is a reader paroled from its morosity long enough to be swept up in the wonder of what is possible at the magical estate. Fatal train derailments arranged for convenience? The animation and sexual possession of the inanimate? The enslavement of the living? Murder? These are waved away and dismissed by Coleman as side effects unavoidable in the amoral life of a master conjurer, for whom all the world is but a tool to be used for his pleasure. In this does Shadowland's horror lie.Perhaps most of all I liked the sly side references to past Straub books that were seamlessly woven in here. Did anyone else catch that the upperclassman who came in to speak sternly to the new boys at the school was none other than Miles Teagarden, tormented protagonist from Straub's If You Could See Me Now? Those with a knowledge of that brilliant but emotionally-taxing 1975 book would recall that after the tragedy in 1955 that was the focus of If You Could See Me Now, Miles was sent away to what he'd told us was \\" a prison-like boarding school,\\" and guess what? That school is the same one Del and Tom attend! Nice, Mr. Straub!Shadowland is a de rigueur stopover for anyone serious about the literary works of Peter Straub, and it's fairly readable and sound for its genre, but as far as recommending it to the average reader...there I'd hesitate. For its limitations and occasional failings I rate it three stars overall, but for sheer ambition as far as what he was trying to say, Straub deserves more than five stars. Simply put, he has a wondrous imagination!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I just finished this book last night. I had only read Straub with King before. I was hoping this would turn out better - it had such a build-up that I thought the end would amaze and delight. But the ending left me cold. This book about magic was definitely full of illusions: it had the illusion of fully formed characters, a cohesive plot, and an exciting ending. But if you look a bit deeper you find that it's just a trick.And a big problem for me is that there is very little \\"magic\\" going on in this book. Collins tells stories and gives performances and confuses the boys but no actual learning of magic is discussed apart from some card tricks. Also I felt that there was too much separation between Del and Tom at Shadowland. In fact Del is pretty much nonexistent in the second part of the book. They were inseparable in the first part it seemed and barely talked in the second.I'm glad i read this but it could have been better. As for horror, it is not horror but more dark fantasy."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub's Shadowland is one of the pinnacles of the horror/ fantasy genre, a symbolic, unsettling, expertly-written journey into the country of magic, a coming-of-age story that surprises, enlightens, and terrifies -- sometimes all at once. It follows the journey of two boys, Tom Flanagan and Del Nightingale, first in their experiences at school, discovering that magic is far more than the art of illusion...and then their travails at the house of Del's uncle, the legendary (and dangerous) Coleman Collins, aka Herbie Butter. Much of the story is revealed in flashback form, and sometimes in flashbacks within flashbacks, a literary device Straub loves to employ, and uses to great effect here, choosing just the right moment to provide a little illumination, a little atmosphere, or a little terror. As I noted above, the story is about magic (magic here being symbolic of manhood to Straub's young protagonists), about its discovery and its uses...as well as its perversions. Indeed the entire novel is largely a work of symbolism and allegory, echoing the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm (who even make an appearance in the story) and, to a lesser degree, Hans Christian Anderssen. Straub loves to drop such literary allusions all over his novels, and in Shadowland he does it very well indeed, using his mythic backgrounds to echo and inform the story, providing color and shading much as a painter does. Often a fairy tale that has just been related will happen again as part of Tom's experiences, or the opposite will happen; sometimes the fairy tales are part of a tableau, staged by Coleman Collins for Tom and Del's benefit. Sometimes they become literal events, as they do in the case of Rose, about whom I will reveal nothing save to say that the revelation of who (or what) she really is will shock you down to your toes. This is a novel, as I also said, about comings-of-age and awakenings, both sexual and otherwise, with magic used as metaphor for this to a large degree (the sequences where Tom lifts the tree and flies being key examples of what I mean; his exhaustion afterwards is almost a sexual one), though there is a true sexual awakening for Tom in Shadowland that is just as telling in its way, and just as revealing about Rose's character, as all of the allegorical goings-on that I've been going on about (at some length) above. It is a dangerous moment for both of them, and Straub pulls it off beautifully, missing not a beat as he relates what could have been a clumsy passage in other hands. And speaking of danger, the villains in the story, from the enigmatic and menacing Collins to the troll-like Wandering Boys, to the ugly and utterly evil character of Spider (surely one of the best villans in all of fantastic literature) are portrayed to perfection, adding not just menace to the story but outright moments of terror; there are also three encounters with a mysterious character known only as M., whose confrontations with Tom echo certain elements of the New Testament, and which give the reader one of the clearest indications where Straub is going. Of course it's also worth noting that not all of the story is quite so serious and grim; there are moments of fine, if twisted, humor, as there are in all of Straub's novels. In one memorable sequence, during a hallucinatory magical revue put on by Collins in his Herbie Butter incarnation, Del and Tom meet up with Bugs Bunny, Jesus, and the Apostles (who sing a rousing rendition of -- of all things -- &quot;Fish For Supper&quot;!), all within a few pages. I could go on and on -- I haven't even touched on the novel's more hallucinatory aspects, or the wonderful depiction of life at a boys' school in the novel's early stages, surely one of the best, most realistic descriptions of such an experience I've ever read. There is also Collins' amazing tale of his days as a surgeon in World War I, and how he discovered magic under the tutelage of Speckle John, which will amaze and startle you as much as anything in the book. To sum up, Shadowland is essential reading for anyone interested in the horror/fantasy genre. I read it as a teeneager, and as I've grown older it's gained more and more resonance with each successive reading; I have no doubt that it'll do the same for you."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This got me started on Peter Straub. I read Ghost Story, Koko, Mystery, and If you could see me now all because of Shadowland. I could not put this book down. It is easily the most unsettling book I have ever read and I don't think Straub has reached this level of intensity ever again."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"As mentioned, the plot of this novel is quite hard to summerise. It is a book of two halves, the first part a brilliant, page turning tale of a sadistic school which hints at the horrors to come. The second part and the crux of the novel is set at Del's myserious uncles huge estate 'Shadowlands.' Here stories within stories mix and mingle, and nothing is what it seems. The hero, Tom, is brilliant creation who you cheer for all long. Long, complex and brilliantly written this is a multilayered fantasy masterpiece."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Like many other reviews for this book, it has been several years since I first found this book in my attic. My first attempt at reading it was not entirely successfuly, given that I was quite young then. In a subsequent attempt, I found this book otherwise. It has been one of the books that I consider milestones in reading; books that take you to a higher level. To summarize, it has a captivating story, complex charater portrayals, and a seemingly timeless 'feel' to it. Peter Straub takes you on an adventure which has few parallels. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I agree with most of what the previous reviewer said about SHADOWLAND's feeling of unreality. Straub tells a straightforward yet allegorical tale of loss of innocence, friendship and sacrifice in such a way that the entire book seems like a &quot;fever dream,&quot; like some enchantment cast upon a knight of the Round Table by Morgan LeFay. The effect is unsettling and disturbing. This is certainly one of the most haunting, complex and downright literary &quot;horror&quot; novels ever written. Straub manages to say more about the human condition through &quot;that battered old sword of storytelling,&quot; as Tim Underhill would say, than other writers of this genre would ever dream."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I read this book when I was 14, and reread it many times since. It never looses it's ability to hold my attention. If you love fiction, fantasy, and even a little horror, get ready for a wonderful treat. I'll bet you can't put it down...16 years later and I still can't."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I read this book in high school and had no trouble understanding it. Those reviewers who suggest a Stephen King novel over Shadowland obviously have problems with stories that have depth and plots that you are not smacked in the face with.This is an amazing story about friendship, and leaving your childhood behind. It made me laugh, cry and streched my imagination in the most wonderful of ways.So far though, no one has mentioned poor Skeleton Ridpath who I remember feeling sorry for...Guess I've got to re-read this and perhaps I'll feel differently.Fans of Clive Barker will definitely enjoy Shadowland, Ghost Story and Julia"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Before I read &quot;Shadowland&quot; I went through some of Amazon's review finding comment like&quot;SHADOWLAND at first seems utterly confusing, but by the end everything comes together in ways that will amaze and delite&quot;and&quot;unlike many novels of this genre, the ending is not simplistic or disapointing&quot;I also think that the story is confusing here and there but I was hoping that there was to come the promised not-disapointing ending. Unfortunately I was the one to be disapointed. I must admit the story really keeps you in suspense, however, maybe I didn't get the message, but in my opinion the ending ain't one of the strongest. While reading I had some supposition how the plot would develop and I how things would come out in the end but -as mentioned above- the ending left too many things open (e. g. who/what is Rose?). Though &quot;Shadowland&quot; is entertaining, in the end I felt like having wasted my time cos it wasn't worth it. Well, there surely are books much worse than &quot;Shadowland&quot; but if you have a better one, don't hesitate to read that one first!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I have been reading since a young age, and this is quite simply my favorite book. Some books tend to meander all over the place; others tend to load up on the details to try and fill out a sparse story wihch would be better off a short story. Not so with Shadowland, a truly monumental literary accomplishment which is completely under-rated. The massive amount of details in the story help to bring the story to life, to bring the reader closer into the story.Shadowland is not for everyone. But if you are on the same wavelength as the story you will find what is easily the finest piece of writing in existance. The magnitude and depth of the story, the only other books I can think of comparing would be Tarot by Piers Anthony or the Dark Tower series by Stephen King; IF he gets the totally extraneous side plotline books out of the way!It is a true shame that Straub's other works get more attention, I consider Shadowland to be his absolute finest masterpiece. This book really does belong to the ages."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub's \\"Shadowland\\" is a coming of age story with fantastical events, horrific twists and classic tragic plot turns. All these elements beg the reader to want to love this novel, but in the end the story comes across empty somehow (even if the last 150 pages is a terrifically executed wild ride).As adolescents at a boarding school Del Nightingale and Tom Flanagan form a bond through a mutual love of magic. The boys, who spend a summer at Shadowland with Del's uncle ( a grand wizard of magic), soon realize that their bond was no accident and all the events leading-up to their final summer together were not just random series of events. Shadowland tests their skills, morality and friendship in ways they never expected.Peter Straub's introduction explains that much of \\"Shadowland\\" was conceived as a tribute of sorts to fairy tales. That influence is felt through out the book in its style and stories within the action (King of Cats, mermaids, The Brothers Grimm, The Goose Girl, evil sorcerers...). It is fun to try and catch all the references, although I must admit I am sure I missed 95% of them. Unfortunately, it is the need to present \\"Shadowland\\" as a fairy tale that really pulled the book down for me. Fairy tales are stories told by a third party who is telling a tale passed on to them, and \\"Shadowland\\" is no different. The story is told to us by a narrator who is communicating what he was told by our hero Tom Flanagan. Because we are not getting the information first hand (although the action is written as if the reader is present at the time it happened), there is a detachment to the horror and the reader questions if what is happening is real. Because the novel's plot is based on magic, there are illusions and hallucinations to further confuse the reader as to what is happening. It is this confusion and lack of identity with the characters and events that made an intriguing plot somewhat dull and uninspiring.Although it contains terrific writing, \\"Shadowland\\" falters due to the authors sweeping attempt to do too much which gets in the way of presenting an effective story. I wanted to like the story but it never lived up to expectations."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This is his best. We follow our narrator and actual protagonists through their Freshman year at Carson, a mid-level prep-school in the 1950's. We go through a very traditional turn before... either.This is a great book, featuring the idea of magic in the everyday world as well as in the world of fantasy. It belongs in the fantasy/horror genre, but like Robert McCammon's \\"Boy's Life\\" would later, it transcends it and uses the conventions of the genre to become a universal coming of age story. As I said above, this is Straub's best work, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub weaves a mind-blowing web of horror and emotion in this unsettling tale of darkest magic. As with his subsequent novel, The Talisman co-written with Stephen King, Straub demonstrates his unnervingly clear vision of magic at its most real, devastating and climactic potency. Quite simply, this is a book that can be re-read just to absorb Peter Straub's mastery of story telling and literary atmosphere."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This is my third novel by the author, and while it was pretty entertaining, I thought it was just a bit too over-the-top for my taste. The first part of the book, the first hundred and forty pages or so, was the most conventional. Author's choice of narrator was a bit baffling, but it wasn't a huge distraction. His tendency to describe what the characters are wearing, though, was annoying. Things get really confusing when Tom and Del go to be with Del's uncle, a magician, for the summer. It's here where things got quite confusing, but thankfully pretty soon I got used to it and could keep up. From here on, the novel was always over-the-top, one strange occurrence after another. The only thing that broke that pattern were some of the stories the magician told Tom and Del, which I liked very much.Overall, Shadowland wasn't boring, but it was way over-the-top for my taste. I prefer novels that blend realism with the fantastic (like the author's \\"lost boy lost girl\\"), without getting too into the fantastic. I don't regret reading it, and I had no problem finishing it, but at the end of the day, it really wasn't my kind of novel. I'll definitely read more from this author. The Hellfire Club sounds more to my taste."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Straub is a master of his craft. This book is very, very hard to put down - a real \\"page-turner,\\" to use the old cliche. I recommend it highly. Probably my second favorite of all his books, after GHOST STORY."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Shadowland was one of the first horror books I read growing up (I think I may have been twelve at the time that I read it). Along with some of the early works of Stephen King, it was one of the big reasons I became addicted to the genre and later became a writer. Shadowland is a richly written, complex books that I quickly became engrossed in. Shadowland follows two friends Del and Tom in boarding school. Both boys are into magic and dabble at it while they are in school. After the school year is over, they spend the summer at Del's uncle's house. Uncle Collins is a crazed, retired magician who gives the boy's a tutorial in real magic. As the book evolves, it starts to become clear that Uncle Collins isn't all in the up and up, something that Tom begins to pick up on. He comes to the conclusion that if he and Del are to survive the summer at Shadowland, they are going to have to escape. The only problem is that Uncle Collins has taken a keen interest in Tom and isn't about to let him go.Shadowland is one of those books that perfectly fits the description of \\"hard to put down\\". Straub does a brilliant job of making the characters come alive. I've read many of Peter Straub's novels and this is my favorite. He did an excellent job of weaving in sub-plots and creating a story world that was both highly entertaining and very rewarding to read through. A definite horror classic, I would strongly advise to pick up a copy if you haven't already read this one.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub's \\"Ghost Story\\" is one of my favorites of all time, not just horror-wise but just in general....this book isn't far behind. The first third of the book does drag a little(although it's not boring per say) and is pretty heavy on background and character descriptions etc....however the last two-thirds of this book are definitly worthy five stars. Straub's imagination is unlimited, and he writes in such a dark and creepy manner that it's no wonder he is the only man Stephen King would co-author with. This guy, just based off a couple of books i read, is a big leaguer. I rated 4 stars, because of the longgggg beggining, but even with that included this book is worthy of four and a half. Read this!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This was one of the better books I've read from Peter Straub. I'd recommend it to anyone and would love if they would make an audiobook for it."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Shadowland is a wonderfully imaginative novel by master storyteller, Peter Straub. Without fail, Straub has delivered a tightly written, complex story that's dark, gothic, and hallucinatory with something for everyone: horror, suspense, and mystery.Much of the story is revealed in flashback and sometimes in flashbacks within flashbacks.Long and complex, this multilayered supernatural is story written with pure precision, a coming of age story of an adolescent's wondrous, mysterious and terrifying journey into manhood. The young protagonist, Tom, is the type of hero the reader roots for throughout the story. The story begins at a private prep school for boys where two freshmen, Tom Flanagan and Del Nightingale find each other and form a strong friendship through their fascination of magic. The boys soon discover that magic is far more than the art of illusion.As with Robert McCammon's Boy's Life, Shadowland should be classified as fantasy/supernatural because this work transcends horror, it becomes a classic coming of age story. This is superb storytelling by Straub. Literary and rich in detail, I highly recommend this outstanding novel."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub's Shadowland is a rolling ride into undefinded horror that leaves the reader quaking. Prep schools are a nightmare in themselves (for the attendees)Arizona prep schools are something else. Despite the stigma associated with the schools, many fast friendships can be formed among the students. Del and Tom form such a friendship, sharing a childlike curiosity in magic, learning to execute those ever difficult card tricks, dodging a headmaster from hell, and trying to understand why the entire school is suffering from nightmares.Shadowland is an estate owned by Del's alcholic and slightly mad uncle, a retired magician. Shadowland is a world in itself, as the name implies, for nothing is what it seems. Others live at Shadowland, ones that the boys are not aware of, but suspect. Del's uncle spins tales of wonder, frightening and magical, and everything appears to be tied into Shadowland and it's surrounding areas.Shadowland is frightening, terrifying, and a nail biting bit of fiction that will keep the reader on the edge of their seats. Ranking right up there with the kings of horror, Straub has produced another masterpeice!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This book was re-issued when I bought it a few years ago. i enjoyed the talisman, so I tried this book. This follows boys at a magic prep school--trying to remember--been awhile---taunting from other students and a grudge against one of the teachers. Clear character descriptions, def. recommended.also recommend \\"Honest Illusions\\" by Nora Roberts if you like fiction stories about magic. Different genre, but worth reading."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"First read anything by Peter Straub when he wrote the Talisman with Stephen King. Was curious and so I got this book. It was one I could not put down and really didnt want the book to end."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I first read Shadowland when I was 14 or 15 and loved it. Since then, I've re-read it maybe a dozen times or so and never get tired of it. I've loaned it out and bought it again many times over. I would recommend this book to any fan of magic or modern horror. It is one of my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"One of my favorite Straub novels. A novel that transcends the usual horror conventions and weaves a story that captivates and haunts."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Probably a little long, so a bit on the dull side at times and takesperseverance to get through this creepy and eerie story of two boysinterested in magic.An older magician relative has the boys stay with him for a whileto teach them, but are his skills actually more to do with real magicthan illusion is the question here."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I re-read this book about once a year. It is a fascinating interwoven story of fairy tales, magic, coming-of-age and the loss of innocence. I have probably read it about 12 times and am still amazed at the way Straub manages to make every little story fit into the bigger story in at least two ways. I believe this book is incredibly under-valued. Once you read it, you will never forget it."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Shadowland, by Peter Straub, is a piece of really excellent high-end horror. The book begins in a private prep school for boys. In this school, Del and Tom, two freshmen boys fascinated by magic, find each other and form a strong friendship. Together, they learn card tricks, try to figure out why the whole school is having nightmares, dodge the crazy headmaster of the school, and do the sort of pal-around that only boys of a certain age can do. Their school year culminates with a big talent show in which Del and Tom plan to perform a magical exhibition. Circumstances in the story keep this from happening and the boys retire for the summer to the estate of Del's uncle, Shadowland.Del's uncle is a half-crazy, alcoholic, retired magician. He sets about teaching the boys magic. His magic, though, consists of more than tricking the eye with a slight of hand. At Shadowland, nothing is as it seems. An hour can feel like all day. The sun can set at 11am. You can find yourself suddenly half-way across a continent, just to find that you haven't moved from your spot at all. There are others living at Shadowland that are unseen, and whose existence is denied. There are rules that are made in the hopes of being broken. As Del's uncle spends the summer recounting his life, in all it's horror, to the boys Tom realizes that the horror is only starting. As he sees things that can't be real, but are, and he sees the immediate horrors being committed at Shadowland, Tom realizes that he has to leave, and Del must come with him. Unfortunately, for Tom and Del, Uncle Collins has realized something about Tom that even Tom doesn't yet know - and he wants it for himself.In Shadowland, Peter Straub has written a brilliant piece of fiction. There are plots, subplots, and subplots within those. Nothing in this book is without purpose to the story. Straub's writing, which has a definite British bent, despite the story being set in the United States, is very literary and rich. More complex than Stephen King, Straub is still very readable, especially to those who like a thicker story. No one who enjoys literary horror will be disappointed for having read this book."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Straub burst into fame with his previous book &quot;Ghost Story&quot; but this book has always been my favorite. It has stories within stories, details in one part that take on ominous meanings later in the story, and a weird meshing of magic and Grimm fairy tales. What is real and what is not is a constant question and never fully answered. It does lead to a very stunning though violent ending. It is also a coming of age book but so different from many others of that type. Truly unique which may be why it confused people at first because it fit no clear cut category. With its stunning deatil and visual images, I am amazed no one ever made this book into a movie."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I first read this in 1984 at a christian youthcamp 'retreat' with compulsory 'outdoor activities' in subzero weather. It was there that I got hooked on quote marks and phonics. It was there that I began to see that adults could be as clueless as children.I return to this book at Christmas when the weather looks bleak. As a coming of age novel, it speaks more clearly to me than some classics I could name.One cautionThe first pages confuse. Mr. Straub likes to spin you around before telling you a story. It breaks you out of your world and preps you for his. I'm lucky to find such a great story teller."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Tom Flanagan and his more affluent friend, Del Nightingale, receive an invitation from Del's uncle, Coleman Collins, to spend the summer with him. Collins is perhaps the greatest stage magician in the world, and both of the boys love magic. Collins promises to teach them both some new tricks. In fact, he promises to pass all his secrets on to the worthier of the two, which couldn't please Del more, since he wants to be the greatest living magician. Of course, one should always be careful what one wishes for...This is an extraordinary book, something that might come from Walt Disney, if Disney was capable of coming up with anything either adult or horrific. It is best described as a nightmarish fairy-tale, full of magic - but mostly from the dark side.As is typical of Straub, the story is constructed in convoluted and highly complicated form, all of which builds nicely to the conclusion of the main story at hand. The action begins in an Arizona boys' prep school, moves to an isolated mansion in Vermont, and includes numerous stories of Collins' highly checkered past throughout war-torn Europe, each tale of which increasingly fuels a mounting sense of dread - for Coleman Collins is much more than he seems; much more, and much worse.I'm amazed no one ever attempted to make a movie of Shadowland, for it is highly cinematic in style. It isn't as good as Straub's preceding masterpiece, Ghost Story, but is still a worthy successor and a great, involving read. The characters are well-realized, the action intriguing, and the atmosphere and actual magic of the piece are striking."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This is a classic book by Straub, one of his best! The structure is great breaking the book up into sensible categories and the voice of the book is outstanding.The best parts of the book is the stories within the stories. I particularly love the times in the book when the \\"now\\" adults are reunited and the times spent at Carson. But the greatest parts are the fables told. Straub really flexes his creative muscle during these parts of the book.Why 4 stars? Because the book almost fell apart near the end. I think the novel may have been written about 100 pages too long. But the whole time I read this book I was very curious to how it really ends."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Rates in my top five all-time favorite books. This one delivers it all. Caught somewhere between a fever dream and the cool, longing whisper of a childhood memory, this book does what so few can: creates a narrative that is truly unique. As a film director, I have watched and read--&quot;absorbed&quot;--so many stories, that it is impossible not to see lazy &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; storytelling in almost everything. How often have I picked up a book or watched a movie with an interesting premise only to find that it is just like every other book or movie. Not so with Shadowland, which kept me forever off balance--but not enough to lose me. I was lost and riveted at the same time.With absolute precision, Straub brings to life the adolescent's journey into manhood; how even everyday life can be a wonderous, terrifying mystery. By reframing this subtext within the confines of Shadowland itself--the magician's mansion--Straub creates a level of uncertainty and terror that you will feel lingering with you long after you've closed the book.I can't imagine that this book will suit everyone's taste; but for anyone who likes their fiction to remain elusive, revealing, suprising, this is a book that will haunt you for years to come."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"What a work. I originally read it a decade ago as a kid, I recently picked it up again, and wow, it's even better this time around. Another reviewer noted that it's a shame this book doesn't get more attention among the works of Peter Straub - that reviewer is absolutely dead on. I'd still have to rank it, among Straub's books, a close second - how can you top \\"Ghost Story?\\" Well, \\"Shadowland\\" comes very, very close to doing just that.I imagine this is the kind of book that, as a writer, after you finish it, you kind of lean back in your chair, smile, and say, \\"Ah, I really am that damn good.\\" It has incredible settings. The prep school in Arizona pulls off as interesting dichotomy: it feels, for a large part, like a true-to-life coming of age story, rich in detail and characterization, that you would expect from the era it is set in. But it also has that dark, supernatural twist, and that aura of \\"something is terribly wrong\\" that makes it such a delicious read that brings to mind Graham Joyce in his element.And Shadowland itself! Shadowland, that great estate! Shadowland equals and, dare I say, surpasses in places, masters like Neil Gaiman and Clive Barker in fashioning and sculpting a truly gripping and fantastic world. The sights, sounds, spectacles, and characters of Shadowland are fantastic.I'm not going to outline the plot in any real depth, it's been done on here already. The book is one of the greatest of the \\"horror bildungsromans\\" in existence. It is told in a narrative form that flashes between the past and \\"present,\\" which I did not find confusing at all. I think it seemed like a natural and rich way to get at the story.The main characters are Del and the protagonist Tom. Both are marvelously fleshed out. Coleman Collins is a great character, a man who seems to be a gregarious if somewhat somewhat rough-around-the-edges and mysterious magician. Early in the book he comes off sort of as a hard-drinking, \\"black-sheep-uncle-of-the-family\\" with some sordid elements. He tells the boys (and the readers) great stories, takes them to wondrous places in their minds, and puts on grand shows and illusions in his elaborate and huge house of tricks. Later however, it appears he may be far more sinister and calculating than expected. The mysterious and lovely Rose is another fascinating character, whose introduction into the story adds a major wrinkle to the plot. Skeleton Ridpath is an effective villain whose later appearance is a surprise once it is understood, and horrifying.I could go on and on, but the point should be clear by now - this is a great book, a work of art in my opinion. Do not be put off by other reviews that compare it to Harry Potter (Shadowland came first by more than a decade and is more complex, darker, and more intelligent) or reviews that complain about the book because it does not have a straight arrow, linear narrative style. This is a satisfying read that has a lot of treasures to offer up. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"With the publication of Shadowland in 1981, Peter Straub enhanced his already impressive reputation as a modern master of the horror/dark fantasy genre. Although more subtle than its predecessor, the modern classic Ghost Story, the book's exquisite pacing was more effective in pulling readers into Straub's surreal fantasy world, making them wonder if such a place might not exist after all.The novel is the story of the friendship between two young men and their encounter with a sorceror supreme. The magician, one Coleman Collins, exposes the two boys to a variety of bizarre and perilous situations, all designed to test, but also prepare them, for the time when one of them will inherit Collins' mantle of king of the magicians. The story moves quickly, as Tom Flanagan and Del Nightengale make the acquaintance of the strange denizens of the magician's mansion, Shadowland. There, they meet the charming Brothers Grimm, as well as Collins' warped servants, who go by the unlikely names of Mr. Peet, Roof, Rock and Seed. They also must deal with the evil \\"Collector,\\" a mirror that steals souls.The boys struggle with the malevolent forces which surround them and confront the dark side of their own personalities to prove themselves worthy. But Collins proves to be jealous of his power, causing a challenging summer of wonderment to climax in unspeakable tragedy. Pupil faces teacher in a final, bloody confrontation, winner take all.The phrases \\"I couldn't put it down\\" and \\"Read this one with the lights on\\" are overused in describing horror stories, but in this case they are a perfect fit, as Straub succeeds admirably in his professional goal \\"To take the classic elements of the horror novel as far as they could go.\\" Enter Shadowland, and explore the boundaries of your own imagination."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"An innovatively written tale spreading across the territory of horror and dark fantasy, Shadowland is equally driven by concept and by characters, and is an indispensible addition to the library of any devotee of the fantastic or just excellent novels in general.The style in which the book is narrated is unique, something I've never encountered elsewhere. It's written by a character - now an author - who played a small role in the events during his youth, and who has, years later, gathered the rest of the story through extensive talks - sort of half-interviews, half-conversations - with another character, Tom Flannagan, who played a more direct role in the events being recounted; a lesser role is played by further talks with other characters who were more or less peripheral to the big events. The fact that the author character is never identified by name lends an additional dose of eerie authenticity to the tale.It starts out - after a pair of prologues touching on dreams of ancient wizards, and on the world of stage magic where some of the acts may not be 100% illusion - in 1950s Arizona and the start of the school year at a private school, an institution very austere and unforgiving even for the era, where the teaching staff is mostly unpleasant and many of the older students arrogant thugs, and a hard year is set for Flannagan and Del Nightingale, the two main players of this part of the novel. The novel's narrator is present for the events of this section, and plays a fairly signifigant side role, as he, Flannagan, Nightingale, and several other first-year students at the Carson Upper School form friendships and try to make it through the year, which includes not only the familiar, worldly difficulties, not other, more exotic, troubles lurking in the background. One of the interests Tom is introduced to early in the school year is magic, which is Del's passion, and something he practices most of the time he's not in school, achieving a high level of skill at. Uncannily high, in fact...After many threads have woven together and subplots have beun to meld, we find ourselves ready for the next act, as summer dawns and Del invites Tom to come along with him for his annual trip to his Uncle Cole's estate in New England. Coleman Collins is a rich recluse, at one time a world-famous stage magician, and now mentor to Del during the summer months. It's here that the main thrust of the novel takes place. Tom meets, for the first time, the array of people Del's come to know during his consecutive summers at the estate: Collins's small band of roughish - servants? friends? lackeys? - Tom isn't quite sure; a forlorn and beautiful young girl named Rose; and the mysterious Coleman Collins himself. Many characters aren't necessarily what they seem, and during the school year and, especially, during that fateful summer that follows where Del and Tom co-apprentice under Collins, we encounter wonderous beauty, riveting tension, the telling of fantastic fables within the larger story, and a character who's slowly revealed to be one of the most believably and disturbing evil characters in horror history. The twists and turns are many: some bring unexpected brightness to the tale, some are very dark (one in particular hits like a sledgehammer right to the heart). Some aspects of the book - the true motivations of certain characters; the spiritual/theological meaning behind certain revelations - are wide open to individual interpretation, and that can actually be a good thing: sometimes things are better off not spelled right out, but left for the reader to make up their own mind on (the identity of the 'dream wizard' early on, for example). Some may think the first section of the book - the school year, which is largely a 'lead-up' phase - occupies too much page space, but I like the time the book took in establishing its characters and in letting the more mystical elemets seep in gradually.You feel like you know the characters deeply in this book, and come to truly care about their fates; the magical elements feel real, and sometimes it seems that the weirder the magic gets, the more genuine it feels. As I said earlier, this is a must for fans of horror or dark fantasy (maybe of fantasy in general), and also recommended for fans outside of those fields. The only caveat for readers not into horror or dark fantasy is that when Shadowland gets dark, it gets DARK. There are some frightening and wrenching moments in here, but in the end all the book's elements blend together for a tale that's haunting in more ways than one."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I completely agree with a previous comment about this novel making a great film. I would love to see some of those fantastic scenes played out on the big screen.It does jump around a bit, but I think that this is SUPPOSED to confuse us a little to add to the general feeling of &quot;what is real, and what is not----where am I?&quot;.

Vlad begins to realize that, perhaps, what he does for a living is wrong. He then confronts his weaknesses head on. Add to this the fact that everyone in the book is trying to kill him and you are in for the ride of your life.If you want to try something new and you are tired of all the J.R.R. Tolkien clones that make up epic fantasy today, give Steven Brust and the Vlad Taltos novels a shot. This is irreverent &quot;epic&quot; fantasy. And thank goodness for it.Note: I would start with the first Vlad Taltos novel, Taltos, and continue with Dragon, Yendi, Jhereg, Teckla, Phoenix, Athyra and Orca. That wasn't the order they were written in but it's the order in which they take place."},{"Title":"Phoenix","review":"Phoenix was originally intended to be the last volume of this series. Had Brust decided to stick with this decision (and I for one am glad that he did not), he could have retired from writing about Vlad with confidence and pride, because this is without doubt, hands down, no contest the best bloody book in the whole bloody series. The 5-star rating above is a gross understatement. From Vlad's stunning prison-break to the week-long battle through the streets of Adrilankha when the revolution finally breaks out for real, Phoenix never lets up. And neither does Vlad; he manages to bring down the wrath of almost everyone who could do him damage and then some. Also, the pain-wracked soul-searching he began in Teckla comes to a head as he realizes that the reasoning behind his racism, his vindictiveness, and perhaps his very life is deeply flawed. An utterly engrossing, thrilling read, this is perhaps Brust's best work to date."},{"Title":"Phoenix","review":"There's something about this book that puts it above the first four in the series. I don't know if it was the fact that Brust's writing became better (I didn't really notice anything different) or that Vlad becomes more of a dynamic character, but it was more enjoyable than the others.We finally get to see Vlad doing some real soul searching about what he does for a living. We also see more of the agony he is experiencing due to the fact that his marriage is falling apart. This makes Vlad a much more three dimensional character and more enjoyable to read. I also liked the fact that, towards the end of the book, we get to know his grandfather a little better. I'd love to see him get a bigger part in a future book.The adventure and suspense in this book have been turned up since the last one. I found myself unable to put the book down at night. I always wanted to see what happened next. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best book in the series so far."},{"Title":"Phoenix","review":"Each time I get a new installment of the Vlad Taltos series, I can hardly wait to get started, anticipating a fast-paced, clever and completely irreverent ride through a world very like our own, and yet so different from anything we know. _Phoenix_ did not let me down; in fact, this may just be the best book thus far the in series.Cornered and fighting for his life, Vlad half-heartedly calls upon his goddess, Verra, to save him. Much to his astonishment, she does, and in exchange for the rescue, asked him to perform a task for her. That singular task leads to catastrophe for the entire Empire, which in itself would be bad enough, but events revolving around the Teckla/Easterner revolution seem to have Vlad's life hanging by an unravelling thread. Brust skillfully reveals just enough of the plot to answer one question, while bringing several others to light.He also allows us a more intimate view of Vlad's inner life, as Vlad more seriously begins to question his profession and its associated ethics. He realizes that he may not, in fact, loathe the Dragaerans as much as he thinks he does, largely because every time he's in trouble, he turns to two of his closest friends, Morrolan and Aliera. These two Dragonlords are such interesting characters, and are always there to back up their short-lived, human friend for reasons that have yet to be fully revealed, I think.While all of this internal and external chaos is going on, Vlad must also cope with his marriage crashing down all around him, as he tries to save the woman he so desperately loves, but seems to have no use for him anymore. Fortunately, he has Loiosh and Rocza by his side for comfort, and we see a bit more of their respective personalities in this installment, as well as Vlad's Noish-pa, who is a delightful and welcome co-star in the story, rather than a brief cameo as he has been in the past.It's my understanding that this was intended to be the last Taltos book, and the ending would indicate this as well; however, I am greatly relieved that there are many books after this one, as I would hate to see this series end. There are so many questions to answer, and so many hugely varied directions Brust could take the characters, that it would seem to stave off the boredom some authors have set in after a few books in the same universe. I sincerely hope he continues to produce the series for many years; I would miss his detailed descriptions of flavors, aromas, actions and feelings as he weaves his clever tales. I would miss the subtle (and often overt) cynicism through which Vlad experiences the world that so closely mirrors my own. I would hate not knowing \\"what happened\\" to these characters who have become virtual companions in my brain - no no, I'm honestly not insane or completely pathetic, I swear! Brust simply does such a good job of bringing them to life, that they occasionally pop into my head to comment on one thing or another.[arching eyebrow]Ok, I can hear you out there, saying \\"Ooooooh boy, this chick's totally lost it. She needs a big, hot steaming mug of reality, and fast.\\" No really! They're just exceptionally vivid characters! I...hey...wait a minute! What're you doing with that funny white coat? I ... HEY!

He incorporates the suspense of Teckla minus the depressing overtone and the more on unbelievable aspects found in Taltos. And of course you get Loiosh's usual comic relief. It starts off with Vlad being saved by his demon-goddess, Verra (Example of the far-out stuff), and has to shine someone for her. It picks up from there. Brust really took his time on the descriptions and Vlad's thoughtshots, esp. in the segment when he is on Greeanare and hides in the tree. Many parts in the island scenes make you want to read on and on until the unexpected happens. You will be surprised at some of this stuff. It all comes down to an unprecedented climax in which Vlad must make a choice that could cost him his life. I'd call it the best in the series.*note: this takes place between Teckla and Athyra"},{"Title":"Phoenix","review":"The boock starts out with action, of course if you read the others this is a difference among the rest. It ends witha twist and left me hanging till Athyra came out."},{"Title":"Twig","review":"This is a simple book about a girl in a city who meets \\"Elf\\" and becomes small through his magic. She retains her \\"little girl\\" qualities while exploring the local natural history (including Elf's pet cockroach!) from the perspective of her new size. It is a fairly easy (though there are linguistic aspects that one might expect to find in a more advancedbook) episodic read, and it is enchantingly sweet and old-fasioned without being sentimental._Twig_ was the only book that kept my daughter happy when she was ill over Christmas. She smiled though her fever was high. She slept with the book beside her so she could read it when she awoke. The simple chapters reminded her of the joy and fun there is in the world."},{"Title":"Twig","review":"[...] Just expect Fairies and wonderlands to materialize in this book ...and they will!This is a wonderful classic children's book that never should have been allowed to go out of print! I read this each year to the delight of my fourth grade students from my old worn copies. The books I have belonged to my late great aunt Betty Holden, an elementary teacher in Palo Alto. She read it to me in the \`60s, since then it has been one of my favorite children's' books; (I am 47 now) She wrote a note in one that says the book would always remind her of a teacher of her own. This is real children's literature of rare and classic quality.Set in the early part of the century in the bare dirt back yard of a rundown inner city tenement, the happy, imaginative optimism of a little girl alone at play creates a world that is anything but dreary. We are introduced to the reality of Twig's little world through her point of view while she walks four flights down the back porch stairways of the building past each occupant and an active bird nest. The reader sees that this is where Twig collects the fodder of reality that she soon projects into her fantasy dreamland when she arrives on the ground to play. We can tell she idolizes the beauty of a young wife, shows respect and bemusement at the old spectacled landlord who gives her gum, etc.In the dirt of the back yard, she transforms a ripped tomato can, a dandelion, a gum wrapper, toothpaste tops, bottle caps, a trickle of water, the sparrow family, \\"Old Girl\\" the cat and \\"Old Boy\\" the ice-wagon horse into a marvelous imaginary realm of a setting in which to invite an elf named 'Elf' and a Fairy Queen. During the enchanted tale, Twig magically transforms to become one in size and spirit with her newfound imaginary friends, which of course, seem quite plausibly palpable by this point in the story. The writing is wonderful and so are the gorgeous, rich, sweet and tender illustrations that so seamlessly guide and enrich ones imagination in enhancing context to the story.This is an easy story for children to become absorbed with. It is written with a genuine childlike perspective. But there are also subtle and amusing social commentaries and some neat literary devices as well. Twig projects woes into Sparrows' life based upon marital difficulty she sees in the apartment, for instance. The book is sophisticated enough that one is aware of being able to read nuance into it on a number of levels. One inventive chapter goes off on a discouraging tangent, as one's imagination may, and so is repeated anew with the proper optimistic twists and ending that keep the story alive. I particularly like the stories' closure when; at the last possible moment she declines the opportunity to fly off with the fairies. It is here that we see, as the fairies flutter off quietly on the Royal Magical Cobb-Webb Kerchief, that Twig comes to terms with the fact that, after all, she is just a plain, ordinary little girl, who hears her mother calling. She was changed back.Readers return from the wonderland as Twig slowly climbs up the zigzag back porch apartment steps from the back yard. We are just as slowly reintroduced to her reality with short visitations at each floor with its occupants and their situations that the reader can now relate to the echoed personalities and behaviors projected into the fairy characters in the fantasy. The way the story brings the reader home in a satisfying circle as the reader is deposited home off the last page, is a 'perfectly lovely end'. \\"It is like waiting for the story to begin all over again!\\" Which it is sure to do many times if you read this book but once.This new edition has a lovely new introduction to it written in the style of the story by the author, who has since passed, in April 2001.Also recommended: Stuart Little, The BFG, The Wind in the Willows. A Childs's Prayer, particularly for its illustrations by Elizabeth Orton Jones."},{"Title":"Twig","review":"Twig was absolutely my favorite book as a child.It went out of print for a number of years. The children's books available now are wonderful, and many times more numerous than when I grew up, but it would have been a great loss to not reprint Twig for the 21st century. My six-year-old daughter and I have read it through several times.Twig is about how wonderful a little imagination and some ordinary objects and animals can be in creating a rather complex and marvelous fantasy world. What little girl would not love her own fairies? Twig is poor in worldly goods but very rich with creativity. I keep telling my kids that the best things in life are free; this book definitely is proof!!"},{"Title":"Twig","review":"Twig was my favorite book as a child, and one of my happiest childhood memories. I checked it out of the library so many times, that finally my parents bought me my own copy for my ninth Christmas. It is still one of my most treasured posessions.I could relate to Twig. We were both poor little city girls, who found enchantment with objects found in the backyard and our big imaginations. It truly shows that children do not need material objects to have fun, and that the simple things in life are the best.I enjoyed reading this book to my own little girls.

No, I didn't buy these books. Why? I already own them from my childhood some 50+ years ago. And I've already purchased them years ago for my granddaughters...paid a good price for them, too, as they hadn't been reissued and I searched high and low in order to get them as collector's items. Are they worth it? ABSOLUTELY. Elizabeth Orton Jones was born on \\"half-past-Christmas\\" (in her own words...and I won't tell you the year, but suffice it to say she's not a young woman). I last spoke with her and corresponded with her about eight years ago and she was kind enough to autograph all of her books for me. I asked her then about the possibility of her books being reissued and she laughed, saying they were too old fashioned. Well, I'm glad to see she was wrong. The people in the town she lives in (in New Hampshire) call her Twig and put on the play just about every year. Big Susan's actual dollhouse is in Highland Park, Illinois. Twig, \\"Twig,\\" and \\"Big Susan\\" will live forever. I salute you, Elizabeth Orton Jones...for these two books and the others you have written that have not yet been reissued.

It is a sweet, meaningful story, sprinkled with adorable pencil drawings, and made exciting with endearing characters. Elizabeth Orton Jones has succeeded in creating a book that little kids will not be bored with, but will still be able to grasp the important lessons Twig learns. Overall, it is a wonderful, whimsical story that will enchant both young and old."},{"Title":"Twig","review":"My six year old daughter who loves all things magical but nothing scary, just loved this book. Her little face had an ear-to-ear grin when Twig became small and especially when the fairy queen appeared.

It's a sweet story with basic, old-fashioned, comfortable characters."},{"Title":"Twig","review":"I searched high and low for this book, and the only copy I could find would have cost $250 because it was out of print.

I feel like I have hit the lottery today!"},{"Title":"Twig","review":"It's a wonderful story that I loved as a child, and I am now reading it, over and over, with my 4 year old daughter. It is a great book for kids who are old enough to start hearing longer stories and who are learning to read. It's about a little girl who obviously doesn't have a lot of things or money (reminds me of pictures of my mom from that time, she would have been about the right age) but does have loads of imagination to create her own little world... but still would never leave her own. I didn't like that about it when I was a kid, but as a mother I find that part very appealing! ..., but I wanted to point that out."},{"Title":"Twig","review":"A delightful story of a lonely little girl living in a city apartment, and where her imagination takes her.

While the tone of the book is a bit dated, it is still a delightful tale full of magic and imagination, silly names and sillier expressions that sent my girls into giggles every other page. It was a fun book to read aloud and especially fun that it induced so much laughter. The girls are off pretending they are Twig and Elf and making up stories that include all these characters. And the story ends with valuable messages: beauty is on the inside and it doesn't matter how old and plain your dress is, and that you can make your own magic by using your imagination. I did find some of the dialog to be tedious and repetitive but sometimes it had its charm. I would not consider this a great classic, worth of 5 stars so I'm only giving it 4. But it is worth the read and is a good one for younger kids just starting chapter books. Pictures happen on most pages and are sweet and add to the story."},{"Title":"Twig","review":"Wonderful heart-warming story. \\"Twig\\" was probably my all-time favorite book when I was a child.

It's about the wonderful imagination of a little girl living in a small city apartment, and the rich life she invents while playing in the confines of a baren back yard."},{"Title":"Twig","review":"A sweet little urban fairy story. I am disappointed with how sexist it is. The female main character sets up house with a male fairy, and she spends all her time arranging furniture and trying to get the male fairy to take care of the house with her. He, meanwhile, is extremely bored with housekeeping, and wanders off at every opportunity so he can study magic.Another sexist relationship in the book is between Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow. He is always gone on important matters (or unimportant, we aren't sure), while she tends the children and frets about her husband's whereabouts.Even the fairy queen is not a powerful woman. Her primary virtue is her pretty clothes and gracious manners, and she is followed around by an old male fairy who chastises her for making independent decisions and takes her home (like an errant teenager).Even though I liked the repetitive language (ideal for young children), creative storyline, and magic-in-every-day theme, I got rid of this book soon after I read it. I cannot justify instilling passive feminine stereotypes into my daughters. We will focus on fairy tales like Tatterhood and Maid of the North by Ethyl Johnston Phelps. And classic stories with strong female characters like Wizard of Oz and The Wind Boy."},{"Title":"Twig","review":"Twig was my most cherished book as a child growing up on the 3rd floor of an apartment facing a Twig like alley.

No credit is listed for an illustrator so perhaps the author did them herself? The drawings are mostly in black and white but a few are touched with color.The story is that of Twig, a little girl who meets a tiny boy in her backyard. Through magic she shrinks down to size of the boy named Elf. Elf is actually a Brownie who has flown in on the back of a sparrow. Twig and Elf set up housekeeping in an upturned tomato can and furnish it with a table (a thimble and a bottle top,) a mirror (a shiny gum wrapper) and a broom (a feather). I have to say that not a lot happens in this book. No violence or bloodshed, and not even any enemies for Twig and Elf to fight.

This book helps one understand the times and thoughts of Elbert Hubabrd - leaving his former life as a soap salesman, and forming a 1900's commune. But it dismisses the key encounters with William Morris and neglects the crafts Roycraft created. You are left with the PR he left and his words. Worthy of a read. Not worthy of this pioneer of the American arts and craft movement."},{"Title":"The Misunderstood Child: Understanding and Coping with Your Child's Learning Disabilities","review":"Throughout his book, Dr. Silver repeatedly challenges us to be &quot;informed consumers&quot; and an &quot;assertive advocate&quot; for our child. In the Preface, he sums up the entire focus of this book: &quot;You, as parents, play a crucial role in helping your child or adolescent deal with these disabilities. You must be an informed consumer, knowing all that is known about these problems. You must be an assertive advocate, constantly trying to find the programs your child needs in school, at home, or out of school. This book will help you become both.&quot;For me, as the parent of one child with ADHD, and another with an unidentified learning disorder, that has definitely been the case.While his book covers many different types of learning disorders, Dr. Silver devotes many sections to ADHD, which was why I was originally so interested in reading it. Also, considering that many children with ADHD have additional learning disorders, the detailed descriptions of the various disorders are helpful and enlightening. It also helps you realize how difficult it can be for a child who cannot learn and experience things in the manner most often used in our classrooms.This book outlines your role as a parent to be your child's advocate. Dr. Silver stresses that you must actively work with the schools while you INSIST on these rights. He includes an entire chapter that covers your child's legal rights. He walks you through the process of requesting an evaluation, through all the items that should be included in an IEP. In Chapter 11, he provides insight into what those cryptic numbers mean that you will see in the reports and evaluations that are done on your child. He provides detailed information so that you can question the conclusions reached, when you don't agree. Dr. Silver has also included Behavioral Management programs with examples of how to use it in your daily life as part of the ADHD treatment plan. As many of us already recognize, medication is certainly not enough.But as much time as he spends presenting the problems and challenges of learning disorders, the tone of his book is expressed here: &quot;You must learn as much as you can about the whole pattern that your child displays - the disabilities, of course, but also the abilities. What your child can do well, is just as important as what she or he cannot do because it is these strengths upon which you must build.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Misunderstood Child: Understanding and Coping with Your Child's Learning Disabilities","review":"Dr. Silver's book provides easily understood explanations of learning disabilities, attention disorders, and related emotional/psychological problems. This is a good book to get when you are just beginning to learn or suspect that your child is having problems at school because it gives a good overview of various disabilities, explains the special ed process, and encourages parents to become their child's most effective advocate. I particularly appreciate Dr. Silver's empathy and respect for our kids -- he reminds parents how hard the kids with differences have to work and how much they want to get things right. All in all, when I finished this book I had enough information to start asking questions at school and lots of hope and determination that my child would get the necessary help."},{"Title":"The Misunderstood Child: Understanding and Coping with Your Child's Learning Disabilities","review":"Dr. Silvers book is a wonderful source of information to those who may be starting out or to those who have had so many different opinions that they don't know where to start. It is very easy to understand and goes through all of the information that a parent would need from how to be an effective advocate for your child to how to being to find the proper help. It also helps to put into words things that a parent can't always describe. I also gives many good ideas on how to help the siblings of a behavior disturbed child how to deal with the extra attention parents must give them. I found it an excellent help with my 4 yo and allowed me to go to her Doctors with an accurate discription of her aliments."},{"Title":"The Misunderstood Child: Understanding and Coping with Your Child's Learning Disabilities","review":"I can see how this book could be very helpful to parentsof kids with ADHD.

It provided a thorough overview of how these conditions are evaluated and treated, and valuable advice for getting assistance for your child from his/her school. I also appreciated the author's obvious compassion for children who are having difficulties in school, and his insistence that the child's emotional issues (either caused by, or causing, the symptoms of ADHD) not be overlooked. Finally, unlike a lot of books about ADHD and learning disabilities, this book was mostly substantive information with very little fluff and filler. I would recommend this book to any parent in my situation."},{"Title":"The Misunderstood Child: Understanding and Coping with Your Child's Learning Disabilities","review":"I bought this book out of total desperation, and I laughed and cried my entire way through it.

There is no hocus-pocus, junk, or controversial ideas in this book, it is the right stuff to get you help for your child. If you can't get Dr. Silver in person, then this book is a good substitute. Through this book, I also discovered that I have had ADHD all of my life, and it was never diagnosed. It was like a lightbulb went on. When you finish this book, there will be no question if ADHD is the problem. Through this book, I am now working on getting help for my son and for myself.

But I would like to address a certain detail inaccuracy in the way he explains IQ scores:On Page 193 of the third edition, he says that \\"scores between 85 and 110 are considered to be within the average range.\\" Actually, for reporting purposes, 90-109 are considered Average. 80-89 is Low Average, and 110-119 is High Average. Then there are other classifications for scores below or above these levels.Another way of looking at \\"Average\\" is to broaden the range to one standard deviation below and one standard deviation above 100. This is 15 points each way. The Average range would be 85-115.So \\"Average\\" would be either 90-109, or 85-115; not 85-110.Also, the WISC is now in its 4th edition as of summer 2003. There are no longer Verbal IQ, Performance IQ and Full Scale IQ. Instead, there are four \\"indices\\" (plural of \\"index\\"): Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, Processing Speed. Plus the Full Scale IQ, which is roughly an averaging of the four indices.

Rood, building upon the foundations of W.R. Connor's 1984 THUCYDIDES and the work of Simon Hornblower, which are both scrupulously noted, applies the theoretical approach of narratology to Thucydides' history. In short, narratology, when applied to historical works, argues that we read the text not as an objective representation of past reality but as a rhetorical product. To this end, Rood and the narratologists suggest applying tools culled from the workshop of literary criticism to help explicate the text, e.g. focalization, temporal anachrony, etc.This is an obviously salutary approach, judging by the results. Many passages that have long frustrated critics have been addressed from fresh angles and the history as a whole has been given a new explanation. The theoretical approach will frustrate those who are used to more conventional approaches and the insistence on the non-objective status of historical texts is always a kind of heresy to some. But for those willing to accept (or overlook) these matters, there is much to admire in Rood's incisive and careful analyses."},{"Title":"Thucydides: Narrative and Explanation (Oxford Classical Monographs)","review":"As a relative new-comer to the delights of Thucydides I was at first a little in awe of the author's obvious scholarship. The book was rigorous and well-ordered, as I had expected, having heard much of Timothy Rood's abilities while at University. In particular, the areas of the book where Mr Rood moved from the specific to the general were a delight, and I hope that he should see fit to expand his horizons a little were he to author another work in this field. Chapter 5 of the book, where he animadverts to the inevitable tension between the narrative and dialogic elements of the \\"History\\", is particularly luminous. Areas that could have been explicated better include the bizarre episode involving the bathing of soldiers' feet in hot water, referred to in Chapter 7, something that has mystified Thucydides scholars for years, and the barely comprehensible references to drunkenness that pepper later parts of the \\"History\\". Aside from those few omissions and a litter of singular infelicities of expression in the last two chapters, the work is a numinous one, indispensable for all advanced students wishing to immerse themselves, to quote Gustave Sephier, in \\"the clamorous and vociferating uproar of Thucydidean narrative\\"."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Marek Halter, following what is quickly becoming a flood of biblical fiction, here begins what promises to be the first of a trilogy telling the stories of several women from ancient Israelite history. Halter, an able writer, seems particularly interested in the internal workings of these female characters, giving them a voice. As an undertaking this is worthwhile as it expands the text and offers an interesting view into these individuals inner lives.Some reviewers object to the licence Halter takes with Sarah's life, particularly as it relates to her being the daughter of a deposed king in Ur. While there exists no basis in the text for this view, beyond Sarah's original name of Sari, Halter generally makes it work. Moreover, his idea of making Sarah directly responsible for her own barrenness and using that as the central tension of the novel proves both interesting and gives the story considerable life. Too often in biblical fiction authors place too little control in the hands of their characters and too much in the hands of an unseen divinity.While I enjoyed that aspect of the novel, as well as the author's gift for incorperating archeological and anthrological details into the story, I found the novel fell short in a few ways. Most interesting and perplexing is the author's choice to place the bulk of the story before the birth of Issac. Halter can obviously do as he chooses in his own work, but I felt a bit cheated at not seeing enough of Sarah as mother.Nonetheless, Halter's prose remain contiunally excellent, particularly how he switches from the first to the third person almost seamlessly. Over all, an enjoyable and worth while read.That said, I would be remiss not to make a point regarding the issue of Sarah's relationship status as it relates to Abraham. While it is true that Abraham claims Sarah to be his half sister when he speaks to Abimelech, the text is silent when it comes to his veracity. Also, he does not make this same claim to Pharoh in the same instance. Moreover, the Abraham story mirrors a simmilar story when his son meets Abimelech and claims his wife as his sister. While the hebrew is somewhat ambiguous on the point, most Jewish cometators dating back centuries actually look to Genesis 12:29 to prove Sarah's father was Harran, making her Abraham's neice. Again, the text, however, remains unclear on the point."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"\\"Sarah\\" is the story of the famous prophet Abraham's wife, famously barren until old age when she gives birth to Isaac, leader of the Hebrews. Sarai is the beloved daughter of a lord of Ur, roughly located near modern day Bagdad. Sarai rather improbably escapes from a prearranged mariage, meets and falls in love with Abraham in a night, and years later escapes her role as a high priestess to join Abraham's tribe and wander until they find \\"Canaan.\\" Halter gives Sarah the mind and heart of a very 21st century woman, which drives her to express frustration when Abraham's mind veers more and more to the One True God, jealousy when Hagar bears Abraham's son, and coldness when a plan to outwit Pharoah in Egypt goes awry. The important thing is to suspend all disbelief when reading this story. It's pure and simple fiction, and highly improbable given the times and culture. I too read \\"Red Tent,\\" which was far better, and gave me a much more realistic feel for the cultures of the time."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I don't typically write reviews to compare one book to another, but since so many have already said, \\"If you loved The Red Tent, you'll enjoy Halter's Canaan Trilogy.\\" I'm not disagreeing with that statement, but Sarah lacks the emotional depth and heart of Diamant's epic.We meet Sarai as a child on the brink of womanhood, and the first half of the book observes her luxurious life in the city of Ur and her first encounter with Abram. The second half deals with her marriage to Abram, his developing relationship with Yhwh, and their travels throughout Canaan. The epilogue quickly covers the latter part of her life after Isaac is born and the Covenant, etc. It seems like Halter breezes past what could possibly be the most significant aspect of Abraham and Sarah's relationship with God.However, the early parts of the narrative do shape who Sarai becomes as a woman and wife. She is often stubborn and jealous, and her feelings toward her husband, her life, and mostly her \\"miraculous beauty\\" seem to go from one extreme to another. She is a complex woman who has had to deal with difficult decisions throughout her life, and the burden of being barren and beautiful.Overall, it was an enjoyable read filled with detail and atmosphere. I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy, but The Red Tent will always remain the epitome of Old Testament fiction in my mind.To see my opinion of the entire trilogy, view my review of Lilah."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I had read the Red Tent and loved it.This book didn't quite live up to that standard, but was interesting fiction nonetheless.

If you like Romance Novels, you will like this adventure packed, sexually broad novel. In this version, however, the story of Sarah is pointless."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was better than I expected it to be, but then again I was not expecting all that much. Like other reviewers have noted, this is not a factual read. It is what I like to call a \\"theological fantasy\\". Characters are based on real individuals and events albeit loosely at times. The story is told from Sarah's perspective and the male author does a very good job using the feminine voice. I'll be perfectly honest in letting you know that I did not even know that it was a male author until I had finished the book - I simply had not read the author bio nor had I noticed his picture on the book jacket. The only thing that I really did not like too much about this book was that the author -at times - made Sarah seem incredibly self centered and vain (bordering on conceited). Worth taking out of the library if you are interested theological fantasy."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was a bit skeptical about whether I would enjoy a novel based on one of the characters of the Bible, but I was really moved by Sarah's story. The author, Marek Halter, beautifully recreates the world of the ancient people of Sumeria, including Sarah and her family. A beautiful young girl, Sarah panics and refuses to marry the man her father has chosen for her. A chance encounter leads her to Abraham, a young man from a tribe of nomads who sculpt the idols that Sarah's people worship. Although she is drawn to him, they do not consummate their relationship until several years later, when Abraham returns to Sumeria to find that the girl he once knew is now the high priestess of Ishtar and the most powerful woman in her society. But Sarah has a premonition, and feels called to leave her life of great luxury in Ishtar's temple and join Abraham and his tribe.Abraham claims that God speaks to him, although no one else can hear it, and little by little, his people come to believe his prophecies. Sarah, however, remains skeptical, and it is only after many years that God reveals himself to her as well, and brings her the same power and grace as her husband. She has many adventures along the way, including a marvelous episode with the Pharoah, which read like a great scene from a movie.This is a novel about an amazing woman, and it truly takes you back in time to the long-ago world that she lived in. It also gives you some clues to how and why our spiritual way of thinking came to be, although it's not a book about religion at all. This was a very thought-provoking read and an entertaining one as well, like watching a good epic mini-series with a female hero. I highly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is an interesting tale--I read through it slow and steady, never really that excited about it but a little curious. I actually bought the less clean version than the rest of the book club--which was embarressing! So be careful which one you get. This version is very, very sexual and graphic--which is just not needed because the story line itself is good."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"My personal preference is that the storyline would have more closely followed the biblical version, but I enjoyed this story. Sarah seemed to be, in some ways, portrayed much more selfish than I have always imagined her to be. It did stretch my imagination to see her in other ways. I'm not certain whether I would recommend to others or not..."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is a beautifully written and rich account of the author's impression of the life of Sarai, the matriarch of the Nation of Israel.It begin's with her initiation at the age of twelve in the city of Ur, where she is the beautiful daughter of a wealthy nobleman ,after her 'first blood'. She is then given as a bride to a brutal Chaldean nobleman, and flees from his clutches, where she encounters Abram, a young and dashing man from a nomadic tribe near Ur. She is brought home by her father's guards in disgrace, and later takes herbs from a local witch, which destroys her fertility.She is ordained as a temple priestess before being rescued by Abram, and becomes his wife, journeying with him and his clan to Harran, in modern day Turkey, to Canaan (Israel), and a sojourn in Egypt.Her beauty does not fade after many years, but she is embittered by her failure to bare children.Later we are shown her closeness to her Egyptian handmaiden, Hagar, who she later shows jealousy towards, when Hagar gives birth to Ishmail.The novel introduces new elements such as the lust for Sarai of Abram's nephew Lot, and Sarai's dislike for Abram's servant, Eliezer of Damascus.The end, from Sarah's miraculous birth of Isaac, until her last days, is rather rushed.The nudity and erotica was tastefully done and I had no problem with it.As a believing Jew, I can forgive all of the departures from the Biblical narrative (of which there are many) as artistic license, except for the theme that Yahweh was only Abram's G-D and not Sarai's which left me feeling uncomfortable, because acknowledging that Sarai/Sarah was a great prophetess of Yahweh, would have added and not taken away from the narrative.I don't know why otherwise brilliantly written Biblical-based fiction, such as this novel, and Howard Fast's 'Moses Prince of Egypt' seem to deny the devout steadfastness of the early Hebrews to monotheism and the worship of Yahweh.This element is frustrating and somewhat spoils otherwise beautiful writing. It is possible to produce a beautiful, vibrant and rich novel, and fill in the gaps, without taking away from the basic accounts given of Biblical history."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was wonderfull!! alot like the Red Tent style. I couldn't put this book down and was sad to see it end."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"\\"Sarah\\" was a good novel. I've read a few of Halter's other books, and he will never quite be to par with a \\"celebrated\\" author, but he writed a good novel. Sarah had a few anachronisms I did not care for. Halter tried to create ancient Canaan and Ur in his book, which came out ok. He needed to do a bit more historical research to bring me into an ancient city and envelop me in its culture. It's very easy to get through, and at many times, it was hard to put down. The narration held my attention well, but was not particularly captivating. We will never find a book as good as \\"The Red Tent\\", and this is definitly not one, but it is good, and unless you are a very discriminating reader, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Maybe because I finished reading Dorothy Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles just before reading \\"Sarah\\". The comparison between these two historical fiction writers is night and day. Dunnett is truly a historical writer. Halter is not. Halter has a finite list of words he (she?) employs, whilst Dunnett's is limitless and far more entertaining.I feel the author didn't develop the characters well (I couldn't ever really like Sarah and the author never adequately explained to my why Abraham loved her), paint a vivid historical picture for me or accomplish much with this story.Halter does not give the reader a good time frame. He uses phrases like \\"some time later\\". But does that mean some years, seasons, months, weeks, days, or hours? It bothered me that I could not tell what kind of time lapse was occuring.Don't bother spending your money on this book. It's not worth it. Check it out at the library if you feel you must read it."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Though I no longer consider myself a Christian, I've read quite a few biblical adaptations. Like Anita Diamant's The Red Tent and Orson Scott Card's Women of Genesis series. But this is a serious disappointment as well as an all-round bad novel. Give it a miss and don't worry about the others in the series either.It begins rather auspiciously, with Sarah being raised as a king's daughter in the city of Ur, then going on to become a priestess and running away to get married to Abram....yeah. It makes very little sense, particularly how Abram and his brother manage to get into the temple and steal away Sarai so she can get married and live outside the city with the dirt and filth of animals.But perhaps the most absurd thing about this novel is the way Sarah's inability to concieve is portrayed. It appears that Sarai made some sort of deal with God that she would remain young and beautiful but she would be unable to concieve. This has some rather strange consequences, such as when Abram walks around an old doddering man with a woman who appears young enough to be his great grandaughter. And there's also when Lot grows up and tries to make out with Aunt Sarah, who has been like a mother to him.This is taken to it's logical conclusion, sort of, when Sarah tells God that she would rather have children that be beautiful, and her youth falls away in what was probably meant to be a moving scene but instead was rather disgusting.Orson Scott Card does a much, much better job with Sarah in his novel, despite the fact of the apocraphal Morman text in the first chapters."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love historical fiction about strong women. This book met my high standard. I was familiar with the biblical story of Sarah and was pleased to have a fictional picture of her in this book. Definately along the lines with \\" The Red Tent\\"."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Barbara Cartland writes The Red Tent. I would put this book in the romantic fiction genre rather than literary. The author attempts to wrap a bodice-ripper in the robes of the Bible in order to ride coat-tails of better written creative fiction based on Biblical characters. Use of sexual words are gratuitous and, even worse, fail at being stimulating. It's a nice story but not gripping. I loved The Red Tent, but did not finish this book."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Although the book \\"Sarah\\" and the other two books of the Canaan Trilogy are historical fiction, they are great.

The blurb on the inside cover intrigued me, so i checked it out from the library.I'm not even going to get into the biblicial inaccuracies here. I'm more concerned with the fact that the store seems to center around Sarah's continued beauty despite the passage of time, almost like God takes her fertility, but lets her keep her beauty. Apparently it's so stunning that even her adopted son tries to force himself on her.The story was just flat. There was just not enough insight into Abraham and his belief in God, and Sarah's lack of faith in him(as the bible would have it). I did not feel for the character's. The character i did feel for was Hagar, being forced out after Isaac is born.Just not interesting."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Most people already know the tale, and it is hard to write down what has not already been said. But I will say:This is the story of Sarai, the daughter of a prominent lord of Ur. Betrothed to a man she does not know, Sarai flees. After she is returned home, she slathers on an herb that makes her forever sterile, and becomes a priestess of Ishtar. In time she meets her childhood \\"crush\\" and runs away with him. Our new \\"Sarah\\" shortly becomes alone, as Abram leaves to set out for a new land in the name of his God. The characters are anything but perfect, and more respectable because.I enjoyed this story, despite some of the reviews I had read. Perhaps it is not historically truthful to the tale of Abraham and Sarah, but then again, some people don't believe the Bible in the first place, so who really knows? It's interesting enough just to hear the experiences of these individual icons, and relive their fates and trials as lovers and confidants. This book was not hard to finish, nor hard to read. There is no \\"confusing\\" religious aspects or boring side stories. It is all straight and to the point: the creation of Christianity through the eyes of a doting beauty on her prolific husband. And it's done in such a way where you don't care if Abram's God prevails, or if they make believers of the Egyptians or Sumerians. You just want Sarah to be happy.And I really love the \\"complete distortion of facts\\" review. No one made you read this book, so don't act like it was written to personally offend you and your beliefs."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A truly indulgent read for anyone interested in Biblical History (Fictional) from a feminine standpoint.The tale of Sarah; originally Sarai of Ur, begins when she is thrown into an arranged marriage; right after she is introduced to womanhood. A defiant and highly independant child, the thought of being handed over to a stranger by her Father terrifies her. Sarah sculpts her own destiny from there on and begins a bold journey into new lands with a new people and above all a new \\"One God\\". Sarah's story provoked a great deal of basic empathy from me, while keeping me up after my curfew to read just one more page :).I wished that the conclusion of the story hadn't been so rushed, after much detail and imagination went into the main body of the story, however it is a good excuse to read more.The strength of Marek's writing stirred something deep down inside me and has inspired me to investigate more books about the old ways, and how religions came to be in our world.A guaranteed inspirational read :)."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I hate the idea that really &quot;literary&quot; novels have to be hard to read, so I applaud Marek Halter and his publisher for bringing out a novel that's thoughtful and well-written and yet also entertaining and vivid. The heroine of this novel, Sarah, is the Sarah of the Old Testament, but she comes across not as a one-dimensional religious figure but as a bold, highly intelligent woman whose beauty is as much a curse as a blessing. Her relationship with Abraham and his family (whom she joins after leaving a life of great wealth in her home city) has the feeling of real family life, with all its conflicts, and while Sarah is not always perfect--she can be jealous, doubting, vain and despairing--you always empathize with her and keep rooting for her.This is a very good novel to share with female friends and discuss in book groups. If you're into the Bible, you'll enjoy reading an expanded and vivid version of the story of this great matriarch. If you're a secular reader, this book is just as entertainig as any finely written historical novel, with an unusually exotic setting and compelling characters."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Anyone expecting to find the biblical Sarah in this novel or even the imaginative elaborations that the rabbis placed in Midrashim, will be disappointed, because everything about Sarah in this tale are not in these documents. This does not hurt the Halter version in any way. His notion of Sarah's personality and how she may have lived and acted is interesting.We are introduced to Sarah, or actually Sarai, as she was known in her youth, for the first time in the Bible when Scripture says that her husband Abraham, called Abram at the time, began a journey toward the land that God would show him, which later turned out to be Canaan, now called Israel. The Bible says that he took his wife Sarai with him, but nothing more is told about her at this time. The rabbis debate exactly when the event occurred, but virtually all agree that it was when Abram was 70 or 75 years old. This would make Sarai, who the Bible states was ten years his junior, 60 or 65. The first incident when Sarai is described is when the Bible states that she was barren and she gave her husband her maid Hagar so that he could have a child through her. Traditional chronology places this event when Sarai was about 75 years old.Halter begins his tale when Sarai first began to menstruate, when she was twelve, when her father decides to have her married. Sarai does not want to marry the man her father chose. Halter introduces Abram during the same year, and there is love at first sight. Sarai's father and brother make sure that Sarai will not marry Abram and she is forced to become a dancing pagan priestess for some years. Abram returns, helps her escape, and takes her as his wife.Halter describes Sarai as a strong willed woman. Her relationship with Abram is ideal, although she does not think that God is speaking to him and uses an idol. The couple has marital difficulties when she gives her maid Hagar to Abram.Halter's rewriting the biblical tale of the near sacrifice of their son Isaac is also interesting. According to Scripture, Sarah, as she was then called, did not know that Abraham was taking Isaac to sacrifice him to God, and an angel stopped him from doing so. Halter writes that Sarah saw her husband leaving their tent with Isaac, figured out what he was up to, followed them unobserved from a distance, and she, not an angel, stopped her husband from killing their son."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed Sarah for the majority of the book, but I am surprised at the people who call her a heroine or a \\"partner\\" to Abraham. In this story, the character of Abraham continually uses his wife to serve himself and his own purposes. Toward the end, he never acknowledges her agony or struggle as being brought on by her love for him in the first place. I felt the story was incomplete and didn't do justice to her struggle."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Biblical fiction doesn't get much better than this engrossing tale of Sarah, the wife of Abraham and the mother of the Israelite nation. For people of many faiths, Sarah is a tantalizing figure, and Marek Halter brings her vividly to life in this colorful portrait.As with Anita Diamant's THE RED TENT, Halter uses the image of menstruation or \\"bridal blood\\" as the axis around which the story revolves. After a brief prologue, the story opens as Sarai (her name before God changed it to Sarah) wakes to find she has begun menstruating. Although prepared for it by her relatives, Sarai despairs because in her home culture of Ur, a girl becomes a bride after her first period.On her wedding night, sensing that her prospective bridegroom is wildly attractive yet desperately cruel, she flees the festivities to the outskirts of town. Muddy and disheveled, she meets the young Abram (later renamed Abraham), with whom she finds an instant chemistry. Discovered, Sarai returns in disgrace to her father's house for several months. Fearing becoming betrothed again, she resorts to the herbs of a local witch, dosing herself and becoming infertile. Since she no longer menstruates, she is chosen to become a high priestess. Blood continues to be a motif through the endless sacrifices made to the gods of Ur.Several years later Abram returns and Sarai escapes again, this time to marry him. Abram, interestingly portrayed as a partner with his family in making household gods, hears a voice from \\"The One God\\" that calls him to begin a journey of whose end he is unsure. With him is his nephew, the orphaned Lot, who develops a rather incestuous, unhealthy fascination with his foster-mother Sarai (a good illustration of Halter liberally adapting the biblical story to provide more intrigue).In a time when women were valued for the number of sons they could produce, Sarai mourns her infertility, but Abram assures her of his love. Strangely, as Sarai ages, her beauty remains unmarred by the passage of time. This is a rather spooky and fantastic addition to the story by Halter: \\"The weight of this silent miracle, though at first it delighted her, was beginning to terrify Sarai herself.\\" Her beauty leads to a plot development straight out of the biblical text, when the couple and their entourage pass through Egypt, and Abraham, fearing for his life, passes Sarai off as his sister. In some steamy passages, Pharoah takes her to bed. She is returned to Abraham after Pharoah dreams that God wreaks havoc on him (another liberty with the scriptural text) and relationships between Abram and Sarai are strained for some time afterwards.Abram's eventual desire for a child culminates in several tense plot developments that readers familiar with the Old Testament account will recognize. Blood continues to be a motif throughout the book, culminating in the tense scene where Abraham takes their only son Isaac to sacrifice him to God. Sarai, now Sarah, observing the scene, pleads with God for her son's life --- and Abraham stays his hand.Halter writes good descriptions of the time, including food, geographic settings, and the various clothing worn by the characters. Unlike many more conservative biblical novels (think the wonderfully nuanced portrayals by Francine Rivers's \\"Lineage of Grace\\" series), Halter is frank in his depictions of the sexual attraction between the two, and in his portrayals of sex between various characters throughout the book.This is the first book in The Canaan Trilogy, exploring the lives of biblical women through fiction (the second, ZIPPORAH, looks at the little-known life of the wife of Moses). Book groups will welcome the reading group guide, included at the end.--- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

As I started to read this I thought maybe the author had done some research on the life of Sarah, since I was only familiar with her life after being married to Abraham, and was astonished at his writings of her life as a child. I decided to continue with the book to allow the author to show what he truly knew about scripture and was thankful that I had studied Genesis myself. All I can say is that this is truly a Fiction book and read actual fact on the truth of Abram and Sarai in the Scriptures.

The day before I read the &quot;Red Tent&quot;. If you are searching for a historically accurate portrayal of the story of Sarah and Abraham you won't find it here. What you will find is an entertaining historical novel focusing on the women in biblical times. The male author does a really good job (contrary to one reviewers opinion) of writing in a famale voice. I felt he understood the trials and tribulations of women at that time very well. This book is about Sarah so to say it would have been better if it had been written about another character is ludicrous. The ongoing debate between reviewers about the relationship between Sarah and Abraham is also ludicrous given that there is no way to know exactly if they were related or not. The Bible is filled with historical inaccuracies and exaggerations as it was written by men who had an agenda of their very own to protect. The point I'm trying to make here is that this is a fictionalized version of the story of Sarah and Abraham. It is enjoyable, fast paced and gives an overview of life at that time. If you are looking for biblical truths you won't find it here and no amount of arguing will change that."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel--it's not only entertaining as an afternoon read, it gives the reader a lot to think about without ever being didactic.Ignore the reviewers who argue over whether Sarah was Abraham's sister (they had a child together, so I'm guessing that unless the Bible sanctions incest, they were not. And honestly people, did you even bother to READ the book?)This is a very well-written book that takes a look at the life and times of an influential woman, without ever losing sight of her essential humanity and the beauty of her spirit. Sarah's constant wrangling with God's will and with whether or not to believe in an invisible God speaks a great deal to what all of us deal with in our own lives, even if we don't go to church or synagogue regularly. It's also a terrific love story between a very intelligent, mystical, headstrong man, Abraham, and his bold, intelligent, practical wife, Sarah. I am glad to see a book that celebrates the love a man can have for a woman who is not only beautiful, but who challenges his worldviews and acts as a total partner with him in his journey to find God. I highly recomment this book to anyone who likes a good novel, especially a historical one."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"There are so many \\"stories from the Bible\\" novels out there right now, and I have read most of them, but Sarah really stands out from the crowd, and while it's based in the Biblical story, it never hits you over the head with religious dogma.Sarah is really the story of the journey of Sarai from a pampered daughter of a rich lord to the wife of the nomadic prophet Abraham of the book of Genesis. She's known for her beauty, but is remarkably gutsy and intelligent, and acts as a full partner to the charismatic and determined Abraham. There's a wonderful love story to be found in these pages, the love of two bold and adventurous people who risk everything for each other and for what they believe in.The descriptions in this book are marvellous, from the opening pages in the great Babylonian city of Ur to the palaces of the Pharaoah and the wide open fields of Canaan. The author has a talent for bringing places and people to life without loading down his work with lots of adjectives and flights of fancy--all the images are vivid and real, and it makes for a great \\"curl up and enjoy\\" kind of read."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book cover caught my eye and the quote on the cover comparing it to The Red Tent convinced me to buy it. I too read this book in 24 hours, not because it was engrossing but because it seemed to lack substance and depth. The problem has nothing to do with the fact that it was biblically inaccurate; The Red Tent was not very accurate either starting with the Leah character whose eyes, according to the old testament, were her best feature, not an abomination. It was the fact that the plot focused almost entirely on Sarai's beauty and her lamentations of all the hardships it cost her. The plot was very underdeveloped and full of holes. The Sarai character came across as incredibly vain and was not very endearing. There were also not a lot of details about the setting. There was a lot of mention of various gods but not a lot a lot about the culture it seemed. What I liked most about The Red Tent was the lush detail and the sense of a world come alive. All the small things from the preparation of meals to the varying tasted of the different kinds of beer served to the men really drew you into the story. It elicited an emotional response from me where as Sarah did not. If I had not read The Red Tent a couple times before I read Sarah maybe I would have enjoyed it more, but as it stands, this book came across more as a fluffy romance novel than a piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the read of \\"Sarah\\" by Marek Halter. Based on the Bible story of Abraham, who through the miracle of God's voice, led the Hebrews through years of wandering the desert and the trials and tribulations they faced. This novel is told though not through the eyes of Abraham, but through the eyes of his wife Sarai(Sarah), who's inner strength and powerful wisdom may have been the inspiration of countless generations to follow.In days of long ago, in times of wondrous miracles, and beliefs in pleasing the Gods, and when women were not treated as highly as men, Sarai, the daughter of a wealthy man was destined to marry the man picked for her by her father. At only 12, she was the apple of her father's eye for the beauty she was. But there was more to Sarai then just her beauty. After being subjected to a humiliating bathing ritual, in front of her intended husband, Sarai, perhaps the first to defy her father runs off to the town below her luxurious home, and meets Abram, a man who in class is below the standards set by Sarai's family,but one who will dominate her thoughts for years to come. She also drinks a potion that will make her barren and unwanted by the man her father has chosen.Years later, she has grown into a woman of unmatched beauty and considered a High Priestess. One that has power to bless the men going off to war. Once again Abram comes into her life, and she leaves her people to share a life with him. A life of wandering and miracles.The story follows the lives of Sarah and Abraham(names God has given them),their great love for each other and others such as Lot , Eliezer and Hagar. How Abraham's followers put their complete faith in him even through the toughest of times. And Sarah although a tower of strength and miracle of nature(with beauty never fading), Halter gives her a very human side as well, sometimes with anger or jealousy. Her journeys take her from riches to rags to riches and back again.The book is a fast and enjoyable read. Sarah's story was that of a woman to lead and to be admired. I thought there were many instances that although took place and were specific to ancient times, could be made into a story for modern times. Times change, but people are people. It(paperback edition) also has a Q & A with the Author, and a guide for group discussion. This book is the first of a trilogy of novels based on women from the bible, followed by \\"Zipporah\\", and \\"Lilah\\". After reading this one, I'll say that although based on stories from the Bible, these are no Sunday School lessons. The material is quite adult, akin to a romance novel. Also included in the book is a nice map to follow the long journeys.Enjoy the read.....Lauriealso recommended:ECHOESSemele: A NovelEthan Frome"},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Marek Halter's SARAH is already a bestseller in France and has been translated into ten languages. The debut of SARAH in the United States will lend credence to Halter's sensitive treatment of women in the Bible. His plans for the two subsequent books in the trilogy are the stories of Zipporah and Lilah, lesser known than Sarah, wife of Abraham, but with tremendous impact on the shaping of society.SARAH is the story of civilization's first rebellious teenager who became one of the world's most powerful women. An interview with the author reveals that he sees his women as those \\"beside,\\" not \\"behind\\" great men. The book emphasizes Sarah's working side by side with Abraham to create a life filled with his religious beliefs. Sarah was not a believer in Abraham's God until late, after her early mistakes came back to haunt her unfulfilled life.SARAH begins in the region now known as Iraq, the cradle of history, between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. The region was then known as Sumeria and the city-state where Sarai lived was known as Ur. She is the daughter of a powerful lord of Ur, a beautiful child who comes to womanhood in the first chapter. Her father arranges a marriage with a suitable man when she is twelve years old. The young girl is terrified of the prospects of the marriage bed and flees. Overnight, she runs from safety in the walled city to unknown terrors beyond it. On a riverbank she meets Abram, a poor but exotic member of a nomadic tribe. She spends the night with him and longs for his kiss. But soldiers discover her in the morning and return her to her father's house.Halter has a unique way of entering his heroine's mindset and allowing the reader to see and feel the turmoil swimming in her head. Sarai's beauty is the quality that sets her apart from other women and allows her to once again return to family's favor. But her fate rests solely with her father. He again arranges a marriage, not as opulent with preparation as the first. Sarai is terrified. She cannot erase the memory of her night with the young nomad, Abram. Terrified, she sneaks away, buys a powerful potion from a witch and drinks it. She has made herself barren, unfit to wed. She becomes the powerful priestess of the god, Ishtar, idolized by residents of the entire city. During this period she meets Abram for the second time and follows her heart to remain with him.The Bible has inspired Halter with stories of its feminine heroines. He feels that women were at times the true founders of world history. He takes liberty with Sarai's life, introducing stories about her that cannot be documented. But the sensual, exotic role she plays in Abram's story is one of both support and leadership. Aloof at times, her beauty both enhances and betrays her power in her newfound home. She has qualities that all humankind possesses: tenderness, love, jealousy, self-loathing, self-servitude, kindness and leadership. Sarai becomes Sarah, in final recognition of her husband's one God.SARAH is the story of a modern woman, one who learns and profits from her mistakes. From her experiences, she is able to lend strength to the others in her care. This is a story of desire, intense emotion and consequences of sins committed to justify those feelings. I look forward to reading the second and third books in the Canaan Trilogy. Halter's message is one of hope for future generations through reflections upon a rich past.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad"},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was so disappointed by this book. I read a review somewhere that said if you liked the Red Tent you will love Sarah. I cannot disagree more. The book was just flat. The characters were not well developed and the plot dragged. There was so much made of Sarah's beauty it was daunting to get through the chapters. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I read the book last night in about four hours. It was well-written enough that I wanted to see what happened next, and after finishing Lawrence's Women in Love, this was a welcome break.It's a quick and entertaining read, but do not expect it to bring anything new to the table. This type of story has been written many times before in historical fiction, both biblical and general, including perhaps most famously The Red Tent. Also, you might be interested in reading James Michener's The Source since that book addresses the changing religions and their development in the same general area.There was much more time and detail focused on Sarai's childhood, and early adulthood. It is not until about halfway through the novel that Abram leaves his father's tribe, and starts his wanderings westward. Their actual marriage could have been developed a bit more, since they don't actually seem to interact that much as a couple outside of sex (for example, in the later parts of the novel, Abram and Sarai go for long periods without speaking).That said, as long as it is only seen as a quick,easy, fun read, the novel delivers and satisfies."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The story was good, but I think the English translation leaves much to be desired. The wording is very simple at times, and the descriptions are just not that imaginative. I found some glaring typos in the paperback edition. Furthermore, (I'm nit-picking a little, I know) \\"the small of her back\\" was way overused, and the phrase has lost all of its romantic power for me now.Like I said, the story was good, but I was expecting (as mentioned on the cover) that this book would be similar to the Red Tent (which I loved). Plain and simple: There are similarities between the two books, but Sarah doesn't have the same language and descriptions."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"While I do agree with the fellow reviewer who found this book hard to finish, I feel as though I should point out one thing. It is fiction written for fictions sake. I highly enjoyed The Red Tent but found The Gilded Chamber boring. With Sarah I just didn't enjoy the writing style. Fiction should be for story telling, if you want fact go for a biblical studies book. Personaly I just want a well told tale, but did not find it in this book. Seemed choppy and hard to follow."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Sarai was born to one of the great lords of Ur. Hers was a life filled with wealth and beauty until the fateful day when she became a woman. Suddenly, she was expected to marry a man she'd never met and serve him as a virtual slave, his every whim her command. It was not to be borne!Sarai flees her father's house and plunges into the countryside, where she stumbles across Abram, a simple man to whom she is strangely drawn. Although Sarai is caught and returned to her father, she takes a concoction rendering her barren. Her unique states propels her life along a different course and she becomes a priestess of Ishtar, Ur's goddess of war.Once more, Abram enters her life and Sarai joins Abram at last, becoming his wife. Although the young couple seems happy enough, Sarai remains barren and no child is born to them. Sarai offers Abram her handmaid, Hagar, to give him the son he so desperately wants. A quarrel eventually breaks out between the two women, as they compete for position in Abram's world.Told from the point of view of Sarai herself, this book is a unique glimpse into what life in Biblical times might have been like. At times, the story is raw and brutally realistic and at others, Halter's words create visions of inspiration for the faithful. Well written with great characterizations."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The book read well however I felt it was too fictional. I love historical novels and read them all the time. I felt that the author took too much creative license.It would have been nice to see some afterward regarding what could and could not be historical.

The writer takes lots of license in his story line, incorporating Biblical history only enough to make it relevant. A lot of Sarah's background is assumed-which is expected somewhat because the Bible does not spell out a lot-but key facts are left out..such as the fact the the Bible says Sarah and Abram were half-siblings.It's an easy read, containing more sexuality than might be desired, but it keeps your attention. Book one of a trilogy. I hope the other two have more facts in them."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I wish I could give SARAH 3 and 1/2 stars.It has a promising start, good middle, and a bad ending. It's too rushed.The author does a good job \\"recreating\\" Sarah. She is a complicated, real, well thought out character. Abraham, on the other hand, is not a likeable at ALL. I thought he seemed like a real jerk. But the depiction of him seems real, and despite his self centered jerkiness, it makes for interesting biblical fiction, but I can see how this might turn off some readers.The book is somewhat comparable to THE RED TENT. Though THE RED TENT is sooooooo much better. If you loved THE RED TENT, you will find SARAH only a wee bit satisying."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book is a great piece of historical fiction. Some reviewers seem concerned about possible historical inaccuracies, but historical fiction is just that - fiction! The author did a great job of telling his interpretation of the story behind the woman in the Bible. I found it entertaining, heart-wrenching, and very real. Side note: as a Christian, I wasn't offended by way the author treated the Biblical story of Sarah. There's a lot we don't know about Sarah from the Bible, so his story is as good as any other as far as I'm concerned. But I would echo some of the reader's concerns about some graphic passages in the book; the sexual nature of some of the chapters makes this book inappropriate for young readers and may offend some Christian readers."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was a great woman perspective. I was amazed to find out that the author was a man. I really enjoyed Sarah's version."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is the first historical / bibilical novel I have read in awhile. I think the last one that I really read was \\"The Red Tent\\" by Anita Diamante about Dinah and I had loved that one novel so much that I actually dug up a copy of the bible to find that one small passage where Dinah is mentioned.This book was similar to that one in so many ways. Sarah (Sarai) is quite a major character in the Old Testament but is portrayed as quite a shallow character. This novel by Marek Halter takes a little artistic licensing and delves into her character. We see a probable history of her life in Ur, an account of her decisions, the hows and whys she did things the way that we see her doing them in the Bible.Mr. Halter fills in the gaps in her life with rich period details and made me empathize completely with the character I used to feel apathetic about. After all, most of us probably only remember the bad things about Sarah: sleeping with Pharaoh, casting off her handmaid Hagar, and doubting Abraham and God when he tells her she will finally have a son. Yes those things happened in the Bible but like so much else in life there is always a reason and most people don't set out to do wrong intentionally.This is an excellent book for those who want to dig a little deeper in the Bible and that era."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As aforementioned, this story is best if you suspend all disbelief.

In it we are able to glimpse a small piece of culture from that part of human history. I read this several years ago and am now reading it in a book club I have in a women's group at the church where I pastor."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Marek Halter's \\"Sarah\\" is based upon the well-known story of the wife of Abraham, father of both the Islam and Jewish races. Up until the very end of this novel, Halter succeeds in \\"fleshing\\" out the story of these two Qu'ran and Old Testament personages, bringing them to life along with that of their distinctly ancient Middle Eastern environment. Unfortunately he choses to frame his otherwise third person voice with a soliloquy spoken by Sarah herself in the beginning and ending of the novel which confuses the entire mood of the tale and makes the conclusion seem extremely rushed and almost trite.If only Halter had stuck to the pace and third person narrative. Instead, as the portion of Sarai's story begins to follow the more familiar Biblical story from Genesis, Halter uses Sarah as she awaits her death as a first person narrator looking back over what transpired with Hagar, Ishmael, and even Isaac with the quickening speed of a snowball gathering momentum on its way downhill. All this in just a few pages! In a real sense, Halter cheats the reader of all the emotions and nuances that this part of the story most definitely should include. He doesn't live up to his promise--he made his young Sarai too believable and then abandons her in the bullrushes. Perhaps after all the hard work he did in crafting the more detailed story of the younger Sarai, he realized that if he kept up his pace, his novel would be three times its size.Nonetheless, the novel without the narration of the older Sarah works very well. The alien idea of the Bride Blood is as compelling as the mysteries unfolded inThe Red Tent: A Noveland makes for a great starting point. In fact, the attractive cover of the book --a detail of an Orientalist oil by 19th century British painter William Clarke Wontner-- immediately conjures up a valid preview of the inner pages. The reader knows they are in for a treat-- more than a glimpse of the life of the young and beautiful Sarai, daughter of an opulent lord of Ur, living like a coveted treasure along the banks of the Euphrates River--one of the cradles of Western and Biblical tradition.Halter does not disappoint; his Sarai is a child of passion. When it comes time for her to marry a man her father specifically selects to compliment Sarai's status and beauty, she resists, frightened of becoming a woman. She flees the safety of her fine apartments to have the harsh reality of the world smack her in the face and onto the ground. A chance meeting with the nomad boy, Abram, just a few years older than herself shelters her from a night that could prove perilous to a young virgin and germinates a seed of love. Dragged back to her father by soldiers, she decides that there is only one option to keep her from the marriage bed of any man who isn't Abram.As the well-versed reader already anticipates Sarai's eventual fertility issues, he/she will groan aloud and wish that there was some way in which Sarai's fate could be changed. Alas, what is written stands and Sarai becomes the handmaiden of the goddess Hathor--a woman renowned for her beauty and ripe albeit still virginal sensuality. When she happens upon Abram again, she knows what she wants and willfully goes about changing her fate despite her knowledge of her inability to conceive a child.Halter's Yahweh adds a somewhat unfinished paranormal element to an otherwise straightforward novel. Not actually a character, the God's presence endows Halter's Abram with a frenzied drive. Difficult to interject a supernatural being into the mix of real people with real passions, Halter falls into the trap of becoming merely a chronicler reciting events from the Bible. He make no effort to add a human nuance to this part of his saga, instead relying on \\"gospel\\" to add credence to what must then be looked at as a novel of faith. Sarai's infertility is underscored by her inability to age--a detail that adds interest and a sad melancholic dimension to her character that would work better if Halter had continued his detailed account.As he moves his narration into the final stretch, relating the Hebrews' encounter with Pharoah, the Hagar/Ishmael story and finally Isaac's birth and almost sacrifice, his voice parrots the Bible rather than builds on what he has already constructed as the passionate main character of Sarai. This results in a hurried conclusion that makes the reader wonder if an overeager editor just left most of the detail out or if Halter simply became bored.Bottom line? \\"Sarah\\" (the first novel in the Canaan trilogy) could have been a fantastic story filled with rich characters and enough drama to make any of today's popular soap operas seem lame in comparison. Sadly, author Marek Halter tires around four fifths into the book. When the getting should be good, Marek fails to deliver. Instead, he relies on a rushed retelling of the Bible's Sarah, Abraham and Isaac tale cut down to a scant number of pages that just don't do the rest of this book justice. Recommended anyway for its depiction of ancient customs and the fully nuanced character of the young Sarai.Diana Faillace Von Behren\\"reneofc\\""},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"very much worth the money. great read. it does put a different look in a lot of things. really did enjoy the author keeps you in the book"},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Since my name is Sarah, this book was given to me a few years ago.

If the Bible says the pharoah didn't sleep with Sarah, let's keep it that way. The most important details we have of Sarah from the bible are crammed into the epilogue (along with Soddom and Gomorrah, and Abraham's near sacrifice of Isaac) and the author spends too much time on her brooding and jealousy only to wrap it up with a quick \\"...and she got everything she wanted, the end.\\" Halter could have kept to the original story while doing Sarah justice and making an entertaining tale. I would also have liked to see Yahweh as a stronger character and not just a point of contention between Sarah and Abraham (which he undoubtedly was, but come on...if you want to tell a bible story, you can't make the central character of the whole book look like a figment of someone's imagination)."},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've read \\"The Red Tent\\" and \\"Apostle Paul\\" and loved both of those books.

The author's father was a diesel mechanic lost at sea in his 13th operational U-Boat tour. Individual submarines rarely made war patrols in the double digits before succumbing to sinking or debilitation; at the end of the war, most were scuttled by their crews.In addition to numerous color and black and white photographs, color reproductions of panels from the 5th U-Boat Flotilla's visitor's book, along with statistics on individual U-Boat crews (survivors, war patrols, killed in action) bring the reader fairly close to a variety of experiences common to all submariners (e.g. rituals for crossing the equator, training trials, experiences on leave, the social climate of the bases).This is no glorification of the Third Reich--if anything, it shows, like the film Das Boot (highly recommended), the isolation and challenges of maintaining a no-frills environment in which a crew of usually 45 or so men, from officers to diesel mechanics, had to maintain operational readiness in the context of long periods of dull routine punctuated by brief periods of extreme violence and fear of death--something like laying across a subway railway track with no knowledge of the time of the coming of the next train, and a screwdriver with which to attempt to derail it.From this came initial notoriety of great accomplishment early in the war (measured by tonnage sunk), to near suicide missions by 1943, when Allied radar, sonar, and bombing was too much for these vessels that could mainly do battle only when surfaced and powered by diesel engines, and when submerged had to operate primarily on recharged electric motors (until the addition of the \\"schnorchel\\" which allowed use of diesel engines while still submerged).As a stand-alone work, it is neither exhaustive nor definitive, but within a collection of war diaries, film, and other analyses of performance may give one the sense of opportunity given to men from many different backgrounds to merge into a fighting unit, with a much greater than 50/50 chance of certain death. It shows again how, in wartime, soldiers are fighting for each other as much as for any ethereal cause other than survival."},{"Title":"Fifty Famous People (Illustrated book of short stories)","review":"The stories in this book are great.

A thoughtful biographical account of Pancake's life provides a detail and depth of information about his past, roots and conflicts heretofore unmatched. Also, a thoughtful critique of his work is followed by a most satisfying compilation of his letters, which, for one deeply curious about this author about whom little of substance has been written, is like striking gold. This is a gem of a book for Breece Pancake admirers."},{"Title":"A Room Forever: The Life, Work and Letters of Breece D'J Pancake","review":"This is a very good job at putting together a biography of the little written about author. Pancake came to prominence after committing suicide when Jon Casey and John McPherson put together a posthumous collection of his short stories. They both contribute an essay to add to the length of this slim volume and it is published to rave reviews.With the help of Pancake's mother, ex-University of Virginia students and faculty as well as the treasure trove of Pancake's letters, Douglass has taken the previously thin story line of Breece's life and developed a thoughtful and interesting account of a troubled, talented young man.Whether or not you enjoy Pancake's stories, you cannot help but be impressed by the power and conviction of the author's words. Reading the biography and more importantly, the letters, you see where this power comes from. Pancake is nearly single-minded in regards to his need to write. Every life decision he makes reflects on how it will affect his writing before he makes it.It also is very clear that this was a mentally troubled young man in need of help that he never found. It is all the more troubling for the reader of this volume, knowing that Pancake would eventually put a rifle in his mouth and pull the trigger, watching the signs of his depression grow and develop. There are also other writing tidbits included: alternate attempts at a couple of his published stories as well as beginnings to other stories, outlines of stories, and unpublished stories. While these are interesting to read, and certainly help show Pancake's development as a writer, they show that Casey and McPherson were correct in their keeping the collection of short stories slim. Barring the discovery of a decade of Pancake's personal diaries or journals, this should go down as the authoritative account of his life and work.4 stars."},{"Title":"A Room Forever: The Life, Work and Letters of Breece D'J Pancake","review":"Exhaustive, meticulous and worth every penny of its relatively steep price, this book contains everything you need to know about Pancake, and provides an ideal, even crucial supplement to the author's lamentably small body of published work."},{"Title":"A Room Forever: The Life, Work and Letters of Breece D'J Pancake","review":"Author Thomas E. douglas did a superb job on the reknowned author Breece D'J Pancake,I just hope Mr. Douglass will hurry up stop procastinating on his biography of the reknowned author Davis Grubb.Hurry up!!!!"},{"Title":"The history of violence in America: Historical and comparative perspectives,","review":"Review from American Quarterly Vol. 22, No. 2, Part 2 (Summer, 1970), p. 285The unabridged report to the national commision on the causes and prevention of violence chaired by Dr. Milton S.

They cover stochastic aspects, geometry, analysis, iterated function systems, algorithms, to mention just a few. And they are written by authorities in the field. Fractals make headlines from time to time[--are they everywhere?], and and they make lovely color pictures; but they are also part of a substantial mathematical theory, one with an exciting mathematical history. This very important book presents the subject in a way that it can be taught to students. Or it can be used for selfstudy! In view of the many applications to geometric analysis, to PDE, and to statistics, it is likely that fractal geometry will soon be a standard math course taught in many (more) math departments. A recent example of this: By now it is widely recognized that the selfsimilarity aspects of the wavelet algorithms are key to their sucess. The authors have produced an attractive book on fractals. There are others, for example one by Falconer from 1985[The geometry of fractal sets] with a slightly more potential theoretic bent."},{"Title":"Lying Crying Dying","review":"I found my way to the author's website, under his given name (Dominic Martell is a pen name). One of the areas I liked was where he talked about great crime and spy writers he enjoyed. Obviously he has filtered many of these influences into his own work, but it does not come off as imitative. I liked the setting in Spain and the Catalan and Basque regional themes. At times Frederick Forsyth came to mind because the setup was quite deliberate. Yet there is also plenty of action and a liberal salting of violence. At some point I do see myself looking into the further adventures of Pascal...and seeing what else the author has done."},{"Title":"Lying Crying Dying","review":"The scene is Barcelona and Pascual is a former terrorist who would work for anyone, but is now living out his retirement as quietly as possible. That is until his former colleague and lover, the beautiful Katixa, locates him and puts a lucrative proposition to him. They need to disappear along with the 5 million francs that she has stolen.In the early stages, the story is convoluted with numerous flashback sequences serving to set the scene and give us an idea of how ruthless these main characters can be. It also gives us an idea of what a big part in this story trust is going to have to play.Pascual and Katixa have to leave Barcelona, pick up the money from where it's hidden and then, somehow, smuggle it out of the country. It's a hard enough task at the best of times, but Pascual finds that his past is starting to catch up with him. He is a marked man and his pursuers are zeroing in on him, causing him to go to ground while still trying to organise his passage out of Spain.This is a very good story of intrigue and deception, with no character above suspicion of double cross. When dealing with spies, thieves and murderers and in possession of a lot of money, you have to have eyes in the back of your head. From a slowish start, this story builds in momentum and provides a satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Lying Crying Dying","review":"Dominic Martell's novel is not a shoot-em-up but a thinking person's novel of espionage and intrigue, written by an author deeply familiar with his European settings. LYING CRYING DYING is a slickly-plotted, intelligently written novel featuring interesting characters involved in multiple levels of betrayal, which lend the book an unusual complexity. There is action, suspense, violence, intrigue, and make no mistake, this gentleman writes with both a fine eye for detail and an interest in good writing. An author who deserves a wider audience."},{"Title":"Lying Crying Dying","review":"This is another thought-provoking book from Dominic Martell that grabs you by the throat and won't let go, even after you've finished reading it. Pascual Rose was once involved with a number of groups who committed terrorist acts across Europe. But then he abandoned these radical causes and ratted out all of his former associates, save one--his lover, the beautiful Katixa, to the C.I.A. in return for a new identity and a safe \\"retirement.\\"Six years later, Pascual is scratching out a meager existence in the slums of Barcelona, drinking too much, occasionally bedding an overripe widow, and trying to keep his head down so as to avoid being found by his old associates who would very much like to extract revenge for his defection. Then, from out of nowhere, Katixa bursts back into his life, on the run with five million francs that she has stolen. Katixa proposes that she and Pascual find a way to sneak out of Spain with the loot so that they can finally live happily ever after.Pascual has never lost the passion and the love he felt for Katixa, and he is totally intoxicated by the idea of being reunited with her. His efforts to make this plan work and to realize his dream open the door to a complicated tale of intrigue and double-crosses, punctuated by a considerable amount of violence.As is often the case in novels like this, it's ultimately hard to determine who the good guys are or if, indeed, there even are any good guys at all. But you instinctively root for Pascual. For all the terrible things he might have done in his earlier life, you want things to work out well for him in the end and once you've started the book, it's almost impossible to put it down until you know if they will or not. One thing you will know for sure, though, once you've finished the book, is that Dominic Martell is an author who deserves a much wider audience."},{"Title":"Lying Crying Dying","review":"Well Plotted, Shabbily Written.This story is well plotted and set, but the prose was atrocious.In general, I liked the story, with its intricate cross, and double-cross.

The Katixa character was well rendered, but Pascual lacked motivation.What really hurt the novel was the clich&eacute;d and overly-intellectual prose. This flaw was noticeably worse in the beginning. For example, there was the terribly over-used description of Katixa being \\"lithe as a jungle cat\\".

They are all the type of poem you might hear quoted over the pulpit or in a church magazine article.I enjoyed the book very much. I've also given it as a gift."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"This is Masterton's first, and still one of his best. Masterton has an absolute gift for selling the preposterous, and making it entirely believable. He does so through dialogue and characterization, and I've never seen anyone do it better.Karen Tandy visits her old boyfriend Harry Erskine, occult mavin and low-budget tarot reader to wealthy old ladies, because of a unique problem she's developed - a tumor on her neck, which to all intents and purposes appears to be a fetus. The doctors seem unable to remove it, and Harry starts experiencing paranormal disturbances after Karen comes to him for help. He, and a few initially skeptical doctors, reluctantly come to the conclusion that Karen Tandy is harboring the fetus of a powerful centuries-old medicine man about to be reborn - whose birth would first claim the life of Karen, and after, the entire white race, with his vengeful sorcery. What's modern science to do, against such a supernatural adversary? Why, fight fire with fire, of course - get another medicine man.It's absolutely amazing that this piece works, but it's really great. Masterton never cracks a smile (until the very end), playing the situation up for real and sucking you into it so you believe it. The characters are fabulous, especially Karen, Harry - who appeared in the semi-sequel, The Djinn - and John Singing Rock, the rival medicine man to the rescue.Masterton's stories almost always end on a lighter note, with the deliberate inclusion of a solution that is almost a joke, but the technique works because he's cluing his audience in to the fact that he realizes how silly it all is - he just wanted to show you he could make you believe it - and the concluding laughter he provokes is welcome and sympathetic, not denigrating the finely written novel at all.The all-star movie made from this book in the late-'70s is worth a look. It's a faithful adaptation, though it doesn't work quite as well as the book due to some severe special effects deficits and a crummy musical score."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"Graham Masterton's first horror novel introduced not only a pretty memorable monster (and hysterically funny film adaptation), but also the template plot off all of Masterton's tales to follow.&quot;A series of increasingly paranormal events leads a character (here one Harry Eskrine) to discover that an elder god (here one evil Medicine Man) is about to return and take over/destroy the world. As time runs out a team of sorts (here a well meaning doctor and a contemporary Medicine Man) is formed to try and stop the beast's return, but they are late getting to the pass and our hero (Harry) must do personal battle with the hellish entity to save the world.&quot;It's a formula that works beautifully, no matter which elder god monster Masterton decides to pull from the shadows of fictional legend. That Masterton has a sense of humor about all this hogwash is a bonus, making The Manitou (and others) both scary AND funny. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"I discovered Stephen King at an early age, so once I had devoured all he had to offer by age 15, Masterton was the obvious next in line. To this day (I am now 30) the thought of this book and the images it conjures up can still send a chill up my spine! This was probably the first book that scared me silly... I remember not being able to sleep for nights afterward thinking of that abominable little creature stalking me! It was, and still is, one very well done story and for me, still ranks up there on the scare-o-meter! A word of caution, DO NOT read this book alone at night! Seriously!"},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"I got to know about Graham Masterton through his 3rd Manitou series,\\"The Burial\\",and like most of his fans,always wonder why he is not more well-known.In my opinion,he is indeed the grandmaster of horror , always able to shock you at every turn , and making you laugh at the other . Extremely graphic in his descriptions of gore and bloodsheds and exhibit humour in the face of adversity.The Manitou marks the beginning of the series,and introduced Harry Erskine to the world.It may not be as gripping as \\"The Burial\\",and shorter too,but it gave you the worthy introduction it should,and you will never rest until you collect and finish the whole series.Personally,I think he is so much better than Stephen King."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"THE MANITOU is a true horror classic that still stands up despite multiple readings and over 25 years of time thanks to Masterton's sense of mood and his wonderful wit. Although the novel is filled with chilling and gory scenes, it's our hero Harry Erskine's terrific charm that keeps us speeding along through the story. Watching as a resurrected medicine man is about to born from the neck of a comatose woman, Harry handles the situation with black humor and an unstoppable drive to see the woman saved. Masterton's original ending (as it was presented in the first edition) is much different and much weaker, included here as a bonus. I hear tell that there's a fourth Manitou novel on the way...following two other sequels REVENGE OF THE MANITOU and BURIAL. I, for one, can't wait!"},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"As his first book this was pretty good.

Only a spirit as powerful will be alble to destroy it."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"This here's a very fun horror classic. Written in the mid 70s and a wee bit Lovecraftian, it's chock full of un-PC-ness as endless bourbon drinking, smoking cigerettes in the hospital, women mostly judged on their looks, Red Skin Indians, and Negros. Tho, none of the un-PC-ness is in any way mean spirited, it's just from a different time. The prose is clear, clean and direct. The supernatural story is action packed, effective and fun. Recommended."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"Good book, totally easy read. I read it in about 2 hours. If you are looking for a book that is entertaining and fast, then this is it. Not super scary, but was creepy (In a good way)and very engaging. I wish it were longer so that I didn't feel like I was just reading a magazine. I was surprised at how thin this book is (only 174 pages). If you are looking to spend your money and expect a book that will carry you for a few weeks, then this book isn't for you, but it is a great book for those who don't have a lot of time to read, or find that reading a book that takes weeks is unappealing. Over all I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"I read this book over 20 years ago. It is one of the most frightening books I have ever read. Graham Masterton's writing puts you there, at the scene when the Manitou is born. I read the book in one night and could not put it down.Unfortunately the movie with Tony Curtis could not compare to the book. If the movie would have had big budget money behind it like many of Stephen King's movies, I think the movie could surpass many of the thrillers of today."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"The first Masterton HORROR genre novel I read was CHARNEL HOUSE, so I had a masterpiece as the standard. When I quickly got to THE MANITOU, I loved the supernatural thrills, and the spine-tingling power of Masterton's work.The key thing to know about Masterton's style is that he is down to earth and follows a first person narrative technique which totally takes you there. Masterton has absolutely no other peer. He acquints you with each character, and every situation is finely detailed. With this in mind, when he goes to such lengths, Masterton makes for the best and most powerful scares this side of Clive Barker, except that Masterton is very accessible. He is clearly not out to impress with how many words he can churn out, not how many technical flips he can do, masterton Achieves his power by straight forward high quality scares in a simple yet non-condescending manner.From interviews and reports, it seems that Masterton can produce a book very quickly. The few mistakes in story and plot that I am aware of are basically the fault of an editor. According to the accounts, Masterton produced this book inside of 2 weeks, basically to see if he could, and he did. He seems to have little patience for writers who take up to a year or more to produce a book... not a complaint, but what annoys me incredibly is just how little of Masterton's back catalogue is in print. It is not clear if sales figures are the reason for this, or something else."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"I've read several of this author's books. I've found his books to be hit-or-miss, ranging from fantastic to awful. I felt like I had to read this one because of readers' comments leading me to believe it was THE Graham Masterton book -- his first and his classic.Well, I read it, and I'm sorry to say: It was kind of silly. I didn't think it was all that scary, and it just became more and more ridiculous.The comparison to \\"The Exorcist\\" is inevitable. It's another book in the demonic-possession genre. Granted, the way the possession occurs is a creative idea: a growing tumor rather than a spirit taking over the entire body (although the possessing entity does communicate through the person he has \\"possessed\\"). But this is not only NOT the best demonic-possession book I've read; it's not even the best demonic-possession book I've read by this author (that would beThe Hell Candidate).I'm not going to give much away but, just to avoid making anyone angry for revealing the ending, here it is:******************* SPOILER ALERT *******************************Again, I don't think it gives much away to say that the possessing entity is defeated in the end. That's what's expected, and we're all just interested in how it's going to be done.I just wanted to note that the way that the possessing entity is defeated in this book is absurd. You might even roll your eyes when they come up with the idea of how to defeat it.I know that Graham Masterton fans are going to be angry that I'm putting down his first and supposedly his classic novel, but I simply could not recommend this to anyone. In order to placate them, let me say that I strongly recommendThe Hell CandidateandHouse of Bones."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"A horror story about a young woman afflicted with the growing--literally--spirit of an Indian shaman type from a few hundred years ago.A man with some knowledge of this sort of thing has to help deal with it, and stop the Manitou.

The premise of a medicine man growing out of a tumor on the back of a young girl was ok but the writing was not. Masterton seems to think that everyone is a believing soul and that a major hospital would just let any old charlatan march in and assist on a case. The plot and characters are weak, the scene and characters are extremely dated and the moral fabric to me is insulting."},{"Title":"Manitou","review":"Touted as a suspense novel with intriquing twists at the end, this book was a complete dissappointent on both counts. By the end I found myself glad the book hadn't been any longer and thereby wasted even more of my time.The book starts off with cheesy, forced dialog between paper-thin characters. Even the word pictures that are drawn leave one with a forced, sixth-grade writing style feeling. Rather than eloquent displays of linguistic ability, we are left with crude attempts at adjective usage that leave you wanting something better. Unfortunately, the something better never shows up.The story itself is, of course, quite contrived. Trying to marry the modern with the ancient mystical just didn't work in this book and came off looking ridiculous rather than eerie.I will say that Mr. Masterson did spin a very believable web about various facets of American Indian mystic beliefs. He either did very good research and presented a lot of great facts to which to attach his story, or he did an even better job of creating an entire mystic menagerie in which to tell this tale. Unfortunately, the story around it just didn't work.I reserve my 1-star ratings for books that are completely horrible on all counts, or pass off outrageous lies as complete truth. This book did have a good mystic system on which to base the story, so for that has avoided my lowest rating. 2-stars, but I'd recommend spending your time with a good novel rather than this."},{"Title":"Three By Tey: Miss Pym Disposes; The Franchise Affair; Brat Farrar: A Murder Rsvisited Classic","review":"This book contains 3 delightful novels (of only 8 written) by Tey.

Tey also provides some pithy comments: From Miss Pym Disposes: p. 122: As a psychologist she began to suspect she was a very good teacher of French.From The Franchise Affair: p. 213: The Governor; to whom a tear in the eye was just a drop of H2O.p. 295: If you see a giraffe once a year it remains a spectacle; if you see it daily it becomes part of the scenery.p. 298: The less he knows about a thing the more strongly he feels about it.From Brat Farrar: p. 414: If you thought about the unthinkable long enough it became quite reasonable.While each novel is probably a 4.5 star (or close), IMHO the collection rates higher. Enjoy this fantastic collection!"},{"Title":"Three By Tey: Miss Pym Disposes; The Franchise Affair; Brat Farrar: A Murder Rsvisited Classic","review":"One of the great pleasures of reading classic English mysteries is the indulgence of a gentle nostalgia for a bygone world. In defiance, perhaps, of the changes presaged by the First War and brought about by the Second, they represent an England that is still predominantly rural, held together by custom and civility, and where everybody understands his or her place in the social order. There are also technical reasons for this, in that the classic mystery requires stability as a backdrop for mayhem. These books are typically set within relatively closed communities; Agatha Christie, for example, focused on the inhabitants of a country village in her Miss Marple series, and in more extreme examples featured guests at an isolated house party, passengers on a Wagon Lits coach, or tourists on a Nile cruise. Although the genre has largely been swept away by the police procedural and its gritty derivatives, a few more recent writers still continue the tradition, such as PD James, Colin Dexter, or Elizabeth George. Only the tradition of the amateur or at least private detective seems to have dropped out, although all three authors mentioned go to some lengths to give their policemen a private life which makes them as different as possible from the stereotype.The three novels in this volume were written by Elizabeth MacKintosh in the years immediately following WW2, and published under the pen name of Josephine Tey. They are all, in their way, hymns to a vanishing England; they all have rural settings, and deal with a relatively restricted community; and although there is a peripheral police presence in some of them, the detective figure, if any, is an amateur. But you don't read these books primarily as whodunnits; Tey was less ingenious in plot construction than Christie; indeed she confessed to having difficulty in writing original stories, and two of these novels are based on historical events. But she is a far better writer, with a feel for the countryside, a fine ear for dialogue, a straightforward style, and a nice sense of humor.MISS PYM DISPOSES (1947), the earliest book of the three, literally inhabits a closed community, a residential physical education college for women. Miss Pym, who has achieved a certain fame as the author of a book of pop psychology, is the only outsider. The artificiality of the setting cannot be denied, and the conversations among the students, referring to one another only by last names, seem strange to modern ears. But the relative isolation from outside laws is essential to the ending of the story, whose outcome Miss Pym, not the police, must decide.THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR (1948)also features an isolated house, but this one is bleak and forbidding, set behind walls some distance from a market town. It is the kind of place to start rumors, and indeed its current inhabitants -- an older woman and her adult daughter -- are accused of kidnapping and maltreating a young girl. But the main focus of the book is the interplay between these outsiders and the locals; the go-between, our reluctant hero and eventual detective, is a fortyish country lawyer, hitherto set in his ways and approaching a comfortable middle age of his own. An isolated country house also forms the main setting for the third and best book,BRAT FARRAR (1949). But, in contrast to the Franchise, this is a centuries-old horse farm in the South Downs, and the book as a whole is a luxuriant celebration of the traditions of English country life.Seen purely as mysteries, all three books have unusual qualities. The ending of MISS PYM DISPOSES is strikingly different from that of most crime stories; I should not say more. The death does not occur until three-quarters of the way into the book; most of the novel is spent building up the character relationships, as Miss Pym herself becomes fonder of the young students, and gradually extends her stay at the school. But because these characters are the hardest to translate into the modern world, this book is now the least effective of the three. The crime in THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR is not a murder, but at first it seems an open-and-shut case, and one of the most interesting things about it is the length of time that the question of guilt and innocence hangs in the balance. Technically, BRAT FARRAR is even more audacious. It is the story of a long-lost son come back to claim his inheritance; the boy had gone missing in his early teens, apparently drowned in the sea, whether by accident or suicide; but the death could also have been faked by a determined runaway. The young man who presents himself, who now uses the name of Bratt Farrar, closely resembles the surviving twin brother. Yet the reader knows very early on that the claimant is in fact an impostor, coached by an unscrupulous neighbor who hopes to share in the inheritance. So where is the mystery? Ah!Classic mysteries, finally, often contain an element of romance. These three Tey books, however, are unusual in the form the romance takes. In THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR, the most normal of the three, the attraction develops almost against the intentions of the people involved, but the story takes an unexpected twist where you might expect a conventional ending. The ending of BRAT FARRAR is even more oblique; but given the incestuous overtones of the growing feeling between a young woman and a man who claims he is her brother, it is amazing that Tey can extract herself from the erotic morass with the delicacy that she does. MISS PYM DISPOSES is the strangest of the lot; although there is no overt romance between any of the characters in this all-female cast, a faint hint of Sapphic affection is palpable throughout, and it is hard to imagine that the author was not aware of this (though perhaps this may just be a post-modern deconstruction).Josephine Tey's novels are dated, yes. But there is much charm in their idealized vision of what was in reality a rather gray period. And, whether as an author of mysteries or explorer of emotions, Tey's writing is more complex and personal than the outer appearance of her novels might suggest. Definitely worth another look!"},{"Title":"Three By Tey: Miss Pym Disposes; The Franchise Affair; Brat Farrar: A Murder Rsvisited Classic","review":"The book I received was dirty and stained.I didn't want to hold it to read.Very unhappy to receive a book in this condition."},{"Title":"Gas Turbine Engineering Handbook","review":"This book covers everything about gas turbines, from bearings to IGVs, and from vibrations to balancing.

I ADORE it. I love Scylla more than any other spy I've ever read about and the whole novel is tight and believable. Excellent excellent read."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"I honestly had no clue what Marathon Man was about before I started reading it. I started a book club when I moved to Seattle a year ago and each month we pick a new genre and roll with it. We picked thriller/suspense for January and then looked to see what the mostly highly shelved and rated books in the genre were and added a few to our poll. This won so I acquired it and jumped in. I think it made it quite a bit more fun having no clue what the story was about or where it was going (I haven't seen the movie) so I'll try not to ruin anything in this review. Marathon Man opens with two angry old men in a road rage situation in New York City which results in a string of events involving Nazis, espionage, and a Jewish grad student who runs marathons. It is basically an adrenaline-fueled rush all the way to the ending.Babe Levy, the aforementioned grad student, has the uncanny ability to remember historical facts, just like his father before him. The father whose life and career were ruined by McCarthyism. Babe's only family is his brother Doc, whom Babe resents a bit for doing corporate work of a sort and collecting hoity-toity interests. After Babe begins dating a German student and writes to Doc about his feelings, his brother shows up at his apartment and Babe finds out that several things are not as they seem. And that is about as far into the plot as I can go without spoiling it all.I had rather high expectations going into this book because it was written by William Goldman, ofThe Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventurefame. I'd hoped that he could write a thriller with the same humor he injected into both that book and the movie screenplay based on it. Was there humor? Not really, but he certainly knows how to keep the reader intrigued and there are several scenes I won't soon forget. Something that might be a positive for readers is that the pacing roars along, allowing readers to frantically flip pages until they've finished the book in one sitting. However, I thought the characterization lacked a bit because of it. There are several German characters I kept confusing with each other and they, along with a few other characters, left me practically begging for more of the backstory. It reminded me of the characters in Jasper Fforde's BookWorld who try to invent interesting tidbits about themselves to interject into their acting. Character 1: generally evil henchman, German, broad-shouldered. I found it perplexing, though, that some complete randomness was interjected instead of helpful characterization--did we really need to know about so-and-so's favorite Argentinian laundress?I will say that Goldman knows how to write torture, death, and chase scenes which really covers all the bases in a thriller. And I liked the seventies feel to it. Thrillers are more interesting to me when they aren't utilizing the newest technology and people have to base their life and death prospects on skill and luck rather than their knowledge of advanced weaponry. Plus, who doesn't love reading about assassins going after assassins?Now that I've read the book, I can't wait to see the movie, which stars Dustin Hoffman as Babe Levy. I want to see if the film captures the anxiety I felt during the dentist scene, the point when Levy finds out about the double-crosser, the bank escape scene, and the ending. (these are pretty general, non-spoiler mentions. If you think I should spoiler them, let me know)3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"This book reads like it was written this year, but it was written 20 something years ago.

Possibly the most grusome torture scene on a piece of typing paper. READ IT!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"I'm not a big fan of suspenseful \\"page-turners,\\" but this one's as good as it gets. Goldman is definitely a cut or two above the Grishams and Clancys of the world. His writing isn't always top-notch (the scenes with Babe as an awkward student are pretty bad, especially the dialogue---a poor imitation of J.D. Salinger), and Goldman is obviously no scholar (amusingly, one of his characters, a \\"brilliant historian,\\" alludes to the Keats sonnet where Cortez discovers the Pacific, unaware that Keats had Cortez confused with Balboa).But the book has many strengths: the early spy scenes are excellent, the glimpses of the international underworld are skillfully done and believeable, and the psychological struggle in Babe's head (peaking when he eludes his captors on foot) rings true. The spectacle of the Nazi monster in the Diamond District is terrific. And best of all are the \\"stoop kids,\\" well-rendered, perfectly true to life, almost worthy of Dickens. This is not your average modern thriller."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"This is, hands down, one of the greatest thrillers ever written. I read it when I was around seventeen years old and it had such a visceral impact on me that I knew this was the type of book I wanted to write. I've been trying to achieve the same thing with my own work ever since. Goldman has a style, a wit, a voice that simply sings. And, as usual with his genre books, he gives us a whopper of a twist. Followed by another later down the line. I almost feel guilty even telling you there ARE twists, but then it wouldn't be vintage Goldman without them.A lot of people judge Goldman's work by his movies, having never read the books they were based on. I urge you to enjoy the movie version, but take a look at the original work and see how wonderful it is. If it sounds like I'm gushing, it's because I am."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"Marathon Man is a fast-paced thriller penned to keep you on the edge of your seat. The ingridients include intrigue, betrayal, violence, torture, revenge, and a secret government agency operating outside the law. Young \\"Babe\\" Levy is a graduate student and amateur distance runner getting by in a one-room apartment in New York City in the 1970's. Unbeknownst to Babe, his older brother Doc works for the Division, a secret government agency straight out of a CIA/goon squad nightmare. The Division negotiates with theives and war criminals in a sort of attempt to further government interests. The Division is currently negotiating with is Szell, an escaped Nazi war criminal seeking to enter New York City just long enough to collect some diamonds his deceased father held for him. Babe Levy and Szell don't know each other, but they soon meet in a scene of frightful creepiness. Start with an innocent young man, a war criminal, and double-crossing agents, then add McCarthyism, a beautiful European girlfriend, holocaust survivors, plus double-crossing danger. Sound exciting? You can read this thriller in a few short hours. Marathon Man was adapted into a memorable 1976 movie starring Dustin Hoffman and Sir Laurence Olivier. Those who saw that movie, and/or read this book, will probably never forget the significance of this short but powerful question.

A quick, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"This is an excellent spy thriller filled with international intrigue and double-dealing characters. It leaves one wondering just who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. While it sometimes seems a little dated in parts, the book will not fail to capture the imagination of the reader with its intricate plot, clever characters, and humor. Written in a straightforward, cogent style, this book was made into a major motion picture that starred Dustin Hoffman and was a big hit in its day.Thomas Babington Levy, known as \\"Babe\\" to his family, is a Rhodes Scholar, a graduate student historian at Columbia University, and an amateur marathon runner. He has a wealthy older brother, Henry David Levy, whom he affectionately calls \\"Doc\\" and believes to be a successful business man.When Babe meets a beautiful blonde named Elsa Opel, he is in seventh heaven, believing that he has met the woman of his dreams. When he introduces his brother to Elsa, Babe shortly thereafter finds himself enmeshed in international intrigue. It seems that all is not as it has seemed. There is someone out there that believes that Babe has valuable information, and this person will stop at nothing to get that which he most desires.This is a quick, page turning read that those who like international spy thrillers, replete with old-fashion skullduggery, a Nazi war criminal, multiple murders, and a fortune in diamonds, will enjoy."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"This is a must read for fans of the spy genre. Goldman brilliantly gives us Scylla, a deadly spy who dodges death at every turn with action scenes that literally hold you on the edge with suspense. Scylla's character is the strongest asset to this book, however his demise leads us into the life of his brother, an unsuspecting marathon runner that will find himself the target of betrayal.

In the famous words of Reading Rainbow, Don't take my word for it, try it yourself!!"},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"Marathon Man is tightly woven tale of espionage which involves a protagonist who is drawn into the action completely against his will, and in an extraordinarily short period of time. This is a tough book to review without giving away how the seemingly disparate characters interrelate, but suffice it to say the way in which they do is both clever and clearly well designed. Though there is clearly a rich history to the main character (and his family) which is alluded to often, it never truly gets developed, and the actual action sequences take place over a 36 hour or so span.Nevertheless, the pace, dialog, and conflict are all realistic, and artfully enough crafted so as not to seem rushed, and there are some interesting spices added to the mix which seem incongruous, including marathon running, dentistry, and Nazism. Lastly, there is a chilling torture scene and enough revenge exacted to reward you for rooting for the good guys."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"Years ago I saw the movie version of _Marathon Man_ so I thought it might be fun to read the book, especially since William Goldman was the author and he also wrote _The Princess Bride_ which I loved. But, even with all that background, I was still not prepared for how great _Marathon Man_ truly is. Its absolutely essential for a thriller to have characters that the reader cares about, without some emotional investment on the reader's part there won't be any heart-pounding suspense. Goldman delivers, even minor characters like the W. C. Fields imitating pharmacist Babe encounters, (a great parody of the horrifying &#34;is it safe?&#34; scene with Szell), have a voice and a story of their own. But don't get the idea that this makes for slow pacing: I don't think there is a wasted word in this tightly plotted treasure. The strands of the story, angry drivers colliding, assassins, and awkward academics come together, then twist and surprise right up to the perfect conclusion. Even if you have seen the movie there are still surprises and developments. Highly recommended to thriller fans, and to anyone who enjoys great storytelling and writing--this is a classic of suspense."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"I bought this because of a sudden fascination with the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, on this the 80th anniversary of Hitler's rise to power. But the book was written in a way that made it hard at times to follow along. I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"This is one of those rare books which juggles character and plot. You are led to care for these people, and feel real empathy for them. I am not ashamed to admit that it brought tears to my eyes. What makes this story singularly fantastic, is the laugh-out loud moments, amazing revelations, strong characters, and great plot. It keeps you guessing towards the end. The first chapter may be a bit confusing, and puts you off, but is completely necessary. Hang on. You will not be disappointed. If you like reading about secret agents and down-to-earth people (sounds oxymoronic, I know!), then I highly recommend this book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"Goldman is one of my Top Three favorite authors, which is saying something, considering Twain is one of the others.

It along with Fight Club and of course the Godfather is one of my favorite books of all time. It has a great story and is action backed. I loved it and recommend it to anyone interested in a good book."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"Ever wonder where all the Nazis that escaped Allied Justice, the ones that weren't allowed to escape that is. Most went to Latin America, which is here Szell \\"The White Angel,\\" spirited off to alfter the Third Riech fell, Paraguay to be exact. There he stays until the man, his father, who is the man intrusted with Szell's vast wealth of diamonds dies. So Szell needs those diamonds to live. Doc, our hero's big bro. is a spy, but apparently spies need some extra cash now and then so he worked as a courier for delivering the diamonds to wherever they needed to go.The White Angel thinks Babe (the main character) knows whether or not its safe to get the diamonds, torture of Babe insues. The old Nazi is a dentist so you can imagine how he tortures.Though I wasn't too impressed with the story itself, already having seen the movie, and they are pretty much just alike, Goldman's prose on the other hand was outstanding, a fast paced well written little book. His dialogue was to die for, quick and witty, giving the characters a 1930's noir aura.Really if just want to skip the novel and watch the book, feel free. Or if you have seen the movie and want experience the book, you really don't need to. They are nearly identical. Which makes since of course because Goldman wrote the sceenplay, so you'd think he'd stay true to his own work."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"Not a fan. For a thriller, I would say this is too overblown, and it is not quite far enough to the other type of writing to get a good horror book, either. The bad guy being a killer dentist is close to that end of the spectrum, it would seem. Then there is a bit much of the whole running, running, running, theme throughout."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"I read this book after seeing the movie, which may have been my first mistake, but nevertheless I was disappointed with the book, considering how much I enjoyed the film.I had a huge problem with William Goldman's style of prose. His technique is that he writes the prose as though it were the rambling thoughts of the characters that are the focus of whatever section of the book he's writing. So while it may give you a better insight into those characters and their way of thinking, it is very uncomfortable to read because he tends to ramble in long, disjointed sentences that end up driving you crazy by the book's end. I'm a firm believer in good, flowing prose that makes it easy for the reader to continue reading.Another problem with the prose is that it fails in its intention to put the reader into the minds of the characters. The reason for this is that by the time you're halfway through the book, you realize that Goldman makes no particular effort to differentiate the thoughts and viewpoints of each character. You'll find that Babe, Doc, and Szell all have the same cynical worldview and make the same mental comments to themselves.To conclude, don't miss out on the movie version with Dustin Hoffman as Babe and a mind-blowing and memorable performance from the late, great Sir Laurence Olivier as the sadistic Szell. Leave the book in the past where it belongs."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"This is the worst book that i ever read!Besides the foul language that is constant, the plot is not even good. And many loose ends that is not resolved. I keep reading to the end, hoping to find out the reason why his brother DOC, came to see him before he died, but yet never found out nor explained. Very frustrated and unpleasant read."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"Though he's best known as a screenwriter, William Goldman has also written quite a few novels of note. His best probably remains the thriller Marathon Man. With a nicely complex but hardly difficult plot and amazingly strong characterization from the major players to the minor placeholders, this is a thrilling, at times harrowing book that also manages to provide a great deal of humor and a strong subtext of lost dreams. With his villians, Goldman truly manages to capture the outright banality of some of the world's greatest evil. And as for his hero -- I would defy anyone not to root for poor, awkward Babe Levy from the first minute they meet him. In recent years, its become strangely unfasionable to run the risk of injecting anything resembling humor or humanity into thrillers and instead, those qualities have too often been replaced with meaningless violence and a smirking sadism. Read Marathon Man and see how great a good thriller can truly be."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"William Goldman has a gift for creating three dimensional characters and larger than life situations that actually seem possible. Besides this his prose is entertaining with tight plotting.Of his fiction Marathon Man is a perfect example of all the features of Goldman's skills. I remember starting to read this a few hours before a really hot date. I became so engrossed in the plot, the twists and turns and tension growing within Marathon Man which initiated a first for me. I called and ended up cancelling the date just to finish the last 100 pages.It is a rare book that motivates me to drop everything else and read it from page to page. Marathon Man was the first and one of very few.You feel for the protagonist and visualize his experiences in your minds eye. You feel the terror, the racing heartbeat and surprise with each page. Goldman had a run where he was the master of the thriller novel. Getting freaked out in a literate fashion is truly a unique experience, one you should experience if you have not yet read Marathon Man.In the end I made up for my faux pas of cancelling the date in part by giving this book to the woman I cancelled on. She confirmed she couldn't put it down either, chances are neither will you.Highest recommendations..."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"William Goldman's &quot;Marathon Man&quot; is my favorite novel of all time. I have probably reread it 20 times. It can act as a virtual textbook on the creation of suspense and terror. Goldman has a firm grasp of what frightens people. He juxtaposes different points of view very effectively and creates characters which you cannot help but care about. It contains what is probably the most famous (and infamous) torture sequence ever commited to paper. The novel is violent but doesn't glorify violence which is a very delicate line to walk on. Goldman is wordsmith without peer. His prose sparkles and is memorable. He lately has been concentrating on screenplays and has not written a novel since 1986 (which coincidentally was a sequel to this novel called &quot;Brothers&quot;.) I can only hope that he finds the time to produce a few more novels. Thirteen years has been too long to wait for another Goldman novel. Read all of his novels, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"A well crafted thriller with interesting, complex characters. It is one that I did not want to put down.

It is some of the best suspense, action writing I have read--skillful and artistic not like some of the packaged, thesaraus writing milled out by some of today's writers.Go for it; you will be pleased I think."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"(...)Marathon Man, by William Goldman, is an epic thriller, that which simply begs to be read over and over again. The initially mysterious characters and their odd lives that begin to intertwine and show themselves later on are enthralling, and the book is impossible to put down. Marathon Man attracts an audience of virtually anyone who can enjoy the typical fast-paced action-packed spy novel, and yet sense and enjoy the clever wit woven into the text by the author.(...) When confronted with the question of \\"How good was this book?\\" I can only answer one way: Fantastic. The book sets the pace in the beginning with a cryptic car crash, the necessity of this being explained later on in a sort of \\"light-bulb over your head\\" moment. To read the book is to be frequently interrupted by your own intermittent cries of, \\"So that's who he was!\\" and \\"Oh! I get it! How amazing!\\". The narrator pelts with you sarcasm and charm throughout the book, making light of the most dire situations and adding a touch of surrealism to the whole situation in the protagonist's point of view. Every event in the book has some sort of logical place in the story. Nothing is insignificant. It's a puzzle, and the pieces gradually begin falling together as more and more is found out. You begin to crave to know more, to understand more, and you form your own ideas, predictions, and suspicions, until another puzzle piece falls into place and totally spins you around in bewilderment.The only criticisms that could be genuinely made on the book are that the situation is almost fantasy and unreal. How many siblings do you have that are connected to Nazi scientists from Auschwitz? Personally, I didn't give a damn that the whole plot was full of sheer implausibility; I was enjoying myself far too much to actually give in to a few minor errors that didn't make any difference whatsoever.Overall, the book is of exponential distinction and acclaim. It grabs you with the first scene, and plunges you into a thrilling and intoxicating world of scandal, mystery, and terror. To put down the book and become occupied with some random, irksome task is ridiculous and highly unlikely for any reader. Marathon Man is a thrill ride, but lucky you, you don't even have to leave your bedroom!"},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"I sprinted through this short novel. I'm very familiar with the wonderful film version, having seen in many times over the years, but have only just read this great book.If you have seen the movie, I would still urge you to read the novel as there are a few distinctions between the two that really make it worthwhile. One of the biggest differences involves Doc, the spy. I won't spoil it, but I was quite surprised, considering when this novel was written.The protagonist in the book is Babe, a college student and marathon trainee. He's a brilliant young man, much like his older brother, and almost in the same league as his idolized father. Goldman did a remarkable job bringing these characters to life, with humor, guts, and some surprise qualities as well. One thing that impressed me about the book was the hard edge it has, despite some terrific moments of levity and wit. When needed, several of the characters display a capacity for violence that is unexpected. I enjoyed the intellect of the characters, which was a big theme in this novel. Brains vs. brawn, and the willingness to put mind over matter.Many books are described as \\"page turners\\" and such. This is one of those rare books that live up to the hype."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. Goldman's characters are perhaps a bit exaggerated, but in a good way. They're the polar opposite of what you'd find in most 'popcorn thrillers' nowadays, which develop characters only as plot vehicles. This book is much more colorful when compared to 'classic' works by authors like Fleming and Ludlum.And while the movie is good, it DOES NOT do this book justice. It carries none of Goldman's wit, humor, and edginess that make this book so brilliant. The film version also completely changed (and ruined) the book's darkly satisfying ending.This book is a fast, quick read, but that doesn't mean it's made of fluff. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"Okay it's the mid-seventies and times aren't so great in the United States. Watergate, Vietnam, recession, inflation, energy crises, oil embargo, dramatic increase in crime, Richard Nixon and Disco.People were tired, wearing double-knit polyester leisure suits, angry, afraid (of everything) paranoid, and feeling spiritually bankrupt. So along comes William Goldman with \\" Marathon Man \\". A grim, violent, paranoid thriller. People ate it up.Looking at it thirty-five years later it's apparent that Goldman wrote a novel that was tapping various ills and fears of the time. Old Nazis in South America, uncontrolled government agents engaged in nefarious activities that might not be for our own good, McCarthy and a feeling that the whole system was running out of steam and falling apart. It's actually fairly calculating. It was a huge seller and a very popular movie. I'm not ashamed to say that I like it. Perhaps because in 2011 we're right back to the same situation (with a few new twists).Are there aspects that have aged? Yes. We now expect our thrillers/espionage novels to be loaded with tons of technical details. Almost pornographic in the attention to detail. Everything from weapons to electronic devices. Thank you James Bond and Tom Clancy.Well there is neither in this story. People have to use their wits, physical skills and also rely on that most unreliable of things - luck.Cars are just called cars and firearms are referred to as pistols and revolvers. Nothing more and nothing less. Of course there are no cell phones, iPhone, Apps, iPods, and so on. The characters use plain old fashioned phones.It's very refreshing in a retro way. Of course it wasn't retro at the time was it.In closing this is a cynical, dark, violent novel. It's also intelligent, witty in spots and a fast read. I read it over a week. A chapter or two every night before turning out my light. I never dozed off while reading it - which in my opinion is a compliment."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"I don't normally read thrillers but Goldman is just irresistible. The relationships are actually really emotional and provide a backstory that adds meaning to the whole conflict. Aside from the suspense/mystery component, the story fundamentally involves a man finding the resourcefulness and courage within himself to rise above life threatening obstacles. In addition Goldman is a master humorist- the beginning scene with the two old men driving crazily is hilarious. I find that few writers can describe action such as distance running in an interesting, engaging way, but Goldman achieves this by describing the runner's thoughts, the inspiration he finds in his hero Abebe Bikila, and including the physical agony he feels and how much he wants to give up.I watched the movie with Dustin Hoffman after reading this book and I like the book much better. There are a few scenes they do very well, including the scene with Lawrence Olivier as the dentist, which reminded me of the movie Brazil, but the ending is very different and, I feel, not as good.Overall I'm impressed by how well Goldman draws together many different worlds- seamlessly bringing together Nazis, Columbian historians, and assassins. He must know and read a lot about many things in order to write about them so believably. I feel I learned a lot and I enjoyed the experience."},{"Title":"Marathon Man","review":"When I was eight or so (possibly younger), I strayed on the torture scene from the filmMarathon Manon a hotel room TV. I've never quite forgotten it, and I don't think I'll ever quite forget this book.InMarathon Man, Thomas Babington Levy is a struggling graduate student majoring in history at Columbia University. He's also a marathon man, training to run in his first marathon. When he unwittingly gets drawn in to a world of spying and espionage, he must use his wits and his limited resources to survive.Goldman's writing--possibly because he's a screenwriter--is as taut and edgy as a too-sharp violin string; he doesn't waste a word, and he plays the tension so tight you're not going to put this book down even when you want to. Yet he deftly manages to sprinkle the book with humor, and the twists are truly clever and--to me, at least--unexpected, though they were integral to the story. Fans of Stuart Neville and John LeCarr&eacute; will probably like this book, too."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"As usual Maeve Binchey wrote a rather interesting story - however, she has a lot of mistakes in it. Two of the charactures, (a German and an American) say things they would NEVER say in real life. At one point they are learning the \\"German\\" toast... SKOL! (This toast is NORWIEGEN!) Also SEVERAL times she has the American speaking in totaly BRITISH speech patterns which are completely wrong for him and which he would never use. She also beats to death the idea of the \\"quiet sea taking so many lives\\". You get really tired of hearing it.

I look forward to her next book & the real Mauve to come shining through."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Not that this story isn't enjoyable, but it is a little plastic compared to her other books.

No, it isn't strictly Irish, no, the characters aren't all strictly Irish, and NO, it doesn't even take place in Ireland, and YES, she has created different types of characters, for the most part, but she's still got the gift - which I wish she would share with us more frequently - and this very different Binchy novel is still a very, very good read. It takes place in Greece and brings together characters from different parts of the world and different walks of life, and a sort of bond is created between them due to a tragedy which takes place in a little town near the sea.

Don't get me wrong I would love to see the landscape that she describes so beautifully in this book. I'm sure this Greek seaside village is beautiful.

Andreas' character development (as well as the other characters) is great and the story kept my interest. It touched many of my emotions. Another book I recommend is A Year Since Yesterday by a writer I was not previously familiar with, George Edward Zintel. It is also one of the very best books I have ever read. If you buy A Year Since Yesterday, it is listed as paperback but is actally a high quality soft-cover (New European standard I've been told). Great book for the money!!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I had never read a Maeve Binchey before I picked up this book, and i thought it was a pretty good story, a nice story at least. Upon reading the reviews of others saying that this book was un-Binchey like I have to say that i have little to compare it too, although I will say that I have made numerous attempts to read other Binchey books only to be dissapointed and to be unable to get into the story, causing me to give up.To be honest i think it is different to other Binchey novels and might be a book to reccomend to people who like the genre but haven't read Binchey before"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Any respect I had for Binchy has been obliterated. I've read a number of her previous books and usually found them rather mindless but enjoyable, excluding Quentins and The Scarlet Feather.I am still in shock, however, to have read in \\"Nights of Rain and Stars\\" her characterization of Vonni's being an alcoholic as having been a weak person. Hello? Maeve? Maybe you haven't heard, but it's been determined that alcoholism is a disease. This just blows me away!Ms. Binchy's writing has always been a bit on the prudish side and a bit stilted, but this is just plain out of touch with reality."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Enjoyed the book.

If you love Maeve Binchy--buy this CD set!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"The novel Nights of Rain and Stars is written at a very basic reading level and the plot was fairly predictable. The characters were one dimensional and not especially likable."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"This is not one of Binchy's better books. It focuses on a group of people vacationing in Greece. A boat accident lays the village under the pall of tragedy, and forces the vacationers to figure out the direction of their own lives. Their needs are attended by Vonni, an Irish woman who has stayed in Greece and whose past is a mystery.While the book follows the formula that makes other Binchy books successful, it does not work as well here. A group of people are thrown together, each with their own problems. Perhaps it is the setting in Greece rather than Ireland; I found the Greek characters to be less interesting. The larger issue is that Binchy moves away from the model of devoting a chapter to each character. Instead she weaves them together, and I found myself getting bored with many of them. While I'm sure that Binchy fans will want to read this book, other of her books are better."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Another wonderful read. Fully developed characters true to life with the author'susual compelling warmth. Life's problems emerge with a familiar reality. The scene springs into focus with such details as a restaurant tablecloth, mountain roads, bright blonde hair and baggy shorts. I left Greece with the characters and longing formore."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Maeve Binchy takes a tragedy and writes a wonderful story of travelers who witness the fire of a boat and the perishing of its local captain and sightseers from several different countries. The pathos of the widow of the flamboyant captain and the way the event effects each of the travelers - from America, Germany, Ireland,and England - is beautifully written. Andreas, the kind Greek and Vonni, who followed her lover to the island years ago bond with the beautiful Elsa, battered Fiona, David whose conscience bothers him because he doesn't care for the family business and Thomas who misses his small son terribly.The author neatly ties up the relationships, and all ends well except for one loose end. Maybe a sequel? Not about Sean! What has happened to Vonni's son, Stavos? Will he come back to her? Unforgettable characters!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"This book is a great conglomerate of the character archtypes that Binchy loves to work with: The outsider who has made herself a part of her adopted land, the abused girl, the estranged parents and children, etc. The story is very well-crafted and does an excellent job of telling each character's life story and motivations in the course of a Greek vacation. It also addresses an interesting theme: that it is much easier to see what others \\"should\\" do in their situations, but difficult to see what to do yourself.And Binchy's love for villages and towns where everyone knows each other remains abundantly clear. As does her commitment to a hopeful, if slighly imperfect, ending.Reading this book (twice, I admit it) was time well spent."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Once an avid reader of Maeve Binchy I must admit that I never did read her last three books which included Tara Road, Scarlet Feather and Quentins. Perhaps I didn't read them because rumor had it that each book was a bit less exciting then the next one. Or perhaps I decided to take a rest from an author I really did adore. Whatever the reason I eagerly anticipated Binchy's newest book, Nights of Rain and Stars, and purposely didn't read anything about this book before I read it so I could form my own opinion. Regrettably, I found this book rather disappointing from an author who I adored since I read her first book published in this country, Light a Penny Candle. And it trule grieves me to say that if Maeve Binchy's name wasn't on the cover I mighht not have finished this book. At best by the end I thought this book was very ordinary and wondered if Binchy even wrote it.Nights of Rain and Stars tells the tale of four tourists to a Greek Island, Aghia Anna, who meet as they witness a tragedy. While a boat used to showing off the area to tourists is burning in the harbbor, five people from four different countries their way up the hill to a tavern run by Andreas, a 60 year old local to the island. Elsa, is a beautiful German woman who has left her career and lover trying to find answers to where she should go next. Fiona, from Ireland has left with her boyfriend who her parents and friend feel is not the best man for her. David, a quiet Englishman has left home despite that his father expects him to join his company. And finally there's Thomas, a professor on a year long sabbatical who fears he will lose his 10 year old son's love to his ex wife's new husband. While on the island these people are helped to understand their lives and decisions not only by each other but also by some of the local people. Among them is Eleni who David teaches how to drive a car and Georgi, the chief of police, who finds a way to separate Fiona from her lover Sean. But most of all these four people are helped by the wisdom and knowledge of Andreas who has a secret longing of his own and Vonni, a middle aged woman who came to the island from Ireland with her lover and has lived on the island for over 30 years.The book is filled with some signature qualities of writing one is accustomed to from Maeve Binchy. Descriptions of the areaa, the climate, Greek food and music and dance fill the pages as the friends bond and ultimately make decisions which will alter their lives and lead them to new and and different futures. The writing though is not lyrical or as intersting as in other Bindhy books. And more than anything I found these characters rather wooden and at best the end is tied up a bit too neatly with almost everybody finding themselves in a better place than before.In the past Binchy has been a wonderful weaver of tales and storyteller about human conditions and the fragiel nature of life and loving. Ultimately I feel that this book is not the best to offer by this author. I would rather suggest to those who haev love Binchy in the past to read this book fully aware that some readers didn't like this book as much as some of her other books. As for the newcomers to this author I would suggest spending time with Binchy's older books like Light a Penny Candle, The Glass Lake, Silver Wedding, Circle of Friends and The Copper Beech to see the real Maeve Binchy at work.While I fully expect to go back now and read the three books I missed and even reread soem favorites, I also look forward to another new Binchy book which I hope will be as good as her older titles."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Maybe this isn't Binchy's best, but I enjoyed it. The Greek setting was a place I wanted to visit. The characters were people I liked. If anything, I would have liked to learn more about them. Vonnie's story alone would make for fascinating reading."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I eagerly looked forward to this book - I'm a true Binchy fan - and I was disappointed. While the setting is intriguing and her warmth is there, the characters are boring and one-dimensional, and the story is so plodding and predictable it is unbelievable - I kept reading it, expecting one of the famous Binchy twists, but it never came. I kept wondering where her startling insights into characters had gone - these were stock characters, with none of the unique and human foibles that make most of her characters so memorable and alive.If you are not a Binchy fan, please don't judge her books by this one - read London Transports, Next Year It Will Be Different, Circle of Friends, Dublin Tales, etc. Those are all wonderful, and show why she is so beloved by readers."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"A Maeve Binchy book is always a treat for me; this one is no exception. Happily she left enough open-ended in the plot for a sequel, without the ending being at all unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"A great vacation book about 4 travelers drawn to a town then drawn together. Their lives interact and they interact with the people in the wonderfully close small town."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I have read many of Maeve Binchy's novels. Many! This book couldn't have been written by her. Her novels all leave me with some kind of message about living and life. This novel was filled with shallow, empty, undeveloped characters. Plot? Message? No. Don't buy it!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Maeve's books when her yarns were spun of silk thread. Unfortunately, in this novel, \\"Nights of Rain and Stars\\" Maeve traded in her imported silk threads for polyester. I'm sad to say, it totally fell short and on its face. In past novels, Maeve's yarns unraveled naturally to reveal the tale. This story was utterly simple, way too elementary, far too predicatable, downright unbelievable and much too straight forward. As the reader, I was insulted by the ignorance she perceived her audience to possess. She wove four foreign tourists into the beautiful Greek countryside. Each of them could have had their own identity but turned out to be flatter than Gumby. No depth. I feel that Ms. Binchy just typed in a few details and names onto a story map from her computer and created this book. How can each of the tourists just happened to be either a mirror image of a Greek character or lead a parallel life? David and Adonis were mirror mages of one another leading parallel lives. The remaining three tourists all bore uncanny bits of their lives to the main character, Vonni. Fiona was the young Vonni with a happier ending. Elsa gave up everything like Vonni to escape. Elsa fled from a man (Deiter) and Vonni fled into a man's (Stavros) arms. Lastly, Thomas and Vonni were estranged from their sons. Thomas knew enough to return to his son,Bill whereas Vonni was hoping against all hope to have her son Stavros return. Prayer was her vehicle. Not action. All in all, I found the novel a disappointment. An easy, somewhat enjoyable read, but lacking realism, interest, complexity and subtleness for Maeve Binchy to have penned it! I expected more."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Binchy has done it again! I love a tightly written novel, and she can write them. NIGHTS OF RAIN AND STARS is about four people as disparate as the seasons and from all points on the compass, yet what is wondrous about this book is how Binchy exposes, in subtle ways, with pitch-perfect detail, their overwhelmingly similar humanity. This is a glorious yet easy yet very intelligent read. Highly recommended!I also recommend, for the same reasons, the great book club novel A SECRET WORD, by Jennifer Paddock."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I've read maybe 7 Binchy novels. This is the only one that I have kept and even reread. It's shorter than the others and you don't get so many details of the people's lives as in her other books, which to me is a good thing. Her writing is better, sparer. It's as if she took a nice refreshing vacation herself and the results showed up in this book."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I seemed to remember that Maeve Binchy said she was giving up writing novels after 'Scarlet Feather' - so far two novels have appeared under her name but to be fair, both appear to have been written by a computer. I can imagine a lot of her fans will gush over NOR&S as it does keep MB's trademark feelgood factor but what it dispenses with is strong well-written characters you can identify with and an intricate and compelling plot. Please don't be hooked into buying this in hardback as I did just because of the Binchy name - this is her worst effort yet (if indeed she DID write it). The plot is completely unoriginal and predictable (in fact there's barely enough material for a short story) and the characters two-dimensional and impossible to identify with. For example it was easy to see why Ria in \\"Tara Road\\" fell for loveable rogue Danny, yet impossible to see why Fiona is attracted to her violent boyfried Sean who is simply a charmless oaf. The way the four main characters get together and the attachment they feel for each other I found simply unbelievable - the 'tragedy' which brings them together doesn't affect any of them directly and has only a minor role in the book. Sorry to sound hard-hearted but in reality they would probably have forgotten about it pretty quickly and gotten on with their lives. The only possibly interesting character has her life story told only in flashback (which actually would have made a better story line) while the book focuses on the boring lives and predictable romances of four dreary people who for the most part are totally responsible for their own problems. To make matters worse some of the Non-Irish characters have Irish speech patterns (did no-one edit the book?), at one point a Greek character describes someone as a 'pup'. I found this book deeply frustrating as it DID have the trademark Binchy warmth and I kept waiting for the plot to kick in only to be disappointed. All in all her weakest yet. Buy a used copy or better still borrow from the library ..."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Maybe I read a different book from the other 5-star reviewers. I've been a die-hard Maeve Binchy fan for at least 15 years. I order her books from amazonUK so that I can get them the minute they're published instead of having to wait for them to be released in the U.S. I think her books set in the 50s and 60s are the best. She seems to be drawing much more on personal experiences in those, and they ring more true. Her newer ones, particularly Evening Class and Scarlet Feather, are also good. I thought her last one, Quentins, was kind of weak, but it was still Maeve. But this one? Didn't even sound like her to me. The characters were one-dimensional and seemed cobbled together from other characters she's written previously, and better. The plot, what there was of it, was unbelievably predictable. Where was the trademark Binchy humour? Where was the Irish poignancy? The characters in Nights of Rain and Stars were unlikeable. The only one I was remotely interested in was David. It pains me to write something negative about my favorite author. But I had to rererereread Light a Penny Candle to get rid of the bad taste of this book."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"No, not the person who wrote this book. You couldn't possibly be my beloved Maeve Binchy. Maeve has always given us original Irish tales told with classic twists, memorable characters, and heart-stopping moments. Maeve always left us with something to reflect on and a deep yearning for her next release.Maeve has obviously been the victim of identity theft and that person has written a contrived situation with paper-thin characters who are not very likeable and whose problems are strictly of their own making. Maeve's characters were always more deeply developed, were good people with a tragic flaw perhaps, but after much soul-searching and a lot of Irish pluck managed to land butter-side up and delight the reader. Not so with this book.Not only are we given one-dimensional characters, but they are bonded by a situation so far-fetched that I am questioning myself for continuing with this drivel. Only because the cover claims Maeve Binchy wrote this do I proceed. It's entertaining enough for a beach read or an otherwise boring flight. There are moments when I think, \\"Oh, Maeve did write that part.\\" And there is one character, Vonni, who has a striking resemblance to the unforgettable Signora from EVENING CLASS. But, for the most part, this highly predictable novel falls far short of what Maeve Binchy is capable of.Four tourists representing the US, England, Ireland, and Germany being thrown together in the Greek isles and mixing with the locals seems a wonderful idea. But perhaps Maeve's greatest strength lies deep in the Dublin she has written about with such love and insight. I hope she takes us back there soon.If you are new to Maeve Binchy's work, please don't judge her by this one. Read Circle of Friends, Light A Penny Candle, anything else she has written. I love all her other novels and short stories and consider this just a minor blip on the radar screen of a wonderful writing career."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I've been a fan of Maeve Binchy's from early on but this latest is awful and boring. The characters are weak and unbelievable which is a shame because the setting sounds beautiful. I agree with another reviewer that this book doesn't even sound like Binchy!!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Maeve Binchy is a master storyteller. She has a knack for creating entire worlds that her readers are loath to leave. Her characters are real people, whose lives we are involved with; we know each of her creations intimately. We struggle alongside each of them, and rejoice in their successes.Binchy's latest novel, \\"Nights of Rain and Stars\\", takes place on the small Greek island of Aghia Anna. Four travelers are thrown together with the local people, when tragedy strikes the island. Each one finds comfort in the others, and all of them are running away from something. Thomas, the American literature professor, is fearful of his son's relationship with his new stepdad. Elsa, the beautiful German, has run away from the man she loves after learning something dreadful about his past. David, the quiet English boy, has run away from having to take over his father's business. And Fiona, an Irish nurse, has run off to be with her no-good boyfriend, blinded by love and unwilling to listen to anyone's advice. All of them converge on the island of Aghia Anna, and are inseparable friends within days. They tear each other apart, and build one another up at the same time.Yet \\"Night of Rain and Stars\\" is not Binchy's best. The characters seem a little too familiar, as if we've read about them in past books. Gone are the meandering chapters and vivid minor characters who populate Binchy's other novels. The entire book has the feel of a collection of short stories sewn together with some fragile thread. I have read every novel Maeve Binchy has written and buy them as soon as they come out, even in hardcover. Although an enjoyable read for any fan, I feel that I could've waited for this book to come out as a paperback."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"After reading the other reviews, it seems I fall under the \\"never read Maeve Binchy before and just loved this book\\" category rather than \\"devoted fan and hated it\\". Maybe I'm biased because I've always wanted to visit Greece, but the imagery and the characters were very absorbing. The initial meeting of the main characters led me to believe they were all unflawed, other than the villainous Shane. However, as the book progresses, more revealing information is divulged including insights into their home lives, and a plausible friendship arises between all of the characters, both native and tourists. All of their flaws and problems are revealed and eventually addressed in a very tidy fashion.It's a romantic, fanciful, short story (a day's read) of friendship and family. I really enjoyed the book and was reluctant to put it down. In fact, if she writes about any of these characters again, I will not hesitate to read it."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"This was a light, enjoyable read; it would have been perfect for a long plane ride. I did think that it was missing the depth of character development, intrigue, plot twists, and Maeve Binchy's unique gift of making you feel really involved with the characters. In her earlier books, I have always been thoroughly intrigued by the characters and when the book was over, missed them and wondered what would become of them. I didn't feel this way after this book; it seemed like everything was tied up nice and neatly at the end and as if she rushed to finish. I also found the relationship between Elsa and Thomas didn't ring true for me; aside from the lightning speed of it, it was as if Ms. Binchy was trying to force some kind of love relationship to happen in this book and those were the two most convenient. Overall, superficial and enjoyable but not engaging. I have found this to be true with every book since \\"Tara Road\\", which I consider to be her last really good one, albeit not in the same league as \\"Circle of Friends\\", \\"Light a Penny Candle\\" or \\"The Glass Lake\\"."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I regrettably finished Nights... a few days ago and thoroughly enjoyed the book. I only came to read reviews to see if others agreed with me and am surprised to see bad reviews. I have read other MB books and liked the majority. No, it's not War & Peace or In Cold Blood, but I thought it was enchanting. Perhaps I am not a literary expert, but I know what I like and I liked this book. The characters were human with problems and flaws like everyone in the \\"real\\" world. The descriptions of the town of Aghia Anna makes me want to visit Greece and I hope she writes again of these characters, for the way the book ended certainly left open many possibilities."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Nights of Rain & Stars isn't Circle of Friends but - here's where I differ with many reviewers - it's much better than the more recent novels like the forgettable Quentins and so-so Scarlet Feather. It gave Maeve Binchy a chance to explore those normally sketchy and undistinguishable characters she puts in her short stories. It has what's come to be a standard Maeve Binchy plot, in which a wise and mysterious figure with a past solves all the surrounding young people's personal problems, yet it was nicely written and flows well, under Terry Donnoly's narration at any rate. I especially liked the revelation of Vonni's story, a character, as others have pointed out, similar to the Signora in Evening Class but, in my opinion, much more nuanced and interesting."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I have never read a Maeve Binchy book before and I had not read any reviews of this one before I read it. I was unimpressed with this novel. It was mildly entertaining and written well-enough to pass a few hours. But I found nothing outstanding about it. I thought the premise of four international tourists meeting on a Greek Isle intriguing. However, they lose their nationalities quickly. For awhile I had to search back in the book to remember what nationality each was supposed to represent. They all spoke with an Irish/English flavor. Also, culturally they seemed to meld into a sameness...there was no evidence of cultural differences that are evident in real life when one interacts with others from other countries. Also, I did not find the relationship interactions to be believable. There is a contrived and Pollyanna flavor to the group's dynamic together. For instance, I foresaw Thomas and Elsa getting together only because of literary devices that made it obvious Ms. Binchy was forcing them in that direction, not because it was an obvious outflow of the relationship as described by Ms. Binchy.Frankly, I would normally not choose to read another Maeve Binchy book after this experience. However, other reviewer's comments suggest to me that she does have other books that are worthwhile reads."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I've read most of author Maeve Binchy's books, and when I stumbled across this paperback at a used book sale, I thought that it would be perfect light summer reading. In this aspect, I wasn't disappointed, as I found NIGHTS OF RAIN AND STARS to be a quick, fun read.Binchy transports the reader to a small, quiet Greek island of Aghia Anna, where she introduces us two a group of four young people, each from a different country, and all of whom are running away from something back home. There is Thomas, the American, who is leaving behind a divorce and trying to escape his fears that he no longer has a place in his son's life. Next is David, the quiet, thoughtful young man from England, an only child burdened by his parents' expectations that he will take over the family business. Elsa, a beautiful German girl, seems to have come to Greece to hide from someone who she is desperately trying to avoid, and finally, Fiona, a sweet Irish girl, has left home to be with her boyfriend, Shane, despite the objections of everyone who cares about her.These four strangers form strong bonds of friendship around tragedy: a fire on a tour boat disrupts the peaceful island village life. They become close not only to each other but also to several locals, including Andreas, the owner of the taverna where they meet, and Vonni, Thomas's mysterious landlord, an enigmatic Irishwoman who has lived on Aghia Anna for many years. As the story unfolds, each member of this unlikely group shares his or her history with the others, and slowly, their fortunes begin to become mingled with each other, causing them all to question their expectations for the future.I enjoyed this story, but I was a bit disappointed in the ending. Compared to the other three, Binchy seemed to leave David's story rather unfinished, or at least not in a very good place. Overall, however, I did like this book--it may not have been my favorite Binchy novel, but it made for light, easy summer fare."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Am I wrong, or is this the first Binchy that takes place outside Ireland? It doesn't matter, as Binchy writes an exceptional story no matter where it takes place. Have already read this, but purchased it for my sister-in-law, another Binchy fan!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I picked this one up while travelling, having read and enjoyed Ms Binchy's earlier novels, as it seemed the perfect holiday read: four people from disparate backgrounds and different countries, each seeking something that their ordinary lives hitherto hadn't given them, thrown together by chance after witnessing a horrific accident on a small Greek island. The four - Thomas, Elsa, David and Fiona - become actively involved in the close knit island community, and with the help of the Wise Irish Expat, find out what's really important.What's really important, according to this novel, is love and family - and if you were in danger of forgetting that, you are virtually clubbed over the head with The Message in almost every chapter. Unfortunately, the writing is so focused on The Message at the expense of character development and realistic dialogue. Each of the characters appears to be a stereotype, rather than a three-dimensional person; for instance, while we are told frequently how sweet young Irish ingenue Fiona is besotted with her thuggish layabout of a boyfriend Shane, we're not shown why. Shane's characterisation is in fact the most striking example of the problems with character development - he is a one dimensional obnoxious boofhead, with no redeeming features whatsoever. Elsa's apparent reasons for wanting to escape her own persistent suitor don't make much sense. We're told, but not shown, each character's thoughts and emotions, often to an unnecessary and tedious degree, including those of peripheral characters - do we really need to know what the copper at the Athens lockup thinks of Shane and Fiona's relationship? As for Vonni, the Wise Expat - it seems we are supposed to care about her, but I simply found her irritating. The dialogue is stilted and wooden; none of the conversations seem realistic; and it's very difficult to care about or identify with any of the characters. As for the setting, I got no sense of the environment at all. Nor did it ring true that the four travellers would be so deeply affected by the accident, as other reviewers have pointed out - in real life, one would be initially shocked, very sorry for those affected, but would soon move on. The overall impression I received was that this novel was phoned in to meet a deadline.It's such a shame - none of Binchy's talent at bringing ordinary people to life and creating believable situations is evident here. If you're new to her work, seek out her earlier novels, especially Echoes, Firefly Summer, Circle of Friends etc and skip this one."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I don't know how she does it, but Maeve Binchy never fails to take everyday people with their joys and sorrows, and create wonderful stories around them.

I would recommend it for a beach read."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I have been a Maeve Binchy fan for quite some time and feel that any book with her name on it as author just has to be a good book. I have not yet been disappointed. Prior to buying Nights of Rain and Stars, I glanced through the reviews posted here and saw that most were not too favorable. This surprised me but didn't deter me from purchasing the book. I've just finished reading it, and feel I feel a strong need to review it. OK, perhaps it wasn't the best of Ms. Binchy's books that I've read so far, only because in my opinion, the characters situations could have been delved into more deeply. However, it most definitely was not a disappointing read to me. From the start, I became captivated with the Greek island of Aghia Anna, as well as its people. The book is vividly descriptive and I soon was able to be drawn into the area - even though I've never been to Greece in reality. The bond formed by the four strangers who found themselves there as they were each trying to escape situations in their lives, showed a realistic way of how one can be influenced by being in a foreign place, being removed from your familiar surroundings and seeing a more clear way to attempt bettering your own life, while gaining strength in new and true friendships. I would love to see a sequel to this book - perhaps something along the lines of what happened with each of the book's main characters \\"after\\" they departed Aghia Anna, as well as what happened to the beloved key individuals at Aghia Anna. I would highly recommend this title to anyone who's already been a Maeve Binchy fan; you won't be disappointed. As to those who have never yet read Ms. Binchy's writings - try Nights of Rain and Stars - it's definitely going to grab you and make you feel as though you've just stepped into a visit to a lovely Greek island. Go for it! :-)"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Maeve Binchy did it again for me. I always take her books on holidays and I end up reading her on the beach.

A group of people from various countries witness the boat go up in flames at sea from a distance. The tragic view triggers memories and new decisions - some will return home, some will try to mend severed family ties, there will be a lot of tears and some smiles in the end.

I loved her previous works enough to start collecting them. When i bought this book I settled down with a cup of tea and prepared myself for an enjoyable afternoon. Boy was I wrong. This book was nothing like the previous novels I had come to expect. From the very beginning it was confusing, boring and overwhelmed me with too many characters with no real value. I kept hoping that it would start to make sense and the storyline would emerge, but it just never happened. I finished this book on the stupid rule I have about never leaving a book half read and gritted my teeth through the pain. the book had a beautiful cover and an interesting blurb on the back, but just as I have seen with theater previews...that may have been the best part!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I seldom keep books after I read them to minimize clutter.

While each character has a situation they are escaping from, together, along with the locals and an expatriate woman from Ireland, they each begin to face their issues. While I find this to be a good concept, I had difficulty relating strongly to any of the characters and felt that the story as a whole was somewhat predictable and lacked an ability to draw you into the story. A decent book overall , but nothing I could rave about."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I have read many Maeve Binchy books, but not all and I thought his one was really wonderful! Some reviewers picked it apart on many levels. I have read formula fiction books before and I do not think this was one! I did not think it was predictable. There were many ways for story to unfold. I loved the characters and the setting in Greece. I would love a sequel to see how the characters lives have progressed. I really didn't want the book to end.

To anyone familiar with her books, it seemed obvious that there were plot lines cribbed from other novels and filled in with slightly altered circumstances and different names.There wasn't really enough back story to help readers get acquainted with the characters. As an example, I never could figure out why an educated and apparently practical woman like Fiona would fall for an abusive idiot like whatsizname and throw over her entire life to follow him to the back of beyond. Other characters had the same effect on me.\\"Nights of Rain and Stars\\" drags along, page after page, and there was just not enough to hold my interest at all.

I'm not sure what other readers found, but having spent a lot of time in Greece and in the Greek Isles, I was enchanted by the story of four strangers, all running from someting, who land on the magical Aghia Anna, forge friendships and confront their demons.Binchy is a master at creating colorful supporting characters, so it's no surprise that this book's color goes to the wild Vonni (reminiscent of the teacher in EVENING CLASS).I enjoyed every moment of the book and would recommend it to anyone who loves great stories, well-told.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I too was disappointed in this novel, and wished I read the reviews before reading it. Or maybe it was best that I didn't. Since it's Maeve Binchy, I bought it automatically. There wasn't a need to think it over at all. I agree with most of the less-favorable reviews, and have to say that if you loved this novel, you have never read Binchy before, and you are entirely too used to poorly written chick lit.The entire story centers around an event which draws four strangers together in a restaurant in Greece. Some call this contrivance weak, but it's typical Binchy in my view. She tends to write about coincidences and sometimes ordinary events which draw people together--people who would otherwise never meet. It's not unusual to see her do this, and although I do grant that this particular event was a bit over-the-top, I was not surprised by it. I would agree that in real life, these four people would have moved on and forgotten about it within days. I think she was trying to show that these four people were all in a sort of limbo, and that they were all at a certain point in that limbo which caused them to be so moved by the tragedy.I didn't really care for the four main characters. Why should Fiona stay with that louse? He was awful in every sense, and I cannot believe that any woman with even a modicum of intelligence would put up with him, let alone travel through Europe with him. It was far too stereotypical. Elsa and Thomas were so unlike that it made no sense at all to put them together. It just seemed that Binchy felt the need to put two characters together romantically, and they seemed to be the most attractive couple. If she had to follow such a formula, she would have done better to put Fiona and David together in the end.I liked David the best of the characters, and I felt like he got the short end of the stick. He ended up returning home and working for his father's company in order to make his dying father happy. That was absolute rubbish. Was Maeve drunk when she wrote this?? She left poor David absolutely miserable, after giving everybody else in the novel a happy ending. Here was a young, sensitive, artistic man trying to find his place in the world, and Maeve (through Vonni) tells him to just shut up and go get a terrible soul-crushing job in order to please his father. By no means do I say that a good office job is soul-crushing (after all, how was I able to afford this book!), but for David it was the worst possible solution. She should have let him open his own driving school, or find some artistic calling. If his father would disown him for finding his own way in life, then his father's happiness wasn't worth the trouble.Finally, it doesn't seem to me that Binchy really knows Greece at all. I've never been to Greece, so I shouldn't cast stones here, but it's true that the mentality of the locals seemed much more Anglo-Saxon than Greek.In summary, the characters were stereotypical at best, and the coincidental meeting was a little too flimsy. She may have done better to set the story in a location she knows, where she knows the rhythm of the people. This was a poor representation of Binchy's abilities."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I usually enjoy Maeve Binchy's books -- they are heartfelt and illuminate some aspect of the human condition. Night of Rain and Stars just felt like a string of ideas put together. The plot is contrived and the characters are too shallow. I hope Ms. Binchy gives us a good one soon!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"As this was the first Maeve Binchy novel I have read, I really have nothing to compare it with therefore I will be unable to rant and rave as to merits, or lack of them, when compared to her previous work. I did enjoy this book. It was light reading and held my interest throughout. I am partial to the area of the world it took place, so I suppose that made it more enjoyable for me. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the story line was reasonable, and for a short work, thought the character developement was pretty well done. I will quite likely read more of her work."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"After visiting Ireland I was delighted to find this Irish writer. While I liked her Quentins books, this was the first book that I was able to connect with the characters. I cared about them, not just read about events in their lives. I don't need to read the same formula every time. If that were the case I could reread the same books. I enjoy a little varity when I read. Maeve brought that to this book. I know I will revisit this book often."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"A friend loaned me three Binchy novels. I read \\"Nights of Rain and Stars\\" first. I just finished \\"Evening Class\\" and I see why reviewers who have been her fans were so disappointed with \\"Nights of Rain and Stars.\\" Big contrast! \\"Evening Class\\" was a fun read. \\"Nights of Rain and Stars\\" was like an outline of a novel - sketchy, undeveloped, barely interesting.And I felt that the four vacationers, if they really had any respect for the community that suffered this tragedy (which compels them all to linger), would discreetly move on rather than gawking at the aftermath and projecting their own emotionalism onto the real pain of strangers."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I enjoy Maeve Binchy's books, especially Scarlet Feather. This was not up to her standards. While I did like the change of scenery (this novel is set in idyliic Greece) I felt that the characters were not fleshed out. I could not belive some of the romances (especially towards the end of the novcel) or the one-dimensional character of Shane, who is cast as a moronic villain.I think what was the most disappointing aspect was that certain characters (especially David) were left w/o any closure at all.This novel didn't ring true and wasn't especially well-written either."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Was this novel typically Binchy - no! Was it enjoyable nevertheless - yes. The only thing I really missed was the Irish Binchy humor so prevalent in her other books all of whichI've read and loved. The lives of the four main characters, all from \\"other places\\" were interesting and involving. The descriptions of Aghia Anna and Kalatriades were detailed, perhaps, too much since they were very small with not much to them. By the end of this story I could only wish Thomas, Elsa, Fiona and David God speed and for Andreas much happiness with the long awaited Adonis."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Nights of Rain and Stars was an ok read. I am a huge Binchey fan and found this book missing the twist that is in most of her really good books. The end of her best books tend to have something, like the hotel burning in \\"Firefly Summer\\", the injury and miscarriage in \\"Circle of Friends\\", the tragic car accident in \\"Glass Lake\\". That twist that an Irish friend described as \\"typically Gaellic\\" is missing from this book and from some of her not quite best efforts, like \\"Quentins\\".I had a hard time really caring about these characters and never got as invested in them as I did in her best novels."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Popular spellbinder Maeve Binchy is blessed with an imagination that knows no boundaries - neither do her stories as with her latest she moves far from Ireland to a small Greek island. In this setting she once again explores the fascinating relationships between people - what draws them to one another and what binds them together.Four strangers, each from a different country and each running away for very personal reasons, witness a horrible scene as a full tour boat goes up in flames. They've gathered at a taverna owned by an elderly Greek, Andreas. He, too, is heart sore as an argument sent his only son to America. Vonni, who owns a craft shop on the island, assists him in hosting the group. She also has sadness in her past as some thirty years ago she left Ireland to follow her feckless lover to this tiny spot in the sea.Among the strangers who are gathered by the chance of tragedy are Elsa, a beautiful German woman who renounced love; David, a rather timid young Englishman whose over achieving father wants him to follow in dad's footsteps; Thomas, trying to recover from his divorce and the realization that he must share his son with his ex wife's new husband; and Fiona, an Irish nurse, who despite pleas from friends and relatives has accompanied her ne'er-do-well boyfriend to this island.In true Binchy fashion there is healing to be found.Well known by audiences in Dublin's Abbey Theatre, actress Terry Donnelly renders a splendid voice performance on both the cassette and CD editions. Listeners may well remember her excellent reading of Binchy's \\"Quentins\\" in which she vivified the story with an Irish lilt to her well modulated voice.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I picked up Binchy's new novel while in the UK this summer. Unfortunately, the rest of America has to wait a little longer for this Irish author's latest. Fans of Binchy's work won't be disappointed. The charachters come together in a small Greek village, united by a tragedy, to help each other through crises in their lives. The reader gets to know and love the charachters and feel a part of the Greek village as Binchy weaves another fantastic tale."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Maeve Binchy's latest offering takes us away from her beloved Ireland to a charming village on the Greek coast. It is there that the lives of several strangers become woven together as they witness a tragedy in this town. As they come together, they begin to talk and bond with one another. It soon becomes apparent that each person in this little group has a life circumstance for which they long to find an answer. For one, it is to escape from a past love. For another, it is to find elusive freedom from overbearing parents. Each person soon shares their own dilemma, and the rest of the story sets out to bring healing and resolution for each of these characters.I am a huge Maeve Binchy fan, but this is not one of her better efforts. The way the characters meet and bond in such short order stretches credibility. It also is strained when each person conveniently has a problem that another in their cozy little group may be able to help solve, even though they are not able to solve their own problems. And it just doesn't seem plausible for perfect strangers to become such intimate confidants so quickly.Complicating the story is the presence of Vonni, a worldly wise village woman who dispenses excellent advice to each person, but is strangely unable to manage her own life. While Binchy has always been able to effectively create very human characters, full of both life and frailities, Vonni seems to be extreme in both these characteristics. As a result, the presence of this character just does not seem to fit.Still, this book is in many ways what we have come to expect from Maeve Binchy. It is a pleasant read, jetting us to an idyllic setting, perfect for an afternoon immersion in another world. But if you are looking for the nuanced craftmanship of Binchy's pervious novels, you will likely be disapppointed."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Maeve Binchy did it again for me.

The Irish connection is there, but it's weaker than the Greek connection. I listened to the Audio CD version and found that the dramatic reading by Ms. Terry Donnelly took an average (at best) novel and made it reasonably entertaining. This is not a book you want to read. Listen to the recording instead. Trust me on that.As the book opens a small group of travelers find themselves at a hilltop taverna in Aghia Anna, Greece run by an older man, Andreas who pines for his missing son, Adonas. As they overlook the sea, all are aghast as a tourist boat burns with grisly results. All of the tourists think, what if? They had earlier been out on that boat. The shared reaction to the tragedy causes them to cling to one another and to re-examine their lives. A powerful chain of circumstances is set off when Andreas insists that they each call their loved ones to let them know that they are safe so the news reports won't be frightening.The diners are the beautiful, famous Elsa from Germany who is fleeing from a lover who has disappointed her; Fiona, an Irish nurse who has cast off her job to be with the man of her dreams, Shane; Shane, an Irish caricature of the unfeeling brute of a young man who is only interested in himself and wants no responsibilities; David, a gentle young Englishman who wants to escape from running the family business; and Thomas, a divorced American professor who wants to give his young son, Bill, space to get used to his new step-father, Andy.The characters are all quite shallow and follow trite formulas in the plot that keep them from being objective about themselves.Ms. Binchy introduces one interesting character though, the Irishwoman Vonnie, who has lived in Aghia Anna for over 30 years and has a secret past full of despair and disappointment. Vonnie gives the other characters frequent pieces of her mind that help set them onto the right paths for each of them. The message seems to be that without a guide in our life, we will make quite a mess of our loving relations.If you don't mind superficial characters and a mostly trite story, you'll certainly feel happy with how the characters go about improving their lives. If you also use the book to inspire yourself to think about what you need to change about your life, you will gain more benefit.I found that Ms. Donnelly's reading made the thin characters come to life through their varying, well-produced accents and different speaking cadences. The only weakness in her reading is that occasionally she uses her lovely Irish accent for someone who isn't Irish, such as David.If you are like me, you'll be yearning for another Tara Road after reading this book. The trend of disappointing stories since that one continues."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"We just read this book for our book club and no-one liked it. It never took off. I probably read chapter 1 about 5 times hoping I missed something. It seemed like the writer was under the gun to produce a book and that it was thrown together. You just didn't care about these people. We all agreed it had a pretty cover but no substance. We spent our discussion thinking of better ways this story could have gone.

It just was not realistic."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I've read a lot of Maeve Binchy's novels in the past (Scarlet Feather, Circle of Friends, Light a Penny Candle, Echoes, Firefly Summer, The Glass Lake, Evening Class, Tara Road). Her books are typically the kind of book that you fall into and can't put down. I keep reading one last chapter before bed, until I realize that it is 2 a.m. So I picked up a copy of Nights of Rain And Stars. What a disappointment! The characters are flat, I had little interest in what happened to them, the outcomes were wrapped up too easily for some characters, and the writing was not very good. I had to force myself to keep picking it up and finish it, which took several weeks, because it simply was not that enjoyable or interesting.

Try Evening Class or Tara Road."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"This is a wonderful story of 4 strangers who meet on vacation in Greece and share an adveture which draws them together in an unusual way.

She clearly didn't do her research because Americans don't talk like the character in her book does. The American still talked like a Brit or Irishman.

It was a waste of time.It started off well enough, and I initially liked Ms. Binchy's writing style, so I kept going. There were several flaws, however:1. The characters (save Vonni) seemed to be cardboard cutouts. If they were any more one-dimensional, they'd be a dot.2. The end result was too predictable. If about a third of the way through you couldn't figure out exactly where each character was going to end up, you weren't trying.3. The dialogue. Who talks like that? Specifically, the American man and the German woman's dialogue sounded like they were speaking two centuries ago. I haven't read dialogue that bad since I tried reading a Left Behind book.I'm tempted to give Ms. Binchy another shot. She seems to have many devoted readers, and they too have expressed their disappointment with this novel. I sincerely hope that this book was not representative of the rest of her work."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"While an easy read, Binchy's lateset effort is not as engaging or as detailed as her previous works. The characters seem cardboard cutouts that are more like tv characters than true human beings."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Mauve Binchy has a way of bringing all her characters to life. We all know them in some form in our own lives. She touches on topics that are dear to us all. This story takes place in a small town in Greece. She brings a group of strangers together with a group of local citizens and links their lives with life changing decisions. A lovely description of Greece and the people who live there. Makes one want to visit."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Having read all of Maeve's books, this one was truly disappointing, one-dimensional and shallow. The characters were neither believable nor particularly likeable. Very contrived story. Her best asset in the early books was to make the characters so empathetic, likeable, believable and fallible too. Her story lines were so wonderful - they made you think how natural the lives of the characters were. I couldn't wait for the next Binchy book to come out. Sorry, this one just did not do it for me at all."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I am currently plodding through this book... and I do mean plodding through. I have read almost everything Maeve Binchy has ever written and consider myself a huge fan. I was so excited when I saw she had a new novel out... what a disappointment! I can't make myself feel ANYTHING for these characters... they are so DULL. I am 3/4 of the way through the book and could easily close the cover and never open it again. I don't care how the story ends. If you're still not convinced this book is a clunker - get the book from the library... at least you will not have wasted $25 or more."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I am not sure why I keep reading Maeve Binchy's novels. I guess I am hoping that one of the ones I have read: Evening Class, Scarlet Feather, Quentins and now Nights of Rain and Stars will compare to the books that made me a Binchy fan in the first place. How could an author who wrote such books as A Circle of Friends write such one dimensional drivel as in these later works? Does she not know any other adjectives other than \\"sad\\", \\"happy\\" or \\"poor\\"? You can almost predict the plot. I am afraid this will be the last one for me."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"It is sooo boring and predictable and the characters are not at all likeable.

Loved the dust jacket and looked forward to reading a novel set in Greece. Thank goodness, I'd be more upset if I paid full price for it.How many times can an author use the word \\"companionable\\"? A dozen or so, no kidding. My biggest complaint is her insistance on describing what her charactor's dialogue has already established. If they are having a friendly conversation then you don't have to tell me that they walked/sat companionably or any of the other odd words she was compelled to use. Speaking of dialogue - I found almost every conversation unbelievable and therefore her charactors pretty boring and unlikable. Don't writers have editors any more? I am tempted to take a red pen to it and send it back to her publisher.Maybe if I was 13 I would have liked this book. I will never be able to read another one of her books."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Even though it was different from her others, I loved it."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Maeve Binchy has this rare gift. Every time I pick up one of her books, I'm very quickly drawn into the story as if I was there in person to experience it with the other characters. Rather than the usual setting of Ireland, this one takes place on a small island in Greece.As usual, the characters seem very real and likable, the storyline so realistic it's almost as if this were a true story turned slightly fictional. If these characters really existed, I'd be on the next plane.This is another story that kept me up til all hours reading, excited for more and very sad when it ended. Bittersweet would be the word.I highly recommend this book. Also a perfect summer read."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"NIGHTS OF RAIN AND STARS by Maeve BinchyJuly 28, 2007Amazon Rating: 3.5/5 starsI hadn't read a Binchy book in quite a while. NIGHTS OF RAIN AND STARS, I have to admit, will not be one of my favorite Maeve Binchy books but it still was enjoyable. The story takes place in Greece, where a group of tourists bond after a touring boat catches fire and many people, locals and visitors, are killed. The tragedy brings these people together, bonding them as friends.Elsa is a beautiful German television reporter who is running away from her life. She remains a mystery to her fellow travelers, as she does not want to talk about her past. Fiona is from Ireland, who is visiting Greece with the man she thinks she loves, a man that no one approves of back home. Fiona thinks her family and friends simply do not understand her boyfriend, but her new friends in Greece can see the reasons why. David is running away from his family business. His parents love him but expect him to take over once his father is no longer able to work, and David loathes their entire lifestyle and what he thinks they represent. And finally, Thomas, the Californian, is dealing with his recent divorce and is trying to run away from a situation that he doesn't want to face - his son will soon have a new stepfather, and Thomas feels he may get in the way of his son's new life. Yet he yearns to be with him again, to be his father and have a real father-son relationship, not just the occasional phone call.While the four new friends bond and learn about each other, two locals also have their own stories. Vonni is a mystery to everyone, at least to the newcomers. Her past goes back to Ireland, and the tourists wonder what brought her to Greece in the first place, and why she has never gone back home. She acts like a mother figure to them, giving them advice even when the advice is not wanted. And last but not least, Andreas is an elderly man who regrets what he said and did to chase his son away to America, a son who does not want to return home.I'm not sure if my tastes have changed over the years, or possibly Maeve Binchy's style has changed as well, but I didn't enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed some of her previous books, including TARA ROAD, my introduction to Maeve Binchy (through the Oprah Book Club). Maeve is great at creating and writing about characters you grow to love, but most of her books were set in Ireland, and I am wondering if this was the problem with NIGHTS OF RAIN AND STARS, which was set in Greece with an international set of characters. I felt the people in this book were not quite \\"real\\", that they were not really contemporary characters but characters from another era. I also felt the novel was just a reason to publish another book, maybe her publisher was expecting another one, so here it was.Overall, while I was able to finish the book and was able to enjoy reading about the various characters in NIGHTS OF RAIN AND STARS, I didn't quite buy who they were. It felt like I was watching a made for TV movie, from the seventies, no doubt."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"The alchoholic character is true to many I have know through AA associations - it does miss out on there being a sponsor-type or stand-in, although Andreas might have been. Other bits of lives are verities, and the heartbroken Andreas is the catalyst to the strangers' lives becoming intertwined. Having an all-wise Vonni is the one oh-too-convenient character, yet her flaws are also nearly fatal to her.This is a book for those who enjoyed \\"Enchanted April\\", and deserving of a movie, itself.Of course, a yahoo from Alabama will be disappointed there are no priests and leprechauns from Blarney, but the characters speak appropriately for their varied origins, although I don't think my cargo shorts are so laughable, nor would I ask a woman I had kissed in a bedroom if it were \\"gross\\", especially if she spoke German. Oh, well, this is an Irish writer - the rest was true to my years living among the \\"Continental natives\\" and the ex-pats."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I was genuinely disappointed in Maeve Binchy's latest offereing, Nights of Rain and Stars. I thought the characters were poorly developed and not nearly as interesting as in previous books. The plot was thin and there wasn't the \\"smile on my face\\" pleasure that I usually derive from her books. I was glad to get to the end of this one. I hope her next book reveals a return of her delicious talent."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"\\"Nights of Rain and Stars\\" is one of my favorite books by Maeve Binchy.I read many of her books and loved them all, this was no different. I enjoyed every page, was never bored. I loved the setting in Greece, enjoyed all of the characters.I truly don't understand the negative reviews. It appears to me that readers get so disappointed when an author takes a different turn, writes about a different place. I found it a refreshing change. I think if I was an author, I would get tired of writing about the same country, the same kind of people and the same kinds of problems, like an actor gets tired of playing the same role, I imagine an author gets tired of writing the same kind of books...so, I say, thanks Maeve, for a refreshing change from your routine.I love stories about Ireland and Scotland, but loved reading about Greece too, loved the water, the sun, the story line, the food, the characters, their lives - loved it all!KCNew Jersey"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"NIGHTS OF RAIN AND STARS is another enjoyable book by Maeve Binchy.The story takes place on an island in Greece where a group of international tourists bond together after seeing a terrible accident.

Several people end up dying in a ferryboat accident. Fiona and Shane from Ireland, Elsa from Germany, David from England, and Thomas from California watch the fire helplessly from high up on the hill. All these visitors have personal problems that they ran away from, thinking that was their solution. Andreas, the tavern owner, treats them like family that night, and all of them are touched by his gestures. David especially grows close to Andreas since he came to Greece because of problems with his father. Andreas himself has problems with his own son who left him to go to Chicago. Vonni, Thomas' landlord, was once married to Stravos a native of Aghia Anna; long ago developed a drinking problem, and never saw her son again. Resolved to continue on, she tries to help this group of visitors. Fiona reluctantly leaves the drunk and bitter Shane behind. Vonni tries to point Elsa and Thomas in the right direction but they stubbornly have to rediscover themselves on their own. David unwillingly decides that he has to go back to England to run the family business. Solutions to problems come probably too easy to be realistic. Motivation behind certain characters actions leave more questions than answers. However you are left with a message that the bonds of friendship and family are the strongest bonds of all. This group of strangers, now friends share in the joys, sorrows, and tragedy of Aghia Anna. I do miss her stories that take place in Ireland, but Nights of Rain and Stars once completed leaves you feeling quite satisfied."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I've been a long-time Binchy fan, and I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed with her latest work. The characters seemed stilted and forced to fit the story. Also, I repeatedly had the feeling that I was being introduced to these characters just to set up the sequel. Not the worst book I've read, but possibly the worst by Ms. Binchy."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"This is my first Binchy book and had I not read rave reviews about some of her other books, this would have to be my last. The setting was wonderful, but the story line weak and frankly not too realistic. In my opinion the dialogue between the characters was stilted and didn't \\"flow\\" and they (the characters) were never fleshed out...no depth at all; also the book kept jumping back and forth to what was happening in each of their lives so much that it was almost like watching a slide show. The lessons learned by each of the characters was noteworthy and I'll probably try to read one of Ms. Binchy's older books that I've heard good things about, but this one truly wasn't worth it and I finished it only because I don't like leaving things undone. This must have been published only because it was a \\"Binchy\\" because otherwise I can't imagine an editor/publisher bothering with it."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Although I had briefly scanned some bad reviews of this novel by one of my favorite authors, Maeve Binchy, I decided to ignore them, and checked it out of my local library. I really tried to stick with it, but was sadly disappointed. I was hoping that some of the other reviewers had overstated the decline in the quality of Binchy's writing, but they did not exaggerate. It's hard for me to believe that, given the wonderful character development and plots of her earlier novels, this one was so poorly drawn. Is she simply fulfilling an obligation for a certain number of novels, perhaps?The 'heart' of Binchy is missing from this one. I couldn't even finish the book, giving up at not quite the halfway point. It's a huge disappointment, because I've always savored Maeve Binchy's books, especially her earlier works which took place in Ireland."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"This book was well worth the read. Maeve Binchy pulls you into her stories like an old friend welcomes you into their kitchen. Her characters are warm and interesting and evolve over the life of the story to reinforce your belief in the goodness of the human spirit. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story to raise their spirits and give them hope for the future."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Nights of Rain and Stars is a literary boondoggle, in which a two week vacation in Greece obviously formed the setting for her new book (OK, I'm being a little mean, but this book is a serious let-down). The main characters--who, if you are a Binchy fan, you will recognize as the archetypical Glamourous Blonde Who Is Secretly Disappointed in Love, a Sensitive Young Man Estranged From His Parents, the Courtly Older Scholar, and the Sweet Young Irish Colleen Who Dates the Wrong Men--are all shown how to right the wrongs in their respective situations by the Wise Irish Expatriate Lady.Part of the charm of Binchy's work, especially her early novels, is the richness of the Irish communities and the loveable, or at least empathetic, humanity of her characters. In NOR&S;, the Greek village is composed entirely of stereotypes, and the characters are unlikeable and self-absorbed. Most of the novel is taken up with their dwelling on their own lives at length, which is not interesting at all.However, I was extremely amused at the number of times Binchy managed to work the Greek word for watermelon--one of the vocabulary words she picked up on her vacation, perhaps?--into the story."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Maeve Binchy is an extraordinary story-teller, but unfortunately, in this book, she is merely ordinary. The plot centers around a group of people who have come to a Greek island for various reasons, mostly to avoid a bad situation at home. While they are there, a tragic fire occurs on a tourist boat, and the separate people are drawn together by their common witness of the unhappy scene. One character is fleeing from a divorce, another one has left a cheating boyfriend, yet another one is avoiding taking over his father's business and the last one is running away with her boyfriend in spite of the disapproval of her parents. An older woman named Vonni becomes a counselor to them all, although she is not wise about her own life and situation. A recurring theme is broken relationships within the family and the possiblity of healing those relationships. Despite the author's best efforts, I never felt really involved in these characters' lives or their problems. The relationships between them formed too quickly and too superficially to have the life-changing impact that they were supposed to have. It's a pleasant read, but not nearly as absorbing of most of her other works."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I was surprised at the low reviews of this book. While it doesn't have the sparkle of some of her books, there's still no one who brings characters to the table like Maeve. She's a master!I still think it would be impossible to read half this book and not find out what happens in the end, so as far as I'm concerned, that's a great read. There's far too many books that are all plot, and I could care less if the heroine lives or dies. I ALWAYS feel for Maeve's characters, and that is a gift, she will always have. It's been too long since her last book, and I'm glad to see her return! I loved the different setting too."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I suppose that one could refer to this book in patronising terms by calling it a \\"nice\\" little book, but it is just that, a really pleasant,easy read.A group of travellers meets at a hillside tavern on a small Greek island. To their horror and that of the locals, they witness a terrible accident when a tourist boat, down below them in the harbour, catches fire with the loss of many lives, both local and tourists. As they are too far away to be of any help on the beach, they bond together and begin telling their personal stories as to why they are there at this moment. The group consists of Elsa, a beuutiful, German tv presenter, running away from a suffocating relationship with a demanding lover/boss, David, a quiet Englishman rebelling against his overbearing parents, Thomas, an American adademic on sabbatical, and Fiona, a young Irish nurse who is accompanied by her violent boyfriend. The tavern owner befriends them all and introduces them to a local Irishwoman Vonni, who has lived in the village for many years.M/s Binchy weaves their stories together in an easy and interesting manner, just right for a charming and non-demanding read."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I love Maeve Binchey's books & I've read them all. This one is a departure from what her fans may have come to expect, but it's still a wonderful story. If anyone has ever suffered an estrangement, an abandonment, disappointment in another, or blindness to another's flaws, and who hasn't; this book is for you. You will be able to relate to these characters and empathize with them.The story begins on an tiny idyllic island off the coast of Greece. Five tourists in search of answers to problems in their own lives and who do not know one another share a night of tragedy in a small taverna.The owner of the taverna, Andreas, who was born on the island and has lived there all of his life, is also scarred by the long ago loss of his only son after a bitter argument drove them apart and the son left for Chicago.As they all start to eat & drink in the taverna high on a hill, a tragedy begins to unfold in the sea below them. A boat that takes tourists out for evening sight-seeing cruises around the island, burns and then explodes. They watch through borrowed binoculars, helpless, as the horrific scene plays itself out. They see people struggling in the water, they see the rescue attempts, they see it all. They are all the more mesmerized by the terrible event knowing that it could have been any of them on that boat that night too.The owner of the boat ,Manos, is a friend of Andreas' since his childhood. He and other life-long residents of the island die that night along with many of the tourists.The island and it's people will be changed forever by the accident and their loss, along with an Irish expatriate, Vonnie, who has lived there most her life seeking redemption for her past.The tourists in the taverna, want to try to find some way to share in their grief and help in the aftermath. What they do then, and the gesture they make creates a bond between them and the island's inhabitants.The scope of the tragedy makes it newsworthy and the next day, TV news crews from around the world converge on the tiny island in the sea to report the grim story.Those of the tourists who fear their families might think that they too were on the boat that fateful night, reach out and contact their homes. This small act and other acts of reaching out, combined with their desire to be a part of the days of mourning on the island that follow, change the dynamic of their lives and the lives if the islanders.What follows is a satisfactory and engaging story of how that change plays out in the lives of the tourists and the islanders as they learn more and more about one another and become bonded by their shared grief and the circumstances of their individual lives. They all become friends to not just themselves but to the people of the island; no longer just tourists from different continents. By bonding and sharing, they are able to set in motion far reaching changes in the lives of themselves and others."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I did not enjoy this book. I loved Tara Road and The Scarlet Feather, but found no such affinity for this one. I, like other reviewers here, found the characters to be stilted and unbelievable. In the first few pages I was thinking to myself, who reveals this much of themselves to a complete stranger? I just did not believe in the people. For me that is the crucial part of a story.I have another Maeve Binchy book on my shelf, The Quentins, and I hope it doesn't disappoint me as this one did."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I laughed when, near the end of this book, a character says, \\"I didn't see that coming!\\" A reader paying even half attention would see everything coming in this simplistic, predictable, formulaic tale. My views echo those of previous reviewer Barbara, in that I could see Binchy with her character scenario spread out, lazily matching happy and improbable endings to her flatly-rendered and unbelievable characters. Much of the book is dialogue, and it, too, is unreal. I am hugely disappopinted, having been charmed by Tara Road, an excellent read. The best part of this book is its lovely dust jacket!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Having read the reader reviews before reading this latest from Maeve Binchy, I began it with a sinking heart, because I have agreed that her last few efforts have not been stellar. But surprise--I loved this book, and disagree with the negative comments it has received.It might be because I had a slightly different take, and here it is: The plot concerns a group of disparate tourists from America, Ireland, England and Germany, who find themselves drawn together in the tiny Greek village of Aghia Anna , after a terrible fire kills a large number of locals and tourists alike. In a sort of \\"Ship of Fools\\" venue, if you will, the tiny group becomes, for a short time, inseparable, sharing various stories, heartbreaks and dreams.In the unreal bubble that is the island in a particular time warp, there is one voice of truth in Vonni, an Irish expatriate who has spent her last 30 years in the village, and who refuses to be bowled over by either romance or dreaming. Don't ask me why, but I consistently thought of Vonni as Maeve Binchy herself--exasperated with her own characters and the fact that they cannot see what is right in front of their noses.All the foibles of human nature appear in this one short microcosm, with Vonni desperately making everybody \\"see\\" the truth. It's interesting, and it worked for me. I'm sorry that the majority does not agree, but I was pleased that Binchy seems back on track!"},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"This unabridged audio recording, on 8 CDs, was a fun listen. I agree with the other reviewers that it is not up to Binchy's usual standards, but Binchy's weak writing is still better than a lot of what is published by her contemporaries.The narrator read well and had a good accent for the story, and I was able to tell the characters apart when they spoke, which is always good. Her voice seemed to suit the narrative.Again, not a shining example of Binchy's work, but a good diversion for fans. If you have never read Binchy before I'd start with another book, maybe Scarlet Feather or The Copper Beech."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"Although not up to the standards of her ealier works, Maeve Binchy offers some light, undemanding reading with this one. There are no surprises and the outcome of each character's story is predictable. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that the story could have benefitted from a more thorough edit. There were several instances of a non-Irish character using Irish speech patterns. The short chapters and simple plotlines make this a good choice for anyone looking for something to read that won't demand too much time or thought."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"This is one of my favorites books by Binchy. It's a tad bit more uplifting than some of hers and makes for a great read."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I have to agree that this is not Binchy's best novel to date ~~ but it is still a cozy, comfortable reading! Who else would try to write about a group of strangers bonding on a small Greek spot and becoming friends of a lifetime?Bonded by a tragedy that happened on a boat that they were just on the day before ~~ Elsa, David, Thomas, Fiona, Vonni (an Irish woman who has lived there for over thirty years) and Andreas, the restaurant owner who provided a place for the friends to meet ~~ they share their disappointments and reasons for fleeing home ~~ and together, they grew close as friends and circumstances brought them closer together till they left the little place. Their stories are stories that most people relate to ~~ broken hearts, broken dreams and joy and love ~~ and finding the courage to begin anew. Old themes, yes, but wonderful themes. And Binchy still has a touch of her magic in weaving those stories together.If you're expecting a return to her older novels ~~ this book isn't it. If you're a devoted Binchy fan ~~ you'll still enjoy this novel as it is just comforting and cozy reading ~~ and perfect for a lazy afternoon reading. If you are new to Binchy ~~ please be sure to read her other books, \\"Light a Penny Candle\\" and \\"Circle of Friends\\" are two of my favorites.

And I admit to being puzzled. \\"Nights of Rain and Stars\\" has many of the elements of Binchy's best, but it seems stripped of description and rushed, even choppy, the language at times being extremely simplistic.Despite these problems, I still wanted to read and find out what happened to the characters (I was especially drawn to David) but I couldn't help but wonder if she was writing under a tight deadline and had to 'hurry' to the end. I'm wondering how her editor allowed this to happen (or caused it?). Where are the lovely descriptive passages that really allowed us to be IN her other books, like Circle of Friends, Evening Class or Firefly Summer? Stripped and minimalistic.Again, despite these problems, the book is more alive than many of Binchy's contemporaries' books. I just hope that with the next novel, Binchy will give it the time and love she gave her previous works."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"I am a huge fan of Maeve Binchy and even though I was let down with her last book, I was still thrilled to see her write one more novel. Unfortunely, even though she redeemed herself a bit from Quentins, Nights Of Rain and Stars is no where near the quality of work you will get from reading Evening Class, Glass Lake, or Circle Of Friends. The writing was very choppy from time to time and I did not feel like I got the chance to know the main characters before the story began. I will always read a new Binchy but from now on I will borrow it from the library and not buy a copy of my own."},{"Title":"Nights of Rain and Stars","review":"If you are looking for a story centered around women of Ireland in Ireland, this is not the Binchy title for you.But if you can broaden your thinking to embrace the realities of the \\"new\\" Europe, as Maeve Binchy obviously has in writing this book, this is a rewarding and delightful read. To the extent that Mrs Binchy writes thoughts and dialog for women and men of nationalities other than Irish, some might say that the novel's voice is not what they expect of her. Too true! Men's voices are more prominent and a number of characters from non-Irish cultures speak and think here in their own voices, not in the cadences so familiar from previous forays into Irish living. There are a few familiar (but always different) kinds of characters; all else in the physical and cultural landscape is changed.The prose marvelously evokes Greece: a quick visit to the bustle of Athens near the end contrasts with life in island towns. But the plot shows how these aspects of the country remain tightly connected, just as in ancient Greece.Certainly no prior framework is needed to enjoy this journey, but those with even a little grounding in myth and history may find special pleasure in Mrs Binchy's telling of the odysseys of her characters. How inspired, especially in this Olympic year, to bring the story home to Greece.Kydos, Mrs Binchy! More! More!"},{"Title":"Mayo Clinic on Digestive Health: Enjoy Better Digestion with Answers to More than 12 Common Conditions","review":"Covers the basics from a classic medical perspective. No mention of leaky gut, damaged gut, probiotics, etc.The topics covered are:Chapter 1 Americans & digestion: talks about lifestyle issues (briefly! - also, also from current medical \\"wisdom\\" with advice such as animal fat is unhealthy), how digestions works (7 pages, 1 of which is a helpful labeled pictured), and how to keep the digestion on track (again, covering the typical medical advice such as the food pyramid with veggies, fruits, and carbs taking the majority, serving sizes, advice in reading labels, eating plenty of fiber, exercise, water, appropriate BMI).Chapter 2 Goes through various symptoms and their possible diagnosis as well as the appropriate chapter in the book.Chapter 3 Explains various tests for various intestinal difficulties, including blood work, urine samples, xrays, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, etc., explained simply and briefly, many with pictures.Chapters 5-14 cover the following diseases: Gastroesophageal reflux diseases (GERD), Ulcers and stomach pain, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, diverticular disease, gallstones, pancreatitis, liver disease and cancer of the digestive organs. All chapters are relatively brief, most under 10 pages. Most simply go through the disease, symptoms, medical treatment options and a bit of lifestyle and food needs for the condition but only barely.This would be best of an absolute beginner in understanding their basic health or one of the above mentioned diseases, perhaps before diagnosis is made for a certainty or for someone to begin to piece together their symptoms.

It is the police being heavy-handed in their treatment of Donald, despite his many successes and the many cases that he has solved, Sergeant Sellers still treat Donald with an iron fist. There are many times in the series where I believe the story would have been better had the police not been so narrow and simple minded.This is one of those cases; the case begins in an odd manner, with a client showing Bertha and Donald a newspaper advertisement that appears to be suborning perjury. Donald follows through and gets himself involved in a convoluted set of conspiracies to commit fraud, blackmail and it ultimately leads to a murder. Daphne is a young woman that was unknowingly married to a bigamist and she arrives in town nearly penniless. She falls for the ad and when she has nothing Donald befriends her and uses her to pursue his case.Daphne is set up to be at the scene of a murder and she inadvertently gets away with a suitcase full of money. Donald hides her but the police are hard on her tail. It is here where Sergeant Sellers comes down on Donald in a manner that is much too harsh. After a certain number of times hearing Donald criticized and threatened with loss of his license, you tend to tune it out. While a series must have a formula, if the formula is followed too closely, it becomes dull and predictable."},{"Title":"It's the Thought That Counts: Over 500 Thought-Provoking Lessons to Inspire a Richer Life","review":"If the human race had to disappear forever, leaving only a small library to express what it was, &quot;It's the Thought That Counts&quot; might be a sound choice for the collection. Here we find phrases reminiscent of the ages--echoing the wisdom literature of the Bible and memorable epitaphs of the Age of Reason, among other human testaments to right living. But the 500+ sayings in this book are not &quot;familiar quotes&quot; traceable to a particular source--although the literary connoisseur will (understandably) experience deja vu from time to time. Rather, these are messages the authors have selected from thousands in the mass chorus of voices heard from parents, relatives, friends, and the general envelope of culture in a free society--all filtered through the still, small voices of the authors' own consciences. This sincere book, utterly without pretension, may not impress those in a vain search for the tour de force. It will, however, speak to all those who, with or without great learning, want to live a good life. This is the motif of a book, from its opening essay (railing justly against the modern pressures that take us away from home, hearth, and creative pursuits), to its well-chosen black-and-white photos (revealing the awesome symmetries of nature), to the quotes themselves (words we would want our children to say to theirs).

He's exploring some knotty ideas here, sometimes to the detriment of the story, sometimes to illuminating effect. You can't take it as a straightforward novel, though. This is his attempt at visionary literature, which often has a dreamlike, quicksilver quality to it -- and can also become ponderous if the author can't control it.First & foremost, you MUST read David Lindsay's nightmarish classic, \\"A Voyage to Arcturus,\\" a novel highly praised by Bloom. This is crucial, because Bloom's own narrative is essentially a retelling & a sequel of sorts to that genuine original. Oblique reference is made to the previous journey of Maskull, Krag, and Nightspore, although not by name; but readers of Lindsay will recognize it & realize where they stand here.It's not entirely successful, as Bloom's remarkable talents in literary criticism don't translate as well to the task of writing fiction. Yet if it's a failure, it remains a compelling one. Not many writers would be willing to tackle such a project in the first place. You can sense Bloom struggling & toiling to make the novel cohere as you read, and you can see him falter at times. But there are also moments where everything works.You'll notice that I'm not going into the actual plot. Beyond saying that it involves a flight to another world, one in which Gnostic philosophy is explored & lived out by the characters, I'll remain silent. Read Lindsay's \\"A Voyage to Arcturus\\" first -- and if that strikes a mysteriously resonant chord within you, then give Bloom a try as well. If nothing else, it'll be quite an experience!"},{"Title":"The Flight to Lucifer: A Gnostic Fantasy","review":"I read this book out of curiousity. Harold Bloom is undoubtedly one of the great literary critics of recent times--what would his own fiction read like?Ugh. This book is cast in the mythological prose of a Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast. This is low quality fantasy. The real star of the book is Bloom's eccentric philosophy of Gnosticism and no thought at all is given to characterization or euphony of language. I think Bloom is trying to write a new testament here, not a novel. He fails. This is an embarrassing piece of work.Do try his criticism, though. When Bloom is on his home court, he's engaging."},{"Title":"The Flight to Lucifer: A Gnostic Fantasy","review":"&quot;The Flight to Lucifer&quot; is a fantasy, nothing more, nothing less; set on a distant world where time and space shift back and forth and where the conflicts of first-century religion are still being played out. Harold Bloom's story begins with an Aeon, Olam, descding to earth to bring two men, Valentinus, a reincarnation of a Gnostic prophet, and his young warrior escort Perscors, back to Lucifer on a quest to help Valentinus recover the call that motivated his previous life. For Perscors, the quest is a search for a transcendental principle, but to reach it, he has to do battle with enemies both divine and semi-divine, to finally reach his inner discovery of his own uniqueness.If you're looking for an in-depth study of Gnosticism and other religions that flourished during the early Christian era, you'll be disappointed because you won't find it here. You'd be better off perusing Elaine Pagels' &quot;The Gnostic Gospels&quot;. But as an unusual adventure story, &quot;The Flight to Lucifer&quot; is interesting and absorbing.

If you are looking, pretty much, for a \\"pure\\" science book you are going to be disappointed- you might only enjoy the last 60 pages or so. This is where the author delves into Hutton's conclusions and what happened after his death (i.e.- the academic battles between his supporters and detractors, and his influence on later geologists...specifically Charles Lyell). On the other hand, if your tastes are more catholic, you might enjoy the book a great deal. This is because for the first 140 pages of the book the author widens his scope and discusses lots of peripheral things- such as: the Scottish Enlightenment, with biographical interludes featuring such people as the philosopher David Hume, the economist Adam Smith, the inventor James Watt, and the chemist Joseph Black. Their work as well as their lives is discussed. There is even a pretty extensive detour into military history- exploring Bonnie Prince Charlie's efforts to reclaim the thrones of Scotland and England for the Stuart line. You certainly can't fault the style- the book is lively and well-written- but, again, you need to know that this isn't just a science book. If you just want to know about James Hutton and his theories, this book isn't for you. Conversely, if you enjoy meandering and exploring all sorts of \\"sidepaths,\\" you'll find this book to be very satisfying."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"It is hard to find a more significant figure in the history of geology. James Hutton (1726-1797) was an exceptional amateur geologist who was the first to put together a compelling explanation of the age of the Earth. This interesting and accessible book presents in a compelling manner the life and work of this remarkable Scotsman. Written in a breezy style, it will not satisfy scholars but it nonetheless presents a compelling introduction for non-specialists in the history of geology. A Scottish physician, Hutton dabbled in all types of scientific inquiry, especially the practical aspects of farming, crops yields, and the like. While engaged in this effort he began to study the surface of the Earth, gradually forming questions and methods of resolving them.This book is a breathless survey of the life and career of James Hutton as a gentlemen scholar, his work on the age of the Earth, and his place in the larger story of the Scottish Enlightenment. Trained as a physician, Hutton lived a life of ease where he undertook scientific investigations and scientific farming. In terms of his work on the geology of the Earth, he really published three items. The first is an abstract of a talk that he gave in Edinburgh in 1785 outlining in general terms his conclusion that the Earth must be far older than the 6,000 years usually thought because of the analysis base on the Bible. He then published a longer paper, \\"Theory of the Earth; or an Investigation of the Laws Observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of the Land upon the Globe,\\" in 1788 in the \\"Transaction of the Royal Society of Edinburgh\\" that created a huge stir among scientists and led to denunciations from several zealous academics. In 1795 he published a two volume \\"Theory of the Earth, with Proofs and Illustrations\\" that sought to answer his critics, but written as he was rapidly declining this work proved insufficient to counter their arguments.Hutton was correct that the Earth is much older than the biblical account would lead one to believe. He was also right to posit a dynamic structure at the Earth's core and the shaping of land masses based on cataclysm and upheaval, though probably not a universal flood. Because of some committed believers who came later, this understanding became dominant in the nineteenth century.This is a very fine, easy read about an important topic. It ranges far across the eighteenth century, especially commenting on the Scottish Enlightenment, which gave us several great thinkers including Adam Smith and David Hume as well as Hutton. It even explores the Scottish rebellion of the 1740s led by Bonnie Prince Charlie in a chapter that seems misplaced in this volume. Overall, \\"The Man Who Found Time\\" is a useful introduction to an important subject. For those seeking a more detailed, scholar account, I recommend Dennis R. Dean's \\"James Hutton and the History of Geology\\" (Cornell University Press, 1992). For those interested in the larger questions of the Earth's geology, especially the age of the planet, I recommend G. Brent Dalrymple \\"The Age of the Earth\\" (Stanford University Press, 1991)."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"Jack Repcheck's The Man Who Found Time elevates James Hutton to a mountain high enough so that folks not of the geologic persuasion can see Hutton's importance to history. Hutton did his thinking and geologizing during the Scottish Enlightenment, the period during the 1700's when much of the modern world arguably got its start. The title of the book is a reference to Hutton's greatest discovery - the great age of the Earth [or as John McPhee put it, &quot;deep time&quot;] - and the book does an excellent job at leading the reader through the events in Hutton's life and in Scotland's history that led to that discovery. This well-written story of controversy and characters is well worth a read. As a student of geology, we were not asked to read Hutton [or Playfair, Hutton's Boswell] in any detail, so I feel a little inadequate to comment on some of the detailed criticisms of The Man Who Found Time, but Repcheck's telling jives with everything I learned about Hutton in college and everything I've read since. I found no obvious historical errors in the book, especially ones that would warrant a 1-star review. My one complaint [and it may be unfounded given that this book was written for the layperson and not the geologist] is that Repcheck never really delves into the simple principle - usually referred to as the principle of cross-cutting relationships - that underlies the evidence Hutton used to support the claim for the antiquity of the Earth. Simply put, something can't cut something that isn't there first. This applies equally well to the granites intruding into [cutting] the older rocks at Glen Tilt and the flat rocks deposited on top of [cutting] the older, angled rocks at Siccar Point. I highly recommend this book to readers interested in geology, history, Scotland and the Scottish Enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"This books makes a powerfully convincing case that James Hutton was a revolutionary scientist who literally gave us our modern conception of the world. The planet earth is over 4 billion years old and it is Hutton who first rigorously refuted the dogma that the world was created a mere 6,000 years ago. More importantly, he saw that currently active physical processes were responsible for the world's present shape and history, that these processes acted slowly but over vast periods of time. To understand our world is to see it as James Hutton did.Repcheck beautifully presents the social context in which Hutton lived, with a lively and fascinating account of the Scottish Enlightenment and Hutton's relations with the leading figures of his day, a remarkable period of human intellectual development. The social history is the greatest strength of the book. But one also walks away with an appreciation for the enormity of Hutton's contribution and a great fondness for this loveable and remarkable man."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"James Hutton has never been particularly noticed when it comes to the greats in science, such as Charles Darwin, and Copernicus. Though, he has made such an impact on the field of science, (obviously particularly in the field of geology,) by discovering the earth's antiquity. Hutton set out to prove that the world was not only 6,000 years old, but that it was in fact an incalculable age. Not only this, but also that the earth is continuously changing as its substances keep eroding and then reforming.Jack Repcheck noticed Hutton's spectacular achievements, and was obviously compelled to write this book about him. Like scientists such as Lyell, Repcheck realized how important it is for Hutton's discoveries and theories of the earth are, and that they should be let out for the public to enjoy and read.James Hutton's influence on science was not just the beginning of the studies of geology, but his ideas led to greater things. Charles Darwin learned from Hutton's ideas which led him to discover his theories of evolution, which is one of the most influential (and controversial) theories of the past decades as well as now.Though, Repcheck does not just write about Hutton's influence on science today, or just on the people he influenced. He mentions the history of the Scottish Enlightenment (which evidently brought together many of the brilliant thinkers including Hutton,) as well as the story of the country of Scotland. It also speaks of the controversy of the ideas of the church versus the ideas of Hutton, and how he and society dealt with one another.I strongly recommend this book if you are interested in not only James Hutton and his achievements, but if you're interested in learning about the history of Scotland as well. This book, I feel would be most enjoyable for history buffs."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"I know, I know, I must be ignorant. I had hear the name James Hutton before, but I knew nothing of him and what he had done. This book was a revelation for me.James Hutton was a man caught between two very different ideas. Science and Religion. While science and religion are often perceived to be at odds, Hutton found himself trying to show reality but understanding that the world would vehemently oppose any idea that some believed was in direct contradiction to the Bible.For centuries, it was common understanding to believe that the earth was just several thousand years old. Author Jack Repcheck does a good job of showing how many scholars basically did a genealogy from the Bible all to show that the age of the earth. Society, by and large, accepted these ideas. Hutton had a hard time accepted this as he studied the land mass, cliffs in Ireland, shorelines and farming land. Instinct as well as what he felt was evidence, led him to challenge these ideas.The book does a good job of showing the scientific environment during Hutton's days. Religion was the science and if it possibly contradicted the Bible, it was wrong. The book examines Hutton's life and discussed why he was willing to challenge that thinking and show why his evidence proved that the earth was ancient...much, much older than just a couple thousand years old.Though the writing can sometimes borderline too much surrounding detail, the description of the times and an analysis of Hutton's life prove valuable. Though Hutton never truly saw the acceptance of his work in his lifetime, it lead to many other great researchers looking for answers and reasoning on the age of the earth. Enjoyable book and an interesting view of who were his contemporaries and friends and how he fought the fight he believed was too important for the world to ignore."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"Repcheck's biography of James Hutton (the father of geology) is a well presented insight not only into the character and mindset of a man who provided the ultimate steps to establishing the Earth's true age in the face of religious doctrine, but also provides a fascinating general history of the time before and during the Scottish Enlightenment.It is the latter that allows Repcheck to give substance to what would otherwise become an essay for two thirds of the book barely deals with Hutton, more with the history of various personages at the time. As such, under the guise of dealing with Hutton's youth it becomes apparent that this author has little source material so we are treated to a lengthy chapter on the Jacobite uprising and the battle of Culloden. None of which Hutton appears to have actively participated in. Still, it is presented in an interesting manner.To begin we are given a somewhat nostalgic and romantic scene of an aging man finally proving his theories off Scotland's windswept coasts (the kind of thing that might open a tv documentary) and we then move swiftly into a commentary on previous scientific thinkers such as Luther, Gallileo et al and how they tentatively challenged Christian representation of the earth's origins to fit in with doctrinal requirements. We are also given details on how early Church thinkers kept altering the date of the world's creation to ensure that foretold events were always pushed back as the apocalyptic event approached. An opening page on the uniqueness of Castle rock's composition allow Repcheck to give us an early history of Edinburgh. Then we move into a seventy page history lesson on the early eighteenth century (roughly 1715 - 45) focusing on Bonnie Prince Charlie that just keeps on the titular track by telling us where Hutton was at each point as he studied to be a lawyer, then a doctor before, come 1745, settling onto a farm at Slighhouses where his management led to his fascination with soil and erosion.The second half of the book devotes itself entirely to following the greatest thinkers of the Enlightenment - Watts, Black, Hume, Hutton and Smith (plus several others) and how they formed their own \`Inklings' that met discussed and formed a scientific clique in Edinburgh. As a result we then move rapidly on through his years spent study rock strata, his formulation of geothermal science to explain the cyclic nature of an ancient Earth, contradicting opponents like Werner who espoused the universal ocean theory. Eventually Hutton delivered his two lecture, 500 single print texts and promptly was the focus of both support and attack from those who say his statement that placed the earth as extremely ancient. The argument raged well beyond his death until eventually people like Lyle and Darwin saw the inevitability of fact and serious attempts began at dating the earth (eventually via isotopic decay in the 1950s).If you had only read half this book you might be forgiven for thinking it had very little to do with Hutton and admittedly in the first part this is one of those books where the content tends to wander off the subject matter but it is done in a manner that the extra information about the period is fascinating in itself. However, come the latter stages, Hutton's presentation of his theories is placed within the intellectual context of the age, stressing its importance to the scientific community as a whole and permitting further achievements. What this book attempts to do with some success is give the modern reader an elegy to the Father of Geology from who simple observations contradicted the human view in an altogether Galilean way."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"Copernicus and Galileo moved the center of the universe away from the Biblical world. Darwin moved the creation of species out of the Biblical garden. James Hutton, though little-known today, had a similar role. He moved the origin of the Earth out of Biblical creation and flooding, into the realm of observable, testable fact.It may not sound like much today, but it was just as shattering a shift in its time. Hutton's theory of geology had the added impact of informing Darwin, and preparing that later scientist for changes in species as gradual and continuous as the changes in the earth under them.Repcheck's biography of Hutton describes the man, his times, and the debates that followed his theory. Repcheck starts with background - some history of the Bible and Christian doctrine, of Scotland in general, and of Edinburgh in particular. Hutton's time must have been an exciting one. It's now called the 'Scottish Enlightenment,' and gave rise to Adam Smith, James Watt, and many other great thinkers. Repcheck then gives a very readable account of Hutton's life and the successors who guarded his intellectual heritage.The book is a clear, readable account of the man that made study of the world into a science instead of a branch of Biblical scholarship. Repcheck never fully engaged my imagination or passion for the character, though. There's background material up to page 100 or beyond, with some speculation on how the young Hutton fit into the Edinburgh that Repcheck so clearly documents. Hard facts about Hutton start to appear about that point. Hutton then dies before page 165 (out of 250 pages or fewer). His ideas live on, but the book says surpringly little about Hutton the man.It's a short, informative history of the origin of modern geology, and a brief picture of the man who brought that origin about. This is not the most vivid character protrayal I've seen, but it adds a welcome chapter to the history of science.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"I found this book to be an interesting new perspective for me on the Scottish Enlightenment--the role of science. The central focus is James Hutton (1726-1797), a Scottish geologist whose pioneering work would disprove the then (and perhaps still) current assertion that the world was not more than 6,000 years old. No less a figure than Newton himself had made this influential calculation. Hutton's theory was based upon his study of the effects of erosion in conjunction with the dynamic movements of the earth's surface generated by intense subsurface heat. He spent much time simply studying various cliffs in Scotland, which convinced him of the ancient nature of the Earth. The author well sets the stage, with introductory chapters on the religious perspective, Hutton's early life, the political context in 18th century Scotland, the role of Edinburgh (\\"the Athens of the North\\") as a catalyst for Enlightenment intellectual and scientific development, and the evolution of a scientific study of geology. A chapter is included on Charles Lyell, an influential geologist and author who did much to spread knowledge of Hutton's findings and theories, including being influential on Darwin who read his \\"Principles of Geology\\" while on the Beagle voyage. And of course, Hutton's theory was of critical assistance to Darwin, because it indicated that the earth had been in existence for millions of years, during which the slow processes of evolution would have had an opportunity to develop. This is another of the new breed of fairly short books (228 pages) that are just excellent in rich in content, putting some of their longer counterparts to shame. An excellent appendix deals with key geologic terms and some current views of Hutton; a valuable extensive bibliography is also included. Just a most pleasant read about a novel topic."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"No one who looks closely at this book, or at the reviews of this book, could reasonably expect it to be an exposition of James Hutton's important but long-superceded geological notions. This is a social history, a story of science as a cultural phenomenon, and as such it is neither meandering nor disorganized. As Mr Rocky Road himself acknowledges, it's engagingly written, economical of words, almost never repetitive, witty, and not at all a difficult piece of reading. In fact, it's a short book and a quick read, and if you don't know much about the 18th C explosion of knowledge, it's a great introduction."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"Who now believes that in about a year's time, at noon on Oct. 23, 2004, the whole world will celebrate the six-thousandth anniversary of the creation of the Earth?No? Well, 200 years ago almost every Christian on the planet believed that to be a fact with the same assurance they had in their belief in Jesus Christ and the rest of Christian theology. The precise date and time had been announced in 1650 with the publication of &quot;Annals of the Oled Testament&quot; by James Ussher, archbishop of Armaugh, Ireland. For generations, every copy of the King James edition of the Bible included Bishop Ussher's dates in the margins.Educated people now believe the world was created about 4.6 billion years ago, and the universe is about 15 billion years old. Those figures are based on exacting scientific analysis, which anyone with access to a space shuttle, nuclear laboratory or radio telescope can verify. Bishop Ussher, not having access to such scientific equipment, based his Oct. 23, 4004 BC date for the creation of the Earth on the Christian bible.So, in 1788 and without access to modern scientific equipment, how did James Hutton challenge the accepted reasoning of the entire scientific and religious establishment to prove the world is billions of years old?This book is a first-rate account of how it happened.Hutton, by literally inventing the modern science of geology, became one of the handful of men who created the modern world. He lived in Edinburgh at the same time as David Hume, Adam Smith, Erasmus Darwin and the other leading figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. Together, this handful of brilliant men, working and thinking in a community that valued education and new ideas, launched a revolution in scientific thought that continues to this day. One scientist outside the Edinburgh group who communicated regularly with them was Benjamin Franklin, the American statesman, polymath and genius who discovered electricity and a wealth of otrher now common natural phenomena. Adam Smith, another one of the group, literally invented the economic foundation of modern society.In 1788, while the US Constitution was in the process of ratification, Hutton published his 95-page document in which he explained the world was created long before Oct. 23, 4004 BC. He based his work on rigid science, not on tradition or religious orthodoxy. It was a bold leap into the future.He was a major player in what became an extraordinary breakthrough in scientific reasoning, just as the US Constitution was a breakthrough in the manner by which people govern themselves. All were based on the same principle, the first-hand observation of events rather than relying on ancient theories or religious dogma. These were men who believed in the future, not in being bound by the unchanging chains of the past.Repchck does a masterful job of tying these elements together, not merely Hutton and his observations and work, but the intellectual habits and social habits of the era. He explains how and why Edinburgh became the intellectual capital of the world for at least two generations, during the time Hutton developed his ideas.When you think of how completely our whole way of thinking has changed in less than 200 years, the impact of a handful of scientists such as Hutton may well be the greatest intellectual advancement of mankind since the days of the Greek philosophers.To sum up, this is a wonderful book. Hutton was the ideal of the perfect scientist, and Repcheck not only understands the man but the social climate in which he developed his ideas.Biographies usually talk only of the person, histories only of events; this book outlines with eloquent clarity how a variety of seemingly unrelated events came together in one place at one time in the mind of one man to utterly change our world.Today, we should be so fortunate!"},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"I read this book in one setting. Not only is it informative on the subject of geology, but it's also an intriguing history of a forgotten man who discovered that the world is older than the once-accepted Biblical age. I have to give this one two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"Great book about Hutton. The book discusses how Huttons theories about geology, his education, and his life endevors. The author spends a great deal of time discusing the historical events that influenced Huttons life, for example Charles Stewart's attempt to regain the thrown of Scottland and the eventual fall of the clans.The author also discusses Hutton relationships with many Scottish Scientist and Philosphers, such as Playfair and Adam Smith.Very interesting book, a quick read. I highly suggest that students of Historical Geology read this book."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"James Hutton was a tall thin Scotsman, a non-practicing medical doctor, who was independently wealthy and devoted to farming. Unlike many lately, but like some other residents of the United Kingdom, such as Smith, Darwin, Talbot and indeed the fabled figures Sherlock Holmes and Henry Higgins, he used his wealth not to acquire numerous homes but to engage in intellectual endeavors. There are those who may have found him \\"difficult,\\" but it is hard to fault his priorities.Hutton became convinced that the world was much older than generally believed in the last half of the eighteenth century. Although the author is not sure of the genesis of Hutton's belief, he does describe the books that had been written in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that posed scenarios markedly different from that in the bible. Hutton appears, or had the opportunity, to have read them. In 1788 he scouted the rocky, inhospitable, Scotch coast and discovered sedimentary rocks, (Silurian greywacke) tilted like the pages of a book below an unconformity which in turn was overlaid by Upper Old Red Sandstone, all exposed to the sea. This finding confirmed his thought that the world was very, very old, much older than then thought.But what did nearly everyone else think at that time and why? It is one of the better parts of the book. Repcheck describes Eusebius chronology of world history, written in Greek for Constantine in 325. It was translated into Latin by St. Jerome in 382 and that document \\"inspired chronologists for the next 1400 years.\\" Eusebius had borrowed from the Hebrew Bible; now known as the Septuagint Bible. It contains the Book of Genesis which gives definite years for the life spans of a few of the celebrities mentioned, e.g. Adam 930 years, Noah 950, Abraham 175, Moses 120, etc. From these and a chronology constructed by Julius Africanus between 212 and 221 he calculated that the birth of Jesus Christ took place 5500 years after God had reportedly worked for six days and rested for one. This was the belief that Hutton faced, and it was then, as now, very widely held in the West. (In China, as there is no belief in a creator, Hutton would have had a somewhat easier time.)At the time Hutton was farming, most mineralogists believed that all visible rocks were precipitates from the universal ocean. Hutton did not, because he could not dissolve in water every substance found in rocks. He concluded that heat from within the earth coupled with pressure caused lithification. He was wrong on the need for heat. However, he was the first to recognize the need for pressure. (Heat and pressure being necessary for the formation of metamorphic rocks, they were then thought to be also required for sedimentary solidification.) Hutton's importance was stated by Lyell, who was inspired by him, \\"[Hutton] was the first... to explain the former changes of the earth's crust, by reference exclusively to natural agents.\\" Hutton stated his ultimate conclusion succinctly: \\"In the economy of the world, I can find no traces of a beginning, no prospect of an end.\\" The effect of his insight was summed by Lyell: \\"The imagination was first fatigued and overpowered by endeavoring to conceive the immensity of time required for the annihilation of whole continents by so insensible a process.\\" Hutton originated uniformitarianism, which Lyell took to another level. Unfortunately it does not account for catastrophes, which Repcheck notes later caused some resistance to the impact thesis. The strength of the book is its description of the evolution of thought and the intellectual impediments that were overcome."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"An enthusiastic 5 stars. This is simply a wonderful book -- easy to read and engrossing. Lots of background on all sorts of things, including the Scottish Enlightenment.

You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"Part geology, part biography, part history of Scotland, this excellent book is a tribute to James Hutton, the originator of modern geology. Starting with the status of geology in the eighteenth century and the use of the Bible as the basis for estimating the age of the earth, the author weaves the intriguing story of James Hutton and how he came about discovering signs of the earth's true antiquity. The political situation in eighteenth century Scotland is well described and illustrates the times in which Hutton lived. But the book goes further in that the evolution of geology after Hutton's death is also discussed, ending with modern estimates of the age of the earth and a brief description of the methods used to produce them. This is a very well-written and exciting book that should appeal to a wide audience."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"The Man Who Found Time is a charming little book, which is as much about the Edinburgh Enlightenment and its various contributors, as it is about the geologist Hutton. The author provides a readable background of the political and social environment of the time. He describes the preliminaries to the Battle of Culloden and its aftermath and the freedom that removal of the twin threats of the return of the conservative Stuarts and the violence of the highland clans had on economy and creative thought at the time.This unique place and time brought together a small group of creative geniuses that turned the face of the world totally around. These were the intellectuals who were the ultimate founders of the industrial revolution and of much of modern science. Black, Clerk-Maxwell, Watt, Hutton, and others shared a camaraderie rare among individuals one normally pictures as jealous of their intellectual property and prestige. The mutual support, close friendship, and collaborative efforts were phenomenal and very productive.It was primarily because of this mutual respect that Hutton's contributions to science, especially geology, are still remembered at all. Using diaries, letters, biographies, and scientific papers, the author manages to present the portrait of a man of congenial temperament, insatiable curiosity and patience. While many of the founders of the neophyte science were losing their way trying to make their observations and theories fit, not only the Biblical narrative of Genesis, but the chronological machinations of generations of Biblical scholars all trying to place the events of creation on a time frame, Hutton remained free of preconceived notions. A naturalist from childhood and a farmer by choice, he made careful observations throughout Scotland, Ireland, England, France and Italy, gathering data for his theory of the earth. His observations of soil errosion and of rocks in their natural setting--rather than as depicted or described by others as was the custom--laid the groundwork for his claim for the great antiquity of the earth. Several of the skeptics in his circle were converted to his thesis when the evidence of the earth's own strata were presented to and interpreted for them on field trips.Not everyone, however, was willing to admit defeat. Many opponents, unwilling to concede that the Biblical narrative of the creation of the earth was not literally true, continued to find fault with Hutton and his data. After his death and those of several of his supporters, the anti-Huttonian faction almost literally buried his work. Living beyond him, and having the ear of the young scientists of the time, they were able to bring ridicule and obfuscation to the effort. Only with the rise of another young scientist, Charles Lyell, whose book Principles of Geology became the definitive book on the topic, did Hutton finally receive credit and general recognition for his remarkable observations.A nice little book on an often neglected subject."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"I purchased this book in July '03 shortly after it was published but only now got around to reading it. It's been sitting in my stack of unread books while I've worked on the publication and marketing of my own book, \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\"This small book makes for a leisurely and informative diversion. Repcheck is to be commended not only for attempting to give Hutton the recognition he deserves but for portraying the locale and culture of Hutton's time. I certainly agree with other reviewers' positive assessments and highly recommend it.Two things struck me while reading this book. Hutton's culture was essentially the same that America's founding fathers labored under with its Biblical beliefs both in the Earth's six-thousand year age and in a pre-Darwin stagnant creation. And they had only pre-Industrial Revolution technology. What our founding fathers were able to accomplish was truly remarkable and revolutionary. The other thing is the persistent difficulty of introducing ideas that run counter to religious beliefs eventho we've had two more centuries of further enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"The book \\"The Man Who Found Time,\\" by J. Repcheck is about James Hutton, the eighteenth century Scottish geologist who deserves to stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Newton, Darwin, and Einstein in the pantheon of History's greatest and most important scientists. Unlike these other great men who are rightly famous, Hutton is little known outside of the Earth sciences community. I first learned of Hutton's work many years ago when I was a student of geology and sadly, have seldom heard his name mentioned since then. Hutton's theory of the Earth is a truly remarkable accomplishment. His rare ability to free himself from many of the religious and dogmatic fetters of his day and his sheer brilliance and perspicacity made it possible for him to formulate the first viable and more-or-less correct theory of how the Earth works. His discovery of \\"Deep Time\\" was crucial to later advances in geology and of great importance to many of those made in biology and astronomy as well.In his book, Mr. Repcheck attempts to rescue the father of geology from the unfortunate and undeserved obscurity in which he has languished for more than two centuries. A book such as this is long over due and I hope that it is widely read so that this great scientist and exemplar of the Scottish Enlightenment will finally get the recognition that he deserves.As a previous reviewer pointed out, Repcheck is on occasion rather loose with his history and perhaps not as objective as he should be. He probably should have made it more clear, as other authors have, that Hutton was not a modern empiricist, that he relied heavily on the works of earlier natural philosophers, and that he got some things wrong. But when viewed within the context of his time, Hutton's evident shortcomings are quite forgivable and do not change the fact that modern geology is the direct descendant of Hutton's geology.I am a little disappointed that Repcheck does not mention the fact that Hutton posited an idea of organic evolution through natural selection (although he did not call it that) decades before Darwin independently formulated his magnificent theory. I also think that Repcheck's argument would be more effective had he presented his explanation of why Hutton is so important early on in the book rather than relegating it to the later chapters.I do not agree with Repcheck and many others that Hutton was overlooked by history largely because of his inarticulate and turgid writing style. I have read some of Hutton's original works and do not find his writings to be \\"impenetrable\\" as compared to those of other eighteenth century authors. Perhaps Hutton was rejected in his own day and later nearly forgotten because he was simply too far ahead of his time. His contemporaries could neither let go of biblical creation myths nor countenance the notion that the Earth is many millions of years old and powered by an, at that time, inexplicable subterranean heat source.In spite of these few minor criticisms, this is an excellent and much needed book. Repcheck writes well and presents his case cogently and effectively. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in science or the history of science."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"I loved this book. Repcheck explained Hutton by narrating the times in which he lived and what's changed since. The clear and witty writing pulls from a fascinating variety of sources: the brilliance of Isaac Newton, the sanitation of Edinburgh, the importance of Adam Smith, the use of chemistry as logic, etc. All these thought threads get woven into a short, readable history of science focused on the Scottish Enlightenment period.I picked up the book because I'm soon traveling to Scotland and was looking for some travel ideas. I got so much more! I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to better understand Scotland or how thinking evolves."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"A reasonable brief discussion of the life of James Hutton in relation to the Scottish Enlightenment. Geologists know Hutton as one of the founding fathers of the science and any student of history is aware of the giants of the Scottish Enlightenment (Watt, Hume, etc.). No new ground is covered ( except perhaps the brief discussion of Hutton's illegitimate son). If you have never heard of Hutton or some of the other Enlightenment scientist, this book is a good introduction. One issue not discussed at any length concerns Hutton's fascination on the origins of granites. The Geologic Society of America (GSA) hold periodic scientific meetings on the origins of granite called the Hutton Symposiums (yes there is still debate on the origins of granite)."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"You might enjoy reading this book but, believe me, it is not an accurate account at all of how James Hutton worked at all. Clearly, the author has tried just a bit too hard to get a popular handle on the subject, and has thrown all objectivity out of the window in the process. Just one example (a BIG one) -- Hutton already discovered an unconformity (at Jedburgh) that satisfied him before he came across Siccar Point -- of Jedburgh he wrote, &quot;I rejoiced at finding what I had so long sought&quot; -- so much for Repcheck's &quot;Eureka moment&quot; at Siccar! Oh, and long before finding his own unconformity, Hutton knew such things existed from French accounts of Alpine geology. So, &quot;enjoy&quot;, but this is not an accurate account of how Hutton worked."},{"Title":"The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of Earth's Antiquity","review":"The topic of this book - the story of the man who first discovered how the earth had evolved over countless ages of geologic time - is intriguing and full of promise. Unhappily, the book does not live up to the promise.To be fair, not a great deal seems to be known about James Hutton and any writer would be stretched to develop a book-length manuscript with so little directly relevant material. This explains the tediously detailed tangents that the writer chooses to indulge in. They provide background and context but are pedestrian and uninspired.The writer is introduced on the back cover as an editor \\"with a long career of publishing works of science\\". It seems that this is the first book he has written and one should therefore be tolerant. It doesn't explain why it is so poorly edited. The copy editing alone is abysmal - was there no-one to check typos and spellings? He over-uses the word \\"rigorous\\" which only goes to point out that his own work is less than rigorous. The book is noticeably US-centric and in parts the US-based vocabulary is both inappropriate and distracting.

Sometimes ideas lead to good things but not always. One idea that has contributed greatly to the confusion over the age of the earth is usually attributed to James Hutton. The Man Who Found Time by Jack Repcheck is a recent book which gives some of the Hutton story. The book is subtitled: \\"The Discovery of the Earth's Antiquity.\\"It is from Hutton that we've gotten the religious idea of Uniformitarianism, often identified with the phrase The Present is the Key to the Past. The idea is that by observing natural processes in today's world, a person would come to the conclusion that since these processes are generally very slow, it would take a long, long time to develop the geologic formations we see today. In the main, Hutton's idea was (and remains) a denial that the earth's feature could have been produced by a catastrophe, especially a water related event, in the earth's history.Repcheck's book (from Perseus Publishing, 2003) of some 200 pages plus a listing of source materials provides not only some insights into Hutton's life as a Scotsman and how Hutton came to his conclusions about earth history but also gives some interesting historical notes about 18th Century Scotland where Hutton lived. Recheck also reports that Hutton was not immune to the temptations of the flesh as he fathered a child by a young woman to whom he was not married.Though trained in medicine, Hutton apparently never pursued a medical career but felt it more interesting to do other things, including a stint at farming. He was very much attracted to Issac Newton and his work. From him, it is said, Hutton learned or picked up observational skills.Hutton, observing the give and take of tides and what he believed were pressures from deep in the earth, came to think that all of these would, over eons of time, create what he saw in front of his eyes. Hutton was not the first to come up with the thought that the earth was very old. He had probably read John Woodward's Essay Toward a Natural History of the Earth (1695) or William Whiston's New Theory of the Earth (1696) or perhaps G.L. de Buffon's 34 volume Histoire Naturelle (1749). These and other works of his day tended to stray away from the straight-forward reading of scripture. Hutton strayed even further from that path to the extent that the Bible was no longer considered a valid source of earth history. His thinking was first printed in 1788, based on lectures given in 1785. His book, The Theory of the Earth was finally published in 1795. Two years later, March 26, 1797, Hutton died, apparently of kidney failure.Today, in most corners of geologic thought, Hutton is considered the Father of modern geology. His idea of a long age for earth history encouraged Charles Lyell to write his Principles of Geology, three volumes completed by 1833. These, in turn, provided Charles Darwin the grist for his later efforts. Hutton led to Lyell led to Darwin; a series of ideas.Repcheck's work is interesting in that it provides a brief history of Hutton and his 18th Century thinking. As a balanced work, however, Repcheck could have gone a step further and showed that not all modern day geologists stand in awe of Hutton's work. There are many who take strong exception to the idea that the present is the key to the past but who, instead, maintain that the past is the key to the present. Many of these geologists are alive and well today and have written and spoken on the subject in many ways and venues but Repcheck does not mention them. This suggests that Repcheck is either ignorant of such people or is unwilling to acknowledge them for fear that some people might be tempted to hear what they have to say. In my opinion, it is the latter concern which Repcheck is facing.

Yes, the author is right that if Hutton had challenged the dominant mode of thought to create a new science and been the first person to challenge the biblical time-scale and the story of the flood, that he should be mentioned in the same breath as Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and the other greats...BUT HE DIDN'T!All of this had been already covered to varying degrees by many different scientists for only about oh, the last 100 years by the time Hutton showed up on the scene. He is in no way a founder of geology, he is only an important and early contributor.So regardless of whether the book is well written or not, the entire foundation for what it has to say is completely false, and thus completely worthless."},{"Title":"Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress: Upon Human Life and Thought","review":"I found this interesting because I've read Wells' most popular fiction novels and wanted to sample some of his social commentary, and because I've been collecting writings by famous futurists of the last century. Readers who are not similarly motivated may rate this book lower than I did. It's very different from his fiction, so if you liked \\"War of the Worlds\\" or \\"The Time Machine\\" or \\"The Shape of Things to Come\\" it doesn't necessarily follow that you will like this.The author's attempt to predict the social and technological developments of the 20th century from the vantage point of 1901 can be entertaining for both its hits and misses. For example, in his chapter on armed conflict, he correctly envisions long-range, highly accurate sniper rifles wielded by expert marksmen, but incorrectly guesses that these marksmen will maneuver through battlefields on bicycles. Also, writing two years before the first Wright brothers flight, he estimates that the first practical airplane will be demonstrated around 1950. His description of an aerial dogfight between dirigibles and his disbelief in the viability of submarines seem quaint.Wells was a product of 19th century England, so sometimes quaintness gives way to offensiveness from the perspective of the modern reader. Today, Wells would be considered racist and sexist. He also supported eugenics and euthanasia, including practices that have been widely discredited since the horrors of Nazism.Wells was also a socialist who distrusted both monarchies and democracies, believing that the global society of 2000 should be a New Republic that constituted a world state (or close to it) dominated by three or four languages. It would be led by an elite cadre of scientists, engineers, and medical doctors - a technocracy, as we'd call it today.Despite many inaccurate predictions, Wells did have some interesting insights on things like the growth of cities, the proliferation of labor-saving devices, the problems of the education system, and the evolution of journalism. For those who are comfortable with the writing style of the time (very long sentences and paragraphs; protracted sidebar discussions in lengthy footnotes), this is an intriguing historical sample of both social commentary and futurism."},{"Title":"Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress: Upon Human Life and Thought","review":"Around the turn of the century, 1901 a famous Sci-fi writer that is well known for predicting the future applies his trade.

I can't believe that this is Mr. Gonzalez's first effort into the publishing world. It was written so descriptively and clearly. I really appreciate the time and effort he put into following up his use of unfamilar (Jewish) terms with the definition. He also seems to have a wonderful grasp of understanding people and their emotions and motives. I really appreciate how the main character of Solomon Pliekin was able to get right to the heart of the matter when dealing with bigots and other such characters that are functioning, acting or reacting from ignorance and stereotypes. I enjoyed how each story drew us deeper into the lives of Sol and his deep religious beliefs but did not whack us over the head telling us that if we have different religious beliefs we are wrong or misguided.

More people need to be exposed to his deep, thoughtful and powerful understanding of what it means to be of strong faith yet allow others to be just as strong in their faith. It was also refreshing to read a good western tale that was not rife with gunshots and blood but instead matzah and moxie.

These stories are an expansion of his well-conceived Solomon Pliskin character.Pliskin is a Jewish Russian immigrant who sets up as a second hand goods dealer in the Old West.The stories are deceptively simple-I'd say most kids around age 10 on up could undestand and enjoy them. But there are plenty of hidden little touches that adults will appreciate. His most lighthearted stories have some darker subtexts, and his darker stories can be pretty amusing in places. He's twisty that way.All illustrate a moral point, but no heads are ever beaten with these ethical themes. They're there, you'll absorb them, but they don't taint the flavor at all. Further, these aren't gun tales as such, either, but as the time and place of the setting requires guns and gunplay, Mr. Gonzalez not disappoint in this respect. When guns are used, they are correct guns used realistically.There aren't a lot of Jewish-Western books. After this one, you'll hope for more."},{"Title":"Gleanings of Virginia history;: An historical and genealogical collection, largely from original sources","review":"I am related by marriage to one of the old Virginia families included in this book. Many members of this family have copies of this book and regard it as authoritative. The genealogies of the Anderson, Brown, Craig, Craven, Custis, Davis, Harrison, Newman, Smith, and Thomkins families are given in this book. Rosters and payrolls of the men in the Virginia companies that fought in the Revolutionary War are also compiled, as are other Revolutionary War documents and letters.In looking up General Robert E. Lee in this book, the closest thing to personal item that I was able to find is the fact that while President of Washington College in Lexington Va (now Washington and Lee University) General Lee exonerated (together with the courts) Charles H.

Quimby, of the New Thought movement in the United States. It describes the careers of the most influential teachers and writers in the various schools and movements, with the exception of the well-known Christian Science church.It is most successful in uncritically informing the reader of the roots of modern New-Age ideas, most of which were expressed more than a hundred years earlier. It is endlessly surprising to discover how little credit most spiritual leaders give to their ideological forbears and how, because of the lack of any coherent organization, a widespread unawareness of earlier discoveries persists.Although the author supplies an apparently comprehensive bibliography to the grateful student, the reader wishes that the text delineated more precisely the specific differences in philosophy among the several teachings, for it is those differences that produced the individual schools and distinct spiritual communities."},{"Title":"Spirits in Rebellion: The Rise and Development of New Thought","review":"Braden's text is a MUST for any serious student of metaphysics. The work delves deeply into the roots of New Thought and chronicles many key churches and movements throughout the United States and abroad. Braden writes with scholarly insight and spirit-led intuition. You won't be dissappointed!"},{"Title":"Spirits in Rebellion: The Rise and Development of New Thought","review":"Charles Samuel Braden (1878-1970) was a Methodist Episcopal Church missionary and educator, who was Professor of History and Literature of Religions at Northwestern University from 1926 until his retirement in 1954. He wrote a number of books on comparative religions, such as:The World's Religions, a Short History., andThese Also Believe,A Study of Modern Amereican Cults in Minority religious movements.\\"Spirits in Rebellion\\" has justifiably been called \\"the definitive history of New Thought.\\" Braden comprehensively and fairly covers the forerunners of the New Thought movement such as Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (who Braden identifies as \\"certainly the pioneer in America of the theory of the mental basis of disease\\") and Warren Felt Evans (whose failure to have founded a movement Braden attributes to the fact that \\"Evans was clearly not an organization man\\"), who each have their own chapter, as well as devoting separate chapters to the actual \\"religions\\" that emerged from the movement: the Unity School of Christianity, Divine Science, and Religious Science.He notes that New Thought developed in contrast to the \\"authoritarian\\" tendencies in Mary Baker Eddy's Christian Science church, and that Religious Science founder Ernest Holmes \\"did not expect that his writings would crystallize into hard and fast doctrines ... as in the case of Mrs. Eddy's.\\" Nevertheless, \\"the line of demarcation between the two (i.e., Christian Science and New Thought) is by no means clear and sharp.\\" Braden chronicles the Unity School founder Charles Fillmore's origins from the New Thought movement, but then his \\"growing dissatisfaction with the movement ... (which) had ceased to express what he thought to be absolute truth.\\"The book ends with chapters on \\"New Thought Leaders,\\" \\"Leaders Outside the Movement,\\" and several chapters on \\"New Thought Abroad.\\" Overall, this is an extremely informative, and highly interesting book for anyone interested in New Thought, Christian Science, Religious Science, Divine Science, the Unity School, metaphysical healing, or New Age ideas in general. VERY highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Spirits in Rebellion: The Rise and Development of New Thought","review":"While I have been metaphysical for some time I have never really given much thought to the development of this way of believing. Spirits In Rebellion has opened my mind to the amazing life work of many early Americans and people around the globe. This is not always an easy read due to the language structures used. I found I had to pay careful attention while reading this in order to fully understand some parts. There is an enormous amount of healing and other knowledge in this book. I found it helped me better understand why there are so many healing modalities and explained what natural law makes them work. I have recently become a serious student of metaphysics and find this book to be very enlightening."},{"Title":"Spirits in Rebellion: The Rise and Development of New Thought","review":"For those of us interested in the New Thought movement, this book is a must. It's size can be overwhelming and yet the detail and careful preservation of the names of those who came before us is amazing. In these days of instant everything, it is helpful to be reminded of those who took time, made the effort, strove ahead through all kinds of challenges, to bring a way of living in the world to our attention. I highly recommend that this book be on your library book shelves, not only for reference purposes but as a living memorial to these inspired and inspiring women and men."},{"Title":"Spirits in Rebellion: The Rise and Development of New Thought","review":"We're using this book in Agape ministerial school - U.T.S.L.A. - for our \\"Emergence of New Thought/Ancient Wisdom\\" class.

If you're interested in a brief on Northwest Coast Indian life, this is a reasonably good (if rather scholarly) place to start.However, I feel the book loses points because of the following reasons: it has precious few Native writers, and therefore lacks the Native perspective; it spends an awful lot of time focusing on the past, forcing Northwest tribes into an &quot;ethnogrpahic present;&quot; it needs desperately to be updated; and its illustrations are entirely in grainy black and white. Finally, Native readers may find themselves uncomfortable with both the sections devoted to forensics and shamanism."},{"Title":"Natural Health Complete Guide to Safe Herbs: What Every Consumer Should Know About Interactions and Side Effects for Hundreds of Herbs, Drugs, Supplements, and Foods","review":"Prescription and over-the-counter drugs can interact with herbs, so before taking an herbal formula it is a good idea to see which herbs should not be taken with various vitamins, minerals and prescription drugs. There are also some herbs that most people should avoid and this book contains the information you need to make the best decisions about your health.Herbs can be quite powerful and there can be side effects. There are seven sections that explain the 175 best herbs and how to use them to promote healing and relive minor symptoms.The Contents Include:Introduction - Why you should take charge of your health naturally.Safe & Effective Herbs - Safe herb catalog and herbal medicine explainedSafe and Effective Multiherb Formulas - Multiherb forumulas explainedHerb-Herb and Herb-Food Interactions - Potentially harmful interactionsDietary Supplement-Herb Interactions - Beneficial dietary interactions, harmful interactions.Drug-Herb Interactions - Drug catalog and understanding interactions.Herbs for Special Cases - Safe herbs for children, potential dangerous herbs for children, unsafe herbs for pregnant and nursing women, safe herbs for older adults, dangerous herbs for older adults.Buyer Beware - Herbal safety, herbs to avoid.Appendix - Reliable manufacturers, suppliers, top-selling herbs, index of safe herbs, conditions index, additional reading, easy-to-use index.Not only does this book give you the best information I've seen on herbal medicines, it also is beautifully illustrated with full-color pictures of the plants being discussed. The layout of the items is especially appealing and you will find this book easy-to-use and very practical.For instance, if you are taking Anacin 3, Asprin-Free Excedrin, Bayer Select, Excedrin PM, Panadol or Tylenol, these contain Acetaminophen which is a pain reliever and fever reducer. While there is no known herbal interactions, you may want to help prevent liver damage from long-term use of acetaminophen by taking Milk thistle. So, preventative care is also discussed in detail.The Index of Safe Herbs by conditions gives you information fast. If you have Insomnia, you can look up the name of the condition and you will find recommendations for Catnip, Chamomile, Dill seed and Valerian. To read about Chamomile in detail, you can easily look up the herb at the front of the book in the safe herb guide.What you will find is a picture of the herb plant, why it is used, how it works, comments and cautions and dosage information. For instance, if you can't sleep, but are using a blood-thinning drug like warfarin, or you are allergic to ragweed, you might want to skip that remedy and research a second option. In the beneficial herb-herb interactions tables, you will see that catnip and passionflower are good combinations to relieve anxiety and insomnia. However, they should not be used with antidepressants or MAOI antidepressant drugs like phenelzine.As with any remedy, it is a good idea to discuss your health issues with your doctor before taking herbal supplements or vitamins. Use this book to catch those items your doctor might not even be aware of. Most physicians don't seem to be aware of the side effects of herbs and don't take a great interest in this area. That has been my experience. Once you know what works for you, I think you will see your doctor less and feel empowered that you can in fact help your body heal with your own knowledge.Echinacea, olive leaf extract and oregano have literally been a miracle for me and my husband. Within about three days of catching a cold, we seem to recover and get on with life. Before, even on antibiotics, it took one to two weeks to get well.I looked up Olive Leaf on page 44 and sure enough it is used to treat infections, including colds and ear infections. It contains oleuropein, that has been shown to kill bacteria and viruses. It also has been used for antibiotic qualities for more than 6,000 years! Talk about an ancient remedy. Echinacea is also a Native America remedy and then you have oregano which contains substances that are known to be antibiotic and antifungal. I take the capsules as the oil is rather intense and is not recommended for internal use.Herbs may be the miracle you have been looking for.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Natural Health Complete Guide to Safe Herbs: What Every Consumer Should Know About Interactions and Side Effects for Hundreds of Herbs, Drugs, Supplements, and Foods","review":"This book is necessary for anyone even considering using herbs and herbal remedies for their family.

I started on an herb regiment four months ago (thanks to webmd.com), much to the dismay of my rheumatologist and cardiologist as I was already on fifteen prescription pills a day. With the help of the herbs I've been able to cut those pills in half. But I, too, was concerned about my ignorance as to the possible incompatibility of my newly found herbs with my doctor's advice and pills. Thanks to this book, we can all rest assured that I'm not messing with a dangerous mixture. Absolutely one hundred percent of my prescriptions were listed in the book and found to be safe with the herbs I'm now taking daily. The book is beautifully written with colorful pictures and easy-to cross-reference drugs, herbs, foods, etc. and their interactions with one another. At the end, a bonus that I had not expected: a long list of ailments offered to the reader who may have he or she's own agenda for wanting to try an alternative path to wellness. The mystery of these age-old remedies, that our ancestors probably used, is quickly unraveled in a written format simple enough for a child to understand. And, if I'm not mistaken, the author never once promised to cure cancer, etc. That would have been a giant signal to me that I was dealing with a quack. It is what it is, a guide to herbal usage. It's my new favorite book! P.S.

We also wanted to expose him to Christian message, and especially the stories from the Bible. After looking around at several different options I came across this little book. It seemed like an ideal first exposure to the Bible, and a great way to read to a really small child. I can sit him on my lap and hold the book right in front of him. I can read and show him the illustrations while holding him, something that has proven difficult with much larger books.The book is really tastefully and beautifully illustrated. The illustrations are really well done and will certainly appeal to kids of all ages. Roughly half of the book is dedicated to the Old Testament and the Other Half to the New Testament. The Old Testament includes a snapshots of some of the best known stories - Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, Moses parting the Red Sea, Daniel in the Lions' den, etc. The New Testament part is exclusively the Gospel accounts of some of the highlights from the life of Jesus. Each little \\"story\\" combines an illustration and four verses on the opposing page. I was worried that the verses might be corny, but they turned out to be quite well written. They are amusing and get the gist of the message that each episode is trying to convey. The verses can be used as a springboard for deeper discussion of the given Biblical stories.We just love this little book. I expect to read it very often in the upcoming months and years. Would definitely recommend it to parents of small children who want to expose their children to the Biblical stories from an early age."},{"Title":"His First Bible","review":"I got this product for my son, it works well for him because he is only 3 months old.

It's a beautifully illustrated little book and I continue to reread it hoping I can convince myself to give it to my great-nephew for his Baptism, but I just find the sweet little rhyming sentences to make no sense to a little one.I suppose you can say that it 'plants a seed' as I read from another reviewer, but I don't see that. Before purchase, I had read the first couple of pages that Amazon allowed me to preview and I thought ok, that is sweet (\\"God spoke to the night 'Let there be light!' And all the world grew sunny and bright\\". But then it just jumps on through with pages such as, \\"Rebekah did her part God knew she was smart. She gave the camels water And won Isaac's heart.\\" or \\"A coat of bright colors Angered the brothers, For Jacob loved Joseph More than the others.\\" ... then it jumps onto another chapter and so on.I get it that it is supposed to be only an 'introduction' to the bible, but these words mean nothing to a child and as the adult, I would find it difficult to elaborate into words so that a child can understand. I guess I just expected more of a simplifacation of God's creation and love for his children (words that comfort a child).I don't want to recommend that you not purchase it. It's just that in my opinion, it will not make any sense at all to a child or make him wonder/ponder about it ever. I even read this book to my husband and he actually disliked it.

The rest of the work is their detailed explication. Huxley unlike the present generation of anti- religious evolutionary scientists of the Dawkins Dennett school has a real understanding and appreciation of various aspects of the religious life. As he sees human life and development it is an overall evolutionary process. This is one reason why he could be a champion of the works of the Christian thinker Teillhard de Chardin who saw the whole development of mankind as motion towards higher and higher complexity, greater and greater spiritual development.Huxley's opposition is to a key element at the heart of the great monotheistic religions. He is opposed to the idea of a Supernatural Personal Being as Ruler and Guide of the Universe. He argues that there is no need for such a Diety as the method of natural science has given us a way of understanding the world without reference to such a Being. Yet Huxley does not classify himself as an ' atheist' but rather as an agnostic who is undecided on a matter he does not have enough evidence for.I should not mislead here. Huxley is an opponent of the religions of Revelation.However what I find interesting and even exciting in his work is not this but with his vision of Religion as ' an activity of man which suffers change like all other human activities: ... that as it grows it cannot avoid coming into contact both with intellectual and with moral or ethical problems and with the development and broadening of human experience and tradition.'As Huxley understands it the development of the human involves involves the development of what he calls the 'emotional side of the religious life' that aims at a ' communion with the divine'.For Huxley the scientific method is the method which yields truth . And if it does not yield certainty, it by its openness and being subject to endless questioning and re- testing is essential to bringing mankind to greater completion and knowledge.In other words it is almost as if Huxley sees Mankind as being able by itself to so transform its situation and reality as to move to greater and greater progress in religion.I think that even for a traditional religious believer like myself there is much to be learned from this modest, scholarly , learned and rich- in- ideas work and thinker."},{"Title":"Visual Symphony: A Photographic Work in Four Movements","review":"The book contains glossy reproductions of Mr.Barnbaum's black and white photographs. Each picture is about 8X10 inches. The quality of the reproductions is high. You could cut the pages out and have them framed, though you wouldn't want to.The book is divided into four sections, called, FIRST MOVEMENT(forests, ice crystals, Goosenecks State Park in Utah, and deserts), SECOND MOVEMENT(ancient cathedrals in Europe), THIRD MOVEMENT (modern skyscrapers in the USA), and FOURTH MOVEMENT(slot canyons in southern Utah and northern Arizona). The very first photograph, which is from the FIRST MOVEMENT, starts the book on a dramatic note. It shows a fallen tree, white because it is stripped of its bark, wedged between two standing redwood trees. The trees in background are somewhat removed from the scene because of the thick fog. The stiff, light-colored fallen tree, wedged between two adjacent redwoods has certain overtones.Moving on to the SECOND MOVEMENT, where the subject matter is ancient cathedrals, one appreciates the difficulty in taking some of these pictures. Difficulty arises because of the low levels of light, requiring exposures of up to 21 minutes (plate 38). Another difficulty resulted from the magnitude of contrast between areas within cathedral illuminated by sunlight, and areas plunged in deep shadows.The photographs in the THIRD MOVEMENT, disclose modern skyscrapers. In particular, the photographs entitled CHICAGO (1986), CALGARY (1985), NEW YORK (1986), and LOS ANGELES (1985), resemble paintings by Piet Mondrian. DALLAS (1986) resembles the paintings of Richard Estes.The great accomplishment of this book is the slot canyons, or slit canyons, of the FOURTH MOVEMENT. This is not just a great accomplishment for the book, but a great accomplishment in the history of American photography.Plate 65 is like an optical illusion, and shows a column-like formation. The optical illusion is that it is uncertain if the columns are concave or convex. Plate 66 shows two window-like formations, one above like a skylight, while the other below revealing a garden. Plate 68 shows mud, but what mud!!! What we see is mud having a metallic shimmer, like the kind that Elliot Porter has photographed. Plate 72 shows two parallel logs, both wedged into the width of a slot canyon. Plates 74, 81, 83, 84, 85, and 86, show swirling abstract designs in stone. Plate 89 shows a pyramidal striped rock having stripes residing in the center of the picture, while a snake sits in the sand at the bottom left. While Mr. Barnbaum did not discover the slot canyons, it is likely that he popularized them, and stimulated the boom in color photography of these mysterious and hard-to-reach underground alcoves.After the plates, we find fifteen pages of intelligent narrative, relating to technical details, goals, and problems that needed to be overcome in taking the pictures."},{"Title":"Visual Symphony: A Photographic Work in Four Movements","review":"In my opinion, one can tell if a book of photographs is worth having if: 1) the viewer is torn between looking at the photo at hand and the desire to turn the page and see what visual marvel is coming next ... 2) if one can't wait to grab a camera and go outside to try do capture something beautiful. These are why this book succeeds as a collection; it accomplishes both.If you are a photographer-wanna-be or a seasoned artist, this book is worth having and studying. Click.

The plot ramps up slowly at the start but once it gets going, hang on for the adventure of your life- it is non-stop heart pounding action. And throw in a budding romance and you have one heck of a tale. I found the White Company a more tightly constructed book then Sir Nigel, which was subsequently written as the prequel to the White Company. I found the final ending of the story a tad Hollywoodish, but I suppose he wanted a happy one. All in all, one of the most memorable books I've read."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"I first read this book over 50 years ago, and wondered how I would like it now. I found it to be an absorbing description of feudal times in England and what we now call France. I can readily see why the French dislike the English, although 700 years seems a long time to hold a grudge! The book is a fine adventure, with lots of detail about combat in the 13th century. The style may be a little slow for those used to a modern pace."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"My parents had a series of books when I was a child.

It was a beautifully constructed story; an education about chivalry and how wars used to be fought.

The The White Company was written before Sir Nigel; however, Sir Nigel (Nigel Loring) is set earlier and should be read first. Although famous for Sherlock Homes, Doyle was knighted for his historical novels of which these are two. Both books are excellent for young people forming their characters."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"The White Company, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an inspiring tale of knightly honor and chivalry. Though famous for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in writing The White Company, produced an extremely vivid account of the horrors of medieval warfare, while mixing in moments of humor to create an inspirational and highly enjoyable tale.The protagonist, Alleyne Edricson, is a young man come fresh from the monastery to explore the world and all it has to offer, as his father had wished. Soon after leaving the monastery, Alleyne meets a beautiful young lady and her father, Sir Nigel Loring. Alleyne then becomes squire to Sir Nigel, a humorous and highly respected knight, and the adventure begins. While fighting abroad, Alleyne proves himself to be a worthy suitor for the lovely Lady Maude, Sir Nigel's daughter, and returns from the war as a courageous and honored knight to marry her.Though the characters are at times two-dimensional, Doyle does a superb job of endearing them to the reader and enabling the reader to feel as if he or she really knows the characters. The White Company, an escape fiction novel, is an excellent example of formula fiction. The characters are mostly stock, and the ending is a happy one. The worthy hero rescues the damsel in distress, loses her for a while, but returns to win back her love. Even though the novel contains some flat characters and stereotypes, a dose of reality is present in the horror of war portrayed by Doyle.This account of knights, war, and fair ladies is permeated with the theme of honor. The code of chivalry for medieval knights is a well-developed theme presented by Doyle. This valuable theme mixed with an enjoyable and funny story makes this novel unique. The White Company is a well-written, interesting book and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"If the Divine is in the details, than this novel is touched by It with easily readable and rich details alive with imagery.

There were some minor inconsistencies between the two books--which were probably occasioned by Sir A. C.

(I won't detail the discrepancies, so as not to diminish the reading enjoyment for those who missed them.) I was glad I purchased both books together, though, because they're both worth reading.

Alleyene intervenes, which causes his brother to set dogs upon him. Alleyene then decides to become a squire to a knight, the knight happens to be the beautiful young lady's father. Alleyene goes off to war and gets involved in battle. Some soldiers called Alleyene weak because he dwelled on the horrors of war, but Alleyenes friend explained his weakness. &quot; It is not weakness of heart, for I know the lad well. His heart is as good as thine or mine, but he hath more in his pate than ever you will carry under that tin pot of thine, as a consequence he can see further into things, so that they weigh upon him more.&quot; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle brings the story alive with vivid detail and characterization.

Containing detailed descriptions of heraldry, castles, weapons, and cities, The White Company takes you back in time to the romanticized world of knight errants, damsels in distress, gallant squires, but does not shy away from the more realistic facts of Medieval life - starving peasants, blood-and-piss battles, captives and ransoms, rape, pillage, and plunder. The White Company contains, among other things:a chase with archers and knights,an awesome sword fight,a giant who can fire an arrow 600 metres,a sea battle between pirates and a merchant boat,a rampaging bear,a gunpowder explosion,an archery competition where Longbowmen shoot birds out of the sky,a pseudo-monk,a wrestling match in a tavern,a last stand between five knights and thousands of starving, crazed peasants,a huge battle in the end,a princess who lives in a nunnery,a lord and a archer taken slave,and much, much more. But the best thing is that the book won't drown you if you tie it around your neck and go swimming and if you put it in your suitcase it won't be overweight: The White Company is just the right length.On a different note, it must be remembered that Conan Doyle was INTENSELY patriotic and much of this book had parallels with England's situation then. So if you don't like that sort of \\"England is supreme. French are dogs.\\" sort of stuff, avoid....The White Company contains one of my favorite poems, an old archer's song: The Song of the Bow. I will show some of it here:What of the Bow?The Bow was made in England:Of true wood, of yew wood;The Wood of English bows;So men who are freelove the old yew-treeAnd the land where the yew tree grows....What of the Shaft?The Shaft was cut in England:a long shaft, a strong shaft;Barbed and trim and true:So we'll drink all togetherto the grey goose featherAnd the land where the grey goose flew....The White Company is one of my favourite books, and I have read many.

Although he is well known for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Doyle was most proud of creating the noble knight, Sir Nigel Loring of the White Company.This book is set in the tumultuous days of the 14th century, when the political struggles among England, France and Spain, and the Crusades in the Holy Land, created instablity for peasant and noble alike. There are many heroes in the tale of knights and battles, but young Alleyne Edricson is the main protagonist. Sheltered in an abbey, where the orphaned lad was educated per his noble father's wishes, Alleyne is unwillingly shoved into the world for a period of a year, where he must decide whether he wishes to make his way there or return to a monastic life.It doesn't take long for Alleyne to meet with adventure. He is shocked to find the world is a rough and tumble place. But his straightforward and naive approach to life helps him out of some scrapes and endears him to some colorful characters who become his bosom companions. Together, they join the service of Sir Nigel, who is an unlikely hero with his bald head, bad eyesight and scrawny stature. That is, until he is able to prove himself in \\"some small feat of arms,\\" which is his favorite pastime. He is always victorious in these exhibitions of his knightly prowess, and he always has a kind word for the vanquished, his noble opponent. His motivation is always to defend the honor of his \\"lovely\\" wife, for whom he cherishes the greatest tenderness, although others wonder if this is due to his poor vision rather than any attractiveness on his lady's part.There are many satisfying battles and cliffhangers in this book. Sir Nigel plunges headlong into any opportunity for a fight. Alleyne becomes his squire and follows him to France, to fight for their Prince, Edward III, who wants to restore the vanquished king of Spain. Alleyne becomes adept at sword fighting and exhibits as much bravery as his lord. He is also motivated by the love of a lady, Sir Nigel's lovely daughter, Maude.I read this book aloud to my children, and we shared many moments of laughter as we followed the warriors from England to France. I struggled a bit with the French pronunciation of names and places (how do you pronounce \\"Blois\\"?), but it was a very funny and exciting book, and I'm glad we were able to read it together. Doyle was an expert on this time period as his mother read him many chivalric tales as a boy, exciting his interest in medieval times, which continued into his adulthood. The descriptions of weaponry, customs, religious life, clothing, historical events and geography permeate the story without detracting from it. There are numerous stirring and gory events (including pirates, hangings, peasant uprisings and decapitations...yuck), which will have readers on the edge of their seats. Of course, the illustrations by N.C. Wyeth added to our enjoyment.There is another book about Sir Nigel, a prequel to The White Company, called Sir Nigel, which we will have to read soon. He has become one of our favorite literary characters."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"I can't remember how I happened on this book- probably Amazon herded me to it- but I'm quite glad. I'm more of a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but I found this as enjoyable as The Black Arrow or Robin Hood or any other medieval book that I've read, and I'd never even heard of it before. The protagonist is a young man raised at the monastery who joins a band of rough but good hearted archers and follows their exploits as they head to war in France and Spain. The old agnostic (Doyle) weaves in more respect for the Catholic church than one usually sees from so-called church leaders today, combined with some common sense insights of true morality. For Doyle chivalry not only is not dead, it'll cut off the head of anyone who says otherwise. In other words, a man's word was worth something, and a man's actions were worth even more. Lots of swordplay, a little (very little) romance, some interesting and well developed characters, and an undercurrent of humor. Not as clever as the Holmes books, but a lot more action, and one learns a little English history at the same time. I'd highly, highly recommend it for kids, or anyone really, and I am amazed that it's fallen through the cracks to this point- at least for me."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"I cannot tell you how much fun this book is...you will have to read it yourself. This is the kind of book that you must immerse yourself in. Give yourself the time to just sink into Conan Doyle's world. It is easy to do, because Conan Doyle had a gift for imagery. The book is so complete. It shows both the beauty and the barbarity of the times with complete harmony. It is also downright funny at times. I have found myself laughing out loud while reading this book, largely because of the language used. Yes, the language is sometimes hard to follow, but who wouldn't laugh at \\"I have been cozened and bejaped!\\"? I think the author does this on purpose because it IS funny. It is interesting to compare The White Company with Crichton's recent novel \\"Timeline\\", set in the same era. Both authors worked to bring the flavor of that time to the reader, but with vastly different aims and results. Anyway, give yourself a break and escape into another world. Go to battle with Hordle John, Sam Aylward, and Alleyne! Then go sample another of Conan Doyle's little known gems and read of the outrageous exploits of Brigadier Gerard!"},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"I recently purchased this book for my husband and myself to enjoy together. Needless to say, he's been hogging it every night. Occasionally I hear him giggling (at a passage) like a ten-year-old boy.

Complete with knights and archers both dashing and dumpy (Sir Oliver), and even pirates, it almost reads like a serial novel in this respect.

While we all know stories like The Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Doyle's classic and simple-hearted story about English adventurers in the Hundred Years' War is a largely unknown work. I purchased it as a lark, and because it cost a single dollar, and its worth was proved to be many times repaid.In reading The White Company, it is best to set aside expectations of sophisticated or intricate character development--this is a story that does best with a sympathetic reader, already steeped in the daydreams of bygone days and lusty battle--and simply have fun. Also, this is the kind of book that a person with some grounding in history will get more out of than someone ignorant of the 14th century. Perhaps it's advisable to obtain a little background information before settling into the book; assumptions about educational background were--ahem--more stringent in 1900 than today.This is a man's story, to be sure, and it appeals to the insurgent lurking within all men. However, it isn't offensive to womankind, either, revealing the strength of the female characters as well. Enjoy with confidence.One last comment: If, at the end of the story, you don't a lump in your throat, or feel a stirring in your heart to don a steel cap, lace on a jerkin and take up a stout length of yew, you've missed the point."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"Though popularly remembered for the Sherlock Holmes stories, the historical novels of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are more illustrative of his literary flair and narrative skill.'The White Company' and 'Sir Nigel' are set during the Hundred Years War between England and France, focused around the figure of Sir Nigel Loring, a chivalrous knight whose thirst for honour and glory pull him and his companions into many strange and warlike adventures.Mixing real historical figures such as Edward III and the Black Prince with creations of his own, Doyle manages to weave a number of separate incidents into an interesting and highly enjoyable tale. At times very humourous, these stories nevertheless also describe the harsher realities of medieval war, presenting a colourful picture. Though characterisation is sometimes two-dimensional, Sir Nigel as the main protagonist is both funny and endearing.

Coincidentally, some of the character names/personalities find their way to S.M. Stirling's alternate worlds novels as well."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"Everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. What many readers aren't aware of is that in addition to detective fiction, Doyle also ventured into historical fiction. Doyle's 1891 historical novel The White Company is one of his early efforts in this genre, and I found the medieval adventure great fun.Beginning in England in 1366, during the Hundred Years War, the novel begins with our protagonist Alleyne Edricson venturing forth into the world for the first time. Raised until age 20 in a monastery per his deceased father's instructions, those instructions also require that he go forth into the world for a year before he can choose to return to the monastery. The sheltered young man ventures into the world with little idea of what to do but to visit his older brother and try not to fall prey to the dangers the monks have warned him of.Alleyne soon encounters two companions, however. Hordle John is a rough and wild giant of a man who has been tossed out of the monastery the same day Alleyne leaves. Samkin Aylward is an archer just returned from France and service in the White Company, loaded with plunder, who regales Alleyne, John, and anyone else who'll listen with tales of his exploits. Samkin convinces Alleyne and John to join him in visiting Sir Nigel Loring, a brave and well-respected knight of England who he hopes to recruit as the new leader of the White Company and to return France and beyond for great deeds. Sir Nigel quickly agrees, as he is full of chivalrous fervor to do great deeds of battle and gain honor. Sir Nigel takes Alleyne as a squire, while Alleyne takes an interest of his own in Sir Nigel's daughter, Lady Maude. After months of preparations and recruiting of additional archers and men-at-arms, Sir Nigel leads the company abroad. Great deeds of honor are performed in France in friendly tournament before the White Company goes to Spain to face real war, and a variety of exciting adventures are had along the way.While reading The White Company, I couldn't help but be reminded of The Black Arrow, Robert Louis Stevenson's 1888 historical novel set a hundred years later during the Wars of the Roses, and also featuring a young knightly protagonist and daring adventures. As big a fan as I am of Stevenson, I enjoyed The White Company much more. The characters are much more likable, there's much more humor, Doyle keeps the medieval language much more accessible for modern readers, and overall, it's just a lot more fun. Doyle's action scenes - Stevenson's definite strong suit in The Black Arrow - are as good as Stevenson's, and the White Company leads in every other aspect between the books.I believe my fellow fans of J.R.R Tolkien would enjoy The White Company. Though a historical novel and not a fantasy novel, it shares some of the high and noble adventure that sets Tolkien apart from the more grim interpretations of fantasy. At times some of the beliefs of the day reflected in The White Company, such as a woman who has prophetic visions, are closer to fantasy than today's reality anyway. Had Doyle just put in a dragon for Sir Nigel and Alleyne to fight (although Tolkien would probably have had Samkin the archer deal the deal blow to the beast), this would have make a perfect fantasy novel.I read a version of The White Company illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. I first encountered Wyeth through his illustrations of many of Stevenson's works, and he really brings some of the most exciting scenes of the book to life with his art. Wyeth illustrating an edition of an adventure story is becoming a signal to me that I'll probably enjoy it.I highly recommend Doyle's The White Company to anyone who enjoys tales of knights, archers, and chivalric adventures, as well as to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings. I had read and enjoyed some of Doyle's Holmes stories before, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how strong Doyle's historical fiction was. I definitely plan to read Sir Nigel, a follow-up book from Doyle chronicling the early adventures of that character."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"Note: This review is of the 1922 hardcover edition published by the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, New York, with illustrations by N.C.

It has been asserted that Doyle regarded his historical novels, THE WHITE COMPANY being one of them, more highly than his (now) better-remembered Sherlock Holmes exploits.The place is England and the Continent, the year is 1366 during the reign of the King of the English, Edward III, and his realm is twenty-nine years into The Hundred Years' War with France.The male heroes of the story are three plus one: Samkin Aylward, a grizzled archer of the White Company, an English mercenary force, Alleyne Edricson, a twenty-year old clerk raised by Cistercian monks in Beaulieu Abbey since infancy who's now sent out into the larger world to learn something of it before choosing a permanent vocation, and the red-haired giant Hordle John, a disgraced Brother of the same abbey tossed out because of his self-indulgent ways. The trio then joins a fresh contingent of the White Company raised by the renowned and veteran knight, Sir Nigel Loring, at Castle Twynham in the Hampshire town of Christchurch. Alleyne himself is taken on as Loring's personal squire and, for the two months prior to the company's departure for the Continent, is the tutor of Sir Nigel's teenage daughter, Lady Maude. Edricson is, naturally, smitten, and he goes off to war carrying her green veil as a token of favor.Doyle's novel, written during the time when the Empire still spanned the globe, is, above all, a paean to England and its common men that transformed themselves into their country's stanch expeditionary warrior forces. As a song in the book has it:\\"What of the men?The men were bred in England:The bowman - the yeoman -The lads of dale and fell.Here's to you - and to you!To the hearts that are trueAnd the land where the true hearts dwell.\\"As might be surmised, THE WHITE COMPANY is also a coming-of-age story and a great road adventure. Emerging from the protective cocoon of Beaulieu Abbey, Alleyne is a completely blank slate, a slate upon which will be writ the learning experiences of a journey that will take him to Spain to fight in what will later become known in history as the Castillian Civil War, a peripheral conflict of The Hundred Years' War. Doyle ensures that the values learned mature Edricson into his ideal of a proper and true-hearted Englishman.A main thread that runs through the entire work is chivalry as practiced by an honorable knight, the poster boy being Sir Nigel. A 21st century reader of this 19th century book may find the romantic view of this warrior philosophy somewhat quaint if not downright ridiculous, as perhaps reflected in these words by Loring to an innkeeper when the former learns of the presence of an anonymous but otherwise bellicose knight within:\\"Go tell him that a humble knight of England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies. Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.\\"Loring is, of course, inviting the other knight to meet him in personal combat on the spot. The contemporary reader may be tempted to mutter, \\"Oh, puhleeeze!\\" However, in 1891, such a challenge, and the courtliness it stemmed from, was likely to be fondly remembered and admired.There was a flip side to chivalry, however. It was a code of conduct that governed relations between members of the nobility only, i.e. from knight on up to princes and kings; there was no obligation for the aristocracy to treat the lower classes similarly. Indeed, a noble landholder could treat his villeins abominably and still be considered chivalrous; only the Church might perhaps prevail upon such a lord to treat his serfs more justly and charitably. Doyle does not shirk from referencing this in the storyline.THE WHITE COMPANY contains thirteen color plates by the painter N.C. Wyeth in a magnificent illustrative style that hasn't been employed in decades.Not surprisingly, Doyle's adventure novel has an old-fashioned air to it. It's a solid tale with a fairly predictable story; there are no plot twists that cause a mental double-take or can claim a \\"gotcha.\\" It was undoubtedly recommended for the adolescent and young adult readers of the period much as I, in my youth, devoured the epic adventures by author Joseph Altsheler, particularly theClassic American Fiction: Altsheler's Young Trailers Series, all 8 novels in a single file, with active table of contents. That said, THE WHITE COMPANY grandly accomplishes what it was penned to do, both entertain and teach moral values."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' simplified English series)","review":"With this book set after Sir Nigel yet written prior, Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle has set the framework of chivalry as it should have been.

However, it is important to distinguish what the Church considers to be the social concerns versus what is commonly thought of as \\"social issues\\", especially in the United States. The latter deal mostly with the problems of individual personal, morality, while the term social concerns is used in this encyclical and other Church documents to denote more general social developments - economic, civic, and political. In the eyes of the Church these social developments ought to be founded on the individual morality as a bare minimum for a just social order, but the term is much more comprehensive.The Catholic Church has long emphasized the distinction between raw progress on one hand and genuine human development on the other hand. The two are not exclusive, and in practice they can reinforce each other, but if we put too much emphasis on material progress without the regard for the uplifting of our fellow human beings we may end up living in a very unjust and disordered society.The authentic human development goes well beyond the economic concerns. The Church has never professed a preference for one economic system over another, and has no desire to play an arbiter in the domain of economics. At the time of writing of this encyclical Marxist collectivism still seemed like a viable way of structuring the economy, but the Church didn't find it necessary to either endorse it or condemn it. However, this encyclical makes it clear that the freedom to engage in private enterprises is a fundamental freedom for the proper functioning of a just society.This is a well-written and instructive look at Catholic Church's view of the development of a society as a whole. Some of the concerns may seem a bit dated today, but overall this encyclical addresses the perennial problems that all societies face as they struggle to provide the prosperity and security for all of their citizens."},{"Title":"Unseen New York","review":"This seminal work by the late New York photographer, Mark Feldstein, is a quiet document of architectural decay on the verge of extinction. The title is apt: None of these images are of subject matter to which anyone else has devoted attention. I imagine other artists have passed by these neglected vignettes of corroding detail without so much as a first glance, not to mention a second. In a city famous for a skyline populated by Art Deco, modernist, Neo-Gothic, and faux Classical skyscrapers, Feldstein presents us with Lower Manhattan's less famous and more superannuated buildings. They are the unseen facades, doorways, steam grates, fuseboxes, stoops, and vestibules, of purely utilitarian edifices -- which have long since outlived their usefulness.In the city that gave birth to the phrase \\"Madison Avenue\\" -- employed to bring the attention of the consuming public to words projected loudly, whether by voice, loudspeaker, in print, or on television -- Feldstein's lens rarely falls on anything of more graphic import than the occasional house number. Indeed, if the author and publisher hadn't denoted New York City in its title, there would be scant evidence of this book's locale. It is akin to the intimate portrait of a famous -- but elusive -- screen siren, taken in the privacy of her hitherto unseen boudoir, but always from behind, her face ever hidden.Feldstein's preoccupation with architectural forms -- as carved into, divided, juxtaposed, and sequestered by dark, cavernous shadows -- brings an element of fastidious formality to these otherwise pedestrian objects. Cornices, windowsills, and banisters in their state of irretrievable dry-rot, are photographed with the same exacting care that Walker Evans devoted to his own architectural studies of New England and the antebellum South. What is most refreshing is that Dover printed his shadows dark and deep -- refreshing from the perspective of 2010, that is. Today, almost all photographers march in lockstep conformity in rendering a high degree of \\"shadow detail\\" in their prints. More aesthetic sophistry than sophisticated, this effect has long ago worn out its welcome. I prefer shadows be what they were meant to be: Pools of darkness that obscure a mystery not readily apparent to the viewer's eye. Whether this was Feldstein's intention, or Dover's inaccurate printing (the same treatment of shadows in the eight color plates suggest it's intentional) doesn't matter so much as its effect: The photographs in this volume hearken back to an era when artists' service to their subject matter was more important than artists making a subtle aesthetic statement that all but obliterates the profound simplicity of its subject's beauty.When this modest book of photographs was published in 1975, most of the subjects were seemingly on the verge of destruction. None of them are captioned, which adds to their mystery. I can only imagine the urban archaeological expedition that would need to be assembled to track down the presumably few locales still remaining undemolished.As for the product itself, I own a first printing (I believe its only). The pages have not yellowed at all; however, the cover was definitely not printed on acid-free paper, and has indeed yellowed. This yellowing has bled onto the first and last pages, but none of the others.That said, do not let that deter you from purchasing this largely-forgotten gem of American photography in its heyday, and the work of one photography's lesser-heralded masters."},{"Title":"Watching for the wind; the seen and unseen influences on local weather","review":"This truly under-appreciated gem of a book brings weather knowledge from charts and graphs into the realm of observational natural history. Its only drawback is that it is primarily about Southern and Central California.

More importantly, it teaches how to use what one sees, feels and smells to understand our atmosphere and what comes next. Special attention is paid to the influences of California geography on microclimate.I read this book at least 25 years ago, but it remains with me.

At the time most of the existing books of this kind were about transforming flea market finds with thorough restoration or with a flick paint, often disguising the wear and tear of the objects. Or the look was the grandiose or ultra frilly traditional shabby chic. In the midst of these trends the style in this book seemed very fresh and modern, and I still find it a pleasure to look at this book, which is why I decided to get a copy for myself instead of checking it out from the library from time to time.This is a beautiful and inspiring book, that has been very influential in the interior decoration.

Back into the culture of Great Britain and into my youth."},{"Title":"The Book of Eve (New Canadian Library)","review":"I first discovered this 1973 novel around 1976 when I was a junior in high school. I was very impressed with the story of a 60-something woman (which was ANCIENT to me at the time!) who has spent 40 years in an unhappy marriage, with the husband now disabled, petulant, and demanding, and who one day sets down the tea tray, packs her hairbrush, and walks out without a word. At the time I found Eva an inspiring character, and the story was in a pseudo-journal style, which I enjoy.In high school, I too was looking for ways out, not wanting to be doomed to family expectations, and Eva's story also seemed a cautionary tale about what could happen to someone who did not take charge of her own life sooner. Eva ends up impoverished, making ends meet by picking up items to sell at the pawn shop, yet feeling an enduring sense of freedom and gratitude. But I think her story made me less worried about becoming a \\"bag lady,\\" one of the big fears of my generation, since Eva did quite well on her own with her small pension cheque, thank you, and the life of a poor old lady was, overall, better than her previous life of marital servitude.When I reverently gave the novel to my aunt to read, she was less impressed. How could Eva just walk out on her marriage like that, when her husband needed her? Unfortunately, my Christian aunt's marriage broke up several years later, which goes to remind one that marital commitment is not always returned in kind anyway.The premise of the novel stuck with me all these years, but for a long time I had the title wrong, so I couldn't find it again, and of course it was long out of print by the time I did. But once I had title and author, it wasn't long before I found a copy at a used bookstore (the Green Apple Annex in San Francisco, if you must know).How does it play 30 years later? First, I found Eva a less inspiring character personally than before. The fact that she has recriminations about her actions does not excuse her selfishness in not communicating with her worried family. In fact, she is a judgmental and often disagreeable old lady herself, and the people who are able to get close to her do so in spite of herself. Yet she is intelligent and resourceful, qualities that had been suppressed in her life as wife and mother. However, all that \\"I'm so bad!\\" introspection without changing her behavior comes off as tedious now. The side characters come off as more interesting and complex, which Eva in her suburban snootiness is slow to appreciate, though eventually she does come around.But there was a completely new and unexpected pleasure in Beresford-Howe's nature writing. She describes the changing of the harshly beautiful Montreal seasons in dazzling, radiant, and poetic detail. That was the kind of stuff I skimmed over in high school, but it is one of the pleasures of style that I could not appreciate when I was reading only for plot.So, in appreciation for a novel that is layered enough to change with the age of the reader, and in gratitude that it wasn't a stinker after all these years of fond remembrance, five stars to ya, baby!"},{"Title":"The Book of Eve (New Canadian Library)","review":"Constance Beresford-Howe wrote a delightful little book in 1973 called &quot;The Book of Eve&quot;. Eve had a comfortable life in the well-to-do English neighborhood in Montreal, as a wife, and a mother of one grown son. On the day she received her first pension check, she walked out of that life to start a journey of personal growth and exploration. She made discoveries about herself, her husband, and her son along the way that shocked her, but she became self-sufficient and a stronger person.This is the kind of story that pulls you back into it again and again, so that, with each rereading, you see new aspects of Eve, her past life, and the life ahead of her."},{"Title":"The Book of Eve (New Canadian Library)","review":". breaking freeReviewer:Date: Feb3/044:56:25 PMI first read this novel many years ago and was struck by what I felt was the honesty of the story. Eva physically walks out of her life one day but probably had been rehearsing this exit in her mind, over and over again.Only a woman who is curious enough to read this story could see the possibilty of leaving a long marriage, and could appreciate what was troubling and trapping Eva. Turning sixty-five was certainly a turning point for her and it just felt right for her to leave that particular day. SHe certainly discovers in her new life that money, status , and material goods won't bring happiness or fulfillment. In her new situation she can freely express her acceptance of human frailty .

Every other version I've tried has been a terrible waste of money and I wonder how long it's going to be before Amazon starts acting responsibly and deleting the worthless e-text versions of this and other collections or offering trial samples of every book listed so people will stop being ripped off.The only improvement I could see is for the table of contents and the individual listings to be justified on the right side of the screen next to the Kindle cursor, but the spacing is wide enough between lines that this is really just quibbling.

First, it's not properly using the Kindle \\"table of contents\\" feature. While there is a page near the front of the book that says \\"Table of Contents\\" on top and has links to the contents of the book, if you load up the Kindle's \\"Go to...\\" feature the \\"table of contents\\" button is grayed out, so they must not have tagged their table of contents page correctly.Secondly, and much more importantly, there are no line breaks after the individual lines of dialogue in the play. Shakespeare's plays are mostly composed in iambic pentameter, and these iambic pentameter sections are almost always printed like poetry, with a line break after each \\"line\\" of five iambic feet, so that you can discern the meter more easily. In the sample chapter of this book, there are no such line breaks, and all the dialogue runs together into paragraphs. Having the line breaks in the right place is one of the baseline requirements for an edition of Shakespeare, so I give this one star.If the publisher revises the book to correct these two features, then it'll be worth taking a second look at this edition.

Which is a shame, because the rebellion is what we really want to learn about. It would be like reading a book about the Alamo that ended just when Santa Anna was first approaching the Rio Grande and had not yet even entered into Texas.

This book is mainly constructed through letters and diaries from the period, and little is left to the imagination as the author chillingly describes the savagery of this particular time. An excellent read for those interested in Civil War history, and to hear a knock at the door in the middle of the night, being asked if you are &quot;Pro-slavery or a Jayhawker&quot;, and knowing that a wrong answer would probably mean death is harrowing just thinking about it."},{"Title":"War to the Knife: Bleeding Kansas, 1854-1861","review":"A native Kansan, Goodrich obviously knows the history of his state. War to the Knife provides a very vivid look at the conflict between pro-slavery and free state settlers in Kansas in the lead up to the Civil War, drawing heavily from personal accounts and local newspaper reports. This approach also helps Goodrich maintain a balance in presenting the views of both sides of the conflict, their hatred of each other and their diametrically opposed agendas. The one area where the book was lacking was in its discussion of the role of the federal military and government in the conflict. Goodrich does discuss the few times the military did intervene in the conflict and the lack of power that the multiple territorial governors had over the settlers, but I found myself wanting to know more about why the military and government did not take a stronger role in preserving law and order in the territory. Despite that, the motives of the various free state and pro-slavery leaders are discected fairly well -- especially John Brown whose raid on Harpers Ferry is used to open and close the book."},{"Title":"War to the Knife: Bleeding Kansas, 1854-1861","review":"Goodrich adds to his works on US Western history with a well-paced history of the guerilla warfare between abolitionist and pro-slavery forces in the struggle for statehood in Kansas. The author relys extensively on personal accounts of the violent and brutal actions of both sides of the conflict. Readers will find his impartial examination a valuable asset. The more experienced historian may find the book long on drama, short on analysis, particulary the impact of these events on the Eastern political establishment. Nonetheless, a valuable addition to the literature and a great follow-on to his earlier &quot;Black Flag&quot; which describes the events that follow in the Civil War itself. I found this a timely book to read after Russell Banks &quot;Cloudsplitter&quot;, a fictional account of John Brown which includes many events found in &quot;War to the Knife&quot;."},{"Title":"War to the Knife: Bleeding Kansas, 1854-1861","review":"First, what I liked about the book: it's a well-written, lively narrative that at times reads like a novel. Particularly interesting is the way the author personalizes the story through the words of both participants and victims. They actually come alive on the page. Opening and closing at Harper's Ferry is also effective. It was hard to put the book down, that is, until I got to the part about the benign character of Missouri slavery, about the chattels' actual love for and devotion to their masters. The author works diligently throughout to give the slave breeders and abolitionist-terrorists equal billing. There are two sides to the story, you see. Often the slave drivers are seen as hapless victims - of the mad John Brown, of self-serving Jayhawkers, of fanatical free soil men. He tells the Border Ruffian side through uncritical citations from their local press. One is left to his own to decide what is true or not.Another problem with the book is that the story of Bleeding Kansas is told with precious little reference to what was happening in the country, in Washington, at the time. It is very Kansas-western Missouri focused. There is brief discussion of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the caning of Sumner, reactions to Kansas events in the Northern press. But it's almost as though Kansas plays itself out in a vacuum. We are riveted to the blow-by-blow on the ground - in the settlements, on the prairie. He tells that story well and in rich detail. What is missing is the bigger picture, what it all means for a country careening toward civil war. On one level, I suppose this is a strength of the book: underplaying the national scene allows him to go into much greater detail on the life and times of the participants.In sum, the book is worth the read - a story well told - if you can get past the author's cryptic sympathies for the bad guys."},{"Title":"War to the Knife: Bleeding Kansas, 1854-1861","review":"The book provides a decent background on the strife between Kansas and Missouri. There are numerous problems with the book, however, that cause me to not give a higher rating. For starters, as mentioned in another review, the book is decidedly pro-Missouri to the point it is blatant. There are numerous situations where the Kansans are shown as roving madmen while the Missourians only wanted peace and to live out their lives quietly after the initial problems (this is especially obvious when he talks about the Jayhawkers). He even goes so far as to claim that blacks were better off as slaves in Missouri than free.In addition to that large fault, the book provided little background information outside of what the author found in letters and newspaper clippings. Given the heavy bias of both, it would have been nice if the author provided some voice to the truth behind the matter (but given his bias, it may not have mattered). I found it very frustrating to read about an individual committing an act or to read that X was occurring in a local's letter but to not hear from the author whether this was true or what happened to the indivduals. The only information given is through newspapers and letters so if you want the backstory on events or the relative \\"truth\\" behind a claim, this isn't the book for you.In sum, if you want a simple and entertaining, if flawed, book about the general background between the MO and KS 'war', this is a good book. However if you are looking for history about the conflict and research into what was taking place - outside of what was being claimed - look someplace else."},{"Title":"War to the Knife: Bleeding Kansas, 1854-1861","review":"This book has a strong anti-abolitionist bias in general and an anti-John Brown bias in particular. The author seems to have skipped over the last sixty years of careful research and publications by historians and relied chiefly on the long-discredited anti-Brown book by Professor James Malin, \\"John Brown and The Legend of Fifty-Six\\" (1942). Brown was a complicated person, not the madman that Goodrich makes him. A good example of the author's flights of fancy without attribution or historical basis is the murderous vision he attributes to Brown on page 96. If the reader wants a respected, balanced biography of John Brown, that would be Stephen Oates's \\"To Purge This Land Wilth Blood (1970),\\" a meticulously researched work that is still considered the definitive biography.Even more troubling than Goodrich's false picture of Brown is his attitude toward slavery. He devotes three pages (101-103) to quoting with approval a slaveholder's defense of slavery in western Missouri as benign, and the slaves as happy and better off than free blacks. At the same time there is almost nothing in the book that tells how horrible slavery really was. He sounds a little like the Southern apologists of a generation or two ago -- before books like Stampp's \\"The Peculiar Institution\\" (1956) set the record straight -- who claimed that the civil war was not about slavery at all, but rather about \\"states' rights\\" or \\"economics.\\" You might as well say that the Revolutionary War was about the price of tea."},{"Title":"Sea Island Yankee","review":"This book offers a delightful walk through the south of the 1930's.

Previously he had thought of himself as a photographer who forever pushed the boundaries of art photography's subject matter. Unexpectedly, he found himself sharing the limelight with other \`fringe' photographers such as Cindy Sherman, Nan Golden and Richard Kern. These and many others had also been waiting for taboos to come down. No sooner did Kroll become popular for being avant-garde then he found his work being accepted as mainstream.Fortunately for us, Kroll did not decide to rest on his laurels. During the next few years he remained active. Gradually, Kroll pulled away from \`fashion' fetish work and started to work harder at exploring the sexual nature of the fetishist's urges and dreams. Behind the allure of his models lay a rawer, stronger layer of desire. Now the viewer often must question his or her own sexuality and fantasy.From this quest arose the work that went into \\"Beauty Parade,\\" which is a natural extension and outgrowth of \\"Fetish Girls.\\" Not only has Kroll's work become more refined and controlled, it also shows development at the technical level. His focus seems sharper and his graphic sense strong, but he has also gained a fine sense of tension and movement. This enhances the impact of many of the already strong images.Kroll flirts with pornography but never quite crosses the line. In fact, some of the most sexual images contain little nudity. This is not a volume for the easily shocked or overly judgmental. The fetish focus often creates overtones of sexual practice gone slightly awry. Kroll invites us to look into the darker beauties of human desire and make our own decisions about what is art, what is us, and what is not."},{"Title":"Eric Kroll's Beauty Parade (English, German and French Edition)","review":"The photo on the cover is the most impressive of the book.

As a 20+ year veteran member of the fire service and having experienced two parochial school fires myself as a child I couldn't put the book down. It's a moving personal account of a long term victim of this tradgedy in which 95 students and teachers perished. Many of the survivors faced a complete traumatic change in their lives. A newer book on this school fire tradgedy was published in 1996 (To Sleep With The Angels) and it refers to Michelle as one of the most seriuosly injured students. I'm looking for a copy of Michelle's book for my collection. I would like to refer both of these books to some movie producers. This year was the 40th annivesary of this tragic event. Professionally speaking, a fire like this could still happen again in our country....The biggest tradgedy was after the fire and the lack of compassionate psyhcological help for the survivors and the families that lost their children so close to Christmas..... and for every Christmas thereafter."},{"Title":"The Fire That Will Not Die","review":"Michelle McBride saved her life by jumping out the classroom window just as the flames were about to claim their final victims. Her body began burning just as she jumped. A second later and she would have been overcome and helpless, and sure to be the 96th victim of that horrific fire.

Perhaps the most surprising fact she relates was the thoughtless remarks of people."},{"Title":"The Fire That Will Not Die","review":"Michele McBride is an inspiration for all of us. Never again will I complain of little aches and pains, after reading what this woman endured for more than forty years after the tragic fire. I had no idea that being burned affects your muscles and joints making them practically unbendable, and also interferes with your circulation. Michele rose above the ashes of this tragedy and can teach us all how to cope with disaster. The most horrible part of the story is how the community in which it took place basically fell apart after the fire. Children, adults and clergy alike were encouraged NOT to talk about the fire at OLA, when talking and expressing grief would probably have been the best therapy for the survivors. I lived in that neighborhood and many people said that the neighborhood \\"changed\\" because of a shady real estate practice called blockbusting. I think the neighborhood changed because the heart went out of it when all those children died - the people couldn't cope and moved away...."},{"Title":"The Fire That Will Not Die","review":"Michele describes the horror, fear, anger, depression, and finally her recovery from the severe physical and psychological problems she suffered as a burn victim from the time of the Our Lady of the Angels School fire on December 1, 1958, until her adulthood. I was searching for some answers on the fire since I was a student at the school also (emotionally injured only). I guess I was searching for something she might say in the hopes that I could find out what happened to my girlfriend across the street as well as to some of my other friends who perished in the fire. I now can say I can't imagine having been burnt and going through all that she went through and is probably still going through. I only hope that Michele is successful in establishing the Phoenix Program for post-burn victims. In the writing of this book, I would imagine that Michele had to find it very difficult to go back to all that had happened to her in the 20 years up to the writing of this book! . God Bless Michele and all of the other burn victims of the fire."},{"Title":"The Fire That Will Not Die","review":"I don't know that one can 'review' such a book the same way you can review a novel about pioneers or a non-fiction work about politics or hunting. This document of Miss McBride's is valuable because it is a historical record of challenges that most often are not written about by the victim, but by journalists and other 'authorities'. This soul is an authority on her own life.When I first read this work and now again, I have to say that it is a genuine memoir that does not shy away or try to protect the reader. Just as such a memoir of a survivor ought be. I think the pages here are a testament to the author finding her way back despite the lack of pathways offered. That is the heart of this work, that she finds her way."},{"Title":"The Fire That Will Not Die","review":"While this book is not as professionally written as &quot;To Sleep With the Angels,&quot; Michele McBride describes the deep psychological effect the fire had on her and other survivors. Until reading these two books on the Our Lady of the Angels School fire, I did not realize how badly burned many of the surviving students had been. Severe burns affect the body throughout adulthood. Michele McBride died in July 2001 due to multiple organ breakdown, which perhaps was an offshoot of her injuries in 1958."},{"Title":"The Fire That Will Not Die","review":"With medical science now making great advances in treating burn victims using synthetic skin grafts (and hopefully with even greater advances on the way), this book brings home (through the personal experience of a survivor of the fire at Our Lady of the Angels) the deep physical and psychological scars that stay with a burn vicitm for life. The author refers to herself as a \\"burn,\\" which also reflects her experience in a time when those with scars or handicaps were not viewed so much as people with difficulties, but instead as walking embodiments of their disfigurement.

This is a book in which I wish I could have given 6 stars or more. I first encountered Michele McBride over a third of a century ago in a story in the Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine. It told of a woman (I believe she would have been 28 at the time) who had withdrawn from life not only because of the many thoughtless actions and comments she had received after the fire, but also because she herself was unable to find any meaning or peace in what had happened. The deaths were so many and so deeply felt, she herself came perilously close to suicide long after she had left the hospital.Recently, through a complicated series of events I will not relate here, I encountered her story again. At first I searched for the original story on-line (at the time I did not recall her name) but could not find it. Going to the [...] site (which I highly recommend) however, I soon found information about her. From there I was quickly led to her book and simply had to read it. I was not disappointed. It is one of the most wrenching stories of survival, psychological and physical, that I have ever read. From her introduction about the neighborhood, to the time the fire strikes, through her months of physical recovery, her story is stark, utterly fascinating, and unrelentingly harrowing. Her adolescence ended, it would take her some twenty years to achieve a measure of happiness as an adult. Michele never holds back and one of the things that is so impressive about her how she made so many correct psychological decisions (she really does have a fantastic sense of humor) when all the while the anger within her was growing to the point in nearly destroyed her. As other reviewers have noted, she was indeed hit with incidents of monstrous cruelty by some parents of children who had been killed and in one case by a complete stranger (these descriptions are much worse than what I recall from the article). This is a book of human beings at their very best and their very worst.I cannot recommend this book enough. She was the only one of the students to write a book about her experience that terrible day when everything went wrong. I think she wrote very well indeed in honor of all the survivors and the dead."},{"Title":"The Fire That Will Not Die","review":"I found this book to be so inspirtional.

It's obviously not edited by a professional and there are numerous typos. But it's worth reading just to find out about what she endured in the hospital. Also, the comments made to her by all the people out in public are shocking. She does tend to repeat certain subjects over and over, like her mistrust of people, her anger. And I was surprised to hear about her personality - twice slapping girls in the classroom during the fire - but maybe that's how it was in 1959. I would have liked to hear more about her jobs, her family and seen more photos of her. She mentioned her mother was deaf and came to visit her in the hospital but that was it. Barely any mention of the family when she was able to go home."},{"Title":"The Fire That Will Not Die","review":"This is a good book written by a OLA(Our Lady of the Angels)fire survivor. However, the author is clearly bitter about what has happened to her, and this story is definitely NOT uplifting. You have to be in the right frame of mind to read it.

She lived a very painful life after the fire, and was never able to fully recover."},{"Title":"The Fire That Will Not Die","review":"I was disappointed that there were only a few photos (which were printed on the page, not photo plates). I sympathize greatly with Ms. McBride's experience, which I have no doubt was absolutely terrible. When I received the book, I paged through it and was disappointed with the almost constant repetition of thought-lines that became rather tediious. If one were to cut out the repetition, the book would be about 1/3 its length. Very little is said about the OLA fire itself, and even the months of treatment and recuperation - while one could never say this should be \\"interesting\\", one would not expect it to be verbosely boring.

I believe \\"Helen\\" to be Valerie Thoma. For the author to make remarks about her friend being 'uncooperative' during treatments shows a lack of empathy and insight. If in that position, I'd have never said that about my best friend.Don't bother with this book...it's 'whiny' and self-serving."},{"Title":"Whispers of Romance, Threats of Death","review":"I wanted to read this as I am interested in the way Dallas residents thinks of themselves as somehow special and a bit above others, especially the wealthy...but this book is just terrible. How many times does the author tell the reader how beautiful, blond, intelligent, slim and cultured she is? And could she possible refer to Dallas as the Big D less than a dozen times per page? I am sorry she was attacked, but she is not at all a sympathetic person in this book and her sheer lack of \\"getting it\\" when the police were telling her over and over that the rapist was her \\"dear\\" friend and sometimes lover was just too much...she insisted she suspected him yet continued to see him, meet with him, forgive him again and again for her suspicions? Come on! I applaud her for trying to help other victims but this book does not help her cause at all. She comes off as no less shallow than the material girls of \\"Big D\\" she claims to be so unlike...and when her apartment is later robbed, she mentioned her jewels and furs and her items of exquisite taste were taken...give me a break!

I was excited to read this because Cook herself had a hand in writing it and I thought it only served to show what an indomitable woman Cook is that she had the strength to write of her ordeal, but there is really very little about it at all in the entire book. My heart goes out to Cook and all of the other victims but this is the book to read if there's anything you ever wanted to know about the city of Dallas. Except of course the crimes and criminal who terrorized it for so long."},{"Title":"Whispers of Romance, Threats of Death","review":"The premise of this true-crime book is so interesting, I find it hard to believe what an unreadable book it turned out to be. The writing was very stiff. Carol came across as a vain and unsympathetic character. The reader only needs to be told one time what a successful, beautiful, talented, slender blonde she is. Reading over and over and over about her tasteful and expensive knick-nacks was also extremely tiresome. There was also way too much information on Dallas history. I can't help but compare this book (and its heroine) with the book \\"Citizen Jane\\", also about a woman who had to deal with being the victim of a horrible crime. Jane Alexander, the hero of \\"Citizen Jane\\" comes across as being a great person, an intelligent woman, and a real hero and fighter. Her book is really well written and engaging.

Not long after this horrific event, Carol met Gilbert Escobedo, who befriended her, helped her regain control of her life, and then went on to become her business partner and lover. Self-made business success, generous with his money, giving thanks to God every week in church, friendly with members of the Dallas Police Force, Gilbert Escobedo even rode along with law enforcement personnel in pursuit of Dallas' most dangerous serial rapist. No one knew that loyal, friendly, gallant, religious, helpful, kind, and tender Gilbert Escobedo was also the wily, elusive, brutal Ski Mask rapist. Whispers Of Romance, Threats Of Death is a compelling story and highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Whispers of Romance, Threats of Death","review":"My wife chose this book and I read it aloud to her. This would be considered true crime, however, any suspense is non-existant as the author only talks about one suspect and no others so you know from page 5 who the culprit is. If others were mentioned as to rape suspects and a little bit of history given to others, then it might have been more interesting.The interesting part of the whole story is how the culprit leads two different and distinct lives for a period of time and then how his personality begins disintegrating toward the end and the ruse used to get a confession out. The major victim is given a roller coaster ride that is heartbreaking."},{"Title":"Simple GPS Navigation","review":"Whenever I am researching shipwrecks, I almost invariably find different people insist their GPS position is correct and all others are wrong. In a manner that is easy for all to understand, this book explains why those differences exist and why there are errors in all given positions.As is stated on the book's back cover, GPS navigation is a complicated subject and this book explains that subject in a language that everyone can understand. I completely agree with those sentiments.Well laid out, the author takes the reader through the brief history which led to the introduction of GPS navigation sets, the different types of set (i.e. from hand held to the much larger sets which are permanently installed on boats etc) and their use and function. He then gives simple advantages of using these sets when at sea and even when in an estuary - where straight line navigation is often impossible. Further sections on the use of this equipment for hill-walkers and pilots is also included.It was very interesting to discover how the US Military have the power to \\"scramble\\" all GPS signals for civilian use thus reducing the accuracy of any given position to plus or minus 100 metres. Whenever this scramble device is switched off, however, (as it was in 1991 - during the first Gulf War) the degree of accuracy is then reduced to plus or minus 5 metres.Altogether an excellent book and, I would suggest, essential reading for anyone contemplating purchasing their first GPS set.NM"},{"Title":"The power","review":"I just finished rereading &quot;The Power&quot;. Robinson apparently updated the text very slightly to set it in the 90's instead of the 50's. I haven't read the book in at least 25 years, so I can't recall all of the details, but it seems that he also cleaned up a couple of minor plot points. Overall the book is still quite good, but I think that he should have left it in the 50's, since that was its natural era.The basic idea behind the plot is that a university gets a Navy contract to identify the factors that result in survival in battle (or other harsh conditions). They develop a questionaire, the people on the committee take it anonymously to &quot;test the test&quot;, and one of the test scores is off the charts, but no one will admit to it. And then people start dying...This is a very 50's idea at its core. This was the heyday of tests like the 16PF, which purported to be able to uncover people that were thieves (for instance). The idea was that you could write a test that included a lot of questions whose significance you barely understood yourself, give it to a big group of people that had a different &quot;levels&quot; of whatever trait you were looking for (measured independently -- that is, they survived desperate circumstances through something other than complete luck), and you'd apply statistical methods to construct the scoring formula that would be able to magically identify and quantify that trait. This is a great idea for use in a sci-fi thriller, so never mind that it didn't work very well. The only problem with pushing the book into the 90's is that this plot device needs some gee-whizzing to be contemporary, and that didn't change in the update. So my advice is to set it mentally in the 50's so that it's okay for the hero to travel by train, and ignore the references to the Vietnam and Gulf wars (which are glancing, at most)."},{"Title":"The power","review":"Why are some people better at survival than others? The committee overseeing a Navy project researching that question discovers that one of its members possesses the qualities of the ultimate survivor -- never ill, never stressed, impossibly intelligent -- but they don't know which one it is and the gifted member refuses to identify himself. Soon one committee member dies and another nearly commits suicide, feeling compelled by an outside force to harm himself. As the body count mounts, Professor William Tanner's only hope of staying alive is to track down and kill the man who has the power to control minds.The Power has the feel of a thriller with elements of a horror story rather than a science fiction novel. There isn't much science; no real attempt is made to explain the individual's extraordinary abilities. As a thriller, however, the novel succeeds. It has a fast-paced, action-filled plot that keeps the reader guessing. Even if the reader manages to deduce the killer's identity, the ending is completely unexpected.My only quibbles are these: Tanner's schemes to solve the mystery seem a bit over-the-top. More importantly, at crucial moments the plot depends upon unlikely coincidences. I was willing to swallow my skepticism on both counts for the sake of plot advancement. The story is so fun that the flaws are easy to overlook. I recommend it to fans of thrillers, horror stories, and science fiction.A final note: This 1956 novel was revised in 1999. It's not clear that the revision amounted to much more than changing the names of wars. Tanner \\"thumbs the starter\\" of a car he steals and he sees \\"hoods\\" hanging out on street corners, \\"hair thick with Vaseline and combed straight back, their sport coats too long in the sleeves and too big in the shoulders\\" -- not really a popular look for gang members in 1999 (athletic jackets, baggy jeans, and shaved heads having replaced the sport coat wearing greaser look). Also, I'm pretty sure the lunch counter was gone from the Walgreens on State Street in Chicago before 1999. Nonetheless, I didn't find the inconsistent revisions to be a significant distraction from the story."},{"Title":"The power","review":"I read this book, as a teenager, a number of years back and was so impressed that I remembered it all these years. Unfortunately, after reading the book a second time, I am less impressed. The premise of the book is still excellent, that of a person with mental abilities so advanced that they can control people's minds and mentally move inanimate objects. In short, an anomaly, a jump in evolution so advanced that he or she looks upon humanity as a person might look upon their pet dog. This superman is worried about being discovered and begins to kill those he suspects may be on to him.To my dismay, after reading The Power again, after several intervening years, I find there are things about the story that just don't mesh. The book that I always thought was perfect has blemishes. This is surprising because the book was even made into a 1968 TV movie starring George Hamilton and Suzanne Pleshett.The Power is still an interesting book worth reading, attested by the rating others have given the book but the book that I once considered a sure fire 5 star is now, in my opinion, a low 4 star book."},{"Title":"The power","review":"Jim Tanner heads up a panel of researchers into the nature of pain and is confronted by the fact that one of the panel-members is not human. Whoever it is, it's someone who skipped a couple evolutionary steps. He looks human, but his mind is in a whole other place. He can control thoughts and actions and memories, he can work a normal person like Howdy Doody.The revelation spells death for the researcher who brought it up, and threatens everyone on the panel. Tanner finds himself being isolated, dismissed as an imposter when his work records disappear, friends have forgotten who he is, his bank doesn't have a record of his name ...he's being erased. And when done...he'll be done.Frankl M. Robinson's own Twilight Zone take on paranoia came out in the 1950's and stands up well after he did a bit of editing ten years ago to substitute dated references with newer ones. It's a thought-provoking exploration of how a normal guy takes on a superhuman enemy out to get him, much less beat him.I remain a big fan of the late 60's movie made from the book by George Pal, responsible for the classic War of the Worlds and When Worlds Collide. The Power starred George Hamilton, Suzanne Pleshette, Michael Rennie, Aldo Ray, Arthur O'Connel, Earl Holliman, and a stable of other reliables. I watch it every once in awhile.Haven't read the book since I was a teen, but it's excellent."},{"Title":"The power","review":"I read Frank Robinson's book THE POWER back in 1956, when I was about twelve years old. The twist in the final paragraphs really got my attention, and made the book memorable over all these years.I'm writing now myself (working on my 3rd novel). This book is my model for how suspense ought to be written.Oddly, because God is not presented in a positive way at all in the book, it was in fact this book that kept the idea of God on my mind through my teen and early adult years. I became a Christian at twenty years old. God used this book toward that end. Amazing."},{"Title":"The power","review":"I originally saw the movie with George Hamilton and Suzanne Pleshette. They still show it periodically on Turner Classic Movies. Of course, I had to read the book to find out what is always missing and implied in the movie. Naturally, the book was out of print. However, I found a copy. I was right the book was better. Of course I was disappointed to find that Suzanne (Margery Lansing) was written into many seines.While looking for his new book I found to my amazement that \\"The Power\\" has been re-issued. However upon reading the book, I found dates and places changed. The changes were not significant. I just wished that he did not do it. Arthur Nordlund was in the Korean Campaign and that was before me. Now he was in the Gulf War and that was after me. Luckily, I know if I had met him, he would have been from the Vietnam War. I would have named this book \\"You've got to have Hart\\"The Dark Beyond the Stars: A Novel"},{"Title":"The power","review":"Frank Robinson's book is vintage sci-fi.

It was delightful to be reading history one second and then jumping into a faerie tale.

Not only is the reader informatively lead along the various parts of Skye but the wit and humor of the author come along for the ride. The history alone is worthy but the fairy stories rival the human ones as well.If you are curious why the MacDonalds, MacLeods, MacInnes and MacCrimmons may hold a grudge here or there at least some of the answers are in this book of real history. Who would have know that some parts of Skye are MacDonald territory and some are MacLeod? A proud people indeed, and so incredibly resourceful.As the author takes the reader over a bridge, past a rock, or by a stream there is some associated legend of a fairy, demon, insane spouse or a heroic deed about which the author can relate. Simply amazing. If Skye is so loaded with history and legend just imagine what tales the rest of Scotland harbor?A great read told in such a way the reader forgets where they might be at present but is drawn to reside somewhere in Skye. What a finely crafted island story is this book."},{"Title":"Skye;: The island & its legends","review":"So far it is interesting and the stories of a far away time.

The soft-edged images capture the delicate beauty and ethereal quality of the trees and whispery leaves.While viewing these cards you can almost imagine yourself walking through a Japanese garden or wandering down the trail of a Victorian garden complete with roses cascading from a high wall. Water is a feature in all the cards as it mirrors the moments and captures a subtle elegance.The cards are high quality and the white envelopes have a nice gold scroll on the back. They come in a nice flip-top box with Velcro seal to keep the cards all in order.Thea Schrak's hand-colored images have been featured in journals and on address books.

Reading this book could cause spontaneous combustion of your head. Even more dull than watching golf, reading this book is like suffacating yourself with a plastic bag. Its dismal, monotonous narrative will put you to sleep in under five seconds, a new world record. There is now one less sane person in this world beacause of this book. May God have mercy on the poor souls who have been afflicted by this fiery creature from Hell. It is interesting to note that the overwhelming majority of copies of this book available are used. That means that eight out of every thirteen people will break into an uncontrollable seizure when reading this book. The $37.95 I paid for this book would have been better spent on a large bucket of horse manure. The most interesting part of the book would have to be a tie between the blank inside cover and the blank inside back cover. The scripts for made-for-TV movies are better written than this book. A better-quality read for the nearly the same price is Textual Scholarship: An Introduction, by D.C. Greetham. Just listen to the editor's praise of this virtuous book: The author is founder of the Society for Textual Scholarship. He writes to emphasize the continuities in the several parts of textual scholarship and to present the field in terms of a single narrative--a sequence from the discovery and enumeration of the text, to the history of its production, to its transcription and rendering into another medium (the modern typeset page), to its editing and its elucidation by annotation and commentary.This intrepid book, available for the modest price of $34.95, is a clear alternative to Dante's ninth level of Hell. Because of NAR, everyone in the world is now less intelligent. Francois Godement, I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."},{"Title":"New Asian Renaissance","review":"This book is absolutely dreadful. It made me want to cry. You cannot sit down and read this book. It is so horribly written that the reader loses all interest, even during the interesting parts of history, such as world war two. Pick something else to read."},{"Title":"New Asian Renaissance","review":"Godement has failed in every sense of theword to convey any sort of new understanding to the war, except hiswild and untrue hallucinations with regard to the Japanese occupation. I can not understand at all how this &quot;Western&quot; Frenchman can even pass as a historian of &quot;Asia&quot;. Relegating his writing to the realm of pure fiction, Godement either states the plainly obvious or the comically false. He constantly praises the Japanese for deeds that include the neglectable stimulation of Asian industry. I, however, would hardly call the atrocities committed by them to be anything by barbarous. Making only passing mention to the murderous attitude of the Japanese, he fails to underline perhaps the most neglected aspect of the war by Westerners. He makes it a point to tell the reader that Japan has made reparations for the war, when, in fact there are no reparations that can be made for the murderous acts. Until this day, there is no record of an international apology from Japan. Later Godement stresses the fact that Japan had encouraged the independence of the Southeast Asian countries that it conquered. In this, though, he fails to mention the many killed for their anit-Japanese stacne or to put in consideration the fact that these actions were done out of a realization of their imminent loss to the Americans. Perhaps most infuriating is the fact that he hardly discusses the takeover of Nanking. Godement cites that over 100,000 people were killed, but fails to record a source. One can only wonder whether this figure was created by a magic wand for there are actually records of more than twice as much. He dismisses this act that possibly shook the world to its core as &quot;another conquest&quot; by the Japanese. If his goal was to paint the Japanese in a well-rounded light, he only was able to paint them in a distubingly positive light. In fact, it is arguable that there was anything positive to be said. The destruction of the economic and social stability of a continent is nothing to be happy about. More sadistic is trying to shed some positive light upon incidents by saying that Japan was actually doing some &quot;good&quot;. On a personal note, I feel that anyone who is able to see the occupation as a period of &quot;modernisation&quot; is definitely a medieval and violence-hungering beast. Spending more than half the chapter on the World War discussing the development activities of the Japanese during their ruthless occupation, he entirely misses the point of why this war was such a turning point in the view of humanity. He completely fails to highlight the pertinent aspects of the war. Among all this ignorant writing is a failing to understand any of the core values that make Asia unique as a continent. He calls Buddhism &quot;fatalistic&quot;, a view that can easily attributed to the &quot;Western&quot; and &quot;Christian&quot; view of things. Furthermore, he gives no indication of a slight appreciation for the culture of the region, often saying that it was better the West conquered it without even putting himself in the shoes of his subjects. Writing as an intellectual calmly observing the horrors of the Pacific wars, he does little more than to show off his skewed and masochistic way of thinking. To summarize Godement's logic I'd like to ask: If your wife were raped by an invading army, would the child she bore be a good thing or a bad thing? Undoubtedly, his answer would be a resounding yes, it would be a good thing. END"},{"Title":"Sparks a Reader To Energize Writing","review":"This book is beyond worthless. Some of the selected readings are good, but the book itself is riddled with typos and misspellings.

The editor felt that the word \\"luger\\" needed to be defined for students, so if you follow up on it, you'll find a definition that reads: \\"Luger: a semi-automatic German pistol.\\" Honestly, that's just the tip of the iceberg.

She's losing her best friend, Jordan, to the worst people possible - The Cheerleaders. Since joining the squad, Jordan is more concerned with mingling with the in-crowd than she is with spending time with Kara. Kara feels deserted by her best friend, and becomes withdrawn from everything, until she discovers someone who she can trust to truly be her best friend, forever.Melody Carlson's True Colors series starts off with a story every teenage girl can relate to, the loss of a best friend. As with all Melody Carlson's YA books (at least the ones that I've read!) she truly understands teen girls. She doesn't simply play Kara off as a one-sided drama queen. Kara's pain in evident within the story, but not to the point you wish she would just get over her depression. However, Kara doesn't stay wallowing in her loneliness. She bonds with the \\"art freaks,\\" who are people with whom Jordan never would have been seen with, but they end up being great friends to Kara. They allow her to change and become who she wants to be, and they even gently lead her down the right path.Kara's story is not only a story about self-discovery, but also about the discovery of something outside of one's self. One of the greatest things about this book is that it gives teen girls hope. You absolutely might go through difficulties, but those rough times could lead you to someone you never would have met otherwise. Dark Blue serves as a poignant reminder that there IS someone out there who will never leave you feeling abandoned, no matter what.(The Wordsmith Journal strives to guide readers to books of personal interest, with the understanding and respect that what appeals to some may not appeal to others.

They often have interesting conversations. Through this time of horrid depression, Kara finds a true best friend, one who will never leave her.I was inspired by this first-person novel. This has alot of deep meaning in it. I like how it was written. And there are some entertaining humor moments. My favorite character is actually Amy Weatherspoon, the goth girl. I like her personality. Anyway, this novel really made me think. I've had a period of when I felt lonely, but I realized Jesus really is the most best friend you'll ever have. Ever since I read this book, I consider no human friend a best friend, only Jesus, and for those who are close to me, I call them closest friends instead.I admit, I didn't think much of it the first half when I first read it, and didn't really get pulled in until like halfway through. However, read it a second time, especially aloud, and the entire book is amazing! It's one you can read again and again, without getting sick of it!I really wish there was more, though. I think Edgar and Kara should get together, they'd make a cute couple (I know, you probably think I'm crazy! LOL)."},{"Title":"Dark Blue: Color Me Lonely (TrueColors Series #1)","review":"As a high school teacher, I'm aware of what teenaged girls like to read.

It starts with a girl named Kara. Her best friend named Jordan joins the cheer team and doesn't hang out with Kara. Kara feels so lonely. Kids from her art class invite her to have lunch with them in the art room. She makes a bond with them and Jesus.At the end, Jesus becomes her best friend.I liked how Jesus becomes Kara's best friend. I also liked it when Kara defended her friend when some cheer leaders were being mean to Kara's friend. Some of the cheer leaders were Jordan's friends. I liked the part when Kara was telling Jordan she was best friends with Jesus,but Jordan didn't care. Kara was really strong when Jordan left her.I thought it was a really good book. It was more of a Christian book. The other True color books are Christian books. If you like books about God and Jesus,I think you should read this book."},{"Title":"Dark Blue: Color Me Lonely (TrueColors Series #1)","review":"Kara is more on the quiet side. Timid and shy, she usually lets her very outgoing best friend, Jordan, do the talking. But when Jordan makes the cheer squad and starts spending more time with the cheerleaders and less time with Kara, it's looking like Kara is going to be on her own for the first time since her toddler years. Feeling lonely, abandoned, and unloved, Kara searches for a new best friend. But, despite her new art class friends, Kara can't seem to find anyone quite like Jordan. Is it possible that that special space has been reserved for someone else?This was a very good book. I really enjoyed it. It was very realistic, and showed the views of multiple stereotypes - Goths, cheerleaders, geeks, etc. But those stereotypes were never the main focus. It was always just about teens finding strength in God and in themselves. I loved it, and can't wait to read the second book."},{"Title":"Dark Blue: Color Me Lonely (TrueColors Series #1)","review":"Kara is struggling with fer best friend forever jordan fugerson and is having a tuff time letting her go.

Devastated and lonely, Kara lets herself go almost completely, hardly talking and crying everyday after school. But then she is invited to stay in at lunch with three students in her art class, Amy, Edgar and Felicia. Although they aren't what Kara would have looked for in friends in the beginning, she actually starts becoming close with Edgar when he introduces her to faith. Kara lets God into her heart and finds she has a new best friend.I found this book to be quite depressing throughout the first half, and almost unbearable through the second. Seeing as this was my first Melody Carlson book, I had no clue how faith-filled and religous her books were. After reading this first one, I'm not so sure if I'm going to be so willing to read the rest of the True Colors series. I am not a true Christian, and though I don't mind a little religous spirit every once in a while from friends and family, this book was just too jam-packed with it for me. Having been through a similar situation as Kara's, I thought I'd enjoy the book because I would understand her feelings, but I was quite disappointed. The book was repetitive (there was just too much of Kara's moping in the beginning and too much of her \\"I am so glad I've let God into my heart\\" towards the end) and preachy, which I did not enjoy in the least.However, if you'd like to read about a teenage girl going through the motions, and don't mind a lot of religous talk, I'd reccomend it.

Her best friend Kara who she has known all her life is suddenly being left out.Color Me Lonely, is about two best friends Kara and Jordan. Jordan and Kara do everything together but when Jordan suddenly wants to become a cheerleader Kara is not eager to follow her best friends plans. Jordan tries out for the cheerleading squad her freshman year in high school but fails to make the team. Kara is actually reluctant her friend doesn't make the team than sad for her. When sophomore year comes around Jordan enthusiastically wants another chance at becoming a cheerleader. When Jordan makes the team this year Kara is sad and upset and wonders what may happen to their friendship. Jordan starts ditching Kara to hang out with her new cool popular friends. Kara feels like she has no one and her best friend has totally deserted her. Kara makes new friends eventually and her life is suddenly coming together. Kara also finds god and realizes how much of a friend he can really be when needed. Jordan on the other hand, is no longer getting along with her\\" popular\\" friends because of a incident that went on at the dance. With open arms, she comes running back to Kara for support and a shoulder to cry on. Kara doesn't seem to want it this way anymore.Color me Lonely is a great start to Carlson's True Color series. I think that this book shows friendship and how much a person can turn to god when something goes wrong. I think this book shows great character in Kara and shows the ability Carlson has to capture her heart. Melody Carlson did a wonderful job at making every page of this book more exciting each paragraph. The twists and turns in this book left me thinking about life and kept my heart racing.If Melody Carlson's point in writing this book was to make teens think, she was successful. Carlson explained in great detail throughout this book how turning to God with a problem could make every problem seem just a bit smaller. Carlson's writing was very unique and it is a very powerful start to her series. The only weakness in the book was I think she drug the part of the book out where Kara had no friends. Most of the book Kara was having trouble making new friends and it made me more depressed than happy to read the book. Regardless of this flaw, the book was hard to stop reading. Carlson did a very good job in writing the ending. I think Melody Carlson writing about teen Christians is a very brave move. Religion is a serious topic in most cases but Carlson presents it well in her book really explaining what teens go through until they find God in their life. She was right on topic the whole book explaining exactly what teenagers go through and she presents many great results for their problems. Some parts of her novel were depressing and made me upset but I still kept reading. For the most part the booked move me into thinking about my own life and how I can make it better through God. I would highly recommend this book to any teenager who is going through any problem. This novel is also recommended for anyone for just a great novel to sit down and read. Carlson will really catch your eye with all her twists and turns and her book will really make a person think.Color Me Lonely is a wonderful book every teenager should read. The book may have depressing moments but do not be discouraged if the person keeps reading the ending is breathtaking. Color me lonely will leave any persons mind working and ready to keep reading more of her wonderful stories."},{"Title":"Dark Blue: Color Me Lonely (TrueColors Series #1)","review":"Melody Carlson has created an emotional touchstone resource for female teen readers in her series titled True Colors. A prolific author of over seventy books, and mom to two grown sons, Carlson has taken a reminiscent look back at her own teen years to write this story. The result is terrific, and young adults will find Carlson's fiction closer to \\"true\\" life than they might anticipate.The story's primary message is based on the excruciatingly painful emotion of loneliness and how it can overwhelm, undermine, and skew the ability to function in a healthy way. Kara Hendricks is a quiet girl, but when outgoing Jordan Ferguson takes her hand (way back in kindergarten) and announces her loyalty, Kara and Jordan become best friends for the better part of eight years. Fast forward to high school: Jordan now announces to the still shy and reticent Kara that she's going to try out for the cheerleading squad. Kara is abhorrent but supportive. Shockingly, Jordan does not make the team, to Kara's clear relief. The following year Jordan will not be dissuaded and tries out a second time; she makes the team, to Kara's obvious discomfort.What follows is not so unusual in the basic fictional formula, where two former best friends take their separate paths --- one's heart is broken (the one left behind) and the other moves on to better and brighter things. This story aptly describes the day-to-day heartaches that Kara experiences as a friend no longer needed or wanted in Jordan's now-popular social set. While the book could read blandly and predictably, Carlson does some creative wordplay and continually draws readers smack-dab into Kara's volatile emotional journey, thus ensuring a lively, engaging read. Using such emotionally charged phrases as \\"...another part of me is dark blue, and I feel buried alive in a deep and bitter grief,\\" and \\"I am lonely. Unspeakably lonely. And there is this dull empty ache inside of me. Sometimes I think it might actually kill me. But perhaps that would be a relief,\\" Carlson successfully gets her readers' attention.DARK BLUE: COLOR ME LONELY follows Kara though the school year as she works to survive her emotional funk. She meets new people, slowly engages with them, and learns about true friendship. In the midst of her deepest feelings of despondency, Kara reaches out to God and makes a connection with Christ --- her now \\"best friend.\\" The author explores Kara's newfound faith tenderly yet with a frank transparency that works well with the current tempo of the entire text. Young adults will not only appreciate the candor with which this topic is explored, they'll find themselves seeing social situations in a whole new (and enlightened) way.--- Reviewed by Michele Howe"},{"Title":"Dark Blue: Color Me Lonely (TrueColors Series #1)","review":"I read the book Dark Blue from the True Colors Series.

Kara's one and only friend, Jordan Ferguson, tried out for cheerleading and made the squad. Jordan still hung out with Kara until the \\"popular\\" chicks started to stick around Jordan and became friends with her. Kara became depressed and lonely because Jordan wasn't really friends with her anymore. She kept thinking Jordan would come back but every time her hopes got high, they would crash back down again. Kara was in art class or what some people would call it a \\"geeky\\" class and she started to talk to these 3 outcasts, Edgar (school nerd), Amy (Goth), Felicia (fashion disaster). She was invited to an art show with Felicia and Felicia's friend, Jessie. Kara enjoyed the show but felt kind of left out because Jessie and Felicity kind of ignored her. Then the Harvest Dance came up and Kara wanted to go but couldn't show her face to Jordan. Then Amy (in her future she wants to become a fashion designer) thought that Kara and Edgar could go together. Kara wasn't so sure until Amy gave Edgar a makeover and overall, Kara thought he looked like a cutie. Kara got a makeover and looked like a girl from the sixties. She and Edgar went to the dance. Kara liked going with Edgar but Jordan and her popular friends got a little snooty. From there, Kara no longer wishes to be Jordan's friend and begins to come closer with the 3 outcasts.Things I liked about the book are that Kara finally was becoming friends with the outcasts because she was getting a little annoying weeping over Jordan, that she got saved by God and finally cheered up, and this book had good detail but not many thrills. The book was good and once in a while I couldn't put it down. But sometimes I could. Anyways the things that I disliked are some parts near the end that deals with Edgar's family. It is sad and Edgar is already the school nerd, he shouldn't have those troubles also. Another thing I dislike about the book is that Kara was always weeping! Everything practically revolved around Jordan. It became annoying after a while. But the book was overall good.The people who I think would like this book is definitely girls. Also girls who are Christians might like it because it does have a religious touch dealing with Kara getting saved. This book is also realistic fiction so people who like realistic fiction would like it."},{"Title":"Dark Blue: Color Me Lonely (TrueColors Series #1)","review":"The main character is depressed, then suddenly finds God and everything is okay. Yes, I believe in God's healing, but I don't think it is really like a lightening bolt.

You'd never say that to someone with cancer or an amputated limb, why depression?"},{"Title":"Dark Blue: Color Me Lonely (TrueColors Series #1)","review":"Kara Hendricks and Jordan Ferguson have been best friends since kindergarten, but that all changes during sophomore year when Jordan becomes a cheerleader and dumps Kara for more popular friends. Feeling betrayed, all Kara can do is sulk, hoping Jordan will take her back, but after a few weeks Kara realizes that this will not be the case. Kara starts eating lunch with an outcast, a goody-two-shoe, and a goth, all who are art geeks, but still feels the pain of losing Jordan. Then, through this unlikely bunch, Kara is introduced to the one true friend who can fill the hole in her heart, God. Dark Blue: Color Me Lonely, by Melody Carlson, was an awesome book that I would recommend to all Christian teen girls.This wonderful page turner was enticing and a fast read. Because it was filled with so much drama, this book was never boring. Also, this book is made up of many short chapters, so each chapter leaves the reader at a place where they just can't stop reading. For example, towards the middle of the book, a chapter ends with Kara running into her room, sobbing, and wishing everything could just end. The beginning of the next chapter explains why she was crying in order to keep the reader hooked.Reading this book taught me a lot about my relationships with other people, as well as my relationship with God. I have learned to value my friendships more and make the most of everyday. Also, although Kara, the main character, only represents one way to live for Christ, I think she sets a good example. From her, I realized that I should pray all the time, not only when something's wrong. I think anyone who reads this book could learn something about relationships or God.I found the characters in this book easy to relate with. I think anyone who has lost a friend or felt lonely or betrayed can relate to Kara. Others, who have lost parents, may be able to relate to another character named Edgar. There are other characters too who have assorted issues, so no matter who the reader is, he or she will be able to relate to some character in someway. I think this make the book more meaningful, enjoyable, and interesting.Dark Blue, by Melody Carlson, is a five star book filled with life lessons. Also, it is a fast read and easy to relate to. Dark Blue is the first book in the Truecolor series, which now has eleven books. Each book in the series is about a different girl and touches on a different issue faced by teens today. I recommend that any teen girl read Dark Blue, as well as the other Truecolor books to learn how to deal with any problems they might have.S.

As Kara finds herself going deeper and deeper into her own loneliness and despair, everything seems more and more hopeless.

Therefore, the great naval battle of Midway did not avert an American defeat. However, there is no question that the battle made a big difference in the end result.The Japanese losses were far more than simply the tonnage of their ships sunk; the greatest loss was in the highly trained crews on the ships as well as the pilots. Their greatest asset, their aircraft carriers and their crews, were destroyed in a matter of minutes. Part of the responsibility was the victory mentality that already permeated the Japanese naval command, but most of it was due to the American cracking of the Japanese code and the luck that so often makes the difference in such battles.In approximately one-half of an hour, the best carriers and crews of the Japanese navy were turned into junk and debris that was soon to sink into the waters of the Pacific. Due to an indecisive commander, the Japanese were trying to rapidly refit their planes and had gasoline hoses and ordinance scattered all over the flight decks of their carriers. When the American bombs hit, all of this was set off, preventing any realistic attempt at damage control.The battle off Midway Island is one of the most interesting battles of the entire Second World War, because it could easily have gone the other way. Taylor does an excellent job of setting the stage for the battle, providing the historical context as well as explaining the course of the battle. He also does something that should be more emphasized in historical accounts of the war. The early waves of American planes that attacked the Japanese ships were on near suicide missions, yet they pressed their attacks without hesitation. Historically, we talk almost exclusively about the Japanese Kamikaze pilots, while the American pilots did not aim to deliberately crash their planes into the Japanese ships, they were in many ways the first suicide pilots of the war. This is a battle that should be studied to death in American history, for one of the greatest of all \\"What if?\\" historical questions that can be asked is, \\"What if the Japanese had been the lucky ones at Midway and destroyed the American carriers?\\" It is very possible that the end result would have been a negotiated peace."},{"Title":"Magritte: Spanish-Language Edition (Artistas serie mayor) (Spanish Edition)","review":"\\"I don' t believe neither in the unconscious, nor that the world represents before us as dream, except when we are asleep\\". Ren&eacute; Magritte.Rene Magritte' s work and the thought in which it 's based constitute a special case in the modern art story. H studied at the Academie des Beaux-Arts in Brussles during the last years of theWW1. And together with E.L.T. Messens, Camille Goemans, Marcel Lecomte and Paul Nogu&eacute;, he formed a kind of Belgian surrealist group. In 1927 he established close ties with Breton and Eluard, moving back to Brussels in 1939 until his death in 1967.He began as a Cubist and his first Surrealist pictures were painted after 1925. In his search of the unfathomable mystery that surrounds to things and living beings. So starting from daily reality, he follows a distinct route, he best for the logic in the multiple associations and ideas. Being an avid reader of detective stories and a big fan of Edgar Allan Poe, you may understand why his style fits so well defined in this category. He painted isolated fragments of objects set in landscapes in the same vein of De Chirico his most remarkable influence received. And according Scheneede's opinion \\"If we regard Duchamp as the prototype of the scandalous, Man ray the prototype of the inventive and Max Ernst the prototype of the inspirative artist, Magritte have to be called the prototype of the intellectual artist\\". That' s why Magritte developed the symbolism mixing elements of the reality and facing them with itself in such original way supporting in just an unique logic puzzle as anyone else. Dali, in the other hand blended reality with archetypical dreams or reality surrounded by unconscious gaze gifted with a major doses of black humor and cynicism.The author Jacques Meuris is emeritus Professor of the Superior School of Visual Arts in Brussels and makes an admirable artistic effort with exquisite reproductions of this notable artist: an authentic icon among the Surrealist giants.

A resident of Charleston, South Carolina, DuBose Heyward observed the black underclass of the city and in 1925 published PORGY.The novel was both a popular and critical success, but then as now many note that Heyward was writing from the outside: although his observation was acute, and although his portraits were generally both positive and sympathetic, Heyward was a white man. Given the social climate of the era, he was therefore not fully privy to the culture he scrutinized, and in consequence many have considered PORGY well-intended but intrinsically flawed and somewhat patronizing.The title character of the novel is a crippled black man who lives in a slum named Catfish Row in the \\"Negro Quarters\\" of 1920s Charleston. Heyward paints the slum in colorful terms; no less so are the characters. Unable to work, Porgy exists as a beggar, using a goat cart to travel the area, and so pitiful is his physical condition that his earnings allow him enough for his room, his food, and the occasional crap game. At one such game a stevedore named Crown murders a fellow player--and in time Crown's woman, Bess, stumbles destitute into Catfish Row and Porgy takes her in.Most readers of PORGY are likely to come to the novel from the celebrated opera PORGY AND BESS and will be quite surprised to discover that while Bess does indeed figure in the novel, neither she nor her romance with Porgy forms the focus of the book. In 1927 Heyward and wife Dorothy adapted the novel to the stage and substantially altered the plot, and it was this play, not the book, which so captured the imagination of George Gershwin. The novel is quite different and the conclusion is bathed in pathos rather than optimism.Although it is indeed flawed by its \\"looking from the outside in\\" status, PORGY deserves more attention from the reading public than it presently receives. In a very real sense, the book opened the door to literature--by both white and black writers--about the African-American community, and thereafter the subject would become increasingly mainstream. It also captures many of the customs of the culture it observes which would have otherwise gone unrecorded. Historical significance aside, it also remains a touching work, filled with memorable characters, graced with Heyward's poetic turn of phrase, and intriguing in its effort to catch the Gullah-inflected accents of the 1920s South Carolina Africa-American community. Recommended, particularly to those interested in how \\"white\\" America perceived \\"black\\" America in the early 20th Century.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Porgy a Play in Four Acts.","review":"I just finished reading this. Its considerably different from the play and film, but I enjoyed it.Since I'm a Black person who grew up in Charleston, I'm very familiar with the culture that spawned Porgy and bess. This book is DuBose Heyward's original story that led to the plays and film. Based on the real life beggar Samuel Smalls (whose story is told in detail in Damon Fordham's \\"True Stories of Black South Carolina), Heyward was very good at observing the Black culture of Charleston for a white man of his time.The Gullah speech is recorded phonetically and accurately, which is a difficult task since it is more tonal and does not usually translate well into print. he also adds lesser known aspects of Black Charleston such as the Mosquito Fleet fishermen and the Jenkins Orphanage Jazz band. The type of flamboyant parade he describes in one scene still occur in Charleston's Black neighborhoods on Martin Luther King day and New year's/Emanciation day.The order of some of the more famous sequences differs, as does the ending. More time is spent on sctual conversation between Porgy and Bess, and Sportin' Life is a lesser character in the book. There is also more interaction with White characters in the book which makes the racial aspects of the era more clear. The book is more a series of anecdotes than a linear story as is the play and film versions.If you've heard the score or seen the movie, you'll enjoy this book. Those unfamiliar with Gullah may find the dialect difficult, but accurate.Overall, a good little piece of social history."},{"Title":"Porgy a Play in Four Acts.","review":"Porgy is a classic tale well known to most.

Needless to say, I'm very glad I read the book.Given the popularity of this story, I'm not compelled to analyze any aspect of it. I will just suggest that you read it for yourself. The book is short, sweet, and full of life. By the time you get to the end, Porgy and Bess will have softened your heart and made you glad for investing the time.

The story is narrated by a Welsh lawyer, who begins by recounting his involvement in the affairs of a working class family in Cardiff. This dovetails with his handling of affairs for Charles Whitaker, a kind of modern T.E. Lawrence knockoff who has adopted Islam and lives among the Bedouin of the Arabian Peninsula. It turns out that David, the ne'er-do-well teenager of the working class family, is the bastard son of Whitaker. In trouble with the law and obsessed with his absent father, the boy contrives to stowaway and make for Arabia with the minor assistance of the lawyer.After some years, the lawyer is forced to head to Arabia to track down Whitaker in order to meet concerning his affairs. Once there, he discovers that David has recently disappeared into the desert in suspicious circumstances. His probing reveals a certain resistance from the oil company David was employed by, and some minor assistance from an Italian journalist and an Algerian prostitute leads him to the oasis town of Saraifa (perhaps modeled on Buraimi, near the Saudi/Omani border). The plot then spirals into a muddled mish-mash involving the search for oil, the need for water, border disputes, father-son rivalry, corporate greed, and an accusation of murder. The story is far from being thrilling, and the courtroom climax proves a tepid ending.The characters are fairly uninteresting, David is a one-dimensional obsessive, his father is the stereotype colonial figure \\"gone native\\", the Arabs are all either cunning, cowardly, or steadfastly loyal, the Italian is a sensationalist, etc. The narrator is the most interesting one of the lot, but he exists primarily to tell the tale. An uninteresting work that probably deserves to remain out-of-print."},{"Title":"Sojourn in the Wilderness: A Seven Month Journey on the Appalachian Trail","review":"This book makes even a non hiker want to take to the trail.

Through the rain Ken keeps you feeling cozy in a down sleeping bag enjoying a warm drink, through his blisters you'll meet terrific trail characters. Be it mice in the night using Ken's boots as a storage bin or drooling over the wonderful photographs of the trail you will realize if it wasn't for Ken's tenacity and true initiative and love of the outdoors you would not have been able to live, love, laugh, cry and experience the trail for yourself.

At least the equal of National Geographic's book. Wadness has a passion for photographs that are technically accurate and artistically beautiful.The narrative conveys more than a &quot;walk in the woods.&quot; It relates a unified drama. A remarkable cast of characters! The details should be left to the enjoyment of the reader.On a literary and religious level, &quot;Sojourn in the Wilderness&quot; relates to the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, as the title of the book suggests. Wadness found himself composing poetry at peak moments on the trail.This true-life story demonstrates how one person adapted to the rigors of the trail by faith.

My main problem was the author's constant sniveling to god. Any book about a thru-hiker is as much (or more) about the hiker as it is about the trail and their daily trials and tribulations. I had hoped to cheer the person who could accomplish this feat as a man (or woman) who stood and walked tall with pride at their success. Wadness rarely gets off his knees, and giving all the credit to his god would make his part in such a trek meaningless. God could even get a blind man with no legs through the trail, so it's no big deal, right? Christians will have no problem with this.

It is gorgeous, with the golds and reds and blues streaming from each picture. It has action -- a shipwreck, a giant eating noodles (this is a very action-packed scene). And the main theme is mentioned three times, but still seems understated: Those on the top should help those on the bottom. Astute kids will also catch minor lessons: \\"You thought I had no manners on earth, but how would you fare in my world?\\" It's packed with humanity and humor (at one point Yue regrets befriending the rough Bear-Face, because no one else wants him around. Have you ever had a friend you loved, that was a bit like this? What about if you had just met? Would you abandon them?) I tell you! So many messages! Near the end, there is a lovely picture up in the storm clouds, of the Bear-Faced Thunder Lords drumming and the rain-Dragons looping through the clouds.Use this book for: myths, kindness, China, friendship, unexpected allies, action, manners (including burping!)."},{"Title":"The Junior Thunder Lord","review":"We actually used this in a Sunday school class to generate a discussion of how to treat people.

The heady boldness and empowered sisterhood of the 60's and 70's became less pronounced, giving way to writing that was meant to be taken more seriously in the academic world and thus attempted to be suitably objective and dispassionate. In her introduction to the second edition, which came out in 1986, Christ explained the difficultly of balancing her personal reactions to the works under discussion with the effort to achieve scrupulous scholarship. In my opinion she handled the difficulty well, and her measured approach resulted in essays that are seriously researched and carefully footnoted, while remaining emotionally resonant and deeply considered.The book contains five essays about five specific women writers--Chopin, Atwood, Lessing, Rich, Shange-- and their spiritual journeys as evidenced through their diverse literary characters. The way that the spiritual quest can parallel the social quest is under broad examination. The five specific essays are book-ended by two more general essays concerning women's literature and women in the arts. There is a sort of over-arching theme that is developed throughout: that during a time of crisis in a woman's life she has an initial encounter with Nothingness that can lead toward a mystical awakening. From this awakening, which often involves the Natural world, new and penetrating insights develop. From these insights, women are guided toward finding a new language with which to express themselves, discovering new names for experience and self and new ways to interact with the world.The necessity of this ever-developing language is driven home: Christ rightly insists that without hearing other women's real stories, girls and women are not prepared to articulate their own experiences, nor to value their own struggles, nor to celebrate their own strengths. Given that women are still often undervalued in our society, and still have evolving identity difficulties, Christ's exploration of the awakening process through these examples of honest literature and brave art remains relevant, even 30 years later.Truths that arise out of the depths of a woman's life experience are not necessarily mystical or spiritual in nature, but they can activate personal changes which can lead to transformation of the complete self, including the arenas of political activism and ecological responsibility. Christ says that we need not isolate a spiritual awakening from a social one as these are two aspects of a progression toward wholeness. The spiritual/mystical experience is seen as being interior, ineffable and transient, but it can generate profound insight and lead to a more concerned interaction with the exterior world.The aim of sharing women's hard-won knowledge and experience via stories is to widen the realm of transformative activity, and this book would be a good catalyst for encouraging women--in the college classroom, in reading groups, or individually--to challenge themselves to look beneath the surface, to set about on their own quest for greater awareness, deeper meaning, and a more expansive connection to others and the planet."},{"Title":"Diving Deep & Surfacing: Women Writers on Spiritual Quest","review":"Carol Patrice Christ (born 1945) is a teacher (Columbia University, Harvard Divinity School, Pomona College, San Jose State, and the California Institute of Integral Studies), director of the Ariadne Institute, and author/editor of books such asLaughter of Aphrodite: Reflections on a journey to the goddess,Rebirth of the Goddess: Finding Meaning in Feminist Spirituality,Womanspirit Rising: A Feminist Reader in Religion,Weaving the Visions: New Patterns in Feminist Spirituality, etc.This 1980 book is a series of reflections on the spiritual quest invoked by various women writers, such as Kate Chopin, Margaret Atwood, Doris Lessing, Adrienne Rich, Ntozake Shange, etc.She begins with the observation that \\"Women's stories have not been told. And without stories there is no articulation of experience... the depth of women's souls will not be known.\\" (Pg. 1) She argues that this quest takes a distinctive form in the fiction and poetry of women writers, and begins in an \\"experience of nothingness\\"---in self-hatred, self-negation, and in being a victim. (Pg. 13)She suggests that women must \\"positively name the power that resides in their bodies and their sense of closeness to nature,\\" and use this new naming to transform the pervasive cultural and religious devaluation of nature and the body. (Pg. 53)In her chapter on Lessing, Christ states that \\"Because women have not created philosophies, have rarely had access to spiritual authority, and rarely have had the opportunity to pursue exclusively intellectual or spiritual paths, it makes sense that they might be attracted to the practical, antiauthoritarian elements of the Sufi path.\\" (Pg. 72)This early book of Christ's provides a very interesting side to her thought (particularly for those who associate her almost exclusively with \\"goddess\\" spirituality)."},{"Title":"Diving Deep & Surfacing: Women Writers on Spiritual Quest","review":"The author provides an examination of the various spiritual dimensions present in women's literature through writers such as Adrienne Rich, Ntozake Shange, and Margaret Atwood, etc. She creates a new paradigm in which women may find &quot;spiritual renewal through new self-definition&quot;(anything from a new phase of a woman's life or a new way she chooses to live her life).

I find his chapter on suffering to be very intriguing. Because life is full of suffering, his words make much sense to me and give me a sense of sweet peace amid the storms of daily living.

I'm a big fan--and I loved reading this book. Why? Because it tells the truth, and even though the truth sometimes hurts, in this book it only hurts when your sides are aching from laughing so much. Shropshire, who is just about the funniest sports writer around--Don Imus called his earlier book Seasons in Hell \\"the single funniest sports book I have ever read\\"--doesn't pull any punches here. He lives in Dallas too, and he knows these guys. He gives us juicy behind-the-scenes anecdotes (how he got these I'll never know--must have had a mole in the Cowboys' locker room) as well as all the standard stuff, and Shropshire's style makes it a great read. AND FUNNY--if you can read the last sentence in this book (it's X-rated) and not smile and want to read the rest, you're a stronger man than I."},{"Title":"When the Tuna Went Down to Texas: How Bill Parcells Led the Cowboys Back to the Promised Land","review":"Let me preface this review by stating that I'm as die-hard a Dallas Cowboys fan as you'll ever meet on this Earth. I have read just about everything ever written about the Cowboys and their various coaches over the years. So naturally, I was very excited when I saw this book in the bookstore and immediately bought it. By the time I finished reading it three days later, I was very disappointed.The author seems to be trying way too hard to sound like a good writer. His sentences are way too flowery, and he always goes for the 38-word description rather than the 3-word description. For example, in the chapter discussing the Cowboys' exciting overtime win against the Giants on Monday Night Football, rather than giving us a one-paragraph introduction briefly describing the emergence of MNF and then immediately segueing into a description of this particular MNF game, the author rambles on for 8 pages giving us way more detail on the early days of MNF than we could ever want. I was reading the book because I wanted to read about the 2003 Dallas Cowboys and Bill Parcells, not because I wanted a history lesson regarding how MNF came to be.The author also makes a great deal of factual mistakes in the book that any die-hard fan (or maybe just one as obsessive about the Cowboys as I am) would pick up. For example, the writer informs his readers that the Cowboys of the 1990s won Super Bowls 29, 30, and 32, when in fact they won Super Bowls 27, 28, and 30. Also, he describes how Terrell Owens danced on the star at Texas Stadium, then came back the very next year to torch Dwayne Goodrich for the game-winning touchdown, when in fact Dallas got revenge on Owens the year after he danced on the star, beating the 49ers handily and holding Owens scoreless. The now-infamous \\"Campo-Coslet decide to punt, Dwayne Goodrich and Tony Dixon get torched\\" game was TWO year after the star incident, NOT the very next year. The Dallas Cowboys and all their fans took great pride in getting their revenge on Terrell Owens the year after the star incident, and this author denies that it even happened.In general, the book is a collection of some \\"behind-the-scenes\\" stories that anyone who closely follows the Cowboys would already know, excerpts lifted from a MUCH better Bill Parcells book (\\"The Final Season\\"), and some all-too-brief recaps of the games played last year buried amongst pages and pages of trivial crap that the author threw in to make his writing sound more flowery.Overall, this book is about two things that interest me greatly (the Dallas Cowboys and Bill Parcells), but this author manages to sap all the life out of it and write a book that is tedious for even the most die-hard fan. Where is the insider information? The information in this book could be obtained simply by going to the Cowboys' website. Where are all the witty Parcells coach-speak quips? Parcells is FAMOUS for hilarious remarks. Where are they? The only thing saving this book from a one-star or ZERO-star rating is that it's about the Dallas Cowboys. A better author would have produced a MUCH better book. I got the feeling that this author wrote this book without ever having an actual conversation with Bill Parcells. If you're a Bill Parcells fan, you'll prefer to read \\"The Final Season.\\" It is actually written BY Bill Parcells and contains more of his wit and his wealth of football knowledge than this book does.This book deserved a better author."},{"Title":"When the Tuna Went Down to Texas: How Bill Parcells Led the Cowboys Back to the Promised Land","review":"Being from New York and now living in Dallas I was glad when the Cowboys hired Bill Parcells. I knew he was a good coach and it made following the Cowboys, after three 5-11 seasons, a little bit more compelling. I had read and enjoyed Shropshire's Seasons in Hell (about the original Texas Rangers) and when this book came out I decided to give it a try. I hoped this book would be as good and I wasn't disappointed.I think it is possibly the most entertaining sports book I have read. Parts of it are laugh out load hilarious. It is not \\"ground breaking\\" as Moneyball or Ball Four but it makes no pretensions to be. If you are a purist looking for an in depth scholarly study of the nuances of football coaching strategy, or a play by play recap of the 2003-2004 season there are probably better, more boring, books out there.Read this book if you are a fan of football, Bill Parcells, the Cowboys or you want to have a good laugh. There are a lot of good behind the scenes stories about players, coaches, and owners here that you didn't read in the newspaper. The writing style is unique and if you read Seasons in Hell you know what I mean. I think it's a better read than Seasons because the subject matter is more topical."},{"Title":"When the Tuna Went Down to Texas: How Bill Parcells Led the Cowboys Back to the Promised Land","review":"This book has too many problems to be inducted into the Ring of Honor. Here are just a few. First, this book has unacceptable factual errors(see A. Keller's review). Second the author believes the season opener will make or break the season. The 1993 Dallas Cowboys(one of the top three teams of all time) lost their first two games of the season. Equally as great, the 1981 San Francisco 49ers lost their opener. The author must believe that Jerry Jones died at the Alamo. I don't see what he had to gain by criticizing Randy Galloway's(a frequent Jones critic) choice in the 1972 presidential election. Horrible foul."},{"Title":"When the Tuna Went Down to Texas: How Bill Parcells Led the Cowboys Back to the Promised Land","review":"Reading is often a solitary and silent pastime. Occasionally the solitude may be interrupted by a desire to share a humorous line with someone within earshot. Sometimes, the reader laughing out loud can break the silence generally present when reading. While reading WHEN THE TUNA WENT DOWN TO TEXAS: How Bill Parcells Led the Cowboys Back to the Promised Land, by Mike Shropshire, this reader had numerous moments of laughing out loud and savoring classic comments by the author in hopes of remembering those lines for future use.In the mid-90s the Dallas Cowboys were a football juggernaut, destroying opponents on a weekly basis. Dynasties end for many reasons. To some degree the Cowboys' reign ended because new rules were put in place that limited the ability of franchises to string championship seasons together. Salary caps and free agency, now an essential part of the NFL player agreement, make it far more difficult for a team to build and maintain the foundation of players that allow a team to continually repeat winning seasons. But free agency and salary caps were not the only reasons for the downfall of the Cowboys. Several cracks in the foundation of the empire were self-inflicted. The story of the Cowboys' road to mediocrity began with a star player and two precious little hookers.The star player was wide receiver Michael Irvin, whose liaison with working girls led to a felony drug possession charge. Even a celebrity such as Irvin faced danger in the Texas criminal justice system. As a former prosecutor in Dallas observed to Shropshire, \\"I don't really know the facts of this particular case, but if the prosecution can get a couple of Lutherans on the jury, then Irvin will get a maximum sentence.\\" The criminal prosecution destroyed the franchise. Former Green Bay Packer star Jerry Kramer observed, \\"Whenever I see the Cowboys on TV, I don't know who to root for --- the defense or the prosecution. No, this will never be America's Team, if it is then woe for America.\\"The man in charge of the Cowboys during their trip from the top of the heap to the bottom was Jerry Jones, an Arkansas businessman described by many as coming across \\"like the banjo picker in Deliverance.\\" Shropshire interviewed Jones for Sports Illustrated immediately after the purchase of the franchise and the two men shared grudging respect. Jones was actively involved in every aspect of running the Cowboys. If allowed by the NFL he would have considered coaching the team, but that wish was not to be approved. Instead, he hired coaches that he could control. As long as the Cowboys had great talent, total control was successful. But as the talent level of America's team declined, the need for an outstanding coach grew. Before the Parcells era would commence, Jones hired Dave Campo. As Shropshire observes, \\"the Dave Campo regime shortly became a living-color illustration of what happens when the Peter Principle collides head-on with Murphy's Law. Since Campo was universally hailed as a 'nice guy,' he could also serve as exhibit A to the Leo Durocher doctrine --- the one that mandates where nice guys will inevitably finish.\\" After a losing season in 2002, Dave Campo was fired.Enter Bill Parcells. Football fans were stunned. Sports Illustrated voiced the opinion of the country: \\"Are You Kidding Me?\\" But it was no joke. Jones gave Parcells full and free reign to run the team, and the future Hall of Fame inductee did not disappoint his owner. WHEN THE TUNA WENT DOWN TO TEXAS gives the football fanatic an outline for building or rebuilding a franchise. Start with a head coach who remembers every crucial play that cost him a game during his coaching career as well as the assistant coach who designed and called the play. When the opportunity presents itself, hire that innovative assistant coach for your new team. Next, find a few quality players as a foundation for the team. Parcells believed strongly in the \\"80-20\\" theory that goes with any successful organization. Under that rule, the 20 percent of the workforce that's the most talented always generates 80 percent of the positive results. For the woeful Cowboys, even that 20 percent was a difficult task.Parcells persevered. Somehow he led the Cowboys to the playoffs in that first year. Shropshire chronicles the season, some games in detail, others in passing. Fanatical fans may find WHEN THE TUNA WENT DOWN TO TEXAS light on statistics and fantasy football minutiae. Most fans will enjoy this book for what it is: an irreverent and humorous look at the game of football and three of its icons --- a franchise, an owner and the Tuna.--- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman"},{"Title":"The Pirate","review":"Twin plots alternate in this somewhat unfulfilling novel about two Scots named Martin Law who -- in very different times and very different ways -- step outside of the bounds of law-abiding life. The first Martin is a young university student summering in the Riviera with a few classmates in the early 1990s. A chance meeting, coupled with a greater taste for adventure than his pals, leads contemporary Martin to ditch the campground and squat in a posh yacht with his enigmatic and shady new French pal. One thing leads to another, and soon he's ditched his studies and his family, and is into drug dealing, then some strange boating, before finally settling down with a Scandinavian beauty, having a kid, and opening a bar in Marbella. Meanwhile, alternating chapters tell the story of 18th-century Martin, who has completed his studies to become a doctor and signed on to be ship's doctor. The boat is a poorly commanded vessel destined to partake in the slave trade, and it doesn't take long for him to realize that he can't be a party to such evil. Some swashbuckling later, he emerges as a pirate captain. The parallel Martin's are basically good guys who drift into lives of crime, but the twin storylines don't add up to much more than a well-done gimmick."},{"Title":"The Pirate","review":"Pick this up at the Library and boy was I impressed.

For other developers, their chains of method calls and multiple API layers are cumbersome and slow. For the latter, there is the possibility of keeping all objects in RAM and log modifications for the sake of data integrity. This is what this book is about: how to create a persistence architecture that relies solely on objects, with the help of log files and the serialization of data to binary files.The book goes over basically all matters related to the use of serialization to persist objects: from an initial discussion on RAM based data collections to basic serialization techniques in Java, from Commands and Transactions to XML export and mirroring. It also takes a close look on Prevayler, the open source project that actually concentrates efforts on creating a framework for transparent Java Persistence using serialization. With a nice and straightforward language, Peter Wayner, a well-known author of books on security and databases, shows all the necessary steps to create such frameworks and - without hiding its shortcomings - smartly comments the positive side of this technique: a single, object based logical model, simplicity, and high performance."},{"Title":"Hippocrene Children's Illustrated Croatian Dictionary","review":"I'm quite a bit older than the '4-8 years' age group this book is aimed at, but it's very helpful for ANYONE trying to learn a little Croatian. It's arranged alphabetically in English, but in the back is an alphabetic list (without illustrations) in Croatian.The pictures are quite charming, they appear to have been selected from a wide range of sources, and most of them look like the kinds of pictures found in 1960's era school readers.My only real complaint is that some of the words they choose to include are rather odd, with the partial result being that some very common words are left out. Do we really need to know how to say both 'field mouse' and 'mouse'? 'Bumble bee' and 'bee'? Both 'horn' and 'antler' are included, even though the Croatian word is the same for both. And we learn such relatively obscure words as platypus, badger, fir tree, and lighthouse. Which would be fine except that, while we learn many color names, we DON'T learn orange or purple. Quite a few other common nouns and adjectives are also omitted. (There are comparatively few verbs, but that makes sense since learning the infinitive of a verb isn't much use without learning the tenses, and this book doesn't even begin to touch on the extremely complex topic of Croatian grammar.)A few minor errors in pronunciation as well, but for the most part the pronunciation table seems accurate.A worthwhile purchase for any beginning Croatian student, regardless of age."},{"Title":"Hippocrene Children's Illustrated Croatian Dictionary","review":"sure it's for kids, but I used it to help an adult learn a few words here and there. great for amateurs."},{"Title":"Hippocrene Children's Illustrated Croatian Dictionary","review":"Really good book for leaning the basics of the Croation language.

She is questioned by her youngest daughter, Ismene if the \\"talk of Thebes\\" is true and Iokaste must answer in the affirmative.While Iokaste seats her daughter beside her, she tells her child the family story from her beginnings - Iokaste's prophetic betrothal and royal destiny at the tender age of 14 through the present day tumultuous Thebes...There is little that is written about Queen Iokaste/Jocasta/Epikatse (depending on your preferred or precise translation) and this historical/mythological novel is an authoritative, entertaining and wonderful retelling of one of the most powerful Greek stories in history!If you enjoy mythology of ANY kind, you will really appreciate this novel as I did!Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"\\"Iokaste: The Novel of the Mother-Wife of Oedipus\\" is a thoroughly entrancing read, a page turner, simply impossible to put down! Grossack and Underwood reveal rich new dimensions of character depth and plot development in their innovative retelling of the story of Oedipus through Iokaste's eyes.Instead of another scholar's staid translation of the well-worn Greek text, Grossack and Underwood take us on a compelling journey. Told from the perspective of Iokaste, this novel begins with Iokaste's ill-fated marriage to King Laius, the father of her child Oedipus. As the story unfolds, the authors treat us to a beautiful combination of well-developed character story lines. It is easy to fall in love with the tragic plight of each character.Laius is held captive to his woeful and single-minded focus on a prophecy that eats every day at his happiness. How one wishes he would live life! Iokaste is an innocent victim of unending and unfair fates. Yet she is a passionate and rich spirit for whom one cannot help but feel wonder and compassion. Oedipus's fate stems from the ill-fate of his Mother. Like Iokaste, he is seemingly innocent, but the Gods, whom Oedipus serves unwaveringly, plague his life with bad omen. And Kreon is a loyal brother in the beginning, yet over time a leader of questionable morals. His story leaves a slightly bitter taste, and one wonders how he has thus far escaped the prophecy of the Gods. The characters come alive with an honesty and accessibility almost never seen in traditional renditions of the Greek classic, truly a treat for any lover of a good read.Grossack and Underwood's captivating novel whirl winds the imagination into a contemplation of Fate and how to live life to the fullest. Well researched and academically sound, yet powerful and evocative to a modern audience, \\"Iokaste: The Novel of the Mother-Wife of Oedipus\\" is grounded in a spectacularly balanced cross-comparison and combination of ancient Greek mythology. A must read!"},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"What an enjoyable read! The Greek myths were not novels or anything like them, even in Homer's telling. So it's great to delve back in and give them novelistic heft, which this book does quite well. Despite the non-action-packed subject matter of the Oedipus myth, and despite the rather heavy lunk of scholarship it wears on its sleeve, the book manages to be an absorbing page-turner.The writing is engaging, playful, odd, right on the mark, flowered with surprising cultural history and imbued with emotional resonance. The thread of destiny and its relation to faith is both gripping and nuanced, and has, as does the whole tale, the tang of the real. Those familiar with the story will have a few of those silent-on-a-peak-in-Darien moments."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"I have not thought much about the Oedipus story in 35 years, but do remember that it was pushed down my throat in school, as many of today's students may feel. However, there is not a dull page in this book, and no lineage charts or maps to make reading it seem like work. All the info is there, though, deftly incorporated in the text. The book is pure pleasure, and as they say, is so enjoyable that you learn without realizing it. I loved the book, as did my daughter who read it along with her Oedipus studies in school.There's the great advantage too, to the woman's perspective in the book. For example, we see the teenage Iokaste physically restrained by two different men within a short passage and hear her thoughts express a wide range of feelings, all of which a growing American girl will grapple with today. Also, she shows us the upbringing of a daughter of nobility -from the time when she is displayed as a possible bride choice, through the taking away of her infant son due to fear of the prophecy, to her growth into her duties as queen. This is a truly multi-layered character.I question the birth scene, only because I suspect that young women of the time had infinitely more knowledge and support about the natural birthing process than young mothers do today, and did not experience it in as painful a way as we do. But I have a home-birth mom's perspective and who knows what was the case?"},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"The myth surrounding Oedipus is one that is well ingrained into the psyche of modern culture, thanks to the twin pillars of the original Oedipus cycle of stories from ancient Greece, and the more modern adaptation of those mythological stories by Sigmund Freud into a controversial feature of the human psychological development. The Oedipus complex is well-known; the stories from which Freud derived his inspiration are similarly well-known, but generally only from the perspective of Oedipus.It was not uncommon in ancient mythology and drama (there was no way to separate the two conveniently) for the narratives to be told from one perspective only, that of the hero or the tragic figure, which, in the case of Oedipus, is one in the same. Even more rare is the voice of a woman - Antigone is a rare character in ancient Greek stories in this regard.Authors Victoria Grossack and Alice Underwood collaborated to add a new dimension to the Oedipus tale, one that is both modern and faithful to the ancient stories - here we meet the primary character Iokaste, the mother of Oedipus, doomed to marry her son despite best efforts to prevent the event, and in becoming his wife to commit a sin that would mean the downfall of the family, if not the city of Thebes.Iokaste is presented here as a strong character, not merely the victim upon which these tragedies are played out - a mother who loses her son, only to regain him again in a most shocking fashion, one that is incredibly costly. Iokaste is presented here in full emotion and full action - near the conclusion, Iokaste recounts that she has been queen of Thebes for nearly forty years. The reader can sense the heartbreak as she thinks, 'I have four - nay, five children, and a husband whom I adore; who has adored me up until yesterday.'Iokaste is presented here as an introspective woman, but also a woman of action. Fate has dealt her a bad hand, but she still finds love and value in those around her. She is a strong woman, but as with all human beings (particularly in the Greek stories), fate is ultimately stronger.The writing is lively and intense, and the action is both interesting and dramatic; this is no dry-and-dusty tome from days of yore. The authors do us a service in adding a new element to the narrative of Oedipus; perhaps a sequel following Antigone would be a good follow-up? One can hope..."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"I've loved Greek myths since I was a boy so when I encountered this book through a review, I looked forward to a new telling of the Oedipus story in the form of a novel. The new point of view was particularly interesting because of the authors' command of the details of both Greek life both secular and religious. Further, the character development is believable and entrancing. This is particularly unusual when dealing with myths where, to maintain their archetyple identities, each character plays their unchanging role and does not deviate - there is no character development. Truly incredible was the treatment of Tiresius. A great book - I hope the authors have more books in their plans for the future."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"I have always been fascinated by Greek mythology, so I was excited to read Iokaste, a new take on a famous tale. Although I already knew the surprising plot twists of the original story, Iokaste had more than enough new aspects to keep my interest. Told from the perspective of Oedipus' mother, Iokaste, the tragedy takes on new life. Through the gripping narrative, I was rewarded with new insights as to how the tragedy could have occurred. Iokaste became a young woman that it was easy to empathize with, instead of just the mother that should have known better. Even though I knew how the book must end, I found myself hoping that maybe this time, things would work out differently.Both well-researched and entertaining, this book left me wanting more, and I hope the authors will write another book soon. I would recommend Iokaste to anyone with an interest in Greek mythology or ancient history, although even a reader who knows nothing about the original story will be rewarded by this new perspective."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"Most readers are familiar with the tale of Oedipus Rex, as well as the psychological term Oedipus complex, derived from the relationship between Oedipus and his mother and subsequent wife, Iokaste. Unlike the Greek tragedy, this book is told from the point of view of Iokaste and takes the tale many levels higher, revealing psychological subtleties within the personas of Iokaste and the characters surrounding her. At age 14, Iokaste is chosen by the god Apollo to wed Prince Alphenor, son of King Amphion of Thebes. When Amphion's wife blasphemes the god Apollo, the oracle predicts doom for her 14 children, and Iokaste's betrothed dies. Laius, son of King Labdakus, who ruled Thebes 30 years before, returns to Thebes to claim the kingdom and weds Iokaste. On the night of their wedding, the oracle warns Laius that he will be killed by his own son. Laius withdraws from Iokaste, not knowing she is already with child. When their son is born, Laius binds his feet and instructs he be left on a mountain to die. Instead, the child is given to King Polybus of Korinth, who recently lost his son. Polybus names the child Oedipus, meaning swollen feet.As a young man, Oedipus is told by the Delphic oracle that he will kill his father and marry his mother. Never having learned he was adopted, Oedipus is distraught over this news and vows never to see his parents again. He meets up with Laius, who is traveling to Delphi to seek the oracle's counsel, and the two argue. Oedipus kills Laius, unaware that he has set in motion the ultimate fulfillment of the oracle's prophecy.With profound vibrancy, IOKASTE magically transports the reader into the ancient world of Greek mythology. The visual imagery created by the authors is vividly detailed, the mindset of the characters engrossing. It is interesting to note the politics of the time, constant dedication to the ritualistic worship of gods, and delegation of all things good and bad to a particular god's mood. The Sphinx is a fascinating character, made more realistic by her portrayal in this book, specifically her role in the contest of wit to choose the next king of Thebes. The conspiracies and subsequent rationalizations of Iokaste and her brother Kreon are thought-provoking and insightful.This riveting story flows fluidly from page to page, written in an engaging style that holds the reader's attention from the very beginning. This is one book that begs to be read more than once in order to appreciate and absorb each and every nuance of the characters, history, and tale of tragedy. It is suggested educational facilities utilize IOKASTE as an introduction to Greek mythology, as this is one book that will instill fascination and respect, leaving no room for boredom."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"First, I have to admit that I don't like the story itself, but then it is a story from Greek mythology and most of those tend to have very strange twists and often end badly. Regardless of the story, I loved the book. I've been recommending it to friends. I put off reading it for a over a week after returning home with it. Then I picked it up because I had a little spare time before leaving for work. I was late - very late - for work, and I picked it up again shortly after returning home. I finished it that night - couldn't put it down. This from a guy who *never* has any problem falling asleep (narcolepsy has that one benefit). The writing is superb. I really cannot speak to character development because I was carried along with the story and didn't focus on such details - perhaps I should reread it and be a bit more technically minded. The narration was detailed enough that I could see everything in my mind's eye without being burdensome. That's a very fine line to walk, and the authors walked it masterfully. Since I do the SCA thing (www.sca.org), I will praise the book at each event I attend. I look forward to the authors' next book!"},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"Our small book group discussed \\"Jocasta\\" as a wild card in our list of choices. It turned out to be the most interesting and enjoyable book we have read in several years, eliciting enthusiastic reaction and provocative exchanges.Grossack and Underwood show extraordinary skill as storytellers. Despite the characters, main events, and the ending of this much told myth being known to the reader, the tension is maintained to the last page. Greece of over three thousand years ago comes alive, with characters fully developed and scenes described in such realistic color and detail that one feels personally involved in this mythological drama. \\"Jocasta\\" is quite a page-turner and a splendid read."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"Really a very pleasant surprize, engaging and colorfully written.

A must read for all; YOU WILL WANT ANOTHER BOOK FROM THESE AUTHORS!!"},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"Despite the distinctly Kretan (Evan's Minoan re-creation) backdrop depicted on the front cover, \\"Iokaste, the Novel of the Mother-Wife of Oedipus\\" distinguishes itself as a thoroughly readable, enjoyable and faithful adaptation of one third of the Oedipus myth as restructured by the great Sophocles in his play \\"Oedipus Rex.\\"Rather than concentrating on Oedipus as ill-fated king, author team Victoria Grossack and Alice Underwood focus on the plight of Iokaste (Jocasta), the hapless victim most affected by the unopposable reality revealed by the oracle of Delphi and through Apollo's wandering spokesperson, the Tiresias. (Note that in this retelling Sopholces' character Tiresias becomes less a distinct character and more of a personification of the proclamation of the gods and the rejected truth of the Laius/Iokaste/Oedipus connection. Grossack and Underwood's employment of \`Tiresias' as a title is reminiscent of Marion Zimmer Bradley's use of the title \\"the Merlin\\" in her book \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" as an office rather than that of an actual personality. By doing this, they masterfully force the reader's sensibilities to move backward in time to a place where a very definite and different social structure existed. The reader feels the great pull between religion and politics while still enjoying all the elements of myth and mystery intertwined with the ambitions of humans. Along this line is the authors' rather clever treatment of the Sphinx and its riddles. Infusing the known story with a rivalry that pits Dionysius' Maenads against the more conventional belief in Apollo, Grossack and Underwood exhibit their skill at making the most of known resources; they craft a realistic palpable world that is both primitive and sophisticated.)Likewise, the authors do a fine job of depicting Iokaste as a woman motivated by her desire for love and domestic peace but who falls prey to her sometimes uncertain morals as she attempts to invalidate the dour prophesy that hangs over her head like the sword of Damocles throughout her entire adult life. Embroiled in politics from the moment of her betrothal at fourteen (14) to the son of Thebe's puppet king, Iokaste reeks of beauty and an unfulfilled need for both sex and love. Conventional in her belief in the gods and their proclamations, she moves forward with great assuredness strengthening her role as a well-loved queen while seeking to quench her needs as a woman without betraying her beloved city. As readers, we cannot fail to empathize fully with her situation.Thankfully, Grossack and Underwood do not infuse their story with any jumble of 20th/21st century religious irreverence or feminist propaganda. The characters of this novel remain true to the thinking of a time where the gods ruled supreme and the idea of one's fate overshadowed ambition, righteous behavior or just desserts. Iokaste has no need to trouble herself grumbling about \\"a man's world\\"; she is queen, mother to her land and she views her role and responsibilities in this arena unselfishly and seriously.With this in mind, I recommend this tale of the mother-wife Iokaste. Although told as a first person narrative which I believe makes it far more difficult to impart the character with different shades of emotion, the authors succeed in demonstrating this beautiful woman's range of pathos, set against an ancient world that could have been difficult to comprehend through modern sensibilities. I eagerly await their next offering in their Tapestry of Bronze series of novels."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"Reading Iokaste was a pleasure. The structural irony was handled seamlessly, and the two authors and first-time novel authorship were not noticeable. The shift to Iokaste's perspective and the consequent release of information was flawlessly managed and made a technically difficult task all but invisible to the reader.Their approach to the myth was interesting, with the central protagonist's affair with her son appearing largely to be the result of other characters' machinations, with a large twist of fate. Iokaste's relations seem untouched by the Freudian \\"Oedipus Complex\\" of her son. It is interesting to compare the approach in their work with the attitudes adopted in Freud and D.H.Lawrence's Sons and Lovers, where the mother-child relations are less a product of human construct, and more physically organic. Comparison with Sophocles and other versions of the myth will be instructive too."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"I LOVE this book. I love the perspective from where the story came, the woman's point of view for a story so old; very original. It made me feel all sorts of things, even things I didn't want to feel. The pity I had for her and the disgust, all at once. I love how the authors stay on track rather than talking in circles over explaning things.I recommend this to everyone that loves Greek mythology and to anyone that loves a good, dramatic story."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"You know those quirky fictions that re-tell a major event of history or legend from a supporting character's point of view? Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Girl With a Pearl Earring, The Other Boleyn Girl, and on and on. Historical fiction, especially romance, is a perfect genre for this angle, since the \\"silent majority\\" of supporting characters in our iconic cultural stories are women.Queen Jocasta could not be considered a \\"silent\\" supporting character in the Oedipus legend, except that the main source of our knowledge of her was a play written by a man, making Oedipus the main character, and Jocasta died offstage. Which leaves the ultra-juicy question, \\"What did Jocasta know and when did she know it?\\"Grossack and Underwood throw themselves into Jocasta's first-person narrative with gusto, delivering a page-turner of a love story constructed like a political suspense thriller. Even though we *know* the ending, the authors build the tension by piling secret upon secret, twist upon revelation, all of it new to the characters living through it, and the final collapse is a genuine whirlwind of power.The authors' inventions make the time, the people, and their choices plausible to us in the modern world, although it takes a strong suspension of disbelief to accept that in that era, people simply understood ghastly events as the actions of the gods, and beyond human control. Basically, if you could spin a good story, people believed you. Whatever a king or queen or nobleman said was the truth, *was* the truth, because the gods had given that person their power. Thus it takes both Jocasta and Creon an inordinately long time to view an early disaster as a premeditated plot rather than divine punishment. In the world of \\"Jocasta,\\" cynical realism about political intrigue and subterfuge are the privilege of the highly educated and highly placed; Jocasta has her brother Creon to put things in perspective, and she earns her own smarts over the decades of running Thebes with his help.Among the best of the authors' inventions are who/what the Sphinx really was, and how the seer Tiresias managed to a) live so long and b) switch genders. These two figures, so crucial to the Oedipus legend, become equally crucial to the \\"realistic\\" life of Jocasta written here, providing motives and forces both political and personal that drive Jocasta and Creon to drastic actions.The legend of Oedipus has given a narrative shape to our psyches, desires, and language, hence the \\"Oedipus complex.\\" \\"Complex\\" certainly describes the Jocasta of Grossack and Underwood's novel -- her heart and mind are as deep and powerful as any great heroine's."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"I am a journalist, who has traveled in this region while studying the Classics. So naturally I was intrigued by Iokaste: The Novel of Mother-Wife of Oedipus's subject matter. And by the way, this novel is the only one featuring Iokaste, that I have found penned by a contemporary author (s). I received Iokaste on a Friday afternoon, and on the next day, a Saturday, I did nothing else but sit on my armchair in the USA, and travel in Iokaste's sandals, around 1300 B.C., got to know her intimately, rooted for her happiness, while I saw and smelled the sights, scents, and inhabitants of her city, Thebes, on mainland Greece.'Iokaste: The Novel of the Mother-Wife of Oedipus,' sheds new light upon this tragic heroine; however, it is also a terrific Who Done It. Indeed, writing partners Victoria Grossack and Alice Underwood have created a well-researched and structured Historical Fantasy/Suspense, palatable to modern audiences. Almost everyone in the Western world has heard of Niobe's Tears, Freud's Oedipus Complex, and the play Oedipus Rex, by Sophocles, therefore knows a little about the tale behind it, mostly that Oedipus had sex with his mother--oh how sinful or salacious--but don't know or remember much about what's behind the whole thing. 'Iokaste' expertly delves into what's what and why. When I turned over its last page, even though I had known how it would end, I found myself shedding a tear for her and her son/husband Oedipus. The Fates knew in advance these two souls were loving souls, I thought, therefore they were jealous of their love for each other, and threw them into circumstances which made a mockery of their love. Ahh, those darn Fates!By the way, I also liked how the authors humanized King Kreon, he who had remained in my memory as a stuffy, nasty, grudge-bearing, unbendingly chauvinistic, king (from Sophocles' other play, Antigone). Now that I have read Iokaste, the Novel, I feel I can understand the psychological build-up that made him who he is (excuse me! who he WAS). Then I contacted the authors via their website, asking when comes the sequel, and I'd rather read it pronto. They replied that they are indeed working hard on the next installment in the series, which you can access by typing in [..]. Grossack and Underwood have an easy-to-navigate website, and it's full of additional information and insight into the era. Highly recommended reading for those who like to be entertained as well as informed.

But Iokaste (not Jocasta!) is a really good read, snaring me with the first words of the prologue. Grossack and Underwood take a bit character and give her a voice, and I was impressed with the variety and the arcs of the other characters: Kreon, Laius, the different forms of the Tiresias, Niobe, Menoeceus and Antigone. I had a little trouble relating to Oedipus and the Sphinx; on the other hand, the riddle contest with Oedipus and the Sphinx was compelling, so maybe my judgment is somehow skewed. I can't hope for the continuing adventures of Iokaste - the poor woman is dead! - but I hope the authors will bring us back to Thebes."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"The description \\"page-turner\\" is aptly used by previous reviewers, and I'll echo it. Indeed, I found this telling of a classic story from a new perspective hard to put down, even though the ending toward which it was moving was inevitable and known. The historical background is solidly researched, and the narrative style lively. Letting us glimpse Antigone as a frustratingly difficult adolescent was a clever stroke. (We know too well where that stubborn child is heading!) A number of other secondary characters were vividly sketched, yet I must add that they engaged my imagination and sympathy more than they apparently did the interest of the story's central character. Iokaste herself seems oddly self-centered and unreflective, and fails to mature emotionally during the course of years."},{"Title":"Iokaste The Novel Of The Mother-wife Of Oedipus","review":"This book makes the ancient myth feel so alive that you begin to think that it could have really happened this way.

He's been called the new Mark Twain. One of the most important writers of this century. Read &quot;The Return of Little Big Man.&quot; You'll understand why. In his latest work, the author of 20 novels returns to the story of Little Big Man (a.k.a. Jack Crabb). We first met Crabb in 1964 in the original &quot;Little Big Man.&quot; Thirty-five years later, Berger reprises the character in an effort that brings honor to the tattered reputation of sequels. Again, Crabb, who's well past his 100th year, is reminiscing about his life in the Old West. And an adventurous life it is. In many respects, he is the Forrest Gump of his time. Despite being a lowly bartender, his path continually crosses the biggest names in the West: Buffalo Bill Cody, Wild Bill Hickock, Annie Oakley, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Sitting Bull and, for good measure, the Pope and the Queen of England. The result is a personalized, everyman's perspective of the era's legends. The plot is delivered in a series of encounters with such notables. But where Berger truly shines is in Crabb's observations on life. He speaks in the rich, unlettered voice of another time - hence the Twain comparisons. Yet he manages to be insightful, educational and disarmingly funny all at once. Crabb bounds about the West, busting myths, telling tall tales and offering eccentric commentary on the period. This is fiction at its best. Don't let the Western theme put you off. Berger ably meshes biography with comedy, love stories with history, without any one element pushing another away.

Then eastward to the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show, Queen Victoria, Bertie, Sitting Bull and Elizabeth Custer.As a grand finale he manages to be with Sitting Bull for the assassination of the great chief of the Souix.A great follow-up book to Little Big Man. Too bad it took so many decades to appear."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"In order to fully enjoy &quot;Return&quot; you'd have to read the original, &quot;Little Big Man.&quot; However, having read Jack Crabb's earlier adventures (living among the Cheyenne, consorting with Wild Bill Hickock and surving Custer's Last Stand) readers will find that there's nothing like the first time. After all, which is more interesting, living in the Wild West or performing with a Wild West show? Living among the Plains Indians on the plains or in late 19th century New York?All that said it's nice to hang out with Crabb again. Author Thomas Berger has created one of American literatures greatest characters. In this chapter of his life (1876 through 1892) our narrator tells of more encounters with famous Americans ranging from Bat Masterson to Jane Addams and including Wyatt Earp and Sitting Bull. Mostly we hang out with Buffalo Bill Cody (a bit too much for taste). Cody's Wild West show is a splendid vehicle for Crabb's further adventures but a few detours along the way would have been welcome.Crabb/Berger hint broadly at a third installment. Reading that I get the same twin feelings of anticipation and dread as I do with the coming of movie sequels. All that said, if you've read and enjoyed &quot;Little Big Man&quot; then this sequel is must reading."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"Return of Little Big Man is not as good as Little Big Man, but since Little Big Man easily ranks among the ten greatest American novels ever written, that is not strong criticism. RLBM is a bit too long - it drags somewhat between the point at which Jack Crabb joins Buffalo Bill and the point at which he witnesses Sitting Bull's death. But otherwise it is superior in every way.There is a change of focus here. Unlike LBM, RLBM is less a revisionist history of the Old West and has changed its focus to the encroaching Twentieth Century. Best of all, it introduces a romantic element in the form of Amanda Teasdale, who will surely prove a match for Jack Crabb. The author promises additional installments of Crabb's life. I look forward to them. I wish he'd produce a nonfiction companion volume (or footnotes a la Flashman) so the reader could determine what is fact and what is fancy."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"This sequel was well worth the wait. Although I found the later chapters to move slow at times this is Berger at his best. The chapters dealing with Tombstone are as charming and witty as the material in the original story. An enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"I remember quite fondly the movie &quot;Little Big Man&quot; with Dustin Hoffman, so when I discovered that there were further adventures of Jack Crabb I purchased this sequel. It reveals more tales of Jack's adventures with some of the Old West's most colorful characters such as Wild Bill Hickock, Buffalo Bill Cody, Chief Sitting Bull, Annie Oakley, etc.. It's a book that is never dull, and the characters, both real and invented, mesh seamlessly in the narrative. It's not the West that you might remember from the old cowboy shows on television, but it's certainly a more vibrant place, and definitely more true to life. The book only takes us up to about 1893, so I sincerely hope that ol' Jack has more tales to tell, and that we'll see them in book form shortly."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"I was surprised to learn that Little Big Man, in fact, returned. So I dove into this book, after rereading the original, naturally. I was disappointed, only due to the relative brilliance embodied within the covers Little Big Man itself. It may be the change in the fictional editor, but the new, older Jack Crabbe is far more judgmental of his compadres and enemies than the Jack Crabbe who had dictated for us his life experiences just one year earlier. Annie Oakley, Sitting Bull, and Buffalo Bill, both of whom Crabbe gets to know quite well, are far shallower characters than were Old Lodge Skins and Wild Bill Hickok. Indeed, Jack seems to have disengaged himself from his social contacts and become less interesting himself...having settled into the white lifestyle and rejected that of the Native American with the death of Old Lodge Skins.In summary, while the book is interesting in its own right, it lacks the depth of its predecessor and is at best merely an average read, rather than the superb wonder Little Big man was."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"A bit of a let down after the classic \\"Little Big Man,\\" the further adventures of Jack Crabb are, as is true of any Berger novel, so well written you'll be drawn into it. Yet I found the plot curiously lackluster. If you are a Berger fan, you'll pick this one up, but don't dive into it if you've never read anything of his. You'd be better off with nearly any of his others."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"My favorite historical fiction novel of the last year or two is The Triumph and the Glory, but Berger's fine book is a close second. The appeal of this genre is the transportation of the reader to other times and places with style and compelling realism, and Berger accomplishes this task 100 percent. Great reading, well-developed characters, a solid four star book."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"I first encountered Jack Crabbe about 35 years ago, and later enjoyed the loose and anachronistic film adaptation of the novel, starring Dustin Hoffmann, so I looked forward to finding out what happened to Jack after the death of Old Lodge Skins. Alas, Jack has changed a lot. The latest installment of his adventures (to use the word loosely) runs nearly 450 pages, and to call it plodding and largely eventless is to err on the side of complementary. Bookended by the deaths of Wild Bill Hickock and Sitting Bull, Crabbe's tale this time is largely about his travels with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. The author succeeds best on the very small scale of specific incident--- Crabbe's interactions with Prince Bertie and Queen Victoria, for example, are priceless. But by and large, the novel is just an &quot;info-dump,&quot; with dozens of pages of fairly undigested research narrated fairly humorlessly by Crabbe, interspersed with episodes of self-pity and a general and well-deserved feeling of worthlessness on Crabb's part--- he never finds work as anything more than a bartender.As in many recent novels, such as THE YEAR THE CLOUD FELL, the plains Indians are given preposterous New Age supernatural powers, which fit incongruously with the totally hum-drum and tedious events being narrated. The novel lacks a villain, other than the odious Wyatt Earp, and he never really gets onstage, nor does he get a satisfactory comeuppance.At the novel's end, Jack threatens either to die in his sleep, or to give vent to yet another 450 pages on events between 1893 and 1950. I am afraid it is pretty much a tossup as to which I would prefer to see happen!"},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"A great sequel to the first, which is an American standard. Hopefully Mr. Berger won't make us wait another 30 years for the last book of the trilogy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"As a high school freshman the good sister took Little Big Man from me because she said it was trash. Naturally I couldn't put it down. What a great way to get a student interested in history. Since then I have read countless history books while awaiting this sequel. It is not disappointing at all, it's still &quot;trash&quot;, the kind of trash that will encourage countless students to read more about our history. Crabb is back and as wiley, scatalogical and hyberbolic as ever. With humor, pathos and drama Crabb bounces around to the historical high lights of the late nineteenth, early twentieth century with agility and keen observation. Right up until the final tragedy of Sitting Bulls death Berger delivers great entertainment."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"&quot;Little Big Man&quot; is easily one of my top ten all time favorite books. I also enjoyed the movie with Dustin Hoffman. Without a moments hesitation, I scooped up this book and settled down for what I hoped was another wild adventure with Jack Crabb. Sadly, I think I would have been better off having left the book in the remainder bin where I found it and watched the original on DVD instead.Without rehashing the plot that other reviewers have already gone over, I would describe RoLBM as &quot;more of less&quot;. More of the Old West stories without the compelling drama. Famous names wander into view from stage left and exit stage right without giving the reader any sense of awe. &quot;Oh look, here comes Sitting Bull. There he goes. How nice.&quot;It is my personal opinion that the main reason an author waits 35 years to publish a sequel to his most famous work is due less to need for creative outlet and more the desire for financial gain. That the author broadly hints at yet a third book tends to back my theory up. Not that authors aren't entitled to make money but art should fall in there somewhere."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"I LOVED the original Little Big Man. The Return, not so much. Jack Crabb is still doing what he does, insinuating himself into the lives of famous people of the period and having wild, unbelievable adventures in the Old West.Unfortunately, in this case the adventures aren't all THAT wild or adventurous and there doesn't seem to be any real cohesive plot. It does a good job of giving a glimpse into various aspects of life in the late 19th century and that's about it.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but hardcore fans of western novels."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"Even in this technological age, North America frontier mythology remains strong. Star Trek, that manifestly American idea, proclaimed space as the 'final frontier'. As Berger states, the North American frontier experience was unique and permeated popular thinking. No other culture has so staunchly believed in the ideal of expansion into 'empty lands' and 'development' of physical resources. However, as Berger's two part story of Jack Crabb reminds us, the land wasn't empty. An indigenous population vainly resisted European encroachment for over two centuries. Failure to hold their territory left them scornfully dismissed as 'backward'. Film, radio, books and finally, television combined in reinforcing the image of 'savages' being replaced by triumphant civilization.Berger's Little Big Man probably did more to disabuse the North American public of its misconceptions of Native Americans than any other single work. Assigning this book to students in the 1960's resulted in shock and not infrequently, resentment, at the distruction of closely held myths. Berger's depiction of the Cheyenne made them truly 'human beings', not hostile savages. The Washita and Sand Creek massacres were big news to students of the '60s who ardently believed Indians 'got what they deserved' after the Little Big Horn.The Return of Little Big Man takes us beyond the slaughter at the Greasy Grass [Little Big Horn] into that era when North America was realizing the frontier was closing. With the Indians driven to reservations or into Canada, Jack finds himself moving through such notorious sites as Dodge City, Deadwood and Tombstone. Berger uses Crabb's wanderings to move the focus from Native Americans to the 'gunslingers' and opportunists who provided the foundation of the frontier myth. Crabb encounters Hickock, Cody, the Earps and others any North American will readily identify. Skillfully keeping Crabb merely an observer of the Western scene, Berger's careful research begins to peel the patina of sanctity held by these figures for several generations. He condemns none, but paints them in more realistic hues, even modifying his earlier opinion of Custer.Berger employs Cody's Wild West show as a vehicle for broadening Crabb's views of people and places. In an era when noveau riche Americans were taking Grand Tours of Europe, the show paralleled those journeys while introducing an image of frontier life. The validity of the image is irrelevant, the show was a huge success. Crabb acts to typify American attitudes about Europeans. Berger adds the Sioux for still another viewpoint, and the visit with the Pope is a high point of the book. This aspect alone should give this book greater appeal with readers in Europe. More to the point, these same readers may finally glean a clearer knowledge of the North American frontier. The judas kiss given the Native Americans by Hollywood and television will not be an easy stigma to erase without extensive research. Clearly, Berger has done the research, presenting the results in his usual lively manner.There is no doubt that The Return of Little Big Man fails to equal the novelty value of the first volume of Crabb's biography. While the Sioux somewhat replace the Cheyenne of the earlier work, clearly their life has been changed by the closing of the frontier. The episode of Sitting Bull points up many facets of these changes. The focus on legendary white figures of the post-Civil War era is extensive. While a good background in frontier history enhances the reading of the story, it isn't a requirement. The story of Jack Crabb stands quite alone in itself."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"I read &quot;Little Big Man&quot; years ago and adored it. My boss at the time said &quot;Why don't you just see the movie&quot;. Well, sure I did but books you can carry around. However, this book didn't appeal to me as much. I read only to the part where Ed Masterson died. Maybe it was because it was a big heavy book and the print was small, but the historical stuff was a bit much as was the speech pattern of Jack Crabb. I've read too many historical accounts to appreciate JC's version of history. Maybe I'll give this book another whirl when I can carry it on my camping trip and read it beside a crackling fire. Otherwise, I think it's a fine book and great for anyone who hates dull historical facts (like me - ha, ha). After all, it was Little Big Man who was responsible for killing my hero &quot;Crazy Horse&quot;. That's the true historical fact, and if you want to read a truly great book about him there's &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; by Maria Sandoz."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"&quot;little, Big Man&quot; was undoubtoubly one of the seminal novels of the later half of the twentyith century. Few if any novelists would risk their earned positions among the literate elite. Yet Berger does.....and does it so well. As a set the two books deserve a place in all our futures....and should wind up in those tomes that you would pass to generations yet born. If Berger(and all his many great works) and Jack Crabb are not a national treasure. Then I am hard pressed to make a case for much of anything in American Lit. These two books speak more than volumes........much more. Gary Hill Manditra@aol.com"},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"Thomas Berger's LITTLE BIG MAN (1964) was one of the great American novels of the 1960s--indeed, it's probably one of the great American novels of the twentieth century. It is the putative memoirs of Jack Crabb, who--many years later--would have us believe that he, traveling west in a covered wagon with his family, survived an attack by the Cheyenne, was adopted into their tribe, returned to &quot;civilization,&quot; and survived both a gunfight with Wild Bill Hickok and the Battle of the Little Bighorn--and all sorts of other wackiness in between. The novel is funny, wise, sad, surreal, and wonderful. Readers who know the story only through the inadequate and incomplete film with young Dustin Hoffman should scurry to the local library and check out LBM (before the rush that publication of a sequel will surely engender)--or order a copy online"},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"36 years is an astonishingly long time for a sequel, and there are siginificant differences between Berger's 1964 original (which inspired a movie of the same name, starring a young Dustin Hoffman) and the Return. The Return of Little Big Man, as entertainment, is as entertaining as the original: what I am concerned about here is situating the two books in MODERN American history, and a flaw in character development.Although historical romance can be a good guide to real history (and George MacDonald Fraser, whose Flashman series bears more than a passing resemblance to Lttle Big Man, has pointed this out in Fraser's Hollywood History of the World), it is in a sense impossible to extricate the historical romance from its own time.The original book and the movie appeared at a time, the 1960s, in which the American story of the frontier was undergoing a rapid change as a consequence of the Vietnam war. In a sense, our adventure in Vietnam was a continuation of our Western adventures which attempted to transfer Manifest Destiny across a rather large ocean...and which failed.There are echoes of these concerns in the book and the movie Little Big Man (which came out about 1969) made a conscious comparision of our Western policies with our Vietnam policies.Thirty years on and partly as a consequence of the many social changes that occured in the 1960s, a sort of Victorianism has returned to the USA: for one thing, sheer hypocrisy is no longer laughed out of court...as evidenced by the Starr investigation of Clinton.As a result, Berger's latter-day Jack Crabbe, the &quot;sole white survivor of the Battle of Little Bighorn&quot;, is a different persona than the picaresque individual of the first book [parenthetically, and judging from Berger's first novel, George MacDonald Fraser's &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot; and many other works, Greasy Grass was quite crowded with white survivors. Apparently there were dozens of unaccounted scouts, 'breeds, British officers, mad bishops and perhaps a German band present at the battle :-).]A &quot;picaresque&quot; novel, which the original novel was and the sequel isn't, is at least supposed to be the comic adventures of a character of lower morals than ours. Fraser carries this off quite nicely in Flashman, and has an attractive breeziness with regards to his character (the bully of the 19th century book by Thomas Arnold who in Fraser goes on to be present at most military disasters of the 19th century British empire.)Fraser does not judge Flash Harry and Flash Harry, speaking through Fraser, does not try to be better than he is. Flashy honestly loves, lusts, and sees the dawn &quot;come up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay.&quot;But the latter-day Jack Crabbe seems to strain away from the Wild West towards something finer and to at one and the same time want a more gilded and virtuous existence...yet betray himself at the critical point.The original Jack Crabbe &quot;knowed Custer for what he wuz&quot; and knew hisself for what he wuz. The latter day Jack Crabbe is much more ambivalent about his existence on the frontier and somewhat contemptuous of men like Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. He judges them harshly, when he himself gets drunk in New York when he thinks his inamarota (Amanda Teasdale, a defender of the Indians and a precursor of the Politically Correct) has gotten married.I cannot tell Mr Berger, who has written an excellent and entertaining book, how to build a character. But I do notice that whereas the first Jack Crabbe reserved his judgement for societies that exterminated the native peoples of this continent, the latter day Crabbe tends more to judge people. This is less an artistic flaw than an indication of how America has changed from 1964 to 1999. It does deprive us of the pleasure and scandal of the picaresque, and, in Victorian terms, The Return of Little Big Man is less titillating and more of an Improving Moral Tale.I am old enough to have lived in certain dying embers of the Victorian age: my grandparent's parlor was in that style. This is probably why I am titillated by the picaresque in the first place. To relate to Flash Harry, one has to have, like Clinton and I, scuttled for cover during the Vietnam war. Berger's first novel constructed, in the figure of the Hehmaneh, an alternative to the modal midcentury American male. Nowadays, absent the military draft, this is probably not as attractive to younger readers...and it seems that Berger is at pains to tell us in this book that the Hehmaneh were uncommon, and to have Jack Crabbe be positively contemptuous of &quot;queeries&quot; (Crabbe's hilarious mispronunciation of the Prince of Wales' &quot;equerries&quot;) who Jack thinks are tutti-fruity. Here there is a shift back to intolerance.It is my view that a novelist, if the novelist is constructing a non-picaresque role model character, should not in any way have that character, at the end of the day, have unattractive personal traits...but Crabbe's limitations are just these. Shakespeare's Hamlet says, use every man according to his deserts, and none of us should 'scape whipping...not Flash Harry, nor Wyatt Earp. In the great desert of American fiction, in which unattractive-but-cool characters are more or less force fed to the reader (as in the unspeakable Tom Wolfe) one does look in vain for Flashman, or Hamlet, or even Captain Ahab."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"Thomas Berger is versatile and brilliant. He has written many wonderful books, starting with &quot;Arthur Rex,&quot; one of the Arthurian cycle books to be recommended to those who love that. &quot;Robert Crews&quot; was a take-off of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and of course, &quot;Little Big Man&quot; was one of his all-time greats.This book is written for VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. If you do not have a great grasp of history, you are not going to be able to truly appreciate the book. On the other hand, for those who do know a lot about world events during the period this book covers, there are delightful nuggets to be found everywhere. For example, near the end of the book, at the Chicago World's Fair, our protagonist meets a guy who says he will be the one who builds a &quot;horseless carriage,&quot; but then says something which is disturbing to Jack Crabb, about his &quot;worry that his work on the horseless carriage might be stole by an international conspiracy...trying to take over the world.&quot; You have to be aware of a lot to GET a lot of this book.One more thing: this book made me want to read &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.&quot; What that means, only those who read the book will know.It's good, it's good, but 3 stars is fine, because there are SO many other truly GREAT books out there. Keep reading!"},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"Okay this is a stray from my normal reading of chic lit. I have had this book for awhile, and I decided to pull it out because I wanted to read something different.I had actually never read Little Big Man or saw the movie with Dustin Hoffman, so this was my first experience reading about old Jack Crabbe.I have to say I was taken with his portrayal of history. Quite a nice entertaining story he weaves especially of his meeting different famous people such as Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, Libby Custer, and of all people the Prince of Wales.I found myself laughing throughout the book, and I cannot recommend it enough for the comical element. I would say that anyone interested in history especially of the American West with a touch of comedy thrown in would really have great time with this one."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"Thomas Berger, the author is able to use his comic charactoer Jack Crabb, the 112 year old man to desribel more of western history. The beauty of this book is that, Mr. Berger is able to take away all of the hype to a lot of the most famous historical events and describe, realistically what happened. The OK Corral is one of the best examples. The actual fight was less dramic than described elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"The only thing that Return lacks from the original is the cast of fictional characters that make that story so rich,i.e. Old Lodge Skins, Younger Bear. Berger's writing style, and his knowledge of history, once again creates the aura of authenticity that makes the character Jack Crabb seem beleivable. At the end or Return, Jack's allusions to Roosevelt and the Roughriders in Cuba leaves me hoping for a further continuation of this remarkable story."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"Have you read LITTLE BIG MAN and seen the film? Then you'll probably want to read this sequel. I loved the original and this book as well. The narrative begins where the first book left off.Jack Crabb meets many famous folk from the old west and witnesses historic events. I'd hate to ruin the surprises by revealing who and what here. His youth spent with the Cheyenne is very important to how he relates to everyone.The book ends with his stating that there is more tale to tell. Where is part three?"},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"This novel continues Jack Crabb's adventures throughout the late 19th century as his knack for running into virtually every notorious figure from the Old West (and almost everywhere else he travels)persists. He also continues to provide his rustic, illiterate yet eloquent, unique perspective on the world that he knew. It is certainly readable and sustains interest. However, like most sequels, it lacks the impact of the original and, like a continuous soap opera, one senses that it could continue indefinitely as the chronicle of this unique and eccentric observer, the little anonymous man who happened to witness many of the seminal events of the Old West and lived to tell the tale to an audience of the future, necessarily posthumous as he explains circumstances that rendered the telling of his tales to his contemporaries impossible.There could conceivably be more tales of Jack Crabb in a third novel, provided Thomas Berger is still living and up to the task. However, one was enough to make the point and the second is a worthwhile yet unnecessary bonus. A third, while probably readable, really would be outstaying Jack's welcome and, if he has a knack equal to his uncanny ability to be at the right moment in history, it is his ability to know when to get off the stage.For all fans of Little Big Man, The Return is worth your time. Just don't expect something that remotely equals the first novel."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"Jack Crabb, did not, after all, die miserably in an old folks' home after describing the death of his father-figure, Old Lodge Skins, to a sissy interviewer. Crabb lived on to relate the story of the next fifteen or so years of his life. He had a lot still to get off his chest--or Berger did. He continues musing over the gulf of misunderstanding apparently inevitable whenever race meets race or man meets woman. But in addition, we get the chance to hear him out on other topics--Catholicism, the French, women's rights and Queen Victoria, to name a few. I was afraid this book would be a downhill ride, both because I enjoyed LITTLE BIG MAN so much, and because the fate of the Indians involved was a foregone, depressing conclusion. There are sad bits, notably the murder of Sitting Bull and his son. However, this book surprised me, and I turned heads in public a few times by laughing out loud while reading it. Berger leaves Crabb in as happy a state as one can imagine him. This relieved me of a years-old sadness for the old codger, for I liked him a lot, and like him more now."},{"Title":"The Return Of Little Big Man","review":"But it's still worth a look.

Or, more cynically, they are an (extra) excuse for the publisher to jack up the price.Another saving is that the black and white figures are often maps. While the figures that are of paintings, say, are credited to the Library of Congress. I am not sure, but perhaps the latter does not ask for a royalty from the publisher.What it means is that this text is in some way like a text from 30 years ago. When colour figures were still relatively rare, due to cost. Plus, most of this book is plain text, that you actually have to read. Imagine that! Contemporary texts have a surfeit of colour, and not just in the figures. You know, coloured boxes of emphasised text etc.As to the actual text in this book - it is well written and easily read. You give up nothing by using this book. Also, the very topic of American expansionism means that the multitude of maps is very apropos.

The children don't actually seem to do anything together except complain but they are packed off to Aunt Grace's while their parents go to France. Andrew, Elinor, Ian, and Ollie discover that when the castle key becomes luminous, time is no longer linear. They are exploring the castle keep when Ollie is dragged into the fog of time and doesn't recognize her brothers and sister when they appear in the past searching for her.Spoilers...The wise woman Anna, seventh child of a seventh child, tells the children that their coming, with the silver key, was foretold as the end of an age. It is 1460 and King James II is marching on Roxburgh Castle to battle the English. The kids eventually return to their own time, taking the little girl who they believe is their sister. Once back, they must teach Ollie/Mae how to live as a twentieth century child. The four kids return to the castle and get caught once again in a different time period where they meet an old woman, Vianah, who needs their help while she waits for her people to return. They also suspect that their Aunt Grace was once lost in the keep of time when she relates a dream she had while very young.

Anderson takes real places [.........] and melds them into her story with her own characters and events. The loss of one of the children - actually, misplacement in time - is handled very well and carefully in causing the children to examine what makes each of them who they are.

If women had appeared scantily clad in more than two panels, it would have been an HM archetype.This appears to be the start of a long-lived adventure series. As such, it lays out the fantasy's ground rules and setting (a world of after-the-collapse technology), and introduces the Quest: a trek to the semi-mythical Maser. And, as an introductory chapter should, it leaves much to be revealed in the installments to come. That dangling vagueness can frustrate a reader who lacks access to later chapters, but it also piques interest in following along.It hooked me, at least. I won't spend rent money to collect the rest of this series, but I'll keep an eye out for it.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Second Moon (Keepers of the Maser)","review":"If it wasn't for the March 1997 issue of Heavy Metal that my dad had lying around the house one day a few years ago, I probably never would've discovered this series. I first read part one, Second Moon, and absolutely loved the artwork, and the story seemed epic and I was pumped and ready to see just how epic it would get. Unfortunately, I was foolish enough to believe that that was the end, a story that was meant to be anti-climactic. So it was a while before I eventually stumbled upon it again in 2010 and decided to look it up online. That was when I realized it was a 6-part epic, that there were 5 other volumes I had yet to read, and they were becoming increasingly harder and harder to find, especially in the later volumes. So naturally, since I loved the first volume so much, I went out to purchase them all in their hardcover copies. And hot damn these comics are huge! Just look at the dimensions listed on amazon.com. These are pages meant to be large so as to appreciate the artwork by the late Massimiliano Frezzato. It's a considerably better experience then reading the story through a magazine article. I managed to purchase the first 5 with ease. But to my horror, volume 6, The Lost Village, was nowhere to be found (ironic considering the title)! On amazon.com, nowhere to be found. Ebay, just as likely to show up as a picture of Elvis with his signature written in ink by his hand. So I did the next best thing, order the Heavy Metal issue that had the last part of the story, the September 2005 issue. It was a good yet bittersweet end to an epic that tied everything together and gave the series closure. And yet I longed for the hardcover copy, reading it the way it was meant to be read, enlarged and of good quality, truly bringing out everything in the artwork. And then a miracle happened, a copy of it managed to show up on ebay by some bookstore company the was going out of business or was overstocked. I managed to get a hold of it and finish the collection of hardcover copies.Now for the differences between the hardcover and Heavy Metal magazine issues. First off, at the beginning of volume 1 (Second Moon), there is a 1 page intro that gives some backstory on the world, letting the reader know what they're in for. Aside from that and the bigger pages, the hardcover, an awesome picture on the backside of the hardcover, and a little end note by the author, that was the main difference.Volume 2, The Isle of Dwarves, it begins with a recap of what happened in the previous volume in case the reader forgets or didn't fully comprehend the story. The same type of prologue appears at the beginning of all the other hardcover copies. That said, this is where the real selling point comes in for the hardcover copies. In volume 2, at the end of the story, there is a KOLONY section, The Essential Survival Guide to the Lost Planet; 16 pages of detailed facts about some of the characters, the technology they use, the suits they wear, details o some of the creatures in the story, a map of the tower on The Isle of Dwarves, the planet Geography (space-view of the planet plus a map-continental view, and then a satellite view of the characters' locations and their path of travel so far. There are some other little tidbits here and there. If you had to choose any of the volumes to upgrade to hardcover, volume 2 is the one. The Survival Guide is an amazing bit of work that shows just how much work and effort Frezzato went into to make all the little details found in the story, all to give a solid structure for the epic narrative to stand upon.Volumes 3-4 don't contain any such survival guide, just the story upgraded to bigger pages and hardcover, plus the prologue. But then comes volume 5, The Edge of the World. It contains The Tower: The Essential Survival Manual, another 16 pages of info that give more depth and details the the inner working of things in the world the story is set in. It focuses less on the technology and more on giving biographies on some of the characters, including the Chimeras themselves (you catch a glimpse of them in volume 4, but they really make themselves known in volume 5). Then it gives details as to the workings/designs of The Tower, and the flying structures/devices used, plus some other tidbits here and there.Volume 6 is the same as volumes 1, 3, and 4; no survival guide, just the prologue and the hardcover.If you loved reading the first volume of the series Keepers of the Maser, then you definitely have to get the hardcover editions of volumes 2 and 5. Otherwise, if you don't already have the Heavy Metal issues of the other versions, you may want to try getting those hardcover as well. If you already have the cheaper heavy metal editions, only upgrade if you feel like it. As for volume 6, The Lost Village, I would just get the Heavy Metal issue of it (September 2005) and not even bother looking for the hardcover copy. It is hard as hell to find. It doesn't even make sense why they wouldn't sell it hardcover. They're selling all the other volumes hardcover, including volume 7, the prequel to the series (which I haven't read).As for my thoughts on volume 1 and the series, it's a masterpiece. It's a series that gets fast paced and hectic at some points, slows down in many others. It's a series that should be read at a slow and steady pace, admiring the artwork of each frame, taking your time to marvel at the quality at every step, slowly take in the story that's every bit as powerful as the drawings, finish the series, ponder at the ending and all that you have just witnessed, and then go back to volume 1 and read it again to relive the experience and see what little details here and there you may have missed the first time through. This series is a bona-fide 5 solid star epic that deserves to be read, that deserves to be more popular than it currently is. This is probably my favorite comic series of all time."},{"Title":"Second Moon (Keepers of the Maser)","review":"Excellent book. The artwork is top notch.

I read through all 6 books quickly the first time, and then had to start re-reading slowly to enjoy Frezzato's art. If you like Moebius or Milo Manara, you'll like his work as well.The first volume is fast-paced and can be difficult to follow at times. The 'Essential Survival Guide' sections at the end of volumes 2 & 5 helped sort things out completely, though. His characters have a lot of life in them, both visually and in their dialogue. At the end of volume 6, I was torn between wanting to see more of them & being impressed with the perfect ending.This whole series definitely belongs on the shelf of every fan of comic art."},{"Title":"Batchelder Tilemaker","review":"While specific to the works of Batchelder, the photo supplements leave much to be desired - they are too general (a photo of a tiled room is nice, but a few more detail photos would have been most welcome!) and there are simply not enough of them (especially when compared to works referred in text).

An outstanding, revealing title surveys his life and artistic achievements."},{"Title":"Batchelder Tilemaker","review":"This book is a quick read - it is not much longer than an in-depth magazine article, but it does cover the basics of the life and work of ceramic tile-maker Ernest Batchelder. The best part about the book is the photos - they are many and lavish and if you love ceramics or design from the Arts and Crafts era, you will be purring with pleasure. If you're a fan of Henry Chapman Mercer of the Moravian Tile Works as I am, you'll be intrigued by some of the parallels between the two mens careers - Batchelder was influenced by Mercer and installed some Moravian tiles in his home along with his own.Batchelder and his wife were prominent in the cultural and civic life of Pasadena, California, so if you are doing any research on the history of that community you might also find this book to be of interest.One thing that might have been helpful to include in this book is a listing of places where Batchelder tile installations can be viewed. I know from the book \\"Weaver of Dreams: The Life and Architecture of Robert C. Reamer\\" that there is a Batchelder fireplace in one of the lodges in Yellowstone Park, a fact which I unfortunately didn't know until after my last visit there.

In my case it was the eighth edition, published in 1982 and republished in 1986. CAPT Noel's versions of the \\"Watch Officer's Guide\\" and the \\"Bluejacket's Guide\\" were also instrumental to me in my Navy career, as they surely have been to generations of sailors.Now that I have retired from naval service and have done a few things since, I have had the chance to re-evaluate this book and would like to mention some things about it that I have found to be of value.This remains one of the best books about the art and science of naval leadership I have ever read. This includes literary works by Melville, Conrad, and others, as well as film and Television episodes such as \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" (which we also watched) and a variety of Star Trek \\"The Next Generation\\" episodes, which deal in naval leadership themes with a surprising degree of detail and nuance.The lessons of naval leadership that CAPT Noel imparts in this book are timeless and increasingly relevant. The three core elements of leadership he mentions on page 4 of the book remain fundamental: personal example, effective management, and moral responsibility. In stressing the importance of the human element of leadership, CAPT Noel would probably be considered old fashioned in today's technology infatuated military. A word to contemporary military strategists now embracing anthropology and other \\"soft\\" techniques about CAPT Noel's definition of \\"moral responsibility:\\"\\"The difference between Hitler and Churchill was not only their methods but in their motives. Irresponsible leadership threatens, bluffs, deceives, and oppresses; morally responsible leadership guides firmly and honestly, with every possible regard for human dignity\\" (p. 5).The U.S. Navy (and the other service branches), as well as business and industry, would do well to adopt the honorable and learned counsel he imparts here."},{"Title":"Field Instruction: A Guide for Social Work Students (5th Edition)","review":"Didn't aid in the progress of knowledge for this MSW student nor did it ascertain my current attributes for the field."},{"Title":"Field Instruction: A Guide for Social Work Students (5th Edition)","review":"This book is smaller than a cosmo magazine.

A must read for all interested in seeing Watergate from a reporters view."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"All the President's Men is a well written and enjoyable book. Though their is a serious plot underlying the book, it is light-hearted and witty at times too. This book shows the ups and downs of taking on \\"the man\\" and everything that comes with it. Woodward and Berstein show what persistance and taking a few risks can do. They took a simple burglary story and discovered a whole different story behind it. Creating the story that has never been equalled since. Also, Woodward and Bernstein are the perfect foils for each other. They are so different that their differences play off of one another making the story more interesting and adding some wit. Without their competiveness with each other this story may never had broken. This story is like all about the American hero. The reporters found out something that needed to be brought to light and did just that, no matter what. They fought of doubters and liars and brought charges all the way up the line to the President of the Unided States.

A real keeper."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Woodward and Bernstein have done a masterful job of telling how they unraveled the twisted story of the Nixon Administration's capers and illegal activities. What struck me as quite strange was how Nixon, the strident anti-communist, did things that served to undermine the US Constitution which he claimed to love and swore to uphold. It appears that he did more to harm the country than Communist leaders like Kruschev, Brezhnev, Castro and Ho Chi Minh could ever have done. Watergate and the activities of the so-called Plumbers worked to undermine the basic system of democracy by taking away the people's right and ability to have the candidates run a fair and honest campaign. To me, this is the biggest threat to our country and the biggest shame about Watergate.Having lived through the Watergate years, I still find it incredible that such intelligent men could be so stupid. Why did the Republicans need to break in to Democratice headquarters any way? After all, McGovern was a far out, weak candidate whom Nixon was going to destroy in the election, why take the risks?Woodward and Bernstein hold one's attention as they go about proving that there was much more to Watergate than the \\"third rate burglary which was nothing the President would be interested in\\" according to Ron Zieglar. Good book!"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This book was very iteresting but it was not very good if you nare not interested in the whole idea of impeachment."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"All the Presidents Men is a great book about how these two Washington Post reporters uncovered the Watergate scandal in the 70's. This consists of their telling about breakthroughs, setbacks, dead ends and the endless string on people they had to speak with during their investigation. In the book Woodward and Bernstein give their separate accounts of what they did in their days talking to people inside the White House, and others who might know anything about the break in. In the book Woodward also describes his meetings with Deep Throat in the parking garage, and their methods of telling each other of where and when to meet.I would recommend this book to anyone in high school or older. The book is a little hard to catch on to at first but when you start to understand it, it is really good and interesting."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This ought to be required reading for every journalist already in the profession, and every journalism student. It gives a valuable insight into the process of journalism: fact-checking, source confirmation, and most of all, careful restraint in reporting.Woodward & Bernstein didn't simply report what they'd heard, as so many of today's reporters seem to do. They went through an intensive process of interviewing multiple sources (including, but not limited to, \\"Deep Throat\\"), and they went through careful peer reviews and editorial reviews before each publication.It was interesting to read about White House Press Secretary Ron Ziegler's constant denials, obfuscations, and direct criticism of Washington Post reporting. It is eerily reminiscent of current White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan.

It was very informative, but it was not what you want to read if you are just looking for a novel to read. If you want information, read this book, if your looking for real-life drama, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"It has been 31 years since a small group of men entered the Watergate office building on the banks of the Potomac River for the purpose of gathering intelligence to be used against the Democrats in the 1972 election. There are many young adults who were not around then, and this is all the more reason to give a very high recommendation.This is the story of two young reporters at the Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, whose reportage of the Watergate break-in and the subsequent cover up led to the resignation of President Nixon on August 9, 1974.These two journalists, so dissimilar in may ways, forged a trusting and cooperative relationship born out of initial competitiveness (and disrespect for each other). The book is written in the &quot;third person&quot; which, from a standpoint of style, was probably the best way to proceed instead of bouncing back and forth from one person to the other.We know quite a bit more about Watergate today than we knew three decades ago, but this is the book that really brought the main story into focus. The people who inhabit the book are all memorable: The two reporters; Hugh Sloan, a man whose integrity made him leave the Committee to Re-Elect the President rather than be a party to what was going on; the female accountant (whose name is not mentioned in the book but who has since gone public) who reluctantly helps Bernsetin while he drinks numerous cups of coffee; the men and women who were too frightened to help.And, of course, there is &quot;Deep Throat,&quot; the mysterious source who helped keep Woodward on track and whose identity is speculated about even today, so many years after these events.If you haven't read this book, please do before you read any other book on the Watergate affair (the movie of the same name is also wonderful -- with the cinematographer choosing shots which emphasized the massive government buildings as a backdrop against the insignificant looking figures of Woodward and Bernstein -- played by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, respectively)."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"The truth can be more shocking than fiction, and here's the ultimate political thriller. And it's all true. This powerful memoir details how Woodward and Bernstein, as young reporters covering bland local issues, got the opportunity of a lifetime to unhatch a story of vast political corruption and unethical dirty tricks (known loosely as Watergate), and they directly started the domino effect that eventually toppled President Richard Nixon and got many of his cronies thrown in the slammer. In addition to crucial information on the scandal itself, this book is also an invaluable look into the process of investigative journalism, and how reporters cultivate their sources and follow up on obscure leads that can break out into a huge story. Note that the book can be hard to follow in places, especially in regards to the names of the many Washington conspirators involved. This is more of an issue with Watergate itself, rather than Woodward and Bernstein's writing, because the scandal was just too huge for anyone's comprehension. You will find yourself continually looking back to the cast of characters that the authors have helpfully placed at the front of the book. And finally, this book is a crucial vindication of the true necessity of a vigorous free press in America. Kudos to Woodward, Bernstein, and all of their courageous colleagues for exposing this ultimate arrogance of power and the damage it did to the American democratic process.

This masterful work should be read twice: first, for its sheer detective intrigue and, second, for its immeasureable scholarship. More than giving us a front-row seat at a newsroom editorial desk, Woodward and Bernstein impress the mandate as private citizens to demand the due process of democracy."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"There are good and bad kinds of bugging. The bad kind is when you eavesdrop on political opponents and violate laws and ethical codes. The good kind, as we discover in the opening pages of this classic of journalism as it happens, is when you are a reporter assigned a court case, and don't take no for an answer.Bob Woodward is talking to a well-dressed lawyer who mysteriously popped into the courtroom to handle the defense of five equally well-dressed burglary suspects, caught the previous night at National Democratic Headquarters in the posh Watergate complex.Why are you here? Woodward asks.\\"I'm not going to talk to you.\\" \\"I have nothing to say.\\"But the lawyer talks, a little, just enough to give Woodward some footing on what would turn out to be perhaps the biggest journalistic break in history, one that ruined a presidency and echoes to this day. Any national political scandal is almost automatically accorded the suffix \\"-gate,\\" in memory of this.People who think they know the story from seeing the movie really should read the book. The movie condensed a lot of the story, almost to the point of rendering it nonsensical. Watergate as a story really comes together from reading the book.It's less the story of presidential misdeeds and more of how a couple of mismatched journalists stumbled their way to the scoop of the century, with hard work, stubborn persistance, and occasionally breaking the rules. People who criticize Woodward and partner Carl Bernstein for telling a self-serving story really haven't read the book. Like the part when, stalled for a new story after Nixon's overwhelming re-election, they start knocking on the doors of Grand Jury members legally precluded from discussing the Watergate case. Nothing is learned, and after the jurors complain to Judge John Sirica, the two brace themselves for a stern public lecture, maybe even formal charges.But Sirica only notes the violations and leaves the reporters nameless. Woodward and Bernstein find themselves confronted by other members of the press asking questions. Woodward and Bernstein duck the questions, not without lingering irony. \\"They had dodged, misrepresented, suggested, and intimidated, even if they had not lied outright,\\" the authors conclude, speaking of themselves in the third person.Mostly, though, Woodward and Bernstein get it right. June 17, 1972 was not the most important date in history, though some Nixon haters will say otherwise. The burglary itself was small potatoes, indicative of a larger problem with illegalities permitted by Nixon and his senior staff, but it wasn't like Woodward and Bernstein destroyed the Fourth Reich.They latched onto a story, kept digging, wouldn't take no for an answer, and made sure they had the facts. In the end they won a Pulitzer, and became heroes of the Fourth Estate. This book, warts and all, tells how, and offers worthy testimonial to all those who want to follow in their footsteps. No Journalism 101 course is complete without it."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"It says a lot about the character of Richard Nixon - his suspicion bordering on paranoia, his bitterness, his self-pity, and his intransigent resentment toward everybody who he perceives as an enemy (which was probably almost everybody), that he had to rubber-stamp the commitment of a crime in order to win an election he could never have lost anyway, by approving the break-in of the Democratic national headquarters in Washington in the summer of 1972.A black night-watchman finds a door lock suspiciously taped over and calls the police. The police notify the press. And two young reporters from the Washington Post begin to investigate what looks like a third-class, amateurish crime and end up ripping the lid off the biggest can of worms in American history.We watch in fascination as Woodward and Bernstein follow their mentor Ben Bradlee's precept of \\"If you can't find a woman in the story, look for the dough\\". We follow them as they chase the trail of laundered \\"dough\\" all the way into the White House. And along with them, we peel off the outer leaves of the artichoke one by one - the underlings who committed the crime, their superiors who planned it, the higher-ups who authorized it, until the ugly center stands exposed: the Chief Executive as Thief in Chief. Whether or not Nixon knew about the break-in in advance is irrelevant. What matters is that once the news was out, he did everything possible to cover it up, and by doing so, sank himself irreversibly in a morass of crime and deception.The book reads like a classic detective novel, with the intangible presence of Deep Throat looming over all. Did he really exist, and if so, who was he? The question still puzzles us. Woodward and Bernstein have been playing cat-and-mouse with us over his identity for the last three decades. It's just one of the threads in this story that will be left dangling for years to come.Woodward and Bernstein emerged from the Watergate scandal as American heroes. To say they brought down the Nixon administration may be overdoing it; but they certainly tore the cover off a malodorous snake pit and brought it kicking and screaming into daylight."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"As a college student taking Political Science, I was required to read this book for a paper over the Watergate scandel. While this book was extremely informative, it was written for people who already knew the players in the watergate affair and their relationships in Washington. Some 80 names are thrown at you in the first 50 pages alone. In short, this was not a book with which to begin your knowledge of watergate."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This is a remarkable book about two reporters who effectively brought down a president and an administration. The movie is a classic and a favorite among journalism students (this one included), but I'd recommend a combination of watching the movie and definitely reading the book. A quick compliment to the authors - the \\"Cast of Characters\\" section in the beginning of the book really helps the reader along, since there are so many names to keep straight.This book harkens back to a time when work, time and careful documentation and cultivation of sources were required before printing bombshell accusations against an administration, unlike the scandal-mongering atmosphere from the Clinton administration up through the present. With the advent of the Internet and 24-hour cable news networks, the trend now is to publish or air rumor, innuendo or unfounded stories and do the legwork later, if at all. Woodward and Bernstein didn't do it that way - they uncovered a scandal the old fashioned way - they did legwork to ensure the accuracy of their stories. The result of their hard work and diligence is this book - the biggest, most sensational and shocking political story in the history of our country. Anyone wanting to know the inside story of Richard Nixon's fall from power, start here, and also read Bernstein and Woodward's \\"The Final Days.\\" This book is a classic that will remain so 100 years from now."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Having read numerous books and done extensive work on Watergate related research, it is surpising that I had never read, \\"All the President's Men\\" in its entirety. With the recent revelation that Mark Felt was Deep Throat, my interest in the book was awakened. I have read about Watergate from the historians' point of view, but no story is as exhilarating as the story of the journalists that broke the scandal.The recent revelation in this story has caused many to label Deep Throat a hero or villan. Certainly without Deep Throat, Watergate would not have been the same. Nixon may have never been pressured to resign without Deep Throat. In the book, Felt plainly states that he becomes the secret source for Woodward because he does not believe the FBI is doing enough to investigate the break-in. For taking the next best alternative route, he is a hero.On the surface, the Watergate break-in only appeared to be a motley crew rallying against the democrats attempting to sabotage the democratic headquarters and McGovern's campaign. Yet a trail grew progressively longer through the president's closest aids all the way to the president himself. From Mitchell to Liddy and Hunt to Dean and Ehrlichman and Haldeman, the trail slowly revealed the extent of the illegal campaign activities.Even more than 30 years after it happened, it is still hard to believe how far the office of the president fell. But in more contemporary sight, perhaps the disbelief should be limited. Americans should never forget that their president or government are not infallible. \\"The tyranny of a principal in an oligarchy is not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in a democracy.\\" --Montesquieu, 1748"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"If you care about the truth, if you think of yourself as informed, or if you are remotely interested in politics, you must read this book. Politics, politicians, scandals, cover-ups, lies, and conspiracies will never look the same again after you read Woodward and Bernstein's account of their ground-shaking investigation. Watergate changed everything. That these two guys took down the president is a modern miracle, and a vivid demonstration of why a free press is so important. We better hope we always have one.Your perspective on the personalities at work in the White House of today will be greatly enhanced when viewed in the light of this book. The depths politicians can sink to, the lies they will tell, and their rampant passing of the buck gets exposed here. As you read this book and learn things about America and Americans that you never would have imagined, the unfolding drama of this moment in history will grip you and propel you to the end. By following the reporter/detectives as they unravel their story, you begin to feel like you're playing a part in it. And you are."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"A fine, if somewhat dry, account of one of American journalisms finest hours.I'm rather shocked by some of the other reviews of this book which claim that it \\"proves\\" Woodward & Bernstein were \\"wrong,\\" implying that Nixon et al were innocent. The episode those reviewers seem to be referring to was not an example of a reporter getting it wrong but rather being intentionally being misled by sources. There is a difference.And the fact is that they got it RIGHT. Of all the co-conspirators, Nixon was the only one who never could bring himself to admit his own guilt.This is why I become a news reporter."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Great book Arrrived on time and in was as per the description. jjjj jjjjj jjjjj jjjjj jjjjj jjjjj jjjjj ddddd"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I read this book as part of my pre-inauguration trip reading. I'm really excited to go to Washington D.C and see my first inauguration, and this book really portrayed the nitty gritty work of our media in keeping our government accountable. I will never see the Watergate scandal the same way.All The President&#8217;s Men focuses on the journalistic side of covering the opaque Nixon administration. The Washington Post reporters embark on a winding journey started by the Watergate break-in. Through many unwilling and hesitant witnesses, to the angry secretaries, the reporters write the seemingly ever growing story piecemeal. However, unlike my previous conceptions of the scandal as instantly uncovered, the tale was much more frustrating and uncertain.From Woodward and Bernstein&#8217;s investigation, I learned how news organizations interact with the U.S government. I never fully pictured the many inner-government sources that the media uses to report the news. Especially the extent that non-authorized members of the government speak to the press. So the coining of the group of people covering up the Watergate scandal from the media as the &#8220;plumbers&#8221; was especially fascinating to me. The plumbers added an extra dimension to the battle over information that the media seeks to uncover, and helped me visualize the bigger ecosystem of hidden government information: the leakers and the plumbers.Lastly, I learned of the high personal toll politics take on those involved. Sloan, the CRP&#8217;s treasurer, exemplified a well-meaning individual caught up and negatively affected personally by politics. His physical loss of weight portrays the strains of politics visually. Just like the increase in grey hairs for Obama has often been cited as &#8220;the pressures of politics.&#8221; Even for non-people like News Organizations, the stakes are high. The Washington Post would get ensnared in FCC investigations over media properties it owned, and its reporters would be excluded from government social events during the course of the Watergate investigation. I was surprised how long Woodward and Bernstein persevered, especially for results that seemed so uncertain&#8212;the full uncovering of the Watergate Scandal."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"There is no book that better efines the kaos Richard Nixon and his men put this country through or to warn us of what could happen again if we let our guard down !!!"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Thanks.

I feel fortunate to have found it among my Dad's discards. I re-read the book after reading the recentWatergate: A Novel; all this more or less on the 40th anniversary of the deed.It's a very good book; not great on its own merits: you may recall that it was rushed to press before the Nixon story had played all the way out. The rest is inThe Final Days. But it is a really important piece of our history, and merits all manner of praise.On this reading I was really impressed by the courage showed by the authors and their superiors at the Washington Post. The courage required for a then-second-string paper to assail an extremely powerful (but not popular) president using so-so investigative methods was immense. The Post organization was unsatisfied with the status-quo, and pushed an awful lot of their chips to the middle of the table.A good read still."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"It is a good read and a book that you want to continue reading . However sometimes there is so much detail as to who saidWhat ,it can get a little confusing ."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"It starts out simply, with a phone call to Woodward with instructions to check into a burglary at the Watergate hotel, and it ends with the President of the United States resigning his office.As for everything that happens in between: WOW!!!!I never really knew much about Watergate. When I was in school, I was never taught about it. It was something that just happened. There wasn't any information provided, such as names and dates, as well as absolutely no attempt to put the whole thing into some historical context. By the time I graduated, Watergate was still just a word that carried no significance to me.In the past five years or so (long after college had ceased to be seen in my rearview mirror), I became much more interested in history. I wanted to learn about the history of the United States, warts and all. The Founders hold the most interest for me, but not at the expense of everything else.I came across this book at a Used Book Sale, and bought it for $1. That's probably as good a dollar as I spent on anything, ever, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book, even though at times I felt my head spinning at just the sheer number of people involved.To tell a story that ended up being one of great scope, the best device the authors could have chosen is to write the book in the third person, and that decision has made all the difference. Instead of trying to figure out who's doing the talking, the reader is able to get into the flow of the story itself.It feels like the reader is able to discover the information at the same time Woodward and Bernstein do, and their interview subjects run the gamut, from the nervous office aide all the way up to 'Deep Throat', the one with the largest cache of information. In addition, it appears that the deeper they go, the bigger the mess gets.Ultimately, the incident at the Watergate Hotel becomes nothing more than what it was: a botched burglary attempt. Howevever, that slip-up will eventually lead to the exposure of a group of men at the highest levels of our government who had been flouting the law at every opportunity for the previous 12 years or so.In the movie, Ben Bradlee (played by Jason Robards) summed it up best when he said: \\"We're under a lot of pressure, you know, and you put us there. Nothing's riding on this except the, uh, first amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country. Not that any of that matters\\".I came into the book with no knowledge as to what Watergate was all about. I ended it with a knowledge that I felt was gained from a Watergate Insider.That's how good it was."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"My nephew really wanted this book for Christmas.

Now I have some perspective, views on politics, life experience, which brings this story into sharper focus for me. I don't remember feeling righteously outraged but just disgusted. This time I am outraged. I am in awe of Bob and Carl, the young bulldog journalists that stopped at nothing to get to the truth. Thank God for people like this. This book is superbly written, excellently paced and I hope that when you are through reading it, you are mad as hell.

This type of investigative journalism has no match in the modern era. The press is now a shill of the American Government. The Fourth Arm of the Checks and Balances that maintain a public eye on our public servants no longer act with the tenacity and intelligence that Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward did. As always you can not generalize about a who genre of anything, with people like Jim Tucker, from American Free Press, still searching for the true elite of the World. This book makes you feel like you are running with Carl and Bob through their adventures and conversations obtaining the stories that indicated a cover-up that went all the way to the President of the United States of America. A reporters role was made more significant through the efforts of hard investigating mimicking the intelligence of the FBI. This book is a great spotlight on a brief period of history that has openly tarnished the Office of the Presidency, even though many after Nixon are adding their own coat of Tarnish. Great Book, Great Read."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"With the identity of Deep Throat now known, All the President's Men has an added bit of excitement. I couldn't help but think, \\"wasn't it obvious?\\" as I read it and thought of Deep Throat's true identity. Reading it, I realized that Woodward and Bernstein didn't try to hide the secret as well as all the speculation over the last 30 years would lead one to believe.Don't be like the taxi driver I had late one night in D.C. this summer who said he didn't need to read this book because \\"I lived through it.\\" Man that guy was a jerk.

It gave me no background and therefore only those who lived during Watergate could understand. I don't care if you talked to so-and-so's secretary and didn't get any good leads. I agreed to read this book with the thought that I would gain more information about what Watergate was really about. Well I know a little more but now I care less. Sad but true."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This book is a classic, not because of it's literary qualities but because it was first in the queue. Frankly, after re-reading it 25 years after watching the Watergate story unfold first-hand I wonder how my daughter, without the benefit of my prior knowledge, could ever really understand what happened back then and why it was important from this book. It clearly captures a lot of key facts, but does a lousy job of telling the story in a manner suited for the ages. A period piece at best."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Of all the Watergate books I have read, All The President's Men is without doubt the most badly written. Woodward and Bernstein clearly had a great deal of difficulty working out whose perspective to write it from and, having settled on the third-person, do so awkwardly.While it is interesting to read about the affair from a journalist's point of view, the book is filled with far too much self-effacing backslapping to be of real interest. You can only put up with so much 'we're so nice, we always told people we were journalists / we're not gifted, it was all just hard work'.As books go it's certainly not a complete disaster but I'd suggest that for a novel-style account of Watergate to instead read Gordon Liddy's 'Will' and for a factual account to read Fred Emery's excellent 'Watergate'. ATPM, however, is worth buying for one reason alone - the pictures in the middle are fantastic. I have never seen any of the Watergate culprits looking *quite* so miserable and this is gloriously offset by the fact that the Washington Post staff shown are smiling so much it looks like they have a congenital defect."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description.

But I found the book very hard to read. To me it was almost like reading the geneology sections in the Bible where so-and-so beget so-and-so, one name after another. Boring.

However, after reading Colodny'sSilent Coup, I came to regard W&amp;B as rather sloppy and tunnel-visioned in their quest to assign blame. The critical point in changing my opinion was thegoings on the morning after the breakin in the Pacific, where Dean and Mitchell were on assignment. Colodny shows conclusively that what John Dean testified to with respect to Mitchell's involvement was absolutely and incontrovertibly false. I figured that 1) Mitchell should never have gone to jail,2) Magruder was a little liar, and3) If John dean could falsely testify against someone he didn't even dislike in order to reduce his sentence, he would lie about absolutely Anything.

Woodward and Bernstein have written a riveting account of how their tenacity and persistence caused the unravelling of the Nixon administration. It is fast-paced, gives an adequate synopsis of Watergate to a first-time Nixon reader, and re-affirms the need for the Fourth Estate and investigative journalism. From another dimension, it gives an inside peek into how newspapers work, their struggles over what to put on the front page every morning, and the debates that go on in the editor's office. fascinating stuff."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Having recently seen the movie for the 3rd time, and STILL not sure of &quot;who&quot; did &quot;what&quot; to &quot;who&quot;, or &quot;why&quot;, I picked the paperback version up over the past holiday...and read it in 3 days/nites. Yes, there ARE a LOT of &quot;players&quot;, but the p'back version has a great listing of who they are, and their relationship to the story. With photos in the middle of the book, you even have a 2nd source of reference. While checking back and forth does take time...so did the uncovering of how totally corrupt the Nixon administration was. EQUALLY as valuable is the story of how the Washington Post editors and reporters went to GREAT lengths to confirm 2, and 3, and 4 times, the info they were discovering...to ensure &quot;fair&quot;, and more importantly, &quot;accurate&quot; reporting. EVERY US citizen, not just those in school, should read this book to see just how low print/radio/TV &quot;news&quot; has sunk in the collective race to be &quot;first to report&quot;, even if what is said is false. (Examples: The TWA explosion off Long Island, and Richard Jewell's (spell?) arrest for the Atlanta bombing.) What worked best for me: Saw the movie, then read the book, then watched the movie again with the list of players. I think you will never doubt that Nixon got off easy... especially since Gerry Ford gave him a &quot;full pardon&quot;. Slick Willie Clinton is a true &quot;bushleaguer&quot; in comparison.

The film version of the same title was also a huge success and Washington Post publisher Ben Bradlee's faith in his reporters was richly rewarded. Actor Richard Poe showcases his talents in the audiobook with a nifty retelling of this landmark incident in American history."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"\\"Watergate\\" is a word familiar to nearly every American, whether or not each individual understands its significance. Although it undoubtedly holds various and conflicting significations for a wide array of people, the word essentially refers to the 1972 burglary at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and its aftermath. This epochal event, along with the legal and political fallouts that followed it, led to a nationwide crisis whose vast sweep eventually encompassed the public - and, in many cases, legal - downfalls of President Richard Nixon and many of his top aides. The task of unraveling this case and presenting it to the public largely fell to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, two Washington Post reporters. All The President's Men is their personal chronicle of the adventure. It charts the course of their investigation from its initially unpromising and deceptive appearance as a routine burglary to its eventual status as one of the most famous and fateful scandals in American history. It details the methods and tactics that the two reporters made use of throughout their investigative journey and offers little or no personal commentary along the way; put another way, the authors essentially stick to the facts of their work, rather than using the book to advance their own political agenda. Thus, despite being personally involved in the events they chronicle, the authors are able to maintain an objective tone throughout the book. As a direct result of this, they draw little or no conclusions about the significance of Watergate; rather, they simply provide an overview of the facts as they saw them arise, thereby leaving readers essentially free to form their own opinions and conclusions. Thus, even though it involves a significant amount of personal history, the book should not be regarded as autobiographical so much as an account of a journalistic investigation that happens to be written by the two men responsible for it. All The President's Men is a worthwhile, readable, and well-written book with the potential to appeal not only to those with a keen interest in its subject, but also to a larger audience.The book features numerous strong points that serve to render reading it a worthwhile and interesting experience. The first of these is its sheer readability; it is easy to read and remains interesting throughout. These traits derive primarily from the fact that the book, despite being essentially documentary in nature, is structured like a detective novel, rather than a non-fiction book. Thus, Watergate is the mystery to be solved, and Woodward and Bernstein are the detectives. Armed with this setup, the book is fast-paced and exciting in nature; despite the occasional plethora of esoteric details, it never slips into the dry and boring. As a result of this presentation, it also retains a considerable degree of suspense that nearly forces the reader to keep reading. This quality, needless to say, is customarily absent from books of this type - a fact that renders the asset even more valuable than it would otherwise be.Another factor contributing to the book's inherent readability is its enduring relevancy to American society. Despite the inevitable passage of time, it is nearly as applicable to the lives of young people reading it today for the first time as it was to those who lived through the events it chronicles. This is true because it speaks to a concern fundamental to American democracy - the constant threat of corruption in government. This, of course, is a timeless worry; colonial Americans were concerned about it, just as twenty-first century Americans are today. Indeed, anyone reading it today is likely to be struck by the eerie similarity between the presidentially-endorsed wiretapping described in All The President's Men and the more recent occurrence that is emerging at the present moment. Aside from giving renewed credence to the old clich&eacute; that \\"history repeats itself,\\" this similarity also underscores the enduring power and continuing relevancy of Woodward and Bernstein's book.In many ways, in fact, young readers pouring over the book today have a more interesting read in store for them than those who perused it upon release. The realization of this surprising truth speaks to the fact that readers today come to the book supplied with information not known to its original audience. For example, the identity of Deep Throat - Woodward's mysterious, cigarette-smoking informant who long ago passed into legend - was revealed only in 2005. From the date of the book's publication throughout the ensuing thirty plus years, the identity of Deep Throat was hotly debated; indeed, the open nature of this question formed one of the most famous aspects of the book. Of course, one could argue that knowing former associate FBI director Mark Felt was Deep Throat demystifies the book and spoils part of its appeal for present-day readers. Conversely, though, one can argue that it adds an extra layer of enjoyment; there is a certain undeniable charm in knowing the book's secret before one begins reading it. Also, the book was written and published before Nixon's impeachment and resignation; indeed, it ends with the following retroactively ironic quote from the president: \\"I have no intention of walking away from the job that the American people elected me to do for the people of the United States.\\" The fact that readers today are already armed with this information gives them a perspective on the book that its original readers simply could not have had; this may well make for a more interesting read. In summary, then, factors ranging from the book's style of presentation to the new perspectives it offers current readers serve to insure that it remains anything but outdated; thus, its essential readability is one of its main strengths.The second strength making the book a worthwhile read is the fact that, even though it is very readable and even entertaining, it also contains a wealth of valuable information. For example, it would serve as a good primer for those who know little about Watergate; it gives a solid general overview of the scandal from the uncertain and apparently inconsequential beginning of the burglary all the way to its later stages. For anyone looking to learn more about the subject, it is a good place to start; indeed, as it is both interesting and informative, it will likely inspire readers to learn and read more about the subject elsewhere.Aside from its usefulness as an educational tool for those looking to learn more about Watergate, the book also contains a vast store of information on another subject - the ins and outs of investigative journalism. Readers who want to know how reporters do what they do will find much to interest them in All The President's Men. Woodward and Bernstein often go into great detail about their methods, thereby providing a fascinating glimpse into the world of journalism in the process. Fortunately for the reader, though, they never get bogged down in this detail, extensive though it sometimes is; the book remains fresh and interesting throughout. As a direct consequence of this extreme amount of detail, the reader is left with an overwhelming impression of the authors' knowledge; Woodward and Bernstein clearly know what they are talking about, as every reader will learn. Their descriptions of the journalistic process come off as decidedly authoritative, as do their double- and triple-checked reports themselves. It is true that the book contains few footnotes and no bibliography, but these are arguably unnecessary; the story is Bernstein's and Woodward's, based on their own research. As this research consisted almost entirely of interviews, the book could have no bibliography in the normal sense. Still, despite these lacks, the highly informative overall nature of the book makes up one of its main strengths and contributes to its overall worthiness.All The President's Men also possesses a third strength that adds to its overall worth - its broad appeal. As hinted at earlier, Woodward and Bernstein's book has the potential to appeal to a much broader audience than most other books dealing with a specific political topic. For example, like most other books of its ilk, it appeals to historians and other professional researchers; it is, after all, a thorough and well-researched primary source. Unlike many other such books, however, it also appeals to more general readers. For example, as noted earlier, it can serve as a good primer for those interested in learning more about Watergate. It may also hold interest for other types of readers - those curious about the journalistic process, those with a general interest in Nixon or the time period, etc. Clearly, then, the broad range of appeal offered by the book is one of the main strengths serving to make it a worthwhile read.All of this is not meant to suggest, however, that the book is perfect; indeed, it does have a number of defects. Fortunately, these are all minor points that do not detract significantly from the book's high level of overall quality. For instance, throughout the book, the authors continually indulge in the annoying habit of referring to themselves in the third person. A single, random example will suffice to illustrate this deplorable tendency: \\"Bernstein and Woodward were interpreting this reticence as a sign that their suspicions were correct.\\" Despite the inherently negative nature of such self-referential statements, one can (perhaps) argue for its justification in this one instance; after all, in a book written by two people, readers would likely be puzzled by the use of first person pronouns. A second minor defect is the book's lack of citations. As previously mentioned, a bibliography would be superfluous, but a comprehensive list of the Washington Post articles - as well as the handful of others - referred to in the book would have been a useful addition for the curious. Finally, a third minor problem is the simple fact that the multitude of names thrown out during the course of the book can be confusing and difficult to keep track of for the uninitiated; this problem is eased somewhat by the helpful index and cast of characters provided by the authors. Again, this small amount of relatively insignificant problems detracts - but only slightly - from what otherwise remains a very worthwhile and readable book.In summary, All The President's Men is an interesting, highly accessible, and well-executed book. Its strengths include its overall readability, its generally informative nature, and its wide range of appeal. A few minor flaws mar only the surface of a book that is of a very high overall quality. Though it was written more than three decades ago, it remains a vital chronicle of a specific time and place, as well as an eternal testament to the importance of detecting and spotlighting corruption in government. Consequently, it has earned the right to be named a member of that rarest of groups - books that can be enjoyed by scholars and general readers alike."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Woodward and Bernstein, famous reporters for the Washington Post during the Watergate scandal, chronicle their experience investigating and exposing the deceptive actions of President Nixon and his cronies during Watergate. This book takes the reader through Woodward and Bernstein's efforts at uncovering the truth, internal dilemmas about the information they were uncovering, and covert meetings with confidential sources. They tell a tale of mystery and intrigue that stands up to some of the world's best fiction except that this story actually happened and signaled the end of an era where the US Presidency was respected above all else.This book is a fascinating look at how investigative journalism once was. Instead of printing first and asking questions later, Woodward and Bernstein, along with their editors, took painstaking efforts at checking, double checking, and even triple checking their sources and information before putting something derogatory in print. It seems a sharp contrast to journalism today that appears to be publish now, ask questions later, and file a retraction in small print even later. This book also tells the tale of two very opposite reporters and how they pulled together to write about the crime spree of the century and topple a corrupt Presidency. It gets better with each reading."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"The story of Watergate is certainly the political story of a lifetime. In All the President's Men, Woodward and Bernstein give the complete and definitive story of the who, what, when, where and why of the fall of the Nixon administration. This non-fiction book gives thought provoking insight as to the role and power of informational media the free press.Woodward and Bernstein are two reporters for the Washington Post trying to scout out the facts of the National Democratic Headquarters break-in. What begins the story as a trivial robbery attempt by some Cubans, escalates to a scandal including of some of the government's highest authorities. Harassed and bullied by a desperate Republican administration, Woodward and Bernstein travel through the peaks and valleys that come from their investigation. The book is fast paced, giving insight to interviews with previously unnamed sources of those from the FBI, CIA, and other top government organizations, making it feel as if you yourself are searching for the answer to the question of Watergate. While the cast of characters is broad and occasionally confusing, the immense detail and care taken in the accuracy of content is astonishing and shows what painstaking work good journalism truly is.A majority of the time, media is described as being primarily liberal in its writing. Bernstein and Woodward worked to print only bipartisan and factual reporting and kill the image of the typical news agency. By being able to print any and all of the dirt they can decipher about the cover up of Watergate, these two men are able to bring justice and change to the ethics of the White House. Not only had they delivered the truth to the American people, but they had also given light to the corruption that could take place when the government was left unchecked by a skeptical media.All the President's Men should be on the reading list of every American. There is no true way to conceive of the strength and influence of mass media without following the exciting and nerve-racking story of these two average journalists who are simply out to find the truth and bring their story into the light. After reading this book informational media gains new perspective and appreciation."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I had to stay up well into the night to finish this one. This is the kind of book that I would recommend to most anyone - it is history, mystery, politics, espionage, journalism, comedy, and tragedy all rolled into one. The Watergate break-in was literally the tip of the iceberg - the full extent of what went on is mind-blowing. The idea that Nixon wouldn't have been impeached for these crimes is ludicrous - whether or not he should have been - that is up to each individual."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"What can I say that has not already been said? This book is very good and given the problems of the last administration, it is even more interesting. I am also a huge fan of Bob Woodward. Do yourself a favor and read The Final Days also by Bob Woodward. Together they give you a very good overview of the situation in the last two years of the Nixon White House."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This book is the investigative account of Watergate and the cover up that followed more than it is about Watergate itself, in my opinion. It also does a great job talking about the decisions of Tom Bradlee to hold on stories or run with them. Ms. Graham is featured in this book and her role and support of these unknown reporters. This book not only educates us about the story of Watergate but the inner workings of the newpaper business. Once you understand the characters and who worked for whom, you won't be able to put the book down."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I just finished this book a few minutes ago. All I can say is, \\"WOW!\\"Having grown up in the naive period when we were inculcated with the notion that elected officials looked out for us regular people, it is hard to shake some of that naivete unless it's in print and in front of my eyes. And this book does an outstanding job at educating people in the subversion of the democratic process from within. However...I think when the definitive book on the George W. Bush administration is written, it will be far more devastating.The book is an amazing triumph for Woodward and Bernstein, and a terrific experience for the reader. Next on my list is \\"The Final Days.\\""},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I read this book when it first came out in 1974 and the one aspect of the entire Watergate scandal that astounded me was how stupid the principals were. It frightened me to think that this collection of men occupied the highest positions in the United States and were capable of committing such idiotic acts.First and foremost there was Richard Nixon. His re-election campaign in 1972 was against George McGovern and there was no doubt at any time that Nixon would emerge victorious. Nevertheless, the paranoia in his administration was so deep that they felt the need to break into the national Democratic headquarters at the Watergate hotel in an attempt to plant bugs. This action was carried out so incompetently that the burglars were easily caught, which started the entire affair now referred to as Watergate.Bernstein and Woodward were meticulous in documenting the snowballing difficulties and actions of the members of the Nixon administration. The actions of Nixon's men ultimately led to the collapse of his administration and even thirty years after the fact the account of their investigation is riveting.When reading this book again I was reminded of two quotes related to that era. The first is by former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger that was said after Nixon resigned and Gerald Ford became president. He looked to someone and said something like, \\"The system worked, by God the system worked.\\" The second was by long-time newspaper columnist Jack Germond. While appearing on a TV news talk show, he said,\\" When Watergate first started to become public, none of us believed that Nixon could be that stupid. It turned out we were wrong.\\" Finally, I would like to commend W. Mark Feldt, the man who was the infamous source \\"Deep Throat.\\" Without his patriotic actions taken at great personal risk, it is possible that Nixon could have gotten away with it."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"It is really surprising the amount of work the two authors put into the investigation. Reading through this fast-paced book, I was struck by the amount of informants and under-handed activities that go in politics, and what the journalists needed to do to get information.From secret late night meetings with Deep Throat, to interviews with FBI and White House officials, Woodward and Bernstein search for the truth.Very impressive."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I read/listened to All The Presidents Men, because I am a Journalism major in college. Therefore, I am partially biased. The book offers great detail into the world of Journalism and the problems/consquences a journalist goes through as they work a story. With dedication and determination Woodward and Bernstein are able to uncover the biggest story of the 20th century. For those reading the book for school my recommendation would be in fact to read it. As opposed to listening to it as I did. However for those reading for the fun of it. I thought the Audio version was captivating and well paced."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"they way the investigation is described play by play is an easy read. I'm glad I was assigned this book in college, the way I like to learn history - reading the story of how it happened."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"It is hardly necessary for me to review All the President's Men by Bernstein & Woodward -- or \\"Woodstein\\" as they were collectively named by their editors. I think the book has already shown that it stands the test of time, and the gist of the story and the roles of the two authors in bringing about President Nixon's resignation are well known as history. Having seen and enjoyed the movie of the same title, I took the opportunity of the 30th year anniversary of the publication of All the President's Men to take up the topic afresh. I can whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone who still believes that their government is always acting in the interests of its constituents.All the President's Men is about the investigative reporting of Bernstein & Woodward, rather than merely about the Nixon administration and its attempts to sabotage the Democratic Party campaigns of 1972. It is written in the third person and tells the tale of how various leads came to the journalists and also how they ran up against (and usually, eventually overcame) various obstacles. For those that have seen the film, the movie basically ends at the point in the story when news organizations other than the Washington Post began to seriously cover \\"Watergate\\" -- that the story no longer just belonged to Woodward & Bernstein. But, there was still a lot that happened after that. I found the ill-conceived senate confirmation hearing for then-Acting Director of the FBI, L. Patrick Gray, to be particularly interesting. Gray convinced Nixon that his status should be raised from \\"acting\\" to \\"actual\\" director because he had to keep a lid on all the issues raised by the FBI's investigation of the White House in connection with the Watergate break-in. Some new person coming on, ignorant of what had been going on at the Bureau, might not be able to keep certain less than legal activities under their hat. So, Gray was nominated by the White House, only to face the hearing and spill most of the beans himself.Although All the President's Men refers to a different Republican administration from more than 30 years ago, it was also instructive to be reminded that \\"politics is politics,\\" and many of the same games are still being played today."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This is a tale of a few good mens struggle to - against all odds and against the most powerfull man in the world - find the truth and see that justice is served.A must read to all reporters and &aacute;ll democratic minded people."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Having not studied Watergate in school I have always been intrigued by it. I highly reccomend this book. Its very well written and enjoyable to read. Its also exciting and suspenseful, as two journalists put everything on the line for their country."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Reading this book made me realize just how little most American people my age really know about such an important and devastating event in our history as Nixon's Watergate. Of course everyone has to take the same American history course, and they learn the important events like the Revolution, the Civil War, the World Wars, and the Cold War (though I'm sure most teenagers couldn't tell you what years each took place in).&quot;All the President's Men&quot; is basically an omniscent look at the reporting and journalism of the book's authors Woodward and Bernstein from June 1972 when the Watergate criminals were arrested to July 1973 when Butterfield revealed Nixon's private taping system to the Senate Committee. I think one of the most important aspects of the authors' research and reporting was that, contrary to the accusations of the White House, neither Woodward nor Bernsten had political desires to see Nixon implicated. Woodward was a Republican and Berstein was apathetic to the politics of the time and didn't vote in the '72 presidential elections.Though this book doesn't focus on the Congressional impeachment proceedings and eventual resignation of President Nixon (which is left to the sequel, &quot;The Final Days&quot;), the importance of Watergate is especially relevent to most young people who came coming into political fruition during the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. While most teenagers (as I also did) formed opinions based on what we'd been taught by our parents (i.e. on lying, adultary, etc.), Watergate provided a historical base to the impeachment conditions that eventually surrounded the Clinton administration.The point is that this book is both an interesting, and the importance of the events that it describes is priceless to the American youth that strives to learn more about the political process and the standards that are applied to a sitting president."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Woodward and Bernstein have done a masterful job of telling how they unraveled the twisted story of the Nixon Administration's capers and illegal activities. What struck me as quite strange was how Nixon, the strident anti-communist, did things that served to undermine the US Constitution which he claimed to love and swore to uphold. It appears that he did more to harm the country than Communist leaders like Kruschev, Brezhnev, Castro and Ho Chi Minh could ever have done. Watergate and the activities of the so-called Plumbers worked to undermine the basic system of democracy by taking away the people's right and ability to have the candidates run a fair and honest campaign. To me, this is the biggest threat to our country and the biggest shame about Watergate.Having lived through the Watergate years, I still find it incredible that such intelligent men could be so stupid. Why did the Republicans need to break in to Democratice headquarters any way? After all, McGovern was a far out, weak candidate whom Nixon was going to destroy in the election, why take the risks?Woodward and Bernstein hold one's attention as they go about proving that there was much more to Watergate than the \\"third rate burglary which was nothing the President would be interested in\\" according to Ron Zieglar.

The Reporters, The Director and his Actors should feel proud. Two intrepid reports expose the rampant corruption within the Whitehouse and bring down a criminal president.What is shocking on seeing this film again is that in the present political climate in America the actions of these iconic reporters would not be possible.Under this present administration these reporters would be subpoenaed and made to reveal their sources. So quite possibly if Woodward and Bernstein revealed nothing as would be expected, they could, before the night is out, be stuck in some flea infested jail without the basic right of seeing their lawyer AND before the story had a chance to make any political waves.What is happening in America is the rapid corrosion of Civil Liberties and a grand exercise in consolidation of power. No reporters today could do what those reporters did.The American media as a whole has been eroding it's own power by following the party line and cowering to it's public.

It's been thirty years, now, since the thwarted break-in at the Watergate. Most of the higher-ups in President Nixon's administration have passed away, and subsequent generations reared on Iran-Contra and Whitewater may not even remember what the fuss was about. But from the very first page of this book, history becomes life and events rush forward to the inevitable conclusion that still seems impossible today.Woodward and Bernstein's reporting is the major thrust of the first half of &quot;President's&quot;. We watch both reporters work late into the night, interviewing reluctant and/or anonymous witnesses in an attempt to find out just why the Watergate burglars had connections with the White House, and how far up the political chain of command those men were connected. Along the way, mistakes are made and a reputations are wrongfully derailed. But the story -- the crimes and the subsequent cover-ups may have indeed been directed by the President of the United States himself! -- takes on a life of its own, and Woodward and Bernstein become witness to the defining story of an era.Much of &quot;All the President's Men&quot; has passed into legend, especially the unrevealed identity of Woodward's executive branch contact known only as &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. The Watergate players to this day still debate just who Deep Throat was -- John Dean seems to publish a book on the subject every five years. Time has proven most of the accusations correct -- for an interesting exercise, try comparing Woodward's and Bernstein's discoveries with the corresponding daily entries in &quot;The Haldeman Diaries&quot;). The book gives so few clues as to make the exercise nearly impossible, even to those of us who've read all there is to read about Watergate and Nixon. Was it John Dean? Alexander Haig? Perpetual Nixon apologist Bill Safire? The answer will be made known in my lifetime, but I would like to think sooner rather than later.Although 30 years is a short time in American history, in politics it can be a lifetime. The meticulous triple and quadruple-checking of the Washington Post staff has given way to the unfounded accusations that support a half-dozen instant political bestsellers. Certainly no-one uses the passive voice quite as monotonously as do Woodward and Bernstein. These defects, however, are minor: the antics of Colson and Liddy and Haldeman and even the amusing capers of Donald Segretti remain fascinating in print even today.When you're done with &quot;All the President's Men&quot;, I recommend &quot;The Final Days&quot; (by Woodward and Bernstein) and &quot;The Haldeman Diaries&quot;, and then the rebuttal books put out by Nixon staffers such as Haig and Erlichman."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I am not an American, and I often find that I come short when discussing political history with my American friends. Therefore, I am always looking for books that can fill gaps in my knowledge. \\"All the President's men\\" is such a book.The beginning of this book contains a \\"Cast of Characters\\", a detailed description of persons and their involvement in the case. If you are a like me, you make sure to dog-ear this page for your reference, as you work your way through the flurry of different names and places. Fear not, the struggle of keeping track of everyone involved is worth it!This book provides us with two distinct \\"different\\" story-lines. First, a fascinating description of investigative journalism. We learn how newspapers work, the fights over cover-page stories, the importance of getting your name under the story line, and arguments and discussions in the editor's office. I particularly came to admire the owner of the Washington Post, Cathrine Graham, for her tremendous courage during this period. The newspaper received threats, directed to specific people, as well as with regards to possible lawsuits. The case could have brought the paper down and destroyed it completely. Second, the very detailed and interesting guide to the collapse of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the United States.The Watergate Scandal started innocently enough, with a simple break-in in the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. The \\"Washington Post\\" had Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward covering the case. The two inexperienced reporters would soon see that the more they kept digging, the more obscure and unbelievable the story got. In the end, they had a list of people involved including the top level of government, the US intelligence community and ultimately, the White House itself.What most people don't think of is that, back in the summer of 1972, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were two young and enthusiastic, but complete \\"nobodies\\" in the world of journalism. What they had in common was that they both worked in the Washington Post's \\"Metro section\\", but not much more. They disliked each other, and were not keen on working together. So, after spending the first months using a lot of energy mistrusting each other, they learned how to trust each other and work together.These two young men set in motion a powerful legacy, which extends well beyond their first set of writings for the Washington Post. They covered the case that stands as a milestone in US history. The Watergate Scandal won Woodward and Bernstein fame and fortune, including the Pulitzer Price. Their book \\"All the President's men\\" details all the events of one of the greatest political scandal in US history, which in the end, brought down a President.\\"All the President's men\\" is fast-paced, and easy to read. It gives a very good summary of the Watergate Scandal (and American history) to the lay reader.Comparing the Watergate Scandal with the election in Florida a couple of years back, or Clinton's Lewinsky affair and Travelgate, I think that \\"All the President's men\\" puts things in perspective for us, and highlights a REAL political scandal.I couldn't recommend it more. A page-turner!"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"What is largely forgotten is that in the summer of 1972, Bob Woodward and Carl Berstein were two young but complete nobody reporters assigned not to political reporting but the Washington Post's Metro section. When they were assigned to cover a &quot;fourth rate burglary&quot; at the Watergate Hotel, it changed the course of their careers and of American History. It is no exaggeration that had more conventional Washington political reporters been assigned to the Watergate story, it might never have been exposed in enough detail to bring down Richard Nixon. This book is an American classic. Though it lacks historical perspective on the Watergate affair, it is vital to anyone who wants to understand the greatest American political crisis of the Post World War Two era."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"On June 17, 1972 Bob Woodward received a telephone call and was asked to cover a burglary of Democratic headquarters; he had just finished some stories on the attempt to assassinate George Wallace. All five burglars stood out against the usual suspects in police court; all had CIA connections.Page 21 tells of the investigation into McCord's activities; he worked full-time for the Committee to Re-elect the President. McCord followed orders unquestioningly, did not act on his own initiative. Two of the burglars had the name and phone numbers of Howard Hunt. This number led to Charles Colson, then to the R. Mullen Company. Pages 24-25 tell how address books and telephone numbers were used in this investigation, with off-the-record reports. While this burglary was bungled, how many others succeeded (p.26)? The purpose of the break-in was for &quot;scandal, gossip&quot; (p.27). [To find someone vulnerable to bribery or blackmail who could be used as a spy or saboteur.] There were too many coincidences in this story (some of these burglars were around when offices of prominent Democratic lawyers were burglarized). While a burglary usually means taking something away, it could also be used to plant incriminating papers. Days later John Mitchell resigned as manager of the Nixon campaign (p.30). Bernstein went to Miami, and found out that a $25,000 check donated to President Nixon's campaign was deposited to the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars (p.44). Page 45 gives an example of how confidential medical records are used in politics. The GAO audit determined that over $500,000 in campaign funds was mishandled (p.40). They learned about money-laundering (p.54). Page 55 explains how this is raised for protection money.Bob Woodward had a secret source (&quot;Deep Throat&quot;) who confirmed information that had been obtained elsewhere (p.71). These reporters had different styles (pp.49-51). The big news was that Attorney General John Mitchell authorized campaign funds for apparently illegal activities (p.98)! Page 104 explains a clever denial. Both reporters had sources in the Justice Department who could confirm details (p.111). An unfair accusation in the 'Washington Post' could ruin careers. The Watergate bugging made little sense by itself, but could indicate part of a broader campaign (pp.113-4); page 116 gives an example. Page 127 tells how a faked letter could derail a successful campaign! The Nixon take-over of the Federal agencies was presented (p.130), as if it were subjecting the government and nation his personal whims. There was subversion of the electoral process (p.135). This was unprecedented in scope and intensity (p.143). Page 147 tells of an imposter who imitated the voice of a McGovern campaign official. There were other horror stories from the Muskie staffers (p.148). Control of the operations was traced to Nixon's appointments secretary, who had daily access to the President. The rest of this book covers events from 1973 until early 1974. Page 273 summarizes the connections (Chapter 13).A &quot;third rate burglary&quot; led to White House personnel. Further investigations lead to wide-scale illegal fundraising, and political sabotage that involves misdemeanors and other crimes. Most of those involved had little experience in politics. The idol with feet of clay came crashing down. Most people under 40 missed these events; learn about it from this book."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Even after repeat viewings of the film &quot;All the President's Men&quot; on DVD, and really appreciating what a classic it is, it cannot beat the original book.

In the last few years, between the Jayson Blair scandal at the New York Times and the New Republic embarassment with Stephen Glass, it's refreshing to read this book and see what journalism is meant to be. For one thing, Woodward and Bernstein endeavored to be objective even when describing themselves, and their own actions - being honest about their own weaknesses and habits as reporters. There is no bombast or ego here, or in &quot;Final Days&quot;, about what brilliant reporting they did, or how they broke this white-hot story when they were both quite young. It makes Blair and Glass's arrogance much harder to stomach."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I loved this book. As a thirty something who never studied watergate in school this book made me understand why it is so often talked about.Unlike the movie, the book penetrates the viciousness of the Nixon slush money machine and its undermining of Nixon's opponents' political campaigns through many awful deeds. The watergate break-in itself was really only the tip of the iceberg and that is not addressed in the movie. This book would be a fascinating read as fiction and as non-fiction is one of the greatest tales ever told. The book like the movie is also exciting, dangerous and suspenseful as the two reporters put their lives on the line for the sake of American history."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This now-famous book is one of those rare creatures - a real-life thriller that's actually interesting for the average person to read. Starting with a simple break-in at the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate Hotel, two reporters from the Washington Post followed the trail of money and corruption back to its source. If you haven't been living under a rock, you know exactly how this story turns out, but watching Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward track down the clues is quite interesting.The flurry of different names and places can be intimidating, especially to the reader who does not have a lot of prior knowledge about the Watergate scandal. One will probably find oneself frequently flipping to the convenient Cast Of Characters page at the beginning of the book. Bernstein and Woodworth themselves are left rather faceless and I often found myself getting the two of them confused. Their attempts to humanize themselves fall flat almost every time, but that's to be expected; they are reporters, not pulp fiction writers and this is not a made-up story.This book is recommended for anyone and is quite a page-turner, even for someone with only a passing interest in politics and history. For someone who enjoys mysterious and thrillers, there's nothing better than a good story from real-life. Everyone should read this book, if only for the historical impact that it has had on presidential politics."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"In the sub-genre of journalistic memoir, there simply is no book better than this. It is written still in the heat of battle - as it was being put together, Nixon had not yet resigned - and conveys the sense of being under pressure from public power, from the fears and lack of cooperation of individuals, and from their own human fallibility; conveys it better than anything except, perhaps, a war diary. As writing, it has not aged. And it is worth having for one very good reason: that Watergate has shrunk in the memory. After many succeeding penny-ante scandals, artificially built up to be something they were not, it is important to remember that the President at the time did not go down for the silly raid on the National Democratic Committee, nor even for having a few outright sleazeballs in his ante-room, but - to put it bluntly - for turning the White House into a criminal association within the meaning of the act. Secret intelligence, slush funds acquired from corrupt businessmen, sabotage, slander, destruction of documents, behind-the-scenes fixing - even arson and threats of violence - were the daily bread of the Nixon camp, the way they did business. If they had a choice between a legal and an illegal way to do anything, they chose, not the legal one - nor even the one that made most sense in terms of non-moral efficiency - but the illegal one, as a sort of constitutional preference. There has never been anything like this in the White House, before or - fortunately - since: everything that may be quoted against any other President, up to and including Teapot Dome and Ulysses Grant's inglorious time in office, simply pales in front of the daily, routine criminality of the Nixon men. At the time, the Republican Party at large was quite clear that the Nixonites were an entity apart, dedicated purely to the personal power of the President. And long before the Plumbers ever broke into Watergate, Richard Nixon was in hock and virtually paying blackmail to them and to similarly unscrupulous characters for a score of illegal acts; in the end, that, more than any break-in, made the exposure of the President virtually inevitable.Just as inevitable, of course, is revisionism. I know that someone called Colodny has come up with an \\"alternative\\" account that charges that John Dean arranged for the break-in to cover up for his wife's involvement in a call-girl ring and then sold the President and his colleagues down the river to protect himself; and that Alexander Haig worked against the President and manipulated Woodward and Bernstein. The second statement is highly unlikely, in view of the fact that nobody comes out of THE LAST DAYS - the book that followed this - worse than Haig, who is shown to be a smooth careerist whose \\"military\\" career saw him go from Colonel to four-star General within six years at the White House, and who has loyalty for nobody but himself; a strange way to promote him to the public. The first only shifts the blame from one Nixon sleazeball to another, without doing anything to alter the fact that the Nixon administration, as a whole, was corrupt with a depth and thoroughness that, while not unfamiliar in American municipal politics, was and remains unique at national level. The evidence is beyond denial, and plenty of it is aired in this book - unbreakable paper trails such as the cheque signed by a perfectly honest Republican fundraiser called Kenneth H. Dahlberg, which ended up in the bank account of one of the burglars: with this sort of hard fact staring at us in the face, what does it matter whether John Dean lied or not?Indeed, the best way to understand what happened in America between 1969 and 1973 may perhaps be to think of the politics of Chicago or Tammamy Hall transplanted to the federal level: comparison with corrupt Third World regimes is not very helpful, because Third World politics do not have the elaboration, thoroughness and reach that Nixonism had.This, in the end, is the main value of this memoir: as a sort of pre-emptive strike against revisionism, reminding us that - whatever its ramifications - the Watergate affair was unique in its extent and depth, and should never be simply normalized in memory by aligning it with footling items about smeared cigars and hanging chads."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"By now, most people know what this book is about. Woodward and Bernstein were the Washington Post reporters who blew open the case of the Watergate break-in in 1972 and brought it to the steps of the white house.So you might think there isn't much to learn from reading the book. That's a big mistake.First of all, this is a great read. It's a page turner. Even though we all know how it comes out, watching it unfold is exciting. Woodward and Bernstein write very well, and there's a lot of humor sprinkled in as well.Second, this book is a cliff-hanger. It was published in the spring of '74, several months before Nixon's resignation. Because of this, it's not written with the resignation as \\"the point,\\" and that gives it a very different perspective than most retrospectives of the Watergate era. It pays attention to all the steps of the investigation that get glossed over in the rush to the resignation most historians indulge in.Third, now that we know who \\"Deep Throat\\" was, you can read this book with a whole different set of eyes. Knowing who it was, it looks perfectly obvious who it must have been, even though it wasn't obvious at all until very recently. It's fun to know that you know the secret that the book refuses to reveal.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this book outlines in staggering, depressing detail how much the American people just didn't care for so long. Nixon was reelected with 49 states and 61% of the vote AFTER much of the scandal broke. We tend to say, when watching the news, \\"If this scandal was really important, like Watergate, we'd know.\\" Well, we didn't even know when we heard about Watergate, and that is perhaps the scariest lesson of all."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I loved the movie &quot;All the President's Men&quot; when I watched it during a journalism class one summer at Northwestern University. But you know how movies are: they're always more exciting, more quick-paced than the books they're based on. Not so in this case. Woodward and Bernstein bring the All the President's Men -- and their interactions with them and with the people who worked for them -- to life in such a way that one needn't have lived through the Watergate era to understand what really happened. All we need to know now is who Deep Throat was!"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful to read, even though there is no doubt about how it will end. The processes that Woodward and Bernstein went through to get their sources and check their facts could be a book in its own right. The one thing that stood out the most in my mind as I was reading was how perfect the whole conspiracy could have been had it not been for human nature. As everything began to unravel, it was, in the truest sense, every man for himself. Furthermore, the sheer number of people involved almost insured that the crimes would not stay hidden. This is a fascinating book, not only from a political science or historical standpoint, but also a sociological one. READ THIS!!!!"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I found out about this book in my 8th grade U.S. history class. I had to read it for a report but being a slacker I rented the movie instead. After seeing the film I rushed out to find the book at a local bookstore. I finished it in two days and started reading it all over. Great job Bernstein &amp; Woodward!"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"a must for the journalist to readgreat read that shows the insecurities of woodward and bernstein throughout their investigation where they often doubted themselves and got themselves into trouble trying to uncover the truth. perserverance pays off in a story of two men who sought justice and a great story at the same time."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Once upon a time, political reporting largely consisted of adoring press releases about the president's activities. What little rumor existed was not aired in the national news out of habit of tradition.And then Watergate hit.At the time of the incident, both men initially believed it was a standard robbery, but as they got involved in the story, they realized there were many more layers not immediately present. The &quot;low-level burgalars&quot; were ultimately connected to the executive branch and the United States intellegence community.The final verdict in itself remains shocking, but adding to the intensity was the recognition that Nixon intentionally campaigned as the &quot;Law and Order candidate&quot; who would safeguard middle America. The contrast between the private and public personas amplified the scandal more than it otherwise would have been.If the initial newsroom policy in this book seems antiquated in today's world of regularly investigated political scandals, it is because a series of stories changed everything--for better or worse. After Watergate, the government would be subjected to more critical scrutiny and held accountable by the journalistic community. These two men set in motion a powerful legacy which extends well beyond their inital set of articles.I had seen the movie before the book, and after reading this classic tome, can verify the pages have the same suspense and intensity (if not more so) as the big-screen counterpart. Even if I knew the plot progression, reading the words of the reporters themselves"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release (and a high school American government teacher), I consider Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN to be one of the finest detective stories ever written. It has all the elements of a classic mystery. Its leads are two hungry reporters who risk their lives to expose governmental corruption. There is a powerful villian in opposition to our heroic journalists, and some courageous indviduals in control of the newspaper who support the reporters when it would be easy to throw them to the wolves. There is even a shadowy character who hangs out in parking lots and passes on crucial information to our leads. If this book was fiction, no one would believe the plot. But it is true, sadly true."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I picked this to read for an American History book report. It happened in my childhood, so I thought it would be good to find out more of the detail. It reads well and keeps you interested in finding out who gives in next and how the story unfolds. These two writer/reporters are privvy to great bunches of information and sources. They pick and pick until the dam breaks loose. During a few points, they fear for their lives and careers and have to make quick decisions to save themselves. Much better than I thought it would be!"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"There are two distinct camps when it comes to &quot;All the President's Men.&quot; One side takes it as the recollection of two reporters who were there, who unearthed the story and found out what is currently as close as possible to the truth as is available right now. The other half calls it a bunch of &quot;revisionist trash,&quot; claiming that Woodward and Bernstein were manipulated by politicians into bringing down a President.Ignore the latter camp.Books like &quot;The Silent Coup&quot; are the true &quot;revisionist trash&quot; and contain many factual inaccuracies. Woodward and Bernstein produced one of the most readable accounts of the entire affair and while the story is not necessarily a pleasant one to read (unless you like reading about how corrupt America has become as a country), it is important, intense and gripping.For anyone who is considering journalism or politics, it is a must read. This is one of those books that everyone in America should read."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This book, written with the style of a newspaper reporter, is a great one, chronicaling the struggle to reveal the truth about the Nixon administration. The only flaw was that the authors seem to assume the reader already knows many of the minor characters from experiencing the Watergate scandal as a citizen. For this reason, this book can be challenging for young readers."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"The brilliant reportage of two then unknown journalists, Robert Woodward and Carl Bernstein, helped expose a palace guard headed by a tragically unstable leader. The momentum generated from their courageous Washington Post articles brought Woodward and Bernstein fame and fortune, Pulitzers, and helped save our democracy at a time when President Nixon was trashing the U.S. Constitution and taking America down the dangerous slippery road to dictatorial tyranny.It all started with an event at the Watergate Complex later referred to by Nixon as &quot;a third rate burglary.&quot; The more research Woodward and Bernstein did into a story Woodward thought initially was a routine burglary, the greater their astonishment as the list of contacts and involved characters reached ever higher into the top levels of the government, into ultimately the White House itself. Before long plea bargain deals were being made, more operatives were talking, and a Senate Watergate Committee was formed headed by Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina, who became an immediate household name as the televised hearings generated the most interest to Americans since the McCarthy Committee hearings two decades earlier.If you want to read a cloak and dagger story truer and every bit as fascinating as those penned by the finest writers, this is a book you will want to read. Thirty years later &quot;All The President's Men&quot; retains its timeliness as we read about incredible stories of corruption and double dealings in the political world. After digesting this book it is much easier to evaluate corruption once it is observed by vigilant citizens.William Hare"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Starring character's Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward (both Washington Post reporters),'Deep Throat' Secretary of State(1969-1975)(1973-1977) Henry Kissinger..

This book had its effect in its day, but with the more recent publication of SILENT COUP that reveals that Alexander Haig was Deep Throat, and Woodward's disingenousness about the whole affair, and that John Dean was actually behind the break-in to get an address book of prostitutes' names that had his wife's name in it from the DNC, this book is like reading a pre-Columbus book about the earth being flat. It's out of date. Read it to see what affected the country, but not for its now unfactual facts. If you want to know about Watergate, read SILENT COUP: THE REMOVAL OF A PRESIDENT."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Read SILENT COUP to find out the truth about Watergate. That book reveals, without any doubt whatsoever, who Deep Throat is, and it paints Woodward to be a manipulator and a liar.

The story told by Woodward and Bernstein sparked my curiosity as a young boy. It is a story that is fact but reads like it has to be a work of fiction. The truth is rarely as facsinating as fiction, but in this case both Woodward and Bernstein have proven that even the plain old truth can be both entertaining and informative. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to sneak a peak into the underbelly of our nations government. The skull duggery that was present in the Nixon administration is a blue print fot the actions of our government officials even today."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I'm surprised that there haven't been more reviews of this book in the wake of the recent revelation that former FBI official Mark Felt was the infamous \\"Deep Throat.\\" That revelation lead me to read the book for the first time.Now thirty years old, the book stands up very well. It's a riveting account of the investigation of the Watergate burglary by Washington Post reporters Woodward and Bernstein. As a first time reader of the book who had not focused much on the Watergate scandal, I found many of the revelations in the book to be surprising. For example, to the extent Nixon's resignation gets much attention anymore, it is generally attributed to the Watergate burglary and resulting cover up. What the book makes clear, however, is that those items were only incidents in a general program of political espionage that had been going on for some time prior to the Watergate burglary. Nixon's resignation made much of that mute, and they seem to have largely faded from the general perception of his presidency.Also, reading the book with the benefit of now knowing Deep Thorat's true identity, it seemed somewhat surprising that more focus hadn't been put on Felt or at least other FBI officials earlier - Many of the comments attributed to him directly relate to the FBI investigation. Perhaps to throw people off his trail, there are also other allusions to information obtained from supposedly other FBI sources that in the wake of recent comments from Woodward appear to probably have also come from Felt.That said, the book does show that despite his popular image, Felt was only one of many sources, albeit an important one.In that regard, another thing that is striking about the book is just how many people in the Nixon administration and Republican Party were willing to talk to the reporters about what was really going on. In today's age, where the Republican Party often shows what little regard it has for the \\"liberal\\" press, it is almost inconceivable to imagine Republican sources providing information for a major press attack on a Republican president.All in all, it's a great read with some important messages. However, the book does have its limitations. The authors spend a lot of time early in the book on their pursuit of tangents that ultimately aren't all that important to the eventual outcome. At the same time, the book essentially ends with the resignations of Nixon's chief associates in the Spring of 1973, over a year before Nixon himself would resign. For current readers who are not now saturated with the Watergate story (as most everyone probably was upon the book's publication), it would be better if the book spent a little less time on some of the early tangents and instead went through to Nixon's resignation. That, however, is covered in a separate book by the authors, called \\"The Final Days.\\""},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Quite simply, the first book anyone should read when starting to unravel what watergate really was. This book doesn't provide the inside details, but is a great starting point describing things from the two famed reporters point of view, and it also introduces the world to DeepThroat. Great suspense, and a must starting point for anyone wanting to learn and a unravel what watergate was. This also was the first of many GREAT books by Woodward. Highly reccomended book!"},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"Perhaps the most famous investigative book ever, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN holds up as a classic even with a re-reading thirty-five years later. The prose is excellent, the pacing is swift, the detailing is exacting."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"I purchased this book after seeing the movie, again, on TCM a couple of weeks ago. If you like the movie, you'll love the book.I was just 7-8 years old while Woodward and Bernstein were writing their Watergate stories for the Washington Post and knew very little about the details that led to President Nixon's ultimate downfall. Until now. I couldn't put this book down. It is filled with every detail of the Watergate break-in and the subsequent events that brought down the Nixon White House. The book covers everything, step by step, from learning of the Watergate break-in to Nixon being connected to many, many \\"dirty tricks\\" (and you won't believe some of them! Wow!) played to assure him a win in the election. Woodward and Bernstein labored day and night for the truth and refused to publish their stories until they were sure they had it. They protected their sources and never gave up even when it would have been VERY easy to do so. They asked tough questions, tracked down elusive witnesses and kept the public informed with their reporting. They saw a wrong and devoted that part of their lives to their investigation until the public was completely aware of the truth. Ultimately, they brought down a president, but their reporting exposed a White House that cared more about winning an election-- and one that pursued illegal activities to do it--than it did about protecting the citizens of the country that elected them. Woodward and Bernstein seem to be exactly what the forefathers had in mind when they provided for a \\"free press\\" in our Constitution."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This book is a must-read for everyone. If you want to understand how people in power can abuse that power and how they hide it from you, read this book. It is also very well written and as good as any mystery.

Woodward and Berstein very effectively take you through the office/society politics, research and development of a continuing story in the newsroom, earning them a Pulitzer prize. That the story is one of this nation's most infamous is a bonus.As for the CDs themselves and the audio version of this book, you will not be disappointed. The reader (Richard Poe) delivers the content at a comfortable, deliberate pace but in a tone that will have you looking forward to what's coming next. Very highly recommended.If you enjoy this book, also check outEdward R.

The audio version includes actual Murrow broadcasts from WWII and the era of McCarthyism."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This was the first of two books on Watergate by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein - the Washington Post reporters that uncovered the scandal. In June of 1972 five men carrying electronic recording devices were arrested after having broken into the Democratic Party Headquarters. The five were working for Howard Hunt, who worked for President Nixon in the White House. The authors describe what followed, including their solid journalistic efforts to uncover the truth - and what they found included payoffs, hush money, financial shenanigans, slush funds, conspiracy to commit perjury, political espionage, etc. Their findings didn't prove Nixon's guilt - this book came out before the tape was played that proved Nixon had ordered the cover up and obstructed justice - but the arrows point in Nixon's direction. Ironically, by June of 1972 Nixon was a shoo-in for re-election, and Democratic chairman Larry O'Brien was so open that you'd learn more by speaking with him than by bugging his telephone.This is an excellent narrative as is THE FINAL DAYS which the authors wrote after the facts were out and Nixon had resigned the Presidency in disgrace. There's also a look at solid journalism, which means double and triple checking your facts and sources - something too few journalist do any more."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"This book and the newspaper reports it descibes literly changed my life.

First, it provides a fascinating description of investigative journalism at its finest - the exhaustive search for reliable sources, the need to check and double-check information, the judicious use of editors in both the writing process and the ultimate decision whether to even publish a piece. To the credit of Woodward, Bernstein, and the entire Washington Post staff, the paper was quite conservative in deciding what (and when) to publish, and quick to make amends in the rare instances when they erred in their accounts.Second, the book remains the definitive &quot;in the moment&quot; guide to the collapse of the Nixon presidency. In the wake of the Clinton presidency, after the proliferation of such non-scandals as Whitewater, Travelgate, and the laughably irrelevant Lewinsky matter, it is important to understand what REAL presidential misbehavior is all about.Although the book concludes prior to Nixon's resignation, the detailed elucidation of the activities of both the White House and the Committee to Re-Elect the President leave little doubt that the Nixon Administration was guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors against the American people. Both the Nixon presidency and the subsequent &quot;pardoning&quot; from Gerald Ford were disgraces in American history.As a final note, although Bob Dole is only a minor player in the story, his behavior is worth noting for the insight it provides into his character. His scathing indictment of the Post in his speeches at the time serve as an important reminder of Dole's ties to the most corrupt domestic administration of the 20th century.ATPM is an important volume in contemporary American history. It should be mandatory reading for all citizens."},{"Title":"All the President's men","review":"A good piece of journalism. You really get to know the Washington Post's side of the Watergate story.

Too serious, over dramatic ?, this is not a sunday morning cartoon, it's a story about the battle for the soul of America. To me it's a miracle the book is as good as it is, nothing is perfect.

However, this is pretty good for a first outing, and once the book gets moving it is an entertaining read.Many of Bagley's early thrillers feature a small group of varied protagonists instead of a single \\"hero\\" character, and this is no exception. The brawny Coetzee, the weak-willed Walker, and the resourceful Francesca are all interesting characters, as is the urbane antagonist Metcalfe. The pacing of the second half is good, with the dockyard battle and final storm well described. And the ending is somewhat unexpected, although the very final \\"twist\\" is perhaps a bit too clever for its own good.It's not in the same league as his best books, but there are enough familiar elements here to make 'The Golden Keel' appealing for Bagley's fans, and to those who love thrillers in general."},{"Title":"The Golden Keel","review":"This was Desmond Bagley's first book and although it is by far not his best book, it has enough to the storyline to make him an author to watch for.The story concerns the salvaging of Mussolini's gold from where it was hidden during the Second World War. The main character (Hal) is a boat designer who hears the tale of the gold from one of the men who hid the gold but has been unable to retrieve it.The adventure is the planning and execution of the retrival of the treasure.There is a strong hint of Alastair Maclean to the novel in that the storyline is very down to earth (no James Bond heroics here) and Bagley makes sure to keep the story moving at a brisk pace. Being his first novel, there are times where the story gets bogged down a little bit but on the whole, it is a good read."},{"Title":"The Golden Keel","review":"I remember enjoying this story many years ago and decided recently to have another look. This was Bagley's first thriller and it starts sluggishly before picking up pace. The story takes place in the early 1960s when Cape Town boat maker Peter Halloran, freshly widowed after a drunk driver kills his wife, needs to get his mind off his woes. He remembers the crazy story a drunk soldier told him many years ago about how a ragtag bunch of prisoners and partisans in Italy managed to hijack and then hide a convoy carrying a fortune in gold and jewels during World War Two. The main principals still haven't found a way to get the gold out, so Halloran offers his help. I won't say too much more about how they try to pull off this feat, since the idea at the centre of the tale is pretty clever, but the book features the usual fights, gunfire, violence and love interest you'd expect from such escapist literature. What I like about the Golden Keel is that it's tightly written, plausible, interesting, and doesn't abuse the trust of the reader. You're never faced with a ludicrous plot twist or development so unlikely that you lose interest. I read most of his books and must say I recall liking this one the most."},{"Title":"The Golden Keel","review":"I picked up Desmond Bagley after I last read him in school and had a hazy recollection that I had liked him then.Reading him again just reminded me that my judgement had been corrrect.This is fairly predictable yarn about a group of people who go after a stash of gold hidden during the war in rural Italy. They encounter various shady and not so shady characters on the way and how they eventually return home forms the crux of the tale.With Desmond B. little can be expected in terms of character build up and psychological insights but it can be forgiven at the altar of a pacy read. After the main protoganist's wife (presumably beloved as their relationship is barely touched upon) is killed (rather conveniently) in a car accident, he enjoins a group of two to go and try to get the treasure.He does meet up with a romantic interest but that i shandled with kid gloves. There is hardly any chemistry and though the book is in first person, the insights are restricted to the effects of planning. Of the cast a brutish Coertze is the one who comes closest to gaining our sympathy as his character at least shows some hint of a mystery.Although you would still want to race to the end and find out how it all went.Go ahead, pick it up but don't expect to come out of the experience a beter man."},{"Title":"Joan Mitchell,","review":"I only recently became aware of Joan Mitchell's work through the help of my art teacher and I'm so glad.

MacDonald's Travis McGee series was one of the first truly successful \\"hard boiled detective\\" genre series to make it big at the mass market level of sales. Written mostly in the 1960's and early 1970's the books could come across as somewhat dated time period pieces except that MacDonald was a suspense writer of the highest order whose gritty, hard edged characters come to life on the page just as readily today as they did back when written.In point of fact, these really aren't \\"detective\\" books at all; they are generally better classified as suspense novels. However, the formula utilized in the books, as well as the realistic, hard hitting writing style they displayed, set the stage for many a fictional detective series to follow.McGee advertises himself as a \\"salvage\\" specialist. He's more a high-end repo man. If you've lost something of extraordinary value that you do not want the police involved in recovering, he'll do it for you-for 50% of the fair market value of the lost valuables. Once he's made a big score he reverts to being a beach Bum in ft. Lauderdale Florida where he lives on the beach in a houseboat won in a card game.The Travis McGee novels break down basically into two types of story either (A) a \\"recovery\\" tale and (B) a revenge tale. The former is the far more common format.Pale Gray for Guilt is one of the latter. Tush Bannon, one of Travis' old high school buddies, is killed by developers who want his land for a project, Travis swears revenge. Along with his sidekick, Dr. Meyer, a nationally known economist and fellow beach bum, McGee sets in motion a complicated and dangerous scam to entrap and bankrupt the killers.On the whole I like the recovery novels better than the revenge novels, but this is one of the better of the latter sort. The plan is ingenious, the characters, as usual, well developed and the con victim so loathsome one is fully engaged in the effort to get the SOB.This is probably not the best book to start out with McGee but, once hooked, this will make a very pleasant read.A final note: MavDonald wrote many novels other than the McGee series-however, all McGee novels have a color in the title. If you're browsing for McGee, just select any novel with a color in the title, and there Travis will be."},{"Title":"Pale Gray for Guilt","review":"...and whatever you do, read this one before reading &quot;The Lonely Silver Rain&quot;. &quot;Pale Gray&quot; is vintage McGee, and a very fascinating exploration of the Big Con. There must be something more entertaining than these books, but I can't imagine what it would be."},{"Title":"Pale Gray for Guilt","review":"Tush Bannon, friend of Travis, a good and gentle man is killed horrifically by an anvil crushing his face and chest. First declared suicide-admittedly a peculiar way to do the deed--- later changed to murder. Tush owned a small marina whose acreage was a valuable parcel to the big bad business interests, and he was being squeezed out. He left a shocked and bereft wife and three young sons. Gallant Knight Travis rides to the rescue.\\"Pale Gray for Guilt\\" was the 8th novel in the Travis McGee series, and I judge it as medium-good McGee. Published in 1968, it has an excellent contemporary flavor about it that captures the late \`60s very well. The major flaw in the novel is the extraordinarily complicated sting set up by Meyer and Travis as revenge for Tush's demise. The big businessmen are set up to take a financial bath, and there are pages and pages devoted to capital gains, covering margins, selling short, etc. This has the effect of confining John Wayne to Wall St., not a happy or even very interesting state of affairs. However, Travis does get to expound, and wow his usual lusty women. (this one named Puss Killian-would such a name even be allowed today?) MacDonald allows Travis his special brand of sentimentality, \\"-went into the master bedroom and slipped out of the robe and into the giant bed and wished I wasn't too old to cry myself to sleep.\\" No other tough private eye would ever be permited to think that way in print.By the time this book was written, MacDonald had found his groove, though it was too bad he had to foist his interest in the stock market on Travis who, as we all well know, cares nothing about such things. It never happened again."},{"Title":"Pale Gray for Guilt","review":"This one of the best of the McGee series. One of McGee's friends, Tush Bannon, is killed. It looks like an accident but McGee is suspicious and discovers it is a murder. He seeks justice for Bannon. The reason for the murder is a rather large company wants Bannon's land. Corporate officials are not directly involved in the killing but they help set the deadly wheels that ran over Bannon in motion.The novel has all the hallmarks of a MacDonald novel - crisp writing, good pacing, distinctive characters, brief comments on American society, etc.The ending is a little weak. I'm doubt the killer would have ended up in Ft. Lauderdale. Thought the reasons he wound up close to McGee were not logical.

In his earlier incarnation, McGee was less cynical but more of a hedonist. He became a more appealing hero the more world weary he beacme. Nevertheless, &quot;Pale Gray for Guilt&quot; is the best of the earlier books because it has a classic McGee story that could be the plot of an old west movie. Bad guys kill the hero's friend and the hero sets out for revenge.

I just hope that MacDonald continues to gain in popularity, as I feel he is horribly overlooked."},{"Title":"Pale Gray for Guilt","review":"In constructing Travis McGee, MacDonald took up where Chandler left off. A bold but introspective, thoughtful but hard-edged character, McGee is the rusty white knight in a world despising chivalry. Here, he and his best friend Meyer look into the suspicious death of an old friend. Their goal is to remove the pleasure that the plotters derived from the killing. They enter worlds of high finance, cheap scams, and political connections, seeking restitution and a reckoning. This, the best of the McGee series, offers a look at revenge that doesn't depend on blood. It is a superb book that crafts the McGee and Meyer characters into contemporary Quixotes, tilting at windmills and trying to redress wrongs."},{"Title":"Pale Gray for Guilt","review":"Oodles of green noodles,make blue poodlesjump der stroodle.Hugh G.

When the reader is forced to stop reading and locate pencil, paper and a dictionary of financial terms in order to bring him or herself up to speed about what is transpiring, that magical bond between fiction writer and audience is broken.Pale Gray for Guilt is installment number 9 in John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series. It starts off with a grisly murder. The victim, a hard working family man, happens to be one of McGee's oldest and dearest friends. After McGee identifies the two men most likely to be responsible for his friend's death, he sets out on a mission of revenge. With a little help from his economist friend, Meyer, McGee sets up a rather hard to follow real estate swindle designed to financially ruin one of the two men. Then, this time with a huge amount of help from Meyer, he puts in place a plan to artificially run up the price of a publicly listed stock in order to damage the net worth and, more importantly, the reputation of the other man. Simultaneously, this self same adventure in stock manipulation will bring financial security to the murder victim's widow.Needless to say, all of this proves too complicated for most readers to really follow or believe and consequently mars what is otherwise a pretty good hardboiled, hard edged crime novel.Standard in many Travis McGee novels is the scenario wherein McGee takes an emotionally scarred damsel in distress and restores her psychic well-being by boincking the living daylights out of her on an idyllic cruise lasting several weeks. When this highly effective therapy is over, therapist and client both happily go their separate ways. Thankfully, that nausea inducing scenario is missing from Pale Gray for Guilt and I, for one, am very grateful. Instead, MacDonald introduces the intriguing character known as Puss Killian. Puss is Travis' latest ladyfriend du jour but she is portrayed as a very strong individual and is given a lot of interesting things to say. (Faithful Travis McGee fans will hear about Puss Killian again in The Lonely Silver Rain.)Generally, Pale Gray for Guilt is well written. It features some interesting characters and several surprising and, at times, thought provoking plot twists. A worthwhile read whose positive attributes outweigh the negative."},{"Title":"Pale Gray for Guilt","review":"I love the way I feel like I've fallen into the world of Travis McGee when I start reading one of John MacDonald's novels.

I found this book to be shockingly bad. While other McGee books sparkle with Travis' commentaries on social trends and peripheral characters, and possess intricate plots, this book was a straightforward revenge story, with McGee and his sidekick Meyer confidently and flawlessly triumphing over the evildoers. There is no suspense, and the book is written in a rather haughty style, glorifying the abilities and righteousness of McGee. I was nauseated by the final third, just trying to finish it up, shaking my head at the lack of suspense and the wooden tone. I think one has to have a simplistic devotion to the series and/or character to see this installment as among the best of the series, because it comes off as sort of a love letter from MacDonald to McGee.

It traces the history of Arab intellectuals in the 19th century and of the evolving schools of thought in the Arab world that was divided among conservative Muslims, reformist Muslims and secular nationalists.Such schools of the thought in the Arab world were provoked by the arrival of the French expedition of Napoleon in Egypt in 1798. The interaction between the French and the Egyptians made Arabs realize how far they have become form the modern world and the need to modernize. While conservative Muslims believed that change was a matter of betraying the teachings of religion, propagators of reforming Islam called for the revision of Muslim practices saying that it was only by restoring religion to its original form that the Muslim nation would be able to catch up on the world's civilization advances. Reformers, however, fell short of advocating a coherent agenda for change as their calls eventually fell on deaf ears.Meanwhile, non-Muslim subjects of the Ottoman empire were keen to come up with a formula that would allow them to be treated as citizens with full rights. Accordingly, intellectuals of these minorities advanced secular nationalism ideologies, certainly under the influence of a surge of such ideas in Europe.Sharabi narrates with skill the career of the most important figures of that era and his book allows readers to understand the origins of current ideological and intellectual trends in the Arab world."},{"Title":"Arab intellectuals and the West: The formative years, 1875-1914","review":"Hardcover from Johns Hopkins: green cloth over hardback boards with a sewn binding; in dustjacket; 139 pp.TABLE OF CONTENTS HIGHLIGHTS1: The Emergence of the Arab Intelligentsia- Conservatives, Reformists, and Modernists- Christian Westernizers and Muslim Secularists- The Ulema- The Christian Intellectuals- The Muslim Securalist Elite2: Theoretical Foundations of Islamic Reformism- Basic Orientations- Method of Reformism- Political Committments3: Ideology of Muslim Reformism- Rationalization of Decline- Relationships of Power- Islamic Solidarity- Political and Social Ideology4: The Structure of Christian Intellectualism- Social Background and Psychological Orientation- Christian Intellectualism and the West- The Problem of Borrowing- The Idea of Nationalism5: Social Ideology of Christian Intellectualism- Westernization of Ideas- Man's Autonomy- Notions of Socialism6: The Emergence of Muslim Secularism- Social Composition- Quasim Amin and Secularist Positivism- Power and the Social Problem7: Arab Intellectuals and Political Action- Islamism, Ottomanism, and Nationalism- Political Forms of Islamism- Christian Arabs and Political Committment8: Arab Intellectuals and the West- Traditional Values and Modern Science- The End of the Formative Phase- Western Imperialism and Arab Modernization"},{"Title":"The Ryrie Study Bible: Psalms and Proverbs with Introductions, Annotations, Outlines, Marginal References","review":"Ordered 3 of these from 3 different people all deliver quickly and all where in good shape as they had stated.

There are some excellent structures and lots of great information. It's too bad that such a terrific book had to be marred by poor editing, but it is still very much worth owning. It is extremely relevant to this review to note that corrections to the book are available at http://www.laplantz.com. The book and website taken together deserve FIVE stars."},{"Title":"The Art & Craft of Handmade Books: New Ideas and Innovative Techniques","review":"This book is a must have for anyone who enjoys creating handmade books. It has excellent instructions for creating books with multiple folds and intricate bindings. The diagrams are helpful in the construction of the projects. Also, the gallery pictures of books are a great inspiration. This book was worth the wait after Shereen's Cover to Cover."},{"Title":"The Art & Craft of Handmade Books: New Ideas and Innovative Techniques","review":"Great for starting into book making. The majority of the projects in the book are more about folding paper to make structures but the structures in themselves make books like the accordion fold books, star books, tag books, tunnels, signatures within accordions, etc. For me this was perfect. The book starts with a glossary so you can get the vocabulary down and then starts in with techniques for sewing and scoring. The majority of projects use the accordion fold book as the basis but there are lots of varieties and terrific photos of completed projects to inspire. The instructions go step by step and also have 3-d line drawings showing you where to fold and such. The book builds from very simple booklets to more complex ones where you use the Coptic stitch to create more traditional books. I love the variety and it was just at my level to build confidence along the way as I learned the vocabulary and techniques"},{"Title":"The Art & Craft of Handmade Books: New Ideas and Innovative Techniques","review":"I bought this book to get a feel for the basic small bookmaking process. It is very straightforward, with directions that seem easy to follow, and many diagrams & photographs to help guide you to a finished product. It has some beginner, intermediate, and advanced projects, so essentially there is something for anybody who wants to learn about the craft of handmade books. I wouldn't recommend this for a young crafter -- it's definitely written for a person with at least a small knowledge of paper craft who is looking to expand, and the directions would be too difficult, I think, for anyone younger than high school age."},{"Title":"The Art & Craft of Handmade Books: New Ideas and Innovative Techniques","review":"It explains the various parts of a book like binding, etc., and has many good pictures with explainations on how to create a variety of books such as a tunnel book.

I love this book! Seirawan makes no apology for being a fan. He writes with honesty, but with the same child-like excitement that any Fischer fan would feel, from the preparations to the actual match itself. Most impressive to me was how the author did not skirt the issue of Fischer's outrageous remarks, but rather gave an honest assessment: Here is what Bobby said, and here is WHY he might have said it. Seirawan's enthusiam is contagious, and his notes, for the most part, don't shoot straight over the head of the average reader; therefore, being helpful to the chess amateur. I did not buy this book for the analysis of the games, but for the fan's view of the event, and I was not disappointed! Rev. Peter F. Hyatt, New York"},{"Title":"No Regrets: Fischer-Spassky 1992","review":"I am about a 1500 USCF rated player. I am a Tournament Director (when I have to be). I have been playing for about two years and I'm 35 years old. Taking that into consideration, here it goes...I am extremly skeptical about games collections. Far too many collections that contain annotated games are really nothing more than paragraph after paragraph of various lines with no actual supporting words/explanations. If we were all GMs this might be ample, but we're not and it's not. Some great game collections are Nunn's Move by Move and Chirnev's 100 Most Instructive games. These books will stand the test of time because they are fantastic games but are also annotated with the casual player in mind. Many explanations are literally move-by-move from the first move, and not too many variations going 32 ply. Other than a hard core GM studying, who really needs/wants this?No Regrets is easily among the best of the best. Those familiar with Seirawan's easy-to-read &quot;Play Winning Chess&quot; series will not be dissapointed here. Seirawan explains the moves in plain English so everyone can understand. He goes over each move with the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas morning. So clear is the annotation in this book that you find yourself saying, &quot;What's so brilliant about that?&quot; But that's Seirawan's talent for annotating the game that gives you this feeling. All great chess games look like common sense when they're explained to you by someone who knows how to do it correctly. It just doesn't go that way when I'm actually at the board. But that's a different story.I have been tempted to throw my copy up on ebay because this book seems to be worth something nowadays (I bought it off the shelf four years ago), but I just can't bring myself to do it. There's a LOT of chess books out there and it's not often that one is of this calibur. I have to keep it.SO why is this book about such a famous match, with highly acclaimed annotation, and so obviously well done and in demand out of print? Beats the heck out of me. I think it's truly a shame that this book is not readily available. Hopefully someone will remedy this soon. If this book were more widely available I think it would easily go down as a classic book for players of all strengths. I lent it to a 2100 rated player at my club and he was ready to steal it from me! I think this book is a few steps above Nunn's &quot;Move by Move&quot; as far as educational value and target player strength. Truly a masterpeice. Ad to this all of the well-written diary-style accounts of the history surrounding the match and games, and you have an unbeatable book. A bargain at any price."},{"Title":"No Regrets: Fischer-Spassky 1992","review":"It was indeed a risk, spending the degree of capital required in order to own this wonderful book-but what a treat it has been to read, to analyze, to listen and to learn. It is wonderfully put together, the analysis is terrific and helpful; the historic documentation is thorough and mixed. I am in complete agreement with many other reviewers when say that I cannot, for the life of me, understand why this book is not in mass production.Thank you to the writers and thank you to the reviewers whom granted me the courage to make this fine purchase. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"No Regrets: Fischer-Spassky 1992","review":"The condition that the seller lists the book in is not the same as what Amazon shows it as. Amazon has it's own weird rating system. What makes it insidious is that you can't click on the condition ratings on Amazon's site and see what their ratings mean and I couldn't find them anywhere. I paid a huge premium for a book that was in \\"collectable\\" condition and recieved something in horrible condition. I returned it but wound up paying the shipping in both directions.

I have read this book to my son almost every evening and he just loves the story. It is endearing to see normal fears presented by the charming little sister bunny and to have those fears put to rest by her caring older brother.

She only wants to read the &quot;raggit&quot; (rabbit) book. It's surprising to me that she'll sit through all the text which she normally doesn't have the patience for.

It is one of the sweetest books we have read, and truly a joy for the whole family."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"We really enjoy this sweet story. I like the the brother-sister relationship in the book. Willoughby is a helpful, patient, and caring big brother. The illustrations are fun and playful. The overall theme of the book is this loving relationship, plus the idea that &quot;the morning is waiting just for you but it can't come unless you go to sleep.&quot; We have often used this idea (and this book) to help our son calm down for sleep."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"Cute little Willa is having trouble getting to sleep. Willoughby helps by pointing out all the happy things just waiting for her the next day. This is a sweet, comforting book. My 3 1/2 year old and 6 year old both ask for it regularly. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"This is my second favorite \\"night night\\" book ever. (after the venerable GoodNight Moon) And it has many of the same aspects. A simple repetative story line that is comforting to young children and wording that is almost melodic to read. The wording is indeed repatitive, but any early childhood expert can tell you that for a young child that is what draws them into the story. Remember, it is not written for an adult. The fact that \\"Willa\\" and \\"Willoughby\\" are repeated on every page makes the story instantly familiar to a young child. The story is sweet and the illustrations are georgeous. My copy has been patched many times now and I smile whenever I see it."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"After I read this story to my 3 and 4 year old girls, I knew we had a bedtime story to cherish.

After reading this book, I use examples from the book to help my girls fall asleep."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"This is the best children's book I've read in a long time. I loved it, as did my children. The delightful text and soft, inviting pictures capture the warmth and beauty of the best moments of sibling relationships. It's a comforting story for little ones who are afraid to go to bed alone, and an inspiring one for older brothers and sisters. My 7-year-old and 14-year-old both loved it, because it reminded them of themselves."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"I have a feeling that this book will become another classic bedtime story. It encourages young ones to think of something positive and happy before they go to bed. It encourages them to look around their surroundings and nature to find joyful thoughts. The idea that &quot;the morning likes waking you up. That's what makes the morning happy&quot; is so unique. Going to sleep becomes something purposeful and fun because that is the only way the morning could &quot;wake you up.&quot; In another word, going to sleep becomes a positive act instead of a passive one. What especially makes me love this book is that the one who is soothing the little bunny (who is afraid of nightmare) is her big brother instead of her mother. This very positive book is an excellent bedtime story as well as a good choice to deal with sibling relationship. Ages 4-8."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"Love this book. My kids each had one, had to buy one for my niece.

It's a short story of happy things to think about while going to sleep. Both my 2 and 4 year old kids enjoy this (actually we'd first borrowed it from the library and they liked it so much I bought one for us and one as a gift).I find the \\"said Willa\\" \\"said Willoughby\\" parts get a bit repetitive, so I just use separate voices for them and I don't have to say that all the time.Very sweet, friendly book showing siblings loving and helping eachother.

The overall morale is good (a story about finding things to be happy about in your life... counting your blessings... an older brother helping out his little sister) but it's not very well written in my opinion.The use of repitition of the character's names is very cumbersom to read aloud. (Willa said, said Willoughby, asked Willa, Willa asked, and so on.) My son will not sit through one page of this book. The story drags on too long and could have been written in half the number of words. The illustrations are nice, however."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"Not the most easy to follow, flowing story i have read, the 2 characters names willa and willowby were repeated to frequently and were quite a mouthful to be saying over and over again.I loved the title which drew me to the book, and a great idea for a children book"},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"I, as a non-artist, can think of much more inspiring reasons for a small child to be happy at bedtime.

It even took me a long time to tire of it. They would help me in the reading by saying at the end of each passage &quot;'That's good' said Willa, 'What else?'&quot;It is not only a great story for bedtime, but its a true literary work. It actually has a meter that is not measured as you would in poetry, but more as you in music. There is a definite pattern to the story that flows amazingly well throughout. The pattern repeats, changes to a middle verse, and then ends with a variation on the beginning."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"It may just be coincidence, but it was exactly when this became my 4-year-old's favorite bedtime story that she stopped needing me to come back to her room over and over once I'd said good night. But whether it actually resolves sleep issues is almost immaterial because the story and pictures in and of themselves are so enjoyable. I'd imagined that my 4-year-old would see herself as the big brother and see her baby sister as Willa, but she identifies with Willa very strongly. She loves the ending when Willa and Willoughby are cuddled up together. It is a very comforting story and the pictures are absolutely beautiful. I'd like to frame them and hang them up."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"I thought this was a wonderful book and very well illustrated. I have a small child that has had problems with nightmares in the past. She got to the point where she was afraid to go to bed because of the nightmares. This book showed her that not only are there so many more happy things to think about while you're trying to go to sleep, but also that she wasn't alone. Little Willa was having the same problems. I also thought it was very positive that it was not the character's parents that solved her problem, but her big brother. It was a nice touch for sibling bonding. All in all, I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read to children before bed."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"I thought the illustrations were wonderful and the story it self is so heart warming.

I can't say enough good things!"},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"Although the illustrations are great, overall, I think the book could have been much better written. The story is a sweet story, but the names of the characters (Willa and Willoughby) are used over and over. After a couple pages, it wears itself out while I'm reading it to my 2 year old.That said, I have just decided to omit the names while I'm reading it, and my little one does like the story. It seems to get her in the right frame of mind for bedtime."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep","review":"I found this book breathtakingly beautiful.

Still, it was a favorite so I toughed it out. Then one evening I was in a strange mood on the second or third reading and started using a funny deep voice for Willoughby. The voice ended up a cross between Rod Serling from the Twilight Zone, Laurence Fishburn from the Matrix, and a sprinkling of William Shatner from Star Trek.

Husserl's IDEAS is a significant book in the history of human thought and Western philosophy, any student of philosophy or psychology would do themselfs a favor by reading this very important book. It is not my intention to write a Cliff's notes review regarding the content of this book, but the modern reader will find that Husserl's ideas makes points that expand on Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON. Ideas refers to transcendental phenomenonlgy, a school of thought that placeshuman experience into a realm of personal understanding attained through a series of conceptual reductions. A trained phenomenologist (sic.) should be able to reduce objects of experience to their fundamental concepts, then remove these concepts to understand the essential features of human experience. This &quot;PHENOMENOLOGICAL REDUCTION&quot; is applicable to all phenomena, and when applied properly this technique isolates human experience to certain core concepts that are universal to all phenomena irregardless of space and time. I believe that Husserl's Ideas is an invaluble contribution to modern psychology, and should be required reading for all students in a liberal arts program."},{"Title":"Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET","review":"There are very few publishers in the IT world that follow the approach taken by the Murach's series to teach. All the left hand side pages of this book are theory and explanations and all the right hand side pages of this book are code/explanations. It is a new and unique approach that seems to work. It is clear when you read the book that the authors are definitely geared towards teaching the subject and making it as easy as possible for you to learn. This is obvious even in the way things are explained where the authors make no assumptions and start from scratch in explaining everything in great detail. This is an excellent approach to teach beginners.The book is split into two parts - using VB.NET to build desktop applications and using VB.NET to build web applications. But for both sections, it MAINLY addresses the issue of connecting to databases through ADO.NET. And if you are looking at learning how to develop just web applications, you are forced to learn how to build desktop applications first. The reason for this is that the book starts with the desktop applications before proceding to the web applications and it doesn't repeat the knowledge presented in the earlier chapters. So you can't start directly reading the web development chapters. But we found that it isn't that great an inconvenience.If you are in a rush, you are better off looking at another book in the market - 'Programming the Web with Visual Basic.NET' by Torkelson, et al. This book only addresses how to develop web applications using VB.NET and it does an equally fantastic job at teaching if not better. It also goes a lot deeper into the subject. This other book does does claim to be only for Intermediate/Advanced users though we believe that if you are an experienced programmer but just new to VB.NET, you should be okay.The book being reviewed here does have a website where you can download the sample code and we have been able to successfully use a lot of the code with very few problems in implementing the code. There are almost no negatives to this book with the exception that it isn't for an advanced user and it forces you to learn how to build desktop applications first. Everything it addresses, it does a fantastic job but it does leave out the very advanced topics.We thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and wanted to share this valuable find with others (not just this book but also other books by the Murach's series). We hope you too enjoy learning from this book as much as we did. Our copy will continue to be used for a long time to come to give you an indication of how much we like this book. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET","review":"I took on the project of constructing a database application to track our customers since there was nothing out there off the shelf that would do exactly what we needed done. I had not programmed in 12 years and did not know a first thing about VB.NET or object-oriented programming. The book is so well structured that I managed to build a database application from the ground-up while learning to program all over again within 6 months - it would have taken shorter but the only times I could dedicate to the project was nights and weekends. And guess what; after I beta-tested the program and ironed out the bugs, the program never even crashed once! On average 15 concurrent users are on the program and enter about 200 transacions daily. This book helped make my project a success."},{"Title":"Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET","review":"I was in several Oracle's training classes. In most classes, each takes approximately from two to five days. If you were in the class, you would get a handout book printing from Instructor's PowerPoint slide. The handout, in bullet format, covers only the closed-to-a-real application examples. It is concise. Instructor covers the slide for 30 mins. Then, he gave you many lab exercises to follow. With this method, I think you can understand the context in the short time. This book is using the same method. By pursuing this book, you do not need the real instructor. All instructor suggestions are already in the book.At the end of each chapter, you will have a chance to modify the project that you already did in the chapter. For example, if the author shows you how to write create adapter, you will have a chance to enhance those statements to be more complex. You are also able to do extra projects that the author has not taught in the text. As a result, you can apply those skills to develop your own projects.Another good thing about this book is that the screen captures are very clear. You can see what the points of the author. In many books, they fail to do so because readers cannot read words on those screens."},{"Title":"Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET","review":"This is the best ADO.Net book I have read. It covers most everything you need to learn to develop an application using ADO.Net. The book is relevant for beginning all the way through expert level developers.It starts out with the assumption that you know nothing about databases and database programming. There is a good primer on client server systems, relational databases, and SQL. After the intro, it goes into the basics of ADO.Net. It then builds on that foundation and provides in-depth details of the syntax and usage of .Net database programming.The authors are clear, concise, and explain things very well without being verbose or chatty. There are also many useful and relevant tips throughout the lessons. After you have learned the syntax and functions of ADO.Net, they give you two sample applications, an order entry Windows program and a vendor maintenance web app, that apply the lessons learned in the previous chapters. My one problem with the book is that the code samples do not contain comments, which would be useful with the sample apps. All examples and code are available for download. I haven't done this yet so I can't speak to how well the code works.Besides ADO.Net, there are excellent sections on ASP.Net and N-Tier applications, but what I especially like is the chapter on Crystal Reports. Most every application requires some type of reporting but almost none of the .Net books I read cover the subject. This book devotes 30 pages to Crystal. I wish I would have read this book before I wrote my first .Net app using Crystal; it would have saved me a lot of time.If you need to quickly get up to speed with .Net database programming, this is the book. It covers most every aspect of database development in a little over 500 pages and despite the complexity and detail of the subject, it is very easy to read and understand. I wish they would write a C# version! I recently converted to C#. It is an excellent book. My compliments to authors Anne Prince and Doug Lowe."},{"Title":"Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET","review":"I'm basically a Java programmer and I already own Murachs's JSP which is a class in itself. I had to involve in a project at my company which is totally developed using VB.NET. I came here to amazon to look for some books on Vb.NET and ADO.NET and I knew Murach should have written a title on this. My guess didn't go wrong and I just bought this book 2 days ago. I was able to master the basics of ADO.NET(first 6 chapters) in just 2 days which is really unbeleivable. This book is really amazing. This is truly geared towards a beginner and also serves as a reference for experienced.Murach's idea of explaining the concept on the left hand side and examples for the explanation on the right hand side is really awesome. The topics are clearly illustrated with appropriate examples.I'm now truly a fan of Murach's pen!"},{"Title":"Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET","review":"One thing that immediately hit me as I read the book is that the format. Basically every left hand page is a narrative and every right hand page contains diagrams and bullet points pertaining to the narrative. The first implication this has is that in a way the book appears twice as large as it actually is. A lot of information from the left hand side is repeated on the right hand side. Also there is a liberal sprinkling of white space. At first I thought this was unnecessary. However once I got into the book I found that this format generally worked for me. I discovered that after reading each left hand page I could then take stock by reading the bullet points on the right hand page. This was particularly useful once the first few chapters were left behind and the more involved issues started to get explained. So a thumbs up for this format and I think we may well see other publishers take it up in future.I'd advise you to read Appendix A first and make sure you have the Web Server &amp; MSDE installed ready on your PC for use as you make your way through the book. The book's example applications are written for the MSDE database (although they should work equally as well for SQL Server). The whole book is heavily biased towards MSDE/SQL Server. (Nearly all the example code uses the System.Data.SQLClient namespace) The applications and sample database used in the book are also available for download.Section 1As a long-term database programmer I found that I could speed-read through Chapter 1. For readers not very familiar to database programming this chapter is a must read as it covers a lot of concepts which are important later on. Chapter 2 was an excellent overview of ADO.NET. Chapter 3 was where the book really got going. The initial setting up of data adapters, connections and datasets I found a little heavy going but the example of binding data to a datagrid was excellent. By the end of this section you will have a small database application up and running using a datagrid to display your data.Section 2Chapter 4 shows you how to set up a simple databound application using a form with databound controls on that allow the example Vendors database to be maintained. It also contained useful information about handling ADO.NET errors. Chapter 5 moves on to using unbound controls and shows how an unbound application can be more flexible. Chapter 6 covers untyped datasets, which are more closely related to how the old ADO works. Finally in Chapter 7 you learn how use data views to filter and sort data in datasets, how to use parameterized queries to restrict the data retrieved from the database and also how to work with multiple tables in a dataset.Section 3In chapter 8 you get to learn about working with data commands, i.e. queries that return datasets using data readers, queries that don't return a dataset (either scalar or non-queries), stored procedures (including using the configuration wizard), and transactions. Chapter 9 moves onto working with dataset schemas and covers using the XML designer to create tables and columns, constraints and relations for typed datasets; also using the collection editors to perform similar tasks for untyped datasets; and finally how to perform these tasks through code. Chapter 10 shows you how to develop and use database classes. This chapter briefly covers some of the theory of 3 tiered applications. Chapter 11 then puts all you have learnt so far into practice by running through the creation of a complete order entry application.Section 4Chapter 12 is basically an introduction to ASP.NET programming showing how to use the Web Form Designer and how to bind web server controls to data sources. Chapter 13 highlights some of the ASP.NET programming techniques such as connection pooling and caching and maintaining session state. Chapter 14 shows how to use the Datalist and Datagrid controls.Section 5Chapter 15 deals with working with XML files. No prior knowledge of XML is assumed and it provides a good basic introduction to the subject. Chapter 16 shows you how to use Crystal Reports to develop reports. Chapter 17 explains how to use the Server Explorer for performing common database tasks like creating databases, defining fields, relationships, keys and indexes and constraints.ProsI found the information in the book to be very accurate. The few errors were posted very quickly on their web site.I also liked having space in the margins to pencil in remarks and notes.The print was clear and there were plenty of diagrams and figures to supplement the text.ConsI couldn't initially use the example database as it was created using a collation different to my UK set-up. This will need to be corrected if the book is to be sold outside the US. I eventually managed to get around this problem by using a Microsoft support article, 325681.ConclusionThe book assumes some VB.Net familiarity. I'd suggest that anyone reading this book reads a basic VB.Net book first. However, as far as ADO.Net goes no prior knowledge is required.This is not so much a reference book as a tutorial book that guides you through the various aspects of ADO.Net. I found it difficult to dive into a particular chapter without reading the previous chapters. This in itself is certainly no bad thing but it is something you need to be aware of.My overall opinion is that this book is an excellent tool to learn ADO.NET for VB.NET. I'd have no problem recommending it to anyone new to ADO.NET but with some VB.NET experience. This book is definitely aimed at the ADO.NET novice and you will end up with a basic grounding in a good coverage of ADO.NET subjects.There are 2 chapters available in PDF format for free viewing."},{"Title":"Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET","review":"The collaborative and impressive effort of Anne Prince and Doug Lowe, Murach's VB.NET Database Programming With ADO.NET is a training and reference resource which is especially useful as a self-teaching tool or supplement, and was specifically created to instruct Visual Basic programmers in VB.NET skills in order to develop professional level database applications in ADO.NET in the span of only a few weeks. Sample code and meticulously delineated steps help simplify the difficult process of learning complex ideas and structrues at an advanced and professional level.

The title is ADO.NET Database programming. What is offered is 5 chapters on DB design, 2 on ADO access and a couple more on XML. The author states he uses an older version of MSDE ( version 7) and discounts MSDE 2000 and Access databases. The latter being non-enterprise or desk top databasing. The meat of chapters 6 and 7 for ADO failed to explain the internals of use of the ADO objects. I returned the book and deemed it a failure.

Save yourself money and shelf space. HIGHLY RECOMMENTED.Authors Prince and Lowe do a first-class job of introducing you to ADO.Net as well as allowing you to delve into the more advanced concepts.The book follows the typical and very effective Murach style of a left-hand page of explanatory text on a specific concept and a right-hand page of code and/or illustration that is linked to the text on the facing page. I find this sort of presentation really helps me focus on the current topic. Also, eliminating the necessity of page-turning to find an accompanying example makes for a better learning experience.The book is about 550 pages long, excluding appendices and index. There are probably less text than the typical book on this subject, and that's a *good* thing. The authors were highly selective in what they included. For example, you don't have to wade through 300 pages of &quot;what is a form&quot; and &quot;what is an event&quot; before you get to useful information."},{"Title":"Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET","review":"This is a great ADO.NET book i would like to recommend.

The authors really got to the guts on how real databases work. For instance, using two or more tables in a dataset, creating relations with these tables, using data binding controls where certain combo boxes are bound to a different table in the dataset. So, one can develope a user interface where certain textboxes and combo boxes are connected to other tables all on one form. I actually created my own mini database from this book. All the code worked like a champ. Keep in mind that one should download the application files from their website for each chapter. Once you run the programs for each chapter, you will understand the concepts the authors explain about the code. Make sure you have a minimal background on your standard VB.NET because the authors are not neccesarily going to hold your hand throughout the book, but they do come close."},{"Title":"Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET","review":"I have been working through your excellent primer on ADO.NET, which is the first such book I have seen that makes real sense to me, because it actually focuses on something close to real-life database programming. In addition, the writing is clear, and the program samples are amazingly bug-free. (One of the most infuriating problems a person can encounter in learning a new programming environment is an author's buggy code.) Most of the .NET primers that I have seen have been dreadful, which may be one reason why this technology's penetration has been unexpectedly slow.

Like every small business owner I realized that I would never be able to afford the technical help to get what I needed done, so I was going to have to learn to do it myself.I have a small library of books now, including many of the very fine Wrox books, but I found the Murach series to be the best so far for me: a business owner who needs to learn programming geared towards business problems quickly. The other books seemed to spend an exorbitant amount of time on non essential issues, and I bogged down in creating non relevant examples. This book went right to the heart of the matter: creating a usable interface to my sql server database and explained it all very clearly. I have learned more in the last two days with this book than in the last month with the other titles. In fact, this book will probably provide clarity for those other books on my shelf and allow me to understand their concepts more clearly as well. If you are like me: a small business owner, not a professional programmer, this book is for you. I have spent over a $1,000 in books in the last month.

But in terms of the ability to present the concepts in a clear way, especially for someone new to the subject, this is not quite as good asThe Polarity Process: Energy as a Healing Art.My major concerns with this book are it's scope and lack of real information at times. For instance there are statements made like fire and air produce shaking. Ok, WHY? And how or when is this important to know? Then we hop over to techniques like head/neck manipulation to get at the cerebral spinal fluid. Yes, I understand Dr Stone was a chiropractor and that CSF is a core component in his work. However, for someone who is learning about PT there are many bits like this that are a distraction to trying to memorize the elements, their functions, and the associated body zones that are treated. So the scope of the book is too wide, too much mentioned without being explained, and too much that is ancillary to learning PT.The inclusion of techniques like the cerebral spinal pump are a little misplaced in a book. Generally folks who are not certified in PT should not be moving a clients body around at all, no manipulation or movement. The issues around liability and actual skill should keep such manipulation out of any book that is not clearly a course certification textbook. Also some of the finger placements (palm contact on fire line versus finger tips give this book more of a Reiki feel than PT). After reading Franklyn Sills book if you are interested in PT you should seek out a teacher and see what they recommend. Learning PT to the point of certification is a significant task.You definately do NOT want to start with Randolph Stones books without some kind of orientation like these.

Seidman gives a good introduction to the very detailed energy-based healing system of Polarity. This book is a good place to begin studying polarity. The original texts written by Dr. Stone quickly move into esoteric principles, and other polarity books either simplify things so much that not much polarity is included, or the books suffer from difficult explanations of the concepts.Seidman's book uses illustrations to show hand positions, and clear explanations of what to do and how polarity is thought to work. The overall holistic view is also covered in this book, as approaches to diet and an introduction to ayurvedic principles as understood by the founders of polarity are explained. By using this book, someone could give a polarity session going through the positions as listed, and once the practitioner has gained more experience they would be able to create unique sessions using the positions based on a clients individual needs.Much of the information that is not polarity specific positions can be found in other energy-based systems and texts. I think it is really handy to have it all in one little volume so that if I want to focus on polarity, i need only look in one place. I really enjoyed the refexology chart of the foot that is given. It is comprehensive enough to find most organs reflex location on the foot, without being so complicated that I can't be sure where the same point would be on a real foot with its slight variation from the book picture.This book is a good one to have in the library of any massage therapist or bodyworker. The most recent edition I have found was revised in 1991. The needs of the general public always change some, as well as what foods we may have available to us. This leads the book to being a little bit dated since it has been 20 years since its last revision. This is really a small quibble, but it is one that keeps this book form being five stars today.

As nations began to trade with other nations, the necessity of performing computations on larger numbers very quickly forced changes in the notation. When first introduced into Europe, the modern decimal system of notation was greeted with skepticism and some hostility. However, as is nearly always the case in human endeavors, it was accepted rather quickly, as it was so much more efficient than other systems such as Roman numerals. Therefore, the history of computing devices is bound very tightly with improvements in representation, and the historical changes in notation are the topic of the first section of the book.Ifrah does an excellent job in recapitulating the history of the notation of computation, covering the entire world, ending up with the modern notation and the efficiency of binary numbers. Nearly forty pages are devoted to explanations of many ancient numerical notations, and many figures are included. It is this approach that differentiates this book from other histories of computing. Other authors concentrate on the history of the evolving architectures of the computing devices, ignoring the necessary precondition of a compact and efficient notation. It is very difficult to imagine computing devices that could easily perform arithmetic on Roman numerals.The second section is a two track treatment of the development of computing devices. One track covers the mathematical preliminaries and the second the mechanical advances that led to the construction of accurate computers. Most of the early improvements were done by mathematicians, and it was not until the late nineteenth century that governments started to be interested in computers. The primary event was the work of Charles Babbage, who showed that computers were possible and how valuable they could be in performing routine computations that were highly prone to error.In many ways, this history of computing is more a history of the requisite mathematics rather than a history of hardware. This is a second way in which this book differs from other histories. One of the reasons why computers have improved so quickly is that much of the theoretical background for their actions were developed before the machines were. Ifrah explains that in great detail, describing how some of the principles of abstract mathematics have been applied to the building of computers.The final section is very small and deals with the future of computing. This is a wise move, as this book is a history and one thing we have learned from the recent history of computers is that predicting the future is largely impossible. We know that they will get faster, have more memory and the usage will increase, but the consequences of this are difficult to predict.If your interest is in the preconditions necessary for computers to be widely used, then this is the book for you. Ifrah covers all of the notational and mathematical background necessary for computers to be useful, for without that, they would probably have been little more than intellectual toys.Published in the recreational mathematics e-mail newsletter, preprinted with permission."},{"Title":"The Universal History of Computing: From the Abacus to the Quantum Computer","review":"This book is really fascinating, especially if you are interested in scientific and technical achievements.

No, as the subtitle indicates, this book goes way back. In fact, the first section is a summary of number systems going back to the age of the Egyptians and before. It's a very methodical and somewhat dry tale, not helped by being translated from the French by translators who feel compelled to insert their own comments at intervals.When it does get going, it provides a history of the relevant mathematics as well as automata from the Islamic era forward. The actual computer era is touched on mostly in its early stages, with the first computers of the forties and fifties. And it concludes with about sixty pages that have nothing to do with history but rather attempt to define key words such as &quot;information&quot; and &quot;computer.&quot;All in all, it is a methodical and thorough book, perhaps a little dry but not as much as some books I have read.

There is good material on science and technology as well as social sciences and public affairs. There's also a good selection of material of various rhetorical styles of writing. And the discussion questions after the essays generally avoid biasing the discussion. Very useable for class.The so-so: One reviewer refers to the liberal bent of the texts. And it's abundantly clear that some perspectives receive very privileged status in Fields of Reading. So if you're looking for one version of current ivory tower orthodoxy, here it is. In that sense, there is little diversity in this book, really. So many other possible sources for writing and insights, from Fortune and BusinessWeek to Wired and The Wall Street Journal...I wish the authors had thought a little more outside their box.The bad: Surprisingly unreliable editing. Incredibly, despite having five academics work on this, they still get important facts flat-out wrong. They apparently confused the number of wounded at Pearl Harbor with the number killed: they cite 1177 deaths in an editorial footnote, whereas knowledgeable writers (Prange) cite 2403 dead and 1178 wounded. And page 234 of my edition refers to the \\"missile\\" which hit Nagasaki!I quote from the instructor's edition for the seventh edition; perhaps they bothered with fact-checking for the new edition. How these errors of fact endured this far is a mystery only the editors can answer.

I had readClimbing Parnassus: A New Apologia for Greek and Latinin 2006 or 2007 so I had already been convinced of the importance of studying Latin and the classic literature of the ancient Greeks and Romans. One of the reasons I decided to homeschool was so that my children could receive an education that is as high a quality as what was offered in the past before public schools \\"dumbed down\\" the curriculum and embraced cultural relativism.There is a lot to like about LCC. The high school Great Books reading list in particular is excellent and one that I have decided to use as a framework for my own self-education. Because of the \\"multum non multa\\" philosophy, the LCC list isn't as daunting as certain other ones I have seen. As a busy mom of 3 including an autistic child, I don't have the leisure time to read a huge number of literary classics. The LCC list, however, seems like a manageable size.The biggest issue I have with the LCC approach is the decision to have the student study Greek on a daily basis from 6th-8th and then twice per week from 9th-12th but science not at all until 8th grade and thereafter only on a weekly basis. I understand that this is similar to what was done in the past, but this is one area where I think modern schooling is superior. My husband studied engineering in college and I studied human biology so science is a subject that is very important to us. It is much higher a priority in our family's homeschool than Greek. Latin I see the point of studying because we are Catholic and we sometimes attend the Traditional Latin Mass. Making Latin the center of a homeschool? Okay, I can understand that. Greek though is a much tougher sell for me personally. Maybe if we were Greek Orthodox and wanted to learn it for liturgical purposes. Since we look to Rome rather than Byzantium, however, I'm not seeing how learning Greek would be a worthwhile use of my students' time. This is particularly true when it appears to come at the expense of a rigorous study of science. \\"The Latin-Centered Curriculum\\" has a lot of discussion about why to study Latin but very little on why to study Greek.Additionally, I am not terribly enamored of the curricula recommended in LCC. While there are certain Memoria Press products that I really like, I don't care much for their Latin or Logic programs. I prefer Classical Academic Press for Latin and Logic. Additionally, I am not a fan of the Classical Writing series. CW may fit the \\"multum non multa\\" philosophy by combining grammar and composition into a single program, but I'd rather use separate grammar and composition programs and just do them on alternate days.I am glad to have finally read LCC and definitely will be incorporating certain aspects into our family's homeschool. However, the book did not totally sell me on the entirety of this particular approach."},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"\\"A Latin Centered Curriculum is a gift to the learner, to the educator and to everyone in-between.

Campbell (a practicing homeschooler who holds advanced degrees in Germanic Literature and Languages, with a speciality in Medieval Studies) to enable parents and teachers a ready and 'user friendly' manual for providing children with the basic principles of a Latin and Greek oriented classical education. Beginning with a brief history of the modern classical movement, Campbell goes on to examine the predominate role of Latin in a classical western education and how the various parts of a classical curriculum come together into a coherent whole. Covering Latin, Greek, and Logic, Campbell also addresses English studies, classical studies, Christian and modern studies, mathematics and science. More than offering theories of classical education, Campbell provides commentary and an overview of a practical curriculum that can be readily implemented at home or in the classroom. \\"The Latin Centered Curriculum\\" is especially appropriate for Christian parents wanting to acquire a substantial understanding of just what is involved with providing their homeschooled child with a classical education. Also very highly recommended from Memoria Press as ideal curriculum materials for the study of Latin and Greek is their \\"Famous Men of Rome\\" series ($39.95, for grades 3 and up); their \\"Famous Men of the Middle Ages\\" set ($16.95), the \\"D'Aularies' Greek Myths\\" series ($45.00, for grades 3 and up); and the comb-bound Horatius at the Bridge Guide\\" ($14.95). Homeschooling parents who are considered developing a classical education based curriculum for their children would be well advised to visit the Memoria Press website at[...]for a full listing of all their curriculum materials, supplements and online courses."},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"This book has some good points to make and helpful resources to list. It also offers badly-needed clarification of what \\"classical\\" really means.On the other hand, there are problems with the curriculum suggestions: 1) overemphasis on mythology and lack of emphasis on religious education, 2) a serious lack in the history recommendations--little Middle Ages and Renaissance coverage, 3) it's clear this is for a school-at-home style, not a true homeschool approach, 4) it does not show an awareness of what is developmentally appropriate for young children.An aside:If you want your kids to learn Latin and LOVE IT, then use natural method books such as \\"Minimus\\" (Cambridge), Oerberg's \\"Lingua Latina,\\" or \\"Ecce Romani.\\" Textbooks (like Henle) are going to mean boredom and frustration.\\"Classical education\\" with an emphasis on pagan culture, methods and authors needs to be carefully considered by serious Christian educators. Where does true wisdom come from? Yes, the Greeks had some share in it, but isn't the full truth found in God's revelation? Why isn't that getting priority????A reading of St. Augustine's \\"On Christian Doctrine\\" would be worthwhile for anyone who wants clarity on the proper Christian approach to classical studies. In my opinion, that approach is NOT found in this book."},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"This book is THE manual for why and how to implement a traditional, Latin-centered education in the homeschool. In a nutshell, a traditional Classical education is streamlined, focused on Latin and Greek, with fewer \\"subjects\\" than other methods, and built on a foundation of the principle of multum non multa, \\"not many but much\\". This means that traditional Classical is \\"simple but deep\\". Rather than attempting to shallowly cover a vast quantity of material, a few selections of the best are chosen, and are studied in great depth. Let's face it, many many good resources are available, so many that it can be overwhelming. Why not simply have your student(s) focus on those few that are The Best?The bulk of the book is an outline of a K - 12 course of study based on this philosophy. The information is organized by subject area (e.g. Latin). Campbell gives a general overview of what you should hope to accomplish in each stage of the child's schooling: Primary (K - 2), Grammar (3 - 8), and Secondary (9 - 12). (e.g. \\"During the primary years, give your students a gentle introduction to Latin that emphasizes vocabulary words, phrases, and prayers. Plan to spend no more than 15-20 minutes a day on Lain at this stage.\\") Then, grade by grade, he recommends specific curricula and other resources to help you reach this goal.The result is a book with tremendous appeal to old pros and newbies alike. If you were lucky enough to be Classically Educated yourself, and already know the ins and outs, this could still provide a very useful framework for giving your child a Classical Education. If you're new to the idea, this simple, straight-forward, concise guide will give you the reassurance and confidence that you can do this, and it won't be as hard as you might fear! If you are familiar with neo-Classical education, this streamlined approach may appeal to you for the way it can simplify your life while giving your child a truly great education.Finally, as a non-Christian myself, I deeply appreciate the way this Christian author writes to a broad audience, and keeps an inclusive tone. Some Christian curricula are recommended, and a course of Bible study is outlined, but there is plenty of valuable information here for people of all faiths (including a note to non-Christian parents in the appendix about how to approach the Bible as literature)."},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"In The LCC, Campbell brings a much-needed perspective back to the table for those homeschoolers interested in a classical education for their kids. He presents what the term \\"classical education\\" used to mean; how it differs from the \\"neoclassical\\" approach popularized by Susan Wise Bauer, Douglas Wilson, the Bluedorns, etc.; and how homeschooling families can put such an approach into practice. It's a slim volume, highly readable and very practical. For the historical and theoretical background, he draws heavily from Simmons' Climbing Parnassus (highly recommended reading). For the scope and sequence section, he draws heavily from Highlands Latin School/Memoria Press.The LCC is recommended for those interested in a more traditionally \\"classical\\"--as opposed to a \\"Great Books\\"--education. The emphasis, first and foremost, is on the classical languages, Latin and Greek. Campbell's mantra is that less is indeed more: Making these languages the central focus of study means that other \\"elective\\" courses of study--and even other really wonderful classics--should fall away or be reserved for independent reading. This is a freeing perspective for parents who look at the 20-30 great books their 7th grader is \\"supposed\\" to be reading and want to just throw up their hands.Another interesting difference is that Campbell takes a multi-thread approach to history as opposed to strictly chronological. I'll leave it to the book to explain more fully, but in a nutshell, he has students doing English Studies, Classical Studies, Christian Studies, and Modern Studies simultaneously (though on different days and possibly in different weeks). Very different from The Well-Trained Mind or Veritas Press chronological, cyclical approach."},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"Before discovering the Latin Centered Curriculum, I had become dissatisfied with our mode of homeschooling. I felt we were trying to cover too much, in too shallow a manner. Then I stumbled upon a sample chapter from LCC, and discovered the concept of \\"Multum Non Multa\\": not many things, but much. This approach of digging deeply into a few essential subjects answered the need I had perceived in our homeschool. Making Latin the center of our curriculum not only simplifies, but magnifies my childrens' educational experience. Author Andrew Campbell provides the methodology to follow, recommends materials to use, and suggests schedules to follow. I have no doubt his book will help to guide us to a new level of academic excellence. My only regret is that we didn't have the LCC when we started homeschooling 8 years ago!"},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"Finally, a book on classical education that gets it right. I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 only because I thought a few points could have been fleshed out a bit more. The author makes many important points that need to be understood by classical educators in a way that is refreshing and easy to comprehend. Latin is important. \\"Multum non multa\\"-Not many things, but much! Go deeply into a limited number of great books. Every homeschooler should at least borrow this book in order to understand where many of our great minds came from and how not to be overwhelmed with loads of curriculum. There are a few minor bugs in the book in relation to recommendations, but to the author's credit he acknowledges that the parent must be flexible in using the material and schedules that are suggested in the book. Lots of good stuff in this one."},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"I love this book. It's simple, to the point and does not mince words. I would say that the Latin-Centered Curriculum is the best book on the market for the common home schooling questions of why and how.

I've found for myself with the subjects required in my state I have to do very little adding.I recommend this slim book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"It is a worthy effort. It relies heavily on Climbing Parnassus, which is a wonderful book, the best apology for the study of Latin and Greek.Mr. Campbell's failure I think is to really make Latin the center of the curriculum. I have grave reservations for Latina Christiana. More importantly, I have a stern caution regarding Henle's Latin. Students will achieve great success at mastering the grammar of Latin, but will hit a road block if they ever try to read Latin texts. They will not acquire the idiom of Latin, the knack for the language.Mr. Campbell would do well to look at Sayer's other essay in which she deplored the fact that she studied Latin 20 years but never mastered it. THat is what will happen to those who use Henle.I recommend speaking Latin and the Oerberg approach. Younger kids need a more natural approach. Anyone serious about making Latin the center of the curriculum really, should read Newman's essay on Elementary Education in \\"Idea of a University\\". It is the finest piece Newman ever wrote (or at least out of the three books of his I've read). Newman's essay is online. Caveat: some sections are in Latin, and it is worth reading many times over many years. Also one should look very carefully at Sayer's other essay, especially the reference to Augustine at the end (concerning how and why he never learned Greek). Finally, one should carefully consider Oerberg's Latin books. Kids love then and will learn the idiom (as well as the grammar). Moreover, there is almost no \\"memorization\\" of Latin to English words. My 6th grade students are delighted (and much less frustrated than with other texts).That said, I do admire Campbell's attempt. I would give it more stars but for the cautions named above. Keeping these in mind, I highly recommend it to any homeschoolers intereested in \\"classical\\" education."},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"The Latin Centered Curriculumby Andrew CampbellBasically a how-to manual on giving your child the best education you possibly can, the Latin Centered Curriculum (LCC) is a book that bases it's ideology on the education the Greeks and Romans gave to their kids.It starts out with apologetics... why you should follow the LCC, and puts forth great arguments both for it and against it's detractors.Then it tells you how to do it... giving outlines, sample schedules and in depth descriptions of the courses of study and recommended texts.The most amazing aspect of the book is that it fits all this into 160 pages... (not including the appendices) but then, that is the beauty of of the LCC... the ideal of Much, not many... about which you can read more either in the book itself.I found myself agreeing with the book, nodding my head and thinking with pleasure of all the things my children and I will be learning in the years to come!It was hard not to get up and start right away...A must read for all Classical Homeschoolers! Drew Campbell has provided us all with an amazing resource.The book is fantastic... definitely bedside table material."},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"I really wanted to like this book as I had heard it is concise and readable as to the \\"whys\\" and \\"hows\\" of a true classical education; my children have been studying Koine Greek for 3 years now and we started Latin this year. I think I have read every book currently available on the subject and I was hoping to be able to recommend this, a short-ish book, to families I know who are considering classical home schooling but don't want to invest large quantities of time in the usual longer books (\\"The Well-Trained Mind\\", Teaching the Trivium\\", etc.). So here is my review, and I direct it especially to Christian home schoolers.The first section discusses why a classical education is superior to modern methods. The author, Andrew Campbell, makes several good points, but he is admittedly mostly rehashing other books such as \\"Climbing Parnassus\\", an excellent book that already explains quite well the \\"whys\\". He quotes \\"C.P.\\" extensively, so my suggestion is that you read THAT book with the quotes in context instead.Campbell is emphatic that the classical languages (especially Latin) have THE central role in a classical education, which is certainly correct. Respecting the stages of the trivium model alone (grammar, logic, rhetoric) is not a classical education per se and there are some out there promoting that it is. He critically refers to those who promote that view as \\"neoclassicists\\" and rightly so. But why he put the Bluedorns and their long-printed book (\\"Teaching the Trivium\\") into this category is beyond me. The Bluedorn book places HEAVY emphasis on the classical languages as central to a classical education; in fact, they emphasize a thorough knowledge of Latin, Greek AND Hebrew as all being central to a Christian's classical education.Campbell then emphasizes the principle of 'multum non multa' (essentially \\"less is more\\") which is a solid classical principle. A child's education should be broad and deep in a few subjects, rather than a smattering of this-and-that in a multitude of subjects, which is the modern methodology. This is what the Bluedorns call \\"trivium vs. trivia\\" (yes I am partial to their book; I think it's better!!). Good principle, absolutely crucial in fact for a successful classical curriculum as there are only so many hours in a day. But strangely, Campbell then proceeds to lay out a scope-and-sequence which is anything BUT \\"multum non multa\\". Seven subjects for a first grader?? (PLUS read-aloud time). How is this any different from the curriculum suggested by \\"The Well-trained Mind\\"? It seems to me the Latin is getting lost again. In other words, in the scope-and-sequence he puts forth, it seems Mr. Campbell contradicts his own advice.Another problem specifically for Christian home scholars: in The Latin-Centered Curriculum, biblical studies are included (via Memoria Press's Christian Studies curriculum, naturally) but filtering all materials through a biblical world view is not only NOT encouraged by Mr. Campbell at all, in fact it is mocked. Greek and Roman writers of the ancient eras, however logical and wise, were generally humanists and there are some things your child will not be ready for yet, and some writings you may find little value in because the humanist viewpoint taints the whole thing. The Bluedorns, in their book, have no problem in saying if it's not possible to redeem it, feel free to throw it out. Just because a Greek wrote it, doesn't mean it has value for your family. Campbell practically sneers at this notion on p.165, implying that families that might choose to use discretion in their materials are somehow paranoid or must be fundamentalists (in the current negative fashion of the word).My final problem with this book is that the ultimate point of it appears to be a thinly veiled attempt to sell Memoria Press products. He uses the scope-and-sequence models to push as many Memoria Press products as he can. For example, he doesn't just say \\"3rd grade Latin\\", but rather \\"Latina Christiana I\\" and \\"Ludere Latine\\" (both MP products). I happen to like many of the MP products and expect this sort of thing in their catalog (which also doubles as a magazine with articles on classical education) but this book should have left that stuff out as it undermines its credibility. Alternatively, they could have named it \\"Why and How to Use Memoria Press Products\\".In all, this book brings nothing new to the table, and what wisdom there is in it has all been said before by other authors in a more credible way.In my opinion, everyone interested in the \\"whys\\" of a classical education should read \\"Climbing Parnassus\\" by Tracy Lee Simmons. If you are seeking a secular curriculum, The Well-Trained Mind is fine, as long as you remember that Latin is not a tacked-on subject but rather it should be central and as long as you keep in mind the principle of \\"multum non multa\\" - it suffers from the same chock-full scope and sequence that Mr. Campbell's does, especially in the grammar years.If you are a Christian home scholar who desires a classical education, and putting the Bible at the center of your child's education is your priority, I urge you to read \\"Teaching the Trivium\\" by Harvey and Laurie Bluedorn - it truly places the Bible and the biblical world view at the center, via the study of the classical languages."},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"I've been frustrated with the current definitions of 'classical education' for some time. Many have latched on to Dorothy Sayers' essay and its innovative redefinitions of medieval subject areas as phases of learning. The author of this book does a good job explaining the true definitions of classical education and applying this framework to a modern classroom (or homeschool classroom) setting. He also provides a sample schedule from Kindergarten up through 12th grade (so, yes, this book is useful to teachers of younger children as well).I do not agree with some of his recommendations. For example, like another reviewer, I prefer the _Minimus_ series to Prima Latina and Latina Christiana. Likewise, Campbell suggests Rod and Staff for math, while I prefer Saxon. His specific textbook recommendations, however, are not a fatal flaw. One can use Campbell's suggestions and sample schedule as a guide and then adjust and adapt as necessary.I highly recommend this book for people interested in a more traditional classical curriculum."},{"Title":"Latin-Centered-Curriculum","review":"I decided to read this book after hearing a homeschool mom discuss it at 'curriculum night'. It intrigued me enough to read it. My thoughts were skeptical before reading it. Why would I want to waste my time with Latin? Why would this ancient language be at the core of my curriculum? And I don't have a background in Latin either. Anyway, the book made a great case so I decided to try it. I have to say we've been doing it now for several months and I love it. I love the 'quality over quantity' approach. We don't necessarily spend less time doing schoolwork, but our schoolwork is focused on what is most important. I get my Latin programs from memoria press. They are easy to teach and thorough. I no longer feel like I'm rushing around trying to cram too much into one day. My son is retaining what he's learning. Our prior curriculum had an extensive reading list. I always felt like I'd never get all of it done in a day so we'd rush through it and on to the next thing. I'd give this book 6 stars if I could.

I found that the books held my interest, were titallating, and made me want to talk with the author to find out how he came to write all this. The book has an earthiness and ruggedness not often found in gay literature. There is a air of mystery too as I found it difficult to put the book down becuase I wanted to continue reading.

It does not try to be all things to all people, just one man's spiritual journey through Tibet. His experiences with enlightened \\"Hermits\\" as well as the phoney pretenders (majority) is well documented. The companion book \\"Darkness Over Tibet\\" even portrays the dark side of spiritual persuits. In some respects, the author's experience is somewhat similar to the Carlos Castenada books.Having done extensive reading in the new age and spiritual/channelled material of today, this is a refreshing first person narrative even though it was written in the 1930s. Unfortunately, a lot of the modern written stuff is full of mumbo jumbo [junk] and and outright disinformation. I found this book worthwhile as the author goes through many trials and tribulations in discerning the truth from the lies and fiction of the pretenders who throw just enough truth to hook people and then divert and distort the rest for the purpose of control. The same thing occurs today as it does then. Not all things are \\"love and light\\", yet he prevails in his arduous journeys as a spiritual seeker of truth."},{"Title":"In Secret Tibet (Mystic Travellers Series)","review":"This book purports to be a true account of the author's adventures in Tibet in the 1930's.Foreigners were not allowed into Tibet, so the author claims he disguised himself as a Tibetan and learnt the rudiments of the language.However, his story is full of holes and just doesn't add up.Tibet is very remote and one man alone would not find it easy to enter.In fact, he gives no details of how he entered the country.The more I read, the more suspicious I became of the truth of this book.The author had blue eyes and always adverted them when he met people.This would raise suspicion.He was German, and going by his picture in the book he looks nothing like a Tibetan.He says he stained his face each day to make it darker, but this would have made him look like some comic actor.It just doesn't add up.He must have stuck out like a sore thumb.He propounds his own religious ideas instead of giving an accurate picture of Tibetan religion.This book cannot be taken seriously."},{"Title":"In Secret Tibet (Mystic Travellers Series)","review":"Very enjoyable book. Make of it what you will, but ultimately, it is very entertaining reading. Regardless of whatever \\"holes\\" you find, there is still much truth in the book. I cannot judge whether it is completely true or not, but if you research this mysterious book, you'll find that there are many truths and factual information. The author's name is an alias and he wrote another book in German about Tibetan Healing practices, I haven't read this and it apparently remains in German language only. One would normally not write something like that unless you've had some direct experience. I cannot warrant any of that, but it deserves consideration.
