She read me The Bird's Christmas Carol in installments when I was around seven, I think. Later I inherited the book, which was the edition from the 1880's (old when Grandmother was young!). Yes, it is sentimental, bathetic, and Carol a little unbelievable but it's also a great Christmas story.

Their getting-ready activities make for a wonderful, comic, but touching dramatic reading, which I did once. I am so glad to know this story still exists, long forgotten, probably.

Stoczkowski shows both an encyclopedic acquaintance with the available facts and the modern theories concerning anthropogenesis. He also applies a penetrating, logical insight into the interaction between them. This relationship is, in his opinion, all too often none at all.He subjects twenty-four hominization scenarios offered over the past two centuries to critical scrutiny, and none of them stand up. Much of the book is taken up with rewriting accounts of bipedalism, brain formation and growth, tool use, etc., in the form of syllogisms, each of which is evaluated with reference to their consistency with the archeological record, their plausibility from other sciences, and their possibility of verification or falsification. Historical, cultural, and political biases are rampant in the analyses, leading researchers not only to hypothesize beyond the facts, but also ignore them and invent others. Many accounts are found to have their origin in classical times, and almost all contain biases from thinkers who speculated before the Additionally, the accounts by scientists of the evolution of human beings are almost always at odds with Darwinism, and even Darwin is found to resort to Lamarckianism in the explanation of bipedalism in humans. More recent scientists are shown try to rephrase pre-Darwinian explanations in terms of natural selection without success.Beyond its value as a critical work, this book also makes a fine reference text. It has a broad scope, good footnoting, and a twenty-five-page bibliography."},{"Title":"Will It Fly?

I've worked with entrepreneurs for years and as thrilling as a new launch can be, it's can be the stuff nightmares are made of.

How to Know if Your New Business Idea Has Wings...Before You Take the Leap","review":"I have been in and around start ups for years now, most recently as a senior executive of a security software company. I have read more books on entrepreneurship than I can remember and I concentrated on entrepreneurship in business school. I have never seen a book as penetrating, practical and on target as this one for the topic that it addresses.What makes this book different is:- it is the only one that thoroughly addresses a start up at concept phase, before your business plan, a partner, money or anything else. Every other entrepreneurial book starts after you've decided you have a good idea or devotes a token chapter that tells you to do market research. This book actually steps you through evaluating and modifying your idea to make it fly.- it provides a practical thorough checklist, with detailed explanations, to evaluate a product/business concept quickly and completely and on how to improve the ratings if your business idea doesn't fly the first time around. What makes this checklist even more valuable is that the criteria are based upon the real-world entrepreneurial experiences of the author.- it gets you to focus on your gut-feelings about your idea. If you think you have a good idea - the spreadsheets all work out - but your gut feelings tell you that all is not well, this book will help you identify why and guide you on how to fix it.- it will tell you if your business idea is a bad one - before you spend a dime. Better be sure you're not &quot;pretending not to know&quot;.- it shows you how to do a first-pass evaluation of any idea in 20 minutes or less, without doing a bunch of premature research.My only complaint is that Tom started teaching at Columbia Business School in 1996 and I graduated in 1990, so I missed him by six years.If you're going to start your own company, take a job at a start up or young company, fund a start up or launch a new product or service, buy this book."},{"Title":"Will It Fly?

How to Know if Your New Business Idea Has Wings...Before You Take the Leap","review":"I would give this a 7 on a 5 point scale. This author presents a list of 44 criteria that you should consider in any new business start up. Its one of those matrix scoring systems -- which you'd never use to make a critical decision, like choosing your spouse. So, why would you use it for your business start up?THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT because of the authors extensive experience. His practicality and experience glows through the simple math weightings. You see the why and the how of each criteria. And, you can see that they have been tested on many previous business ideas and start ups.You can use this system to evaluate the likelihood of success of your new venture... or you can use it to tune it up. I found using the system to evaluate several business ideas at once to be very helpful.I particularly enjoyed the author's reasoning on the weights applied to each of the criteria.THIS IS A REQUIRED BOOK for anyone starting up a new business. Its very practical, usable, and easy to apply.John DunbarSugar Land, TX"},{"Title":"Will It Fly? How to Know if Your New Business Idea Has Wings...Before You Take the Leap","review":"I'm one of those many Columbia students that Tom McKnight mentions in the introduction. Having survived his class 5 years ago, I jumped and bought a copy when I saw he'd distilled his teachings into a book.You won't be disappointed. The magic of Tom's wisdom is that he boils down each concept to a catchy phrase, and those fun phrases anchor the ideas. After reading the book, you'll find that each business you think about triggers a bunch of &quot;happy factors&quot; &quot;cash flow now&quot; &quot;hot market&quot; etc etc etc. If you don't think you need this, read page 261 onwards: &quot;pretending not to know.&quot; Let that chapter ring in your ear, and keep you straight!In any case, 5 years later, I still find Tomisms jumping into my thoughts at every corner. Reading the book was a great experience - it refreshed the elements I had forgotten about, and I learned several new ones. Similar to a Anthony Robbins seminar... you will never be the same!!!The book is also like a Tony Robbins seminar in another way. You don't have to work too hard at it. Just read the book, and you'll find the language creeping into your brain on its own. Facing a business challenge, unemployed, etc?

There is also something about the writing that just makes you put it down for a very long time after each 5 page chapter.I'm a voracious reader especially of business books on entrepreneurship.

His Innovator's Scorecard with its 44 critical success factors makes good sense, and the suggestions are actionable. Besides, it's enjoyable reading. The author seems to be having such fun with words, and with Dr. Market, his wise owl.Being a Librarian who has a passion for reading, I'm often asked - both professionally and socially - to research various topics and recommend books to satisfy the inquiry, curiosity, and/or quest for knowledge.

How to Know if Your New Business Idea Has Wings...Before You Take the Leap","review":"The idea in this book is this: You assess your business against 44 simple criteria. If the business does not score high against any of the criteria, modify the business model so the score improves.The criteria are very simple. You are asked questions like these (I am not giving the exact criteria here):* Do you have proven customer?* Do you have the necessary capital tied up?* Is your competition easy to tackle?Against each question, you do self-scoring. For example,* If the capital is yet to be tied up, you give yourself low score and start working towards tying up the capital (so you can improve the score).* If you have tough competitors, you look for a niche to hide from them or add more ammunition (money, skills, protection) before going to the battleBy the time you have finished massaging your business (or business idea) to deserve good scoring, you would have finished giving it a new and far superior shape.I read this book several years ago. Ever since, I had studiously applied these filters on every one of my new business ideas.

We have here film and DVD reviews, articles, screenplays for produced and unproduced short films, journal excerpts and miscellaneous bits, all as funny and eccentric as one would expect from the director of \\"Tales from the Gimli Hospital.\\" (None of this duplicates the material in his \\"Cowards Bend the Knee\\" book, although there is some illuminating insight into the genesis of that project.) All of these pieces are fun in different ways (although some parts of the journal comically disheartening--even a famous director can't always get financing or, for that matter, get laid). Lots of pictures in this book, including film stills, production shots and storyboards, and nice design--\\"Anna\\" from \\"Heart of the World\\" peeking through a die-cut hole in the cover.This book may be educational for the uninitiated (especially the reviews), but probably not the best introduction to Maddin's work (for which see \\"Kino Delirium\\"). But, for those who enjoy Maddin's films, this book is great fun all around."},{"Title":"From the Atelier Tovar: Selected Writings of Guy Maddin","review":"I'm still reading this book, having finished the journals section, and Guy is so fascinating...Remember Kerouac's Big Sur, and all the misery and dislocation he had during that time, which is a nice way to say he was having delirium tremens, which is a nice way to say he was losing his mind due to alcoholism, but somehow at the same time he was writing all this down into a great book. Well, here with Guy's book of journals, journalism, personal photos and magazine writing, etc. Guy presents himself as one of us...either broke, lonely, heart on his sleeve, snooty, unctuous, loving, meticulous, sure of himself, lazy, more broke, insightful, horny, hetero with a fey side of bacon, and wonderfully revealing. You'll never get a presidential bio on this level. Don't miss the part about him and his female friend being kidnapped and hustled...and surviving by plying their captives with booze...I keep wondering why Guy doesn't do a film of J.K. Huysmans' A Rebours."},{"Title":"From the Atelier Tovar: Selected Writings of Guy Maddin","review":"Maddin starts his autobiographical tour with a movie 'dream list' that announces his taste is far from the contemporary mainstream. Journal entries provide a multifaceted portrait of the filmmaker via indelible childhood memories, plentiful enthusiasms, and unstinting self-evaluation.

The author has taken a subject which most of us care not to deal with and has created one of the most valuable resources available today on the subject of death, funeral arrangements, cremation, alternative rites of passage and so much more. Most of us are totally unaware of the &quot;procedures&quot; we must follow when a loved one passes away. Do you call the police, the funeral home, a coronor, a hospital? Who takes the body away? What are your options? How much will everything cost and what alternatives are available to you? Ms. Goralski has done a magnificant job of translating a painful subject into an incredible resource that informs, educates and compassionately offers you advice and suggestions for dealing with the death of a loved one and all the intricate details that accompany this painful experience that eventually touches all of our lives. Her writing style is eloquent, straightforward and to the point.

I was hoping for a more intergral analysis of Napoleonic campaigns and how each marshal played a part and played off each other and how Napoleon used them against each other; not a series of short, independent, mini biographies. The sections devoted to each marshal add little new if you already know the players - merely sketch out the high and low points. A book for beginners in the Napoleonic campaigns. Missing a list or sources and references. In scanning the text I found that the author draws conclusions regarding the competencies of certain marshals that I happen to disagree with and he adds little enough justification or new material to change my thinking. Very little of their complex, individual personalities comes across. For myself, I would give it two stars but it could be a resource for some (hence 3). The factual information is accurate if presented dryly."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

He later had his freedom bought for him by some English people.Douglass is a very intelligent, brave and resourceful man and he describes slavery in Maryland, a state supposedly kinder to slaves than the deep South.Apart from the horror of the living conditions and treatment, what stands out for me is his denunciation of the Christian society which the slaveowners subscribed to. This is in the Appendix, which I think some editions don't have. (The Penguin does). According to Douglass the more pious they were, the more likely to be cruel. I hasten to add Douglass himself was a Christian too.

Written by Himself","review":"This old book remains a classic. Years ago a biracial friend and I were briefly discussing the horrors of slavery in America, heart-broken and incredulous that it could have gone on for so long. She said that for her, the worst part would have been the whippings. I said I thought that (for myself) it would have been having no control over my own life, family, or children, and knowing that the man and children I loved could be sold away from me forever without even any notice. However, after reading this one more book, so eloquently written by Douglas, who experienced slavery first-hand, I might lean more toward my friend's attitude. Douglas describes just the couple of times that he saw his mother, too briefly, in his early childhood, and what it cost her to make the solitary night-time journey through the wilderness just to rock him to sleep. His vivid descriptions of the unforgivable, unjustified, masochistic cruelty of slave-owners cannot fail to touch even the most hardened, self-justified heart."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

British supporters eventually \\"purchased\\" Douglass allowing this great American to return to the United States and live in freedom.While the battle against slavery was won almost 150 years ago, this autobiography's remains a very powerful tool against racism, ignorance, and historical amnesia.

I also think it is an interesting way to be informed.It is an excellent source of information. It has a vivid description of the work fields and how it feels to see a family member being ruthlessly whipped. It also gives you a feeling you are talking to Frederick himself. It suddenly makes you aware of the relationship between you and him. Everybody probably has a relation with him ranging from skin tones to hardship. We all have at least one if not 2or3 similarities.I think that this book is not for children younger than 9 because it has intense parts about naughty haywire masters. It is for the type of person who likes history . When you are reading this book, you may understand why people started the civil war. I think it made people start the civil war because they read this book and got very angry at slavery. Also I think it made the masters mad. That may have also started the civil warNathaniel age 9"},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"I often believe it is easy to criticize nineteenth century Americans for not stepping up to the plate regarding the issue of slavery and race in America. Jefferson may well have agonized over the issue he called the \\"death knell of the nation\\" and which he labeled a \\"neccessary evil.\\" Certainly he benefitted by the ownership of nearly 300 slaves, but he grew up in a world in which slavery was the norm. It takes a revoutionary and remarkable man to truly stand against the only world he knows and move to create a different world, so I usually defend Jefferson and his political vision which clearly transcended that world.Reading Frederick Douglass, however, makes me wonder how anyone with firsthand knowledge of the institution could not see the obvious pain and cruelty which existed right in front of his or her eyes. Douglass's narrative, and particularly his descriptions of the slave trade in Baltimore and the obvious place of the whip (whether used or not) as the principal vehicle of social control argues most eloquently that though the slave system may have been a social norm, the blinders had to be unbelievably thick not to see the horrors that the institution wrought. The relationship of slave and master perpetuated a most un-American (at least in terms of our professed values--cf. Douglass's later antislavery orations) tyranny and oppression. Douglass's narrative testifies that our ancestors could have seen much more and done much more and that 600,000 lives and a subsequent 120 years of racial schism and pain was too much a price to bear for the peculiar institution."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Written by Himself","review":"I am a student at Parkview High School. I read the book The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. This is an autobiography by Frederick Douglass who acts as both the narrator and the protagonist. He begins the book with his birth and shows how he progresses from an uneducated, oppressed slave to a worldly and articulate political commentator.Douglass was born sometime between 1817 and 1818. His mother was Harriet Bailey, and his father was thought to be his master, Captain Anthony. Life on this plantation was not as hard as that of most of the other slaves. Being a child, he served in the household instead of in the fields. At the age of seven, he was given to Captain Anthony's son'in'law's brother, Hugh Auld, who lived in Baltimore. Douglass remarked on how kind his Mistress, Sophia Auld, was to him at first since she had not yet been corrupted by slavery. She actually started teaching him how to read until her husband forbade her, saying that education made slaves unmanageable. Thus two major themes of the book were introduced, ignorance as a tool of slavery and knowledge as a path to freedom. As Douglass continued learning, he became conscious of the evils of slavery and of the existence of the abolitionist movement. He resolved to escape to the North eventually.After the deaths of Captain Anthony and his remaining heirs, Douglass was taken back to serve Thomas Auld, Captain Anthony's son'in'law. He was a mean man made harsher by his false religious piety. Auld considered Douglass unmanageable, so he rented him for one year to Edward Covey, a man known for \\"breaking\\" slaves. Covey managed, in the first six months, to work and whip all the spirit out of Douglass. The turning point came when Douglass resolved to fight back against Covey, after which Covey never touched Douglass again. Douglass is next rented to William Freeland for two years. Though Freeland was a milder, fairer man, his will to escape was nonetheless renewed. He attempted to escape with three of his fellow slaves, but someone betrayed their plans, and he was sent back to Baltimore to learn the trade of ship caulking to keep out of trouble.Eventually, Douglass received permission from Hugh Auld to hire out his extra time. He saved money bit by bit and eventually made his escape to New York. He refrained from describing the details of his escape in order to protect the safety of future slaves who might attempt the journey. In New York, Douglass feared recapture and changed his name from Bailey to Douglass. Soon after, he married Anna Murray, a free woman he met while in Baltimore. They moved north to Massachusetts, where Douglass became deeply engaged with the abolitionist movement as both a writer and an orator.The personal account by Douglass really opened my eyes to the horrors of slavery. The book showed the damaging effect of slavery on slaveholders and how it was a perversion of Christianity. I agree with Douglass on not revealing his escape route. I think it wise that he kept the most important part of his narrative a secret so that future runaways can have a better chance at escape. His vivid descriptions of the cruelty of slaveholders were sometimes unbearble. I knew that the masters were usually exceedingly cruel to their slaves, but his narrative made me cringe everytime he was taken to a cruel master. It made me want him to escape so that he will not be subjected to the whippings any longer. He made me feel like that I was there with him, witnessing the horrors of the system. Douglass also presented himself as a reasoned, rational figure. His tone was dry, and he did not exaggerate. He was capable of seeing both sides of an issue, even the issue of slavery. This gave his narrative an objective view that made it very valuable to the abolitionist movement. I thought the narrative was very powerful and touching and should be a good read for everyone."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

If you are an American and do not know of the life of one of America's greatest heroes, then please pick up a copy and read his story. Remember his story-and remember why we hold freedom so dear. If you are from anywhere else, this is your chance to read a true story, like none other, of a man, who, by his own human nature detests the bonds of slavery, and through incredible daring, indefatigable strength and unrelenting intellect, secures his own freedom. It is an easy and quick read (I went through it in a couple hours) but it is also a must read. This is truly a unique and unvarnished look at the terrors, tortures and dehumanization of slavery in Maryland, the fortitude and zeal of the northern abolitionists who safeguarded Douglass and the ultimate triumph of the human spirit over the forces of ignorance and bondage.

Written by Himself","review":"\\"His articulate descriptions of the abuses perpetrated by his masters revealed horrors of slavery that previously were unimaginable to most Americans...\\" This book was written in 1845, but I find even today that though I knew the slaves were mistreated I couldn't imagine how horribly they were treated (not by all slaveowners) until I read this book. And Douglass wrote so well he had me riveted to the pages. It was interesting for me to compare Douglass' slave experiences with those of Booker T. The latter described so well the extreme poverty they lived in, while Douglass described how they were degraded by their treatment - I would say their souls were murdered. This was the main message which came across to me from reading this book; however, there were many interesting things I learned in addition. Such as, getting an idea of how important names and heritage can be to people, getting a feeling for the hunger to learn, finding out why so many slaveowners impregnated their female slaves (why didn't their wives clamor), and why mulattos (like Douglass) were particularly hated, and why disabled slaves were treated particularly horribly. Douglas mentioned a number of times the ever-puzzling relationship between religiosity and cruelty. How some people can believe themselves to be good Christians while at the same time treating their fellow creatures in such an un-Christike manner, to me is one of the great largely-unexplained questions of human behavior. Bottom line is: reading this book was a great experience for me."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

He also provides an excellent example of what black people in this country could do for themselves, interms of their economical status. Looking further, Douglass loved to think and imagine the endless possiblities, while he was still in bondage physically. When he began to read and understand the \\"Hypocrasy\\" that this country was based on, using christianity as it main tool, and what every human should be allowed by right, this released his psychological enslavement. If blacks throughout this country could read and understand there were blacks that went through worse situatians and overcame them, and the current situation that destroy the black communities were created for them to fail, just like slavery, many would wake up and take on the mask of Douglass.

Many lower-priced Kindle editions of books have bad formatting problems that make the book difficult or even impossible to read. Not this one! I found the formatting was excellent throughout. In two places the footnotes were slightly misplaced, but it was easy to figure out from context what the text was. In general, the Kindle formatting was better than many more recent (and expensive!) books.The content was also excellent (as other reviewers have noted), hence the 5 stars. I've read of Frederick Douglass' life from other sources, but this was the first time I'd read his account.The introduction by other authors was written in a style that now feels very anachronistic. It was hard to get through those.Frederick Douglass' account, however, was fresh, engaging, and direct. I found it hard to put down. Descriptions of the atrocities of the time were very personal and not couched in the melodrama of the introduction. I think that made his account even more powerful. His description of his self-education in Baltimore was absolutely stunning and inspirational.This autobiography, from such a pivotal figure in American history, would already be required reading at any price. But the accessibility and readability of this edition make it a must-have for a Kindle."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Benjamin Franklin's autobiography). However, in having to read this for an Amercian Civilization class, I found it refreshing as a whole. Granted, this is my own opinion about a man writing his autobiography, but considering how impossible it was to read Ben Franklin's for the same class, this book was wonderful in comparison (if for no other reason than Douglass having not nearly so complex syntax in his writing)!Douglass, an ex-slave gives the details of his life from the very beginning to right after his escape into New York state. For those who don't believe that slavery was an barbaric institution, this book should change your mind, as Douglass has no qualms giving vivid, and at times, graphic details of what slave-holders used to do to their &quot;property.&quot; For any person looking for a good primary source book for a research topic relating to Pre-Civil War society, more specifically in dealing with the topic of slavery, this is an invaluable referrence book!"},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"In his work Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave, Frederick Douglass outlines his purpose in writing the piece:&quot;Sincerely and earnestly hoping that this little book may do something toward throwing light on the American slave system, and hastening the glad day of deliverance to the millions of my brethren in bonds - faithfully relying upon the power of truth, love, and justice, for success in my humble efforts - and solemnly pledging my self anew to the sacred cause.&quot;Certainly Douglass' \\"little\\" book shed tremendous light on the slave system that existed in early American history and he successfully accomplished his purpose. The description of how slaves were treated was interesting and enlightening, and provokes compassion in the reader. Additionally, Douglass wonderfully explores the issue of knowledge and power, as he describes the many occasions in which slaveholders tried to keep slaves from learning to read. Finally, Douglass raises a concern about the hypocrisy among southern Christians based on the way that they treat slaves. True Christians treat all humans with love, respect, compassion, and indiscriminately. This final point raises a relevant issue in today's society - does this hypocrisy still exist?Several statistics indicate that although the problem that Douglass addresses is not as drastic, it still remains a serious challenge that the United States must wrestle: 16.2 percent of American children are living in poverty (United States Census); 54 percent of African American families say underachievement among black students represents a &quot;crisis,&quot; 33 percent of white parents agree (Public Agenda); 10.8 million children in the United States have no health insurance; 1 in 4 Hispanic children are uninsured; 1 in 11 Caucasian children are uninsured (Children's Defense Fund); 3/4 of teachers in public schools do not believe that schools should expect the same from students in low-income areas as students in high-income areas (Education Watch); in recent years income has decreased in the bottom, second, and middle 20% sectors, while increasing slightly in the fourth sector and substantially in the top sector (United States Census). . If American Christians were truly loving and sharing like Jesus teaches, the social stratification that is prevalent in the United States would not be nearly as extreme. The Christian Church should not allow such tremendous economic and educational differences. Although this is not nearly as glaring a problem as slavery, Douglass' narrative is applicable even to today's social problems and is well worth the read for that and many other reasons."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

But seldom do they capture with such clarity the dehumanization of both the slave and slaveholder that Douglass depicts.

Written by Himself","review":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is one of the few books that every American should read and is also essential for anyone even remotely interested in American history, African Americans, or slavery's sad story. It is a fine piece of writing in itself and also of immense historical value - a true American classic.The most obvious aspect is of course autobiographical. American literature has a long, prestigious autobiographical tradition, and this is one of the best entries. Douglass' account of his life is profoundly moving and immensely thought-provoking. He begins with his first memories and carries his story all the way to what was then the present. Needless to say, the inside look at slavery from a slave's perspective is the most valuable part; there are numerous such narratives, but this is surely preeminent. The story is heart-wrenching, vividly and unforgettably detailing humanity's inhumanity; we see what it was like to be a slave in regard to everything from food, clothing, and shelter to labor. Many of the incidents are almost painful to even read; actually living through them - or even being alive when such things happened - is now thankfully unimaginable. Douglass gives several examples of physical cruelty, but the most harrowing stories may well be those of psychological torture and simple denial of basic human feelings, as in the heartless breaking up of families. Such things are inherently moving, and this would be one of the most emotional works ever if it were fiction, but the stunning fact that it is not makes it all the more meaningful. The dread weight of its truth is particularly shocking when we realize that Douglass came from one of the areas where slavery was least harsh. The horrors here related are thankfully long past, but such books will always be immensely valuable as reminders of just how cruel people can be - and have been quite recently. We must never forget, lest they happen again.Douglass in this way is more representative than individual, and he indeed took it on himself to speak for all slaves. The book was in this sense propagandistic and did its job better than anyone could have expected, laying slavery's evils bare to many who were previously unaware or unable - possibly unwilling - to believe. It was an abolitionist milestone and had a real effect in moving slavery toward its end. Yet Douglass' story is extremely interesting in itself; indeed, in many ways he was the spiritual successor of Benjamin Franklin, founder of the American autobiographical tradition. Franklin practically invented the American dream by showing how hard work and perseverance could raise one from humble beginnings to wealth, fame, and acclaim. Douglass had infinitely worse circumstances yet managed to rise far above them - not only teaching himself to read but becoming a genuine autodidact, not only escaping slavery but becoming a noted abolitionist, orator, writer, black leader, and racial authority with world fame and reverence. Few stories are more inspirational, and the work is thus on top of everything else the best kind of self-help book. Douglass unforgettably shows that it is possible to overcome even the most adverse circumstances and gives a good idea of how to do so.One must not neglect to mention that, incredible as it is, Douglass is a premier prose stylist. Considering his circumstances, the fact that he was able to write at all is amazing; anyone would make great allowance for poor or even semi-literature writing. In fact, though, Douglass is a top-level writer; this is not only one of the very few autobiographies that is true literature but simply great writing per se. The writing is simple in the best sense; Douglass truly embodied Jonathan Swift's good style definition: \\"Proper words in proper places.\\" He is admirably clear and concise. That said, he works himself up to a rhapsody when appropriate, reaching near-lyrical heights; the passage where he compares himself to the free is one of the most affecting and best-written I have seen in the hundreds or thousands of books I have read. That Douglass' Narrative has this totally unlooked for virtue in addition to all others is thoroughly impressive.Simply put, anyone who has not read this should do so as soon as possible; few books are more important or memorable. Douglass is an American giant, and this is his enduring fame's base. No one who reads it can forget it, and that may be the highest praise of all."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"First, I must mention that there are several editions of this book that have been published. I actually have two different editions but henceforth I will be referring to the Barnes & Noble Classic version with the Introduction by Robert O'Meally published in 2003. It is unlikely the other editions are better.With timelines and detailed endnotes, Robert O'Meally, a Columbia University Professor, provides a scholarly introduction to Narrative, which all combine to create an excellent reference on Frederick Douglass.One would make quick work in reading the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave. It is not a lengthy autobiography which could be attributed to the fact that this is his first autobiography; it was written in 1845 when he was around 27 years of age. He later pensMy Bondage and My Freedom(1855) andThe Life and Times of Frederick Douglass (Dover Value Editions)(1892).In short, it is a must read for everyone! Frederick Douglass provides a first-hand account of the evils of slavery, unveiling its immorality for all to see. He writes clearly, descriptively and at times with emotion; appropriately so given the circumstances. From his attempts at identifying his father, to his encounters with his various masters and overseers, to his epiphany that \\"...rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom...\\", you will be a passenger on his journey to emancipation.Upon learning how to read, Frederick Douglass stated, \\"The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers.\\" When reading this autobiography those same feelings will arise anew in you."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Written by Himself","review":"This powerful first- person indictment of slavery provides the reader with a detailed authentic account of the humiliations and abuses of this primal American sin. I have known vaguely about Slavery and in fact studied about it in the American public school system many years ago. But this autobiography details the cruelties in a truly horrifying and shocking way. I was surprised at the wanton cruelty of so many of the slaveowners. The reactions of the slaves as described by Douglass for instance in telling how they would compete to prove their own slavemaster superior, are scathingly honest. One cannot read this book without again sensing how evil human beings can be. One cannot read it without feeling how deep the historical evil of Slavery truly was.

Written by Himself","review":"Frederick Douglass' \\"Narrative\\" is the story of his life from birth until shortly after his escape. By slave standards, his early conditions were not \\"terribly\\" hard. While his family had been taken from him when he was very young, he had a fairly benevolent master and mistress, and was spared the life of a plantation slave. The degradations he endured were not the daily whippings and starvation that many of his fellow slaves endured -- and that he witnessed as a slave.His life was not, however, the idyllic life Southern slaveholders (and their Northern supporters) painted. As a youngster, he might have been spared the lash and the pangs of starvation, but he knew they could become a part of his reality by any whim of his master. Even as a young man, Douglass yearned for education and knowledge; this, his master would have deprived him of for fear of \\"ruining a good ******\\". Slaves were not people, not the master's fellow man; they were possessions. And, as Douglass' narrative makes plain, every slave felt that keenly.I will not go into the details of Douglass' life, how his less harsh conditions were turned into the very ones he dreaded most, or how his yearning for freedom manifested itself in a failed attempt, and then, finally, success. The book is a short read, and a good one. Douglass' writing style engages the mind masterfully. One knows at once that he is a thinker and a passionate abolitionist, and one quickly learns the reasons for this.I will address one point of his discourse, and that is religion (as it was practiced in southern churches at the time) and religious bigotry. His description of the slaveholder who was as cruel a man as imaginable but the most pious of churchmen; the slaveholders who claimed to adhere to the doctrines of mercy and charity, and yet were as hard as flint and cold as ice to their fellow man; rings so true today, when US slavery is a despised relic of the past, that it is astounding to read. The sentiments Douglass describes, though not the actions, could well be a chronicle of modern bigotry. As most people acquainted with religious people can probably attest, I have had the misfortune of knowing more than a few bigots of the religious variety (southern evangelical denominations, mostly) -- who claim to believe that mankind is all created by the same god, descended from the same ancestors, and equal in that god's eyes yet are appalled by interracial dating/marriage (think: Bob Jones University), and generally hold people whose skin tones are darker than their own in contempt; Douglass' words are a powerful reminder that there is much progress to be made if we are ever to overcome the damage of the philosophies and religious ideologies that permitted -- encouraged and justified -- slaveholding in this country.This book is a must read -- and a great starting point for a study of Frederick Douglass' works and words. 5/5 stars."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Of the three, I recommend the first one because it's written from the heart with honesty and raw emotion. He wrote the first narrative before he became famous and I was deeply moved with his simplicity of language to express the atrocities his fellow slaves and him faced in Pre-Civil War America. The second and third editions are written after he became a famous abolitionist and lecturer, and his writing style is more fastidious, full of a new-found conceited confidence, which detracts from the brutality and hopelessness he endured as a slave in the South.

Written by Himself","review":"It's amazing how often, in the dark nights of man, a voice cries out and manages to be heard. This, one of the loudest such cries in the history of the United States, is the story of an escaped slave named Frederick Douglass, who bears witness to an ordeal of hunger, beatings, and random murder.\\"Narrative Of The Life Of Frederick Douglass\\" is Douglass's own story, plainly told. While published in 1845 as an abolitionist argument against the institution of slavery, much of its enduring power comes from being a specific indictment against the whites in and around Baltimore, Maryland who figuratively and sometimes literally bat Douglass around as a kind of prop to their lower-middle-class existence.His first overseer, a drunkard named Plummer, beats his Aunt Hester with a whip until it is covered with gouts of blood. A woman in Baltimore, Mrs. Hamilton, keeps a cowskin at her side at all times, to beat the two famished girls who wait upon her if they make any minor mistake. A Methodist preacher, Hopkins, preemptively beats his slaves as a warning to the rest to mind their ways.Slavery, Douglass observes, has a dehumanizing effect on the master as well as the slave. \\"The fatal poison of irresponsible power\\", Douglass calls it, and documents its effect on one woman who initially befriends Douglass and teaches the young boy to read before changing her ways in the wake of her husband's scorn.The husband had a point, Douglass reveals. That seed of education implanted in Douglass the desire to read, ultimately to be free.\\"Mistress, in teaching me the alphabet, had given me the inch, and no precaution could prevent me from taking the ell,\\" he states.An inspiring story, the \\"Narrative\\" suffers at times from the excesses of Victorian-era literature and at others from an understandable reluctance from the author to reveal the facts of his final, successful escape. Douglass was writing for a cause, a great one, but there are times when he makes his points and times when he pounds them a bit too long.Douglass is better when relating the day-to-day struggles of his fight for self-respect, learning surreptitiously from white boys by pretending to show off his basic writing and getting them to show him they can do better. There's also the considerable thought he brings to the table. The white preachers talk about slavery as a Biblically mandated fate for the black man, but Douglass points out many slaves owed the circumstances of their birth to the man watching over them with the whip. Douglass himself was half-white, but that didn't make him half-free.Ultimately, Douglass says enough, and decides he not only will be free, but already is: \\"I now resolved that, however long I might remain a slave in form, the day had passed forever when I could be a slave in fact.\\" It's a singularly triumphant moment in this consistently readable book."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"As society moves about, the slavery of the past remains alive and well. \\"Sweep it under the rug and do not bring it up\\" is the mindset of many. This type of suppression is often brought about because of the known guilt of an unfair past. American slavery has deep roots, reading the life of Fredrick Douglass, will help unveil some of the true history of America.At one point in the book Douglass realized he had past the time of being an indentured servant and knew that being a slave for life was his fate. He was treated with little if no respect. Douglass described Mr. Severe, one of his \\"masters\\", as a man who would whip a slave for almost no reason at all (22). Dougless illustrated that Mr. Severe had no respect for his slaves, but treated them as if they were not human.Many people may think that Douglass story was the exception, but that's not the case. Many times through out the book Douglass spoke of other slave's punishment as far worse than his own. He even recorded the murder of two slaves in Talbot, Maryland and stated that the slave owner never paid for the crime (31-33). This type of abuse almost seems unfathomable, but it's reality.Studying the origins of slavery can allow us to see the disgusting progression of the enslavement of human life and stripping of human character. Douglass' narrative provides the reader with a glimpse into the life of a slave. The emotional state of Douglass was strong, considering the abuse that he underwent during his life. The narrative of Fredrick Douglass is a superb read for anyone wanting to get a first hand understanding of the life of an American slave."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

I see why Douglass was considered a great speaker for the abolitionist cause.Also, Douglass' insights into the \\"psychology\\" of slave owning could be described as universal comments on human nature, applicable to situations going on today.In the book he left out some information to protect people who had helped him out of slavery. By researching on the internet, I figured out these were his friends in a black intellectual circle that met in Baltimore. One of them was Anna Murray, a free black woman who loaned him traveling money. \\"Anna was a few years older than Frederick and was a servant for a wealthy Baltimore family. Although Anna was a plain, uneducated woman, Frederick admired her qualities of thriftiness, industriousness and religiousness. Anna and Frederick were soon in love and in 1838 they were engaged.\\" In the book he wrote about how he loved this group of friends and how hard it was to risk leaving them for an uncertain future. Yet he opted to continue seeking freedom. Later he was able to reunite with Anna, and they were together until her death in 1882."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"My name is Jane, and I am a student at Parkview High school. I have been taught about slavery in many past history classes. As I read this book about Frederick Douglass, my view of slavery was moved tremendously. Douglass explains the horror and cruelty of slavery in every chapter of this book. As a child, he witnessed a brutal whipping that his aunt encountered. From this point on, he realizes what slavery truly is and how it dehumanizes African Americans. Douglass was moved from being a plantation slave to a house slave when he was under the age of 10. He enjoyed the life as a house slave because he was treated more like a human-being. However, this did not last long. The mistress, Mrs. Auld, who taught him how to read and write also turned into a cruel slave owner when Mr. Auld showed her the dangers of educating a slave. Douglass, however, continued to learn how to read and write. By his consistency, Douglass accomplished his dream and became a free man. The topic of slavery should not be lightly comprehended. Although, I am not able to put my feet in Douglass' shoes, he truly is an inspirational writer that not only touched me but the hearts of thousands across the world."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"I knew very little about Frederick Douglass when I first set out to read his autobiography. We had to read three or four chapters for our American Literature class. But when I saw the size of the book I didn't think it would hurt to just go ahead and read the whole thing. I'm glad I did.When you ask the layperson who Frederick Douglass was the answers you usually get are runaway slave, orator, abolitionist, and the like. Are these accurate? Yes. But try this one:American Hero!We usually think of Benjamin Franklin as the ultimate self-made American. But it was actually Frederick Douglass. Yes, Franklin started with virtually nothing and worked his way into financial and professional prosperity, finding success in a variety of fields. But Frederick Douglass did the same thing, except he started with absolutely nothing but the rags on his back. (He didn't even start out with his freedom!) He risked his life to prove that a free man is the best man. Even as he wrote his autobiography, he refused to mention the details of his escape, fearing that it would jeopordize the possible escapes of other slaves.One of the things that I found very disturbing in this book (there are many disturbing passages in this book) was the fact that of all the slaveholders he had to contend with, the most brutal of all were the ones who claimed to be Christians. (I'm glad that Douglass was himself a strong enough Christian to not be misguided by those pious hypocrites.) One of the saddest passages in the book is as follows:&quot;Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, next to that enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me. For of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst. I have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all others.&quot; (Page 85, Signet Classic)This was a very controversial statement made not by someone who gets his kicks from mocking Christianity, but by someone who has experienced, first-hand, the love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ but then had to suffer at the hands of people who claimed that their &quot;love&quot; for Jesus Christ gave them license to brutalize and torment any under their charge.I believe that Douglass knew the dangers of going public with this information. I believe he knew of the possibilities of his being returned to a state of slavery - whether it be through political unrest and upheaval in the North, or kidnapping, or any possible way. I believe that he knew that there would be people in both the South and the North who would want to see him dead because of what he was saying.This is why I call him an American hero."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"A prime subject of debate before the Civil War seems to have been the nature of slavery in the South. Northern abolitionists would shoot rhetorical darts concerning the ineffable cruelties done to slaves at the hands of Southern slaveholders; Southern Confederates would fire their own salvos in return, telling stories to show that the abuses did not outweigh the general decency of the system. In this autobiography, Frederick Douglass weighs in heavily with the abolitionists, laying bare the barbarity and brutality of his experiences with slaveholders in the South. Tracking his life from the ignorance of childhood, to his growing awareness and education, to his final escape, Douglass makes his opinion plain: It is not only the South's particular form of slavery which is savagely corrupt - the system itself is despicable at its core.My college assigned me this book to read, suggesting I watch for two things: the relationship of Christian faith to his life and to that of his masters, and the role of education in his journey toward freedom. In regard to the first, Douglass actually says surprisingly little about how his faith sustained him throughout his captivity. A few brief mentions are made here and there about how Christianity strengthened him during his trials, but the vast majority of his remarks on Christianity addressed the viciousness it seemed to inspire in his masters. In his experience, pious slaveholders were more cruel and malicious than unbelievers. Indeed, one of his worst masters was reverend of a local church. Douglass explains that while religion is well and good in its proper state, the corruption of the Southern version of Christianity was unpardonable, a religion where piety begot brutality, and faith sanctioned savagery.In my reading of this narrative, Douglass' primary hope was not in Christianity, but in education. Throughout the book, he explains the various devices slaveholders used to keep their slaves from getting religion, or getting reading and writing, or getting knowledge of current events. He shows that the Southerners knew exactly what they were keeping from their slaves - the very tool by which they could gain liberty, humanity, and freedom. Douglass traces his tortuous trials in learning to read and write, and then shows the invaluable benefits he received from these. A good education is one of the greatest and most liberating things a person can get, and Douglass' narrative drives this point home hard and clear.This book is a worthwhile read. Engaging and well-written, this narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass fascinates and informs. It illustrates the cruel treatment he, and by extension many other slaves, received at the hand of Southern slaveholders. It shows how a barbaric form of Christianity inspired some of these cruelties. And it shows how education delivered Douglass from the hands of his oppressors. Read it as a history. Read it as a story. But by all means, read it."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"Slavery was known as a \\"peculiar institution\\". By broadcasting such labels for slavery, the southern slave owners were able to downplay the severity of the subjugation of slaves in this \\"peculiar institution\\". However, in 1845 a runaway slave by the name of Frederick Douglass was published his narrative which showed the extent of the cruelty within of the oppressive the institution of American slavery. Douglass gives a powerful portrayal of his personal struggle against the tyranny of himself and his fellow slaves. By depicting his personal story regarding the horrors of slavery, Douglass testified to the injustices of the slave institution and conveyed an urgent message of the time for prompt abolition.Douglass leaves out no detail as he portrays the brutal means in which slaves were forced into subjugation. In order to maintain order and to achieve maximum efficiency and productivity from his slave, an owner used the fear of the ever-present whip against his slaves. Over, and over again throughout the Narrative, Douglass gives account of severe beatings, cruel tortures, and unjust murders of slaves. The message is evident. Slavery dehumanized African Americans.From the introduction of his early experience, Douglass portrays the burdens of slavery. The reader is forced to cope with the fact that he has no tangible background. Slavery has robbed him of the precious moments of his childhood. He was raised in the same manner as one would raise an animal. In his early years he had no knowledge of time-he did not even know when he was born. He is also forced to scrounge for food in the same fashion as a pig digs for slop. The saddest insight is the alienation of Douglass from his family. He has no connection with his parents and when his mother dies he was untouched. On hearing of her death he states, \\"I received the tidings of her death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger\\" (19). The bond between mother and child is the strongest bulwark for children and to be robbed of this and to not care demonstrates just how severe slavery was to Douglass and countless others who faced the same fate. In the entire slave experience, the only escape from the repression was through sorrowful singing. As Douglass states, \\"every tone was a testimony against slavery...\\" and \\"slaves sing the most when they are unhappy\\" (29). Only through music could slaves find comfort in dealing with their anguish.Douglass's first witness of brutality is the telling of his Aunt Hester's beating. The narration is powerfully effective through terrible detail. The cursing of the overseer, the shrieks of his aunt, and the horrible effects the whip upon her flesh is almost as agonizing the reader of the Narrative as it was to his unfortunate aunt. The fact that this terrible instance is a common occurrence makes it a heavier burden upon the reader's soul.As if the beatings were not enough, slaves were also murdered on a whim. Douglass tells of Gore, a meticulously cold taskmaster who blew out the brains of a poor slave by the name of Demby. The chilliness of Gore's is terrible due the fact that he kills with the sympathy of a butcher.Upon hearing about this, one would speculate that the authorities would deal with such barbaric acts justly. However, as Douglass recounts in the story Mrs. Hicks, the murderess that killed a slave girl for not moving fast enough, the law officials were hesitant to enforce the rights of the slave and would intentionally overlook such matters. This is primarily due to the fact that a slave owning society could not allow the rights of the slave to be upheld to the same level as a white man. To do such a thing would threaten the stability of their superiority. This is further illustrated in Douglass's struggle against the shipyard workers, when he fled to his master and told him of the attack his master stated that he could not hold up Douglass or even a thousand blacks testimony. The lack of protection under the law and the unwillingness of the whites to give the slaves a voice allowed the whites to completely dominate the slaves without the fear of accountability for their actions.The worst aspect of slavery is found in the religious nature of the subjugation of slaves. The cruelty found in slavery was even more intense when placed under the pretense of the slaveholding religion of Christianity. Through Douglass's deconstruction of Christianity, he learns that the white oppressive version of Christianity is much different from his own beliefs of Christianity. The incident that shaped Douglass's understanding of the mentality of religious slaveholders was when he was placed under the authority of Mr. Freeland. In this situation, he was able to see the difference between the so-called \\"religious slave-holders\\" and \\"non-religious slave-holders.\\" Douglass felt that the \\"non-religious slave-holders\\" were less brutal because they did not reprimand their slaves based on a Divine command. Instead they were more concerned about reprimanding the slaves when the slaves did wrong as opposed to whenever they felt that the Lord professed a beating.The Narrative and Selected Writings is a powerful testimony to the struggles American slaves faced. Through the writings of men such as Frederick Douglass, abolitionists were given fuel to the bonfire of the Abolition Movement. Douglass honest testimony helped to bring out the truth about slavery. Abolitionists now had evidence to back their claim that the \\"peculiar institution\\" was in fact an institution of evil."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Written by Himself","review":"It's simply amazing that a man such as Frederick Douglass could rise up from the bowels of slavery and make such an impact on American history. And the fact that he allegedly educated himself and became an outspoken leader/advocate in the abolitionist movement, while becoming one of the leading intellectuals in the 19th century would indeed be miraculous if it didn't seem so fallacious.But what I'm about to state will disturb many people, and for that I'm deeply sorry. However, I feel Douglass' autobiography and how he managed to educate himself with little or no help then escaping to freedom is unmitigated hyperbole.Also, the fact that Douglass downplays Harriet Tubman's Underground Rail Road as something unfeasible and the fact that Douglass doesn't reveal any information on how he escaped made this book seem extremely far-fetched if not fanciful.Unfortunately, this narrative seems like a work of fiction that was written by a 19th century white person trying to capture the essence of the black experience. (In other words this narrative would make a pretty good TV movie of the week.)And Of course, many people will make the accusation that what I'm conveying are racist sentiments, but that simply isn't the case. There were an abundance of capable Blacks in the 19th century that could and did accomplish what Douglass achieved ten-fold.So, with that said, I emphatically feel that he should've been professional and intellectually forthright with his tale. It would have been intriguing to envisage his perilous journey to freedom.By leaving the readers in utter limbo on how he made his trek to freedom when he simply could have given realistic details of what transpired during his escape without revealing accomplices would have made his story more palatable.But overall, what I think everyone should ascertain from this autobiography is the iniquitous brutality of slavery and the impact it had on America as a society then and now, and we must all muster enough strength to love and respect one-another so someday we'll overcome adversities in our sacred land.So to sum up; even though I found this book far-fetched at times I still consider Frederick Douglass to be one of the greatest Americans of all time.A must read for the learning experience insofar as reaching understanding even though this autobiography reads like a work of fiction."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

This narrative makes it personal. You see an individual and what has happened in his personal life and that always makes it more real. Secondly, the reason why this edition is so fantastic, is the footnotes that it provides.

Written by Himself","review":"The &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave&quot; is an old fine book. It was first published as 'My Bondage and My Freedom' in 1855. Again in 1881, it appeared as 'Life and Times of Frederick Douglass'.Lively and sympathetically refreshing, this book gave a comprehensive narration regarding Frederick Douglass' life as a slave, and then, as a free abolitionist (and civil rights leader).Born as Augustus Frederick Washington Bailey in Talbot county, Maryland, in 1817, young Frederick was a slave right from his mother's womb. However, a successful escape in 1838 changed his life (as well as his name). Known simply as Frederick Douglass, he migrated to New York; and finally settled at Bedford, Massachusetts: where he mastered the art of abolitionism.The young man's writings and eloquent speeches reminded Americans of the evils of slavery. Not even resentments and pro-slavery racist attacks could deter him.Soon after publishing his revealing autobiography in 1845, he fled to England in order to escape deportation and re-enslavement (in the South). Fortunately in 1847, some English Quakers purchased his freedom, and he returned (legally free) to the U.S.This book gave a good account of how Mr Douglass directed &quot;underground railroad&quot;, which took fugitive slaves to their freedom in Canada. It also narrated how he founded his abolitionist newspaper: 'The North Star'.However in 1859, Frederick fled to England once more, having been accused of helping John Brown in the designing stage of his slave revolt plot. He did return to U.S. in 1860, and publicly supported Abraham Lincoln's presidential bid. He held respectable official posts in various capacities: among which was the United States' Minister to Haiti. He wrote several books and newspaper articles, and was finally laid to rest in 1895.This book, (&quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot;), is a classical masterpiece.

Frederick Douglass's life is the most astounding example of the power of knowledge that I have ever encountered.

This story of courage, strength, heartache, and triumph is an invaluable piece of historical literature.

Written by Himself","review":"Perhaps more so than any other account, Douglass gives us a look into the life of a slave. I enjoy this book on many level. Douglass writes honestly and in a factual tone. He does mince his words when he describes the brutality of slavery. Douglass demonstrates that he is an intelligent man despite his lack of education. He taight himself to read. To our youth, this demonstrates the value of education. Douglass also show Americans manipulated the work of God even in his time. Yet, Douglass found strength in that God. I think the quality I enjoyed most about this book is the fact that Douglass does not see himself as a hero, but as an average slave. This is not a typical characteristic of an autobiography.

Written by Himself","review":"In Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, the author states: &quot;You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man.&quot; Frederick Douglass is a thoughtful man of great integrity, who through his soul-wrenching writing, details the story of his life as a slave. As we read the story, we witness horrendous actions that contribute to the building up of a slave; actions that literally define who a slave is. Douglass has a strong ability to transfer the reader to the very place and time of each event he lives. Throughout the book he shares his most personal thoughts on religion, family, music, education, and more. Some of his words are harsh, yet they are reflections of truth - a testimony of America at its worst. Narrative of the life Of Frederick Douglass is a wonderful educational and historical work that enables people to witness this time in history. The writing style is simple and beautiful. I feel it could be read to children on about a 6th grade reading level for an initial introduction to slavery, or could be studied by one with the highest intellect. I am confident that those who experience this story will have a deeper understanding of what it meant to be and American slave in the eary 1800's, and a newfound respect for today's African American families, for surviving, and thriving in America."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"This is one of the most lucid, absorbing autobiographies I've read; that it has much to say about American history, specifically the institution of slavery, only adds to its luster. It is remarkable that someone born into slavery could learn to write as well as virtually any &quot;man of letters&quot; in his era. Despite Douglass' unhappy lot (or maybe because of it), he managed to acquire a great deal of insight into the people, white and black, around him. Douglass convincingly depicts how the institution of slavery damages both oppressed and oppressor--it dehumanizes the former and brings out the cruelest qualities of the latter. (A hundred years later, Martin Luther King would say much the same about the practice of segregration.) There is much anger in the Narrative--but also a wise and noble spirit. Compulsively readable, this book is still very much &quot;relevant&quot; today, and I can hardly imagine a time in which people will no longer wish to read it."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"I must confess I first picked up this biography last year as part of an assignment for my AP United States History class because of its relatively short length. What I found was a profound, thought-provoking narrative about Douglass' life as a slave. The language is not verbose but rather clear and cogent. I find that the phrase &quot;a must-read&quot; has become somewhat of a clich&eacute; when used today but this book is truly that in every sense. It is &quot;a must-read&quot; because it gives an idea of the horror it was to be a slave from someone with first-hand experience. Yet Douglass writes to educate, not to shock. It isn't necessary to have a special interest in slavery to appreciate this book; rather one must have an interest in identity. Before you do anything else, read this book. It will change your perception of America's past and America's present."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"4.5 hoursNarrated by Jonathan ReeseFrederick Douglass wrote three autobiographies during his life. 'Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglas, an American Slave', written in 1845, is, perhaps, the most famous. The others were 'My Bondage and My Freedom' (1855) and 'Life and Times of Frederick Douglass' (1881, revised 1892).Written as a response to those that doubted that such an intelligent and well-spoken man could have ever been a slave, Narrative tells about the early life of Frederick Douglass (b. 1818 - d.1895), how he learned to read and write and how he acquired the skills necessary to escape and prosper in the North after he escaped.Douglass was a young man when this book was published (aged 27) so there is not a lot of detail about his life as a free man (with the caveat of being an escaped slave living the constant fear of being kidnapped and returned to slavery).Douglass spends considerable time detailing the degradations and brutalities of slave life - insufficient food, poor clothing, fear of being separated from family and friends. Random brutalities dumped upon the slaves fill the book and create an uncomfortable but necessary look at what was euphemistically called the peculiar institution.Understandably, the more education Douglass acquires, the more miserable he becomes. Douglass is especially intolerant of Christians who twist Christianity into contortions to justify slavery. His arguments thunder like an Old Testament prophet as he uses Christianity's own arguments, often straight from scripture, to demolish their positions.Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is not only an American classic, but is informative and entertainingly told.My copy of the audiobook came with an embedded e-book that contains the text of the book in PDF format."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"One of the fifth grade teachers at Braeburn Elementary in Houston once told us that \\"Slaveowners had to treat their slaves well in order to get them to work. Just like a horse. If you are cruel to a horse it won't do what you want.\\"This type of happy apologia for slavery was still alive and openly espoused in the Houston Independent School District in the 1970's, and done in front of white, black, Hispanic, and Asian children. Perhaps Mrs. Allen would have benefited from reading Frederick Douglass's autobiography. Perhaps not.Frederick Douglass's story proves the axiom that for every life ennobled by adversity and poverty, ten thousand others are ground up in misery and waste. Douglass achieved fame, literary recognition, and assumed the role as public conscience of America during its slaveholding epoch. Douglass famously reproached the president when he believed Lincoln had backed away from his commitment to end slavery, and boldly praised the 16th President when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation.Douglass's uncompromising hatred of slavery and his tireless efforts to lay bare its horrors make this book a bitter testimonial to the evils of human bondage as it was practiced in the South and condoned by the U.S. Constitution. Anyone alive today who doubts that he is an heir to the sins of slavery need only read this book.Douglass's autobiography takes particular care to describe the physical maiming that sadistic southerners inflicted on African Americans. The beatings, the hideous torture, the murder, and the rapine practiced by slaveholders are all held up in this book for readers to quail at and digest, if they can.If there is any lesson beyond the Lincolnesque conclusion \\"If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong,\\" Douglass's monumental work testifies to the boundless capacity for torture practiced by whites of European descent towards Africans. Immediately after reading this book I readKing Leopold's Ghostby Adam Hochschild, and was amazed at the continuity between Douglass's description of slavery and Hochschild's description of slaughter, oppression, and murder in the Belgian Congo.These two books should definitely be read in tandem; each acts as a historic bookend of sorts to the gruesome racial predations of their respective generations, footnoted with the few and feeble efforts of those who opposed acts that can only be described as the most depraved and unforgivable crimes against humanity."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"This is an absolutely amazing narrative, of the growth of an individual from the most brutish of slave lives to a free man who took pride in his work and his mind, which he then bent to political action. While told as a story, this book is actually an essay on personal struggle and development: to respect himself, to change his circumstances, to be re-born. At that, it is extremely powerful and moving. The reader empathizes completely with his rage, his awakening, and his striving to grow. He came to the point where he would rather fight back than die slowly, never to be dominated in his spirit.But it also points to the effect of slavery on their owners. While there are the standard cruel and selfish ones, who are attempting to \\"break\\" his spirit in order to domesticate him, the story of how it twists the souls of essentially good people that is the most interesting and shocking. It is like a sickness, their total and unresponsible power, that extingusihes their empathy and replaces it with the most horrible selfishness, as they debase themselves with cruelty. You get the whippings and routine humilations, but also what that does to the perpetrators. This means that the book never descends into stereotypes, but reads as an extremely fresh story by a thoughtful, indeed brilliant, man.THere are also many interesting asides, which are often philosophical. He points out the hypocrisy of southern christians, who make the worst and most cruel and self-righteous slavers, all while justifying their behavior by the bible. He also recounts how he expected that the \\"refinement\\" of the southern gentleman and their leisure would be impsooble in the North, which he pictured as poor as the non-slave holding population in the South - but he discovers an entirely different kind of economic life, in which men worked and prospered and deveoped themselves even more than what he had observed on plantations. But the most important thing is his recounting of his inner journey, which was encouraged by his learning to read as a way to overcome the ignorence that made for \\"contented slaves.\\"There is so much food for thought on the human spirit as well as wonder at how the US has evolved. Highest recommendation. If you like this, you should also read Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, by Harriat A. Jacobs."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"This nonfiction revels in importance simply because of its magnitude in not only the fight against slavery in the latter part of the 1800s (and the subsequent abolition), but also because of its brutal honesty for an individual who should be considered an ancestor of civil rights. Fredrick Douglass narrates in detail many of the terrors, horrors, and injustices that he and those around him had to endure during his years as a slave in Maryland. He describes the beatings, whippings, tortures and even deaths that he was close to and had no power to stop. He makes the point that slaveholders gained control over slaves by dehumanizing them, making them ignorant against their own accord, and ultimately having control over them. Frederick does everything in his power to negate this dehumanization, and begins to learn to read and write, but with more knowledge gained he has a stronger sense of loathing those who enslave him: \\"The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers. I could regard them in no better light than a band of successful robbers who had left their homes, and gone to Africa, and stolen us from our homes...\\"He should be considered a hero for standing up to hardships with little or no support on his side, and finding strength to get past these when he had seemingly had his spirit broken. One important moment is the incident with Edward Covey, the notorious \\"slave breaker\\", when rather than giving in, Frederick gets into a rather lengthy physical fight. From this time onward, Frederick is resolved to never let others get the best of him, try to force him to do anything against his will, without a fight. Later he resolves that when the right time comes, he will try to run from slavery and escape. When he is able to land in New York, a kind-hearted man, David Ruggles, comes to his aid and helps him get work.Historically, this is an important story for Americans to know. Douglass' account is a short narrative (a little over one hundred pages), and reads rather quickly, but in that short time he is able to illustrate just how degrading the issue of slavery had become. His autobiography shows the importance of change, the lows with which others sometimes subject each other to, and the essence of taking up a fight against injustices."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

The pain and frustration he felt will tear at your heart. Since we all look the same on the inside it amazes me that society could ever let this happen to anyone. The drama and plot are gripping and the vocabulary is first rate. His soul now rests above while this book serves to enlighten us all!"},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"Frederick Douglass's autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass has many lessons to teach the American public. The first we find in the portrayal of Douglass himself as the narrator and as the protagonist in the story. As the narrator Douglass seems sensible and balanced while as the protagonist of his story he often acts on emotion or gets caught up in a situation without seeing all sides of it. This is a perfect example of the hindsight that many people often experience. If the idea of this phenomenon was more widely understood and excepted, people may learn to take a step back, in turn avoiding a lot of obstacles in their lives. Douglass uses his narrative to poke fun at his retrospection, often exaggerating the naivete of his younger self. The second lesson is the ability to play devils advocate for yourself without having to agree with the opposing side. Throughout the narrative, as Douglass ages, we see him learn to accept both sides of his enslavement. While he doesn't agree with slavery, the rationality that he exhibits as the narrator of his story allows him to separate the people who are slaveholders from the foundation of slavery that grips them. If everyone could stop and take a moment to consider the factors that cause their opposition to make the decisions that they do, more peace in our society would be experienced. The final and most important lesson being that the true key to freedom is education. Douglass describes his first learning to read as a deterrent from future freedom, being that at that time all his reading was doing was educating him on the condition of enslavement. He learns however, over time, that his ability to read and understand provide him with the tools he needs to escape captivity and later with the knowledge and skill to address the nation. It is through this education that people can develop the ability to sympathize and live with one another regardless of race, gender, generation or any other dividing characteristic. Douglass's narrative sets an example for all that America should be; a nation of peace, understanding and the attempt, through education, for a total freedom."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"As you read Frederick Douglass' \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave\\" it is almost impossible to ignore that this man was not only brilliant but also had a warm wise heart.Some have said that this book is the most influential African-American book and I would have to agree that it surely is one of the top. There are many strengths to the book and I will mention a few:First, this is a first hand account of the practice of slavery from the perspective of the slave. Slavery was defended as a humane practice by the wealthy Southern upperclass and it takes first hand testimony, such as this book, to reveal the evils of slavery. Slavery was defended on the grounds that Negroes were intellectually inferior to Whites. The crisp beautiful writing of Douglass immediately calls this concept into question. Thus this book is testimony to the intellectual power of the writer and calls into question racist concepts around intellectual inferiority. Douglass identifies the incredible hypocracy of White Christians who worshiped God on Sunday and beat their slaves when they came home. Slaves were malnourished while White slave owners said grace over their fine tables of meat and vegetables. Many Whites claimed the Bible supported slavery by quoting the scripture: \\"He that knoweth his master's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.\\" (Luke 12:47) Douglass found that religious slaveholders were the most cruel. Slavery was sometimes defended as humane with the weak argument that since slaves were property that the slave owners would not hurt them and thus damage their property. How many of us have seen a young person destroy a car through wreckless disregard? The truth is that we don't really take care of our property and power over another person creates the potential for cruelty. Slaveholders were not held responsible for murdering or mutilating their slaves. In our current day and age this seems unbelievable but 140 years ago it was true. Because of his intelligence and determination, the young 16 year old Douglass was sent to a \\"slave breaker\\". These were lower class White farmers who were willing to manage an unruly slave for a period of time and then return them to the upperclass White plantation owner after they had been beaten and suppressed into submission. These sadistic poor White farmers could never afford a slave unless they obtained one on a temporary basis for purposes of \\"breaking\\" the spirit of the slave. This sadistic treatment did not break Douglass but strengthened his resolve and determination. The use of slave-breakers or sell of unruly slaves was common practice. Douglass reports that when asked slaves must report their masters as \\"kind\\" so to avoid beatings, sale to a slave-breaker, or loss and breakup of their slave family.Second, Douglass's sharp mind recognized the structural supports for slavery and the potential structural supports to change the inferior position of Negroes. He realized that priviledge and opportuntity were paramount to development for the Negro community.Throughout this review I will use the term \\"Negro\\" as compared to \\"African American\\" in an effort to keep this review consistent with the sense of time, place, and actual narrative of Douglass's book. Douglass does not use the more contemporary term \\"African American\\" in his text. Douglass recognized that it was in the best interests of the slave-owner to keep the slaves ignorant. He points out that slaves did not even know thier own age. Further, Douglass recognized that by not honoring family relationships for Negroes, weakened their social structure and allowed adolescent slaves to be traded or given away, never to be seen again by their parents. His pain is evident when he tells of his grandmother who saw many children and grandchildren sold with no information on where they were going or any information about whether the lived or died. Douglass relates that when slaves were too old to do any work, even take care of children or shell peas, they were taken to small huts in the woods and left alone. Thus they died by neglect at no additional expense to the slave owners.Third, Douglass's insight into slavery is comprehensive to the entire human race. He not only sees salvery as an evil practice against the Negroes but his wide intellect also determines that slavery is detrimental to the White race in that by debasing other humans, the Whites are also debased. By attribution of false inferiority to Negroes and false superiority to Whites, a clear and realistic vision of humanity is not obtained by either race. Douglass saw that the one who victimizes others is also a victim of an evil social system that destroys the souls of both the slaves and the masters. Ending slavery frees Whites from the oppressive role of master. This is an intellectual breakthrough of great magnitude. Douglass recognized that Negroes and Whites had much to gain by dialogue and relationship as equals and that freedom for slaves also meant freedom for masters.Fourth, Douglass addresses the incredible situation of slave children whose fathers are the masters of the plantations. The solution for this issue was that the children of female slaves were born slaves. Douglass found that the mixed race children were treated more harshly by White women, who saw Negroe women and their children as potential threats and current affronts.Fifth, Douglass also gives an account of the day to day life on the plantation where constant labor was required all day long with no medicine and rags for clothes. Douglass confronts those who think slave songs and singing are testimony to the benevolence of slavery. Rather, he sees the sad songs of the slaves as a spiritual release from the torments of the body and soul under this unfair institution. Slaves were fed cooked ground corn meal which was called 'mush' and he relates that since slaves often did not have spoons, they would eat with their hands or pieces of tree bark.Sixth, Douglass carefully tells the tale of his movement from slavery to freedom. This starts with the internal determination not to live your life as a slave. The first door was opened by his White mistress who indulged his quick mind by teaching him to read, an illegal act at the time.This powerful book is relatively short, perfect for high school students. In my opinion, it should be read by every high school senior, whether White or Black."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"As soon as I began reading this book, I knew it would have an effect on me. I found it captivating and disturbing from the beginning, allowing me a direct insight on slavery. By the second chapter, I became emotionally engulfed in the novel, feeling pain, frustration and anger as I read on. &lt;i&gt;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&lt;/i&gt; really fills in the gaps in African American education. Where statistics were once offered, this first hand account is much more believable, personalized, and very heartfelt.There are many valuable lessons to be learned from this book. The power of education and Douglass's determination to rise from being a slave made me very appreciative of what today's world offers, education wise and otherwise. After reading it, I felt a real need to grasp life and take every oppurtunity that comes along, really utilizing everything that I have been given. It also serves as a reminder of the horrific effects of discrimination, and the hideous nature of racism.It is also written very eloquently, so much so that if it were not for the subject matter, it would be easy to forget that this book was written by a man who had spent much of his life as a slave, deprived of an education.Overall an excellent book that provokes a very powerful emotional response. I reccomend it for anyone to read."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"What at first glance appears to be a gripping story of the evils of slavery and the excitement and thrill of the battle against and escape from those evils, on second glance reveals itself to be a deeply insightful look into the nature (and in some ways the meaning) of humanity. We see the cruelty, the evil, the jealousy, and the brutality and we see the dignity, the honor, the kindness, and the compassion of humanity. We see nearly all that we as humans are capable of and through reading this short narrative we may become aware of the fact that humanity is what we make of it and that inhumanity is not so different from humanity as we had wished.This book presents a great story that is interesting in and of itself, but it also presents lessons to be learned. Lessons made clear by experiences among the most horrifying in all of human history. Hopefully these lessons will be learned from the experiences of the past and not from new horrific experiences in our own time."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"In the classic slave narrative genre, Frederick Douglass' narrative of his life brings to life, in all its horrors, American slave society, and one slave's life-long protest against it.When we read Frederick Douglass in his own words, he is less the radical and more the reformer than we've been led to believe. He is also more the Christian statesmen and less the Christianity critic than we might imagine. Douglass' oft quoted comments about Christianity had much more to do with a righteous critique of distorted Christian living practiced by white masters than with any critique of Christianity or of Christ. In reality, Douglass, like so many enslaved African Americans before and after him, saw in Jesus a Savior they could identify with--a suffering Savior.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , Soul Physicians, and Spiritual Friends."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

To think any human being can reach such eloquence and pithy yet incisive prose, and remember some of this was delivered as speeches as well, by being self- taught is mind boggling and inspiring. While pointing out the injustice of slavery he can simultaneous express great love for our country and faith and longing for it to live up to the ideals we have professed from the Declaration of Independence onward. His writing and speeches are a triumph for humankind in general and for Americans especially."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Although, be warned, this is no substitute for the literature that Frederick Douglass wrote himself. This ebook provides a good, short synopsis of his life.

Enjoy everyone and thanks Amazon!"},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"They say that if you believe enough in something, and have enough persistence to see it through to the end, then regardless of the circumstances, it will be accomplished.I have a hard time indisputably believing this. However, after reading \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave,\\" it's tough to deny the plausibility of the above statement actually being true.To put it bluntly, Frederick Douglass had virtually zero chance to survive. He was intended to be a slave for life. Through a series of events, however, he came to the conclusion that by receiving an education, he may have a chance, albeit slim, to lead life as a free man.To achieve learning at all costs, Douglass made his way through various terrains, people and incidents, any of which could have ended his life, or at the very least, his crusade. Instead, he somehow managed to adapt and succeed at nearly every turn. And even when he was knocked down, he found a way to have the last laugh in the end.I could go into specific details, but in such a brief column, it would be impossible to do them justice. There are multiple reasons I would recommend this book. First, if you've ever felt as if you could not do something, you should put yourself in Douglass' shoes for an instant. You would be hard-pressed to be in a more difficult situation than he.Second, and most important, is the emphasis on education that Douglass cherished during his lifetime. Being able to grow through learning is such a critical item for every human being, yet many of us take it for granted, or even worse, have the notion that it really doesn't matter. It's not just about answering questions on a test or about a passing grade in school, though. What it's really about is reading or observing a person and/or a situation and understanding what is occurring.Once you start to collect the knowledge of the world around you, there's no limit as to what you can do. Frederick Douglass was an example of this, and to take him for anything less than an example of a great human being would be a completely injustice."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"If progress in human rights continues, and history offers no guarantees, then slavery will remain one of the USA's most nefarious legacies. Though no timeless ethical absolutes seem to exist, the statement \\"American slavery was wrong\\" feels beyond question. Unfortunately, the insatiable demand for cheap labor wreaks havoc even today. Witness \\"sweat shops\\" and the appalling treatment of some immigrant laborers. What strikes us as wrong about such exploitation is its fundamental drive to reduce human beings to mere \\"things.\\" 19th century slavery followed this ideology, though on an institutionalized and far more ghastly level. In 1845, Former Maryland slave Frederick Douglass eloquently described what it was like to have his dignity ripped out from the roots. This, his first autobiography, should stand as a permanent reminder of what exploitation does to the exploited and also to the exploiters. Nobody wins. And as exploitation continues at home and abroad, we find that Frederick Douglass still has much to teach us.This short book chronicles Douglass' murky birth (his father's identity remains a mystery) to his eventual escape to New York City. Graphic depictions of slavery fill each chapter. More than that, Douglass offers reflections on how such events shaped his self-image. These passages evoke slavery's psychological brutality. They also help the reader stand in Douglass' coarse linen shoes, which considerably adds to the work's persuasive power. One such climax arrives in Chapter X, where Douglass lashes back at the infamous \\"slave-breaker\\" Mr. Covey. \\"I did not hesitate to let it be known of me,\\" Douglass writes with evident fury, \\"that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping, must also succeed in killing me.\\" After one failed escape attempt, by the final chapter he finds his way to New York city. Since slavery was still very much a reality in 1845, he judiciously leaves out the details of his escape route. Then his fiance&eacute; appears as if out of nowhere, and with the help of abolitionists the newlyweds make their way to New Bedford. There he labors as a freeman until the anti-slavery movement appropriates him as one of their most eloquent spokespeople. Here he finally finds community and hope. The book's introduction outlines Douglass' life after 1845.Some of the most intriguing passages involve Douglass' reflections on the psychology of slavery. Keeping slaves busy, illiterate, full of self-reproach, and constantly on guard against physical punishment helped keep them in thier place. Not only that, Douglass describes his slave master's holiday tradition of forced drunkenness or surfeit to the point of sickness. He suggests that this sleight-of-hand attempted to give freedom an icky aftertaste. It was a trick. Give your slaves a taste of freedom (a week off) and make it the worst experience of their lives. Douglass even claims that, following such horrors, some slaves were almost relieved when they returned to their back breaking forced labor.Douglass ultimately escaped that hard labor, but he never forgot those he left behind. His back viciously scarred and his feet gashed from frost, he became a beacon for anti-slavery. This brief but passionately written autobiography will serve as a permanent reminder of just how horrible human beings can be to one another. Though its final chapter also relates some of humanity's good side. On both fronts, may this little book continue to inform the past as well as the future."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Written by Himself","review":"Frederick Douglass wrote this while still a relatively young man, recently escaped from slavery. He is extremely articulate; especially for someone self-educated. This is the story of his life as a slave up until the time he escaped and became an abolitionist. He later wrote a couple of other autobiographies, but this is the one that packs the most wallop.His observations of the degrading effects on slavery, both on the slaves and the owners were very fascinating. His description of the change he saw in one of his mistresses from a kindly new slaveholder to a typical cruel slave owner highlighted what evil an institution slavery is. It made me grateful not only that I'm not a slave, but more so not a slaveholder.It was also interesting to see how his religious masters were much crueler than the non-religious owners were. It shows how if a \\"moral\\" institution justifies an immoral practice, its practitioners lose all sense of guilt and act accordingly.The methods the owners used to keep the slaves ignorant and debased was another disgusting practice. It seemed to work at keeping them from revolt, but at what cost?I highly recommend this book for everyone. The lessons it teaches about human nature are things we all need to be reminded of."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"One would expect the autobiography of any individual to be bursting with emotion, heartfelt feelings coursing through the sentences, each word blaring the author's perspective on any institution baring his/her interest. Yet, the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass adheres not to the common stereotype of such work, relying heavily on statements of fact and observation, rather than personal standpoint and beliefs, to illuminate the cruelty and inhumanity which slavery imparts upon its host. The absence of these common aspects does not detract from the profound nature of his work, as the objectivity lends more credence to his argument in that it is not tainted by prejudice, hate, or anger. He simply describes the world as it was, not as he perceived it to be, recounting his journey from slave to freeman in a manner almost entirely numb, surprisingly detached.The strategic style employed in the narrative grants Douglass the ability to argue, in a sense, without arguing. By merely stating fact, through details both vivid and overwhelming, the Narrative of Frederick Douglass has become a powerful testament to the devastating brutality of slavery, displaying with an unconquerable clarity the evils prevalent in both the abhorrent institution and the society which promotes it, thereby educating a people bent on callousness and inspiring the suffering minority towards hope.The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass was fairly simple to read and thoroughly moving, as with each page my eyes grew wider and wider at the atrocities committed in the name of slavery. I am sure he must have acquired a modicum of animosity towards the slave owners, but is not present in the work and thus allows each word to ring true. In this, he is very similar to Virginia Woolf in her feminist essay, \\"A Room of One's Own.\\" She felt that when one is devoid of any prejudices or anger in their work, it calls for a greater, more powerful argument. Woolf strived to write her essay in the objective style employed by Douglass in his narrative. She wrote, \\"The woman who wrote those pages [of Jane Eyre] had more genius in her than Jane Austen; but if one reads them over and marks that jerk in them, that indignation, one sees that she will never get her genius expressed whole and entire . . . She will write in a rage where she should write calmly. She will write foolishly where she should write wisely. She will write of herself where she should write of her characters (ix).\\" The greatness of this work lies in the author's technique, his objective, thoughtful style, which remains honest and true when so much in the society he dwelled sprouted from lies."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

His life's story is one of the triumph of the human spirit in the midst of unspeakable inhumanity. His writing reveals a man of extraordinary intelligence and deep character. Beyond his importance as a historical figure, it is obvious he was, above all else, a good and decent man. Every American should know him."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"I took this book off the shelf and decided to read it again on July 4th. It seemed like a very appropriate book to read on this holiday. It serves as a reminder that at one time a large segment of our population could not celebrate their independence, nor share in the fruits of their labor.This book is a short book, but one that is very powerful nonetheless. Frederick Douglass taught himself how to read, and became an extremely gifted writer and orator. If his eloquent descriptions of the evils of slavery don't move the reader, then the reader probably lacks a soul.I was particularly struck by his statements that religious slaveholders were the cruelest slaveholders. He preferred to have a nonreligious master; simply because the chances were better that the nonreligious master would not be as cruel as the religious one. One of his masters, a Mr. Freeland, was not a religious man. This caused Frederick Douglass to have some hope. He says, \\"Another advantage I gained in my new master was, he made no pretensions to, or profession of, religion; and this, in my opinion, was truly a great advantage. I assert most unhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes,---a justifier of the most appalling barbarity,---a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds,---and a dark shelter under which the darkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protection. Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, next to that enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me.\\" I was struck with how he used religious terminology and imagery to portray just how evil southern Christianity was. However, it should not be assumed that he was anti-Christian. He believed in providence. In fact, the addendum he wrote clears up his views on the matter of religion.Every cruelty one can imagine is portrayed movingly in this book. His portrayal of how they treated his grandmother is very sad. I would say the cruelty that is portrayed in this book rivals anything I have ever read in books by Holocaust survivors. This is a book that should be read, not only for its eloquent crafting of the language, but for the lessons it holds for all who want to be better human beings. Frederick Douglass was a remarkable human being. Five stars all the way!"},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

I will never fully process all that he gives. To live the life he and so many others lived makes you realize how strange humanity is. The very darkest aspects of human nature can so easily be created and continue for years, decades, centuries, millenia.As important as his life and triumph, his writings open the strange suffering of being the slave owner. How odd it is to even type those two words. Words so weighted, but still words being at the same time blurred and blunted by time and usage.

There's a reason it's a classic. It is a great book, written at a time when even those opposed to slavery might doubt an African-American's ability to write clear and compelling prose, and when certainly in the south it was in slaveholders' interests to insist that they were subhuman and incapable of the kind of sensitivity and humanity that Douglass embodied.

Mr Frederick Douglass (1818-95) was the foremost African-American Ablitionist of the Antebellum period. Born a slave-for-life, he nonetheless, devised ingenious methods of learning to read. &quot;From that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom&quot; Mrs Auld had begun teaching him to read until Mr Auld forcefully explained the danger of teaching Douglass. Douglass continued unabated in his single-minded desire, unassisted. &quot;Though conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with high hope, and a fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read.&quot; Once his mind was freed, he set himself to free his physical body, escaping to Massachusetts where he became a dominant force in the abolitionists' crusade. This narrative was very popular. Within three years of its release in 1845, it had sold 11,000 copies, gone through nine English editions and had been translated into both French and Dutch. Not only was it a popular success, but critical response was overwhelmingly enthuastic, as well. Douglass went on to launch a journalistic career that would occupy the rest of his life. This is truly a great story about a great man who influenced the course of history. Furthermore, his words have caused me to rexamine my own behaviours and dispositions. This is the part of this book which I find so horrific. Some may not find it inconsistent and politically unjustifiable that this institutionalised genocide was accepted practice in the &quot;land of free, the home of the brave.&quot; That the same men who signed a &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; purgered themselves because they had no serious intention that &quot;all men were created equal&quot; or &quot;granted inalienable rights&quot; when many were slaveholders of the type and variety of those described in this narrative. How could it happen that otherwise law-abiding men and women (yes, Douglass tells us that the &quot;fairer&quot; sex was handy with whip and rod) murder, rape, and mutilate with impunity? Further that these same people considered themselves morally righteous, god-fearing and faithful to the teachings of the Christ, Jesus. Even more inconceivable is that their ministers were, not only supportive of this heinous crime, but also were participants as they themselves were slaveholders. These were not obscure local ministers, either, but organizations whose influence was national, both South and North. After describing these experiences, I cannot find fault in what Mr Douglass writes, &quot;I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one, for calling the religious of this land Christianity. I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels.&quot; Finally, what is most amazing to me in all of this is that Mr Douglass still holds to his faith, &quot;I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ.&quot; he proclaims. If Mr Douglass can live through slavery and still hold to his spiritual convictions, I am strengthed in my own spiritual relationship. His example has inspired me, and I hope that reading his book will inspire you. PEACE"},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Anytime somebody says that Affirmative Action is necessary because of past wrongs, I direct them to read this book. This man had the drive to learn to read in secret (at the age of 8) and ultimately escape to the free North to become an author. And his conditions were FAR worse than anybody's today! It's a very inspirational novel. It details the horrors of the slaves having to be split from their families and the hardships they had to endure.

I have heard it said by some white Southerners that slavery benefited the black population, and furthermore blacks were better off in the United States than in Africa. Slavery was evil and this book proves it.Douglass points out how slaveholders killed and mutilated their own slaves, and nobody did anything about it. When a slave outlived his/her usefulness, the slaveholder often cast them off, so they did not have to feed and clothe these slaves. Slave families were often broken up for the benefit of the slaveholder. Wives and husbands were separated. Slaves worked long hard days and then had to turn over their pay to their slaveholder. If slaves tried to educate themselves, the slaveholders would break up their classes and then punish those seeking the education. Same with those seeking comfort from the Holy Bible. Those slaves were punished.The question was did slavery benefit the black slave population of the South. The answer is a resounding NO. Douglass does a good job of detailing the hell of slavery."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"I am Alex, a student from Parkview High school. I read the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. It is the true story of a 19th century African-American slave who, against all odds, gained an education and sought his freedom.Frederick Douglass (1818-95) was the foremost African-American Abolitionist of the Antebellum period. In the Narrative, Douglass acts as both the narrator and the protagonist, and he appears quite different in these two roles. Douglass progresses from uneducated, oppressed slave to a political commentator. Douglass frequently compares the vast difference between his older, more experienced self, and his younger more ignorant self. One instance of this occurs when Douglass demonstrates how impressed he was with his reaction after being brought into the city of Annapolis and giving an idea to the reader of how little of the world he has seen.He told about his childhood, and what it was like to be a slave, he told about some of the brutal things he witnessed done by his master to older slaves. Frederick Douglass did not know too much of his mother and only recalls seeing her an estimated 10 times in his whole life.Born a slave-for-life, he nonetheless, devised ingenious methods of learning to read. His father was a white man and it was rumored that it was his first master, Captain Anthony. When he is young he gets moved to the \\"Great House Farm,\\" this is where Douglass experiences the harshness of slavery, always being cold and hungry.At the age of about 7 or 8 Douglass is moved to a new master in Baltimore. His new mistress in Baltimore treats him very well and starts to teach him how to read. When his master learns she is doing this, he rebukes and changes her into a different, crueler person. At first she treated Douglass as she supposed a human being ought to be treated, then Mr. Auld told her of the danger of educating a slave. Despite Mr. Auld's efforts, it was too late, Douglass was determined to learn to read. When Douglass becomes good at reading and gaining knowledge it started to bring him misery, he learns about liberty, justice and truth. He soon makes the decision that he will someday attempt to escape to freedom. Douglass also teaches himself to write, for who knows, he may write a book some day!After the death of his master, Captain Anthony, he eventually ends up living with Captain Thomas Auld. Life is more difficult for Douglass with Captain Auld. Captain Auld believes that Douglass was spoiled in the city life and this makes him even harder on Douglass. Captain Auld decides to send Douglass to Mr. Covey. The first six months here were the darkest days of his life. Here, Douglass is overworked and beaten regularly. Being sick of this cruel daily ritual, Douglass decides he will not be beaten without retaliation. The next time Captain Auld tries to beat him it turns into a two hour fight, and after that Captain Auld didn't beat Douglass again. After working with Captain Auld, Douglass is sent to work with Mr. Freeland, a fair, respectable master in Douglass's opinion.Douglass soon becomes restless, and he knows he is meant for more than being a slave. It is here that Douglass makes his escape to New York. Douglass struggles with having to leave his friends and loved ones in Baltimore. On September 3, 1838, Douglass succeeds in reaching New York, at last, a free man. The book closes with him marrying Anna Murray, a free black woman.I think this novel was very well written. It was very impressive how Douglass could write so well for not having a proper education, having had to teach himself everything that he knows. I am having a hard time thinking of anything bad or that did not work with this novel, it was very well written and fun to read. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants a good read. It gives a lot of insight to life as a slave and is not just a boring story of some guy's life, he lived a very interesting life and anyone could learn from his experiences."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"As the title implies, this short work is the narrative of Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave. He wrote it by himself, a significant fact in that his prose is so eloquent and his pathos so powerful that it seems impossible for a former slave to have composed it. In this short autobiography, Douglass recounts his life as a slave, and details some of the horrors and atrocities perpetuated on slaves by their fiendish overseers, most of whom Douglass portrays as downright evil. More than just a narrative of his life, Douglass also gives an account of how the desire to be free grew and began to burn within his bosom, and how he grew to hate that horrible institution. Above all, this is a story of a slave learning that he is, in fact, a human being.The significance of this book cannot be overestimated. In it, Douglass effectively dispels a number of popular myths about slaves and slaveholders, and forever changes the way the reader (especially one who lived while slavery still existed) looks at slavery. The theme of this book is very simple: slavery is wrong. It is evil, it is cruel, and, despite what many people thought at the time, the slaves know how cruel it is. Douglass cites several examples of the horrible treatment slaves received, one of them being separation of families. \\"It is a common custom...to part children from their mothers at a very early age\\" So it was with Douglass and his own mother.Douglass writes in a very eloquent style, and this contributes to the power of this work. Many people who thought blacks were inferior in intelligence were shown to be sadly mistaken with the coming of Frederick Douglass, a man both educated and refined. It may be said that the book is not entirely fair, for it is decidedly anti-slavery, but it is undoubtedly true for most cases nonetheless. Most of the overseers in Douglass's narrative are demonic and sadistic, but when a good overseer comes along (such as Freeland), he is fair in his treatment of him.One can imagine the fuel this book gave to the abolitionist fire, and it is not difficult to see why Douglass had such an impact on both North and South. This is, in my opinion, a definitive work, in that it shows the horrible institution of slavery in all its barbaric nature, and does it from a firsthand point of view, that of a former slave. This book was a tremendous contribution, both for the light it shed on slavery in general, and for proving that blacks were not intellectually inferior by nature, but instead were \\"transformed into...brute[s]\\" at the hands of their overseers.This is a great book, essential for anyone wanting to study the Civil War era or wanting to gain a firmer understanding of slavery."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Every chapter is full of compelling portraitsand memorable insights. He portrays the acts of violence committedagainst the slave population with graphic brutality; this is anunflinching record of human rights abuse.But the&quot;Narrative&quot; is more than just a cry against injustice. It isalso the story of an indomitable young man who defies a corrupt systemthat was meant to break his spirit. Douglass tells how he gains bothliteracy and the desire for freedom. This is an unforgettable story ofboth intellectual and political awakening. It is also a devastatingcritique of those who used the Bible and the Southern church as toolsfor the psychological terrorization of the slave population.As acollege teacher, I have often used this book in American literatureclasses.

Written by Himself","review":"I have been a huge admirer of Frederick Douglass for years. He was so obviously a genius of rare ability as shown by his writing and speeches. He was a huge influence on Abraham Lincoln who had never known any Blacks on a personal level but became an admirer of Douglass as he could relate to a man from poverty that used self-study and hard work (both mentally and physically) to elevate his station in life. He was even more impressed as he came to understand how much he had in common with Douglass but Douglass had to overcome being a slave and the rampant prejudice against blacks in the U.S.; even among abolitionists in the North. Reading his descriptions of his life, his thoughts and feelings and thinking upon his experiences draws the reader closer to understanding the travesty and inhumanity of slavery than any other text I have read. The editor has included additional material that illuminates the text of Douglass' narrative and enhances the readers comprehension of the nuances of meaning in Douglass' prose. The reasonable price and the excellent compilation make this a \\"must have\\" book for every American household.

Written by Himself","review":"I don't think I ever would have read this book if I did not have to teach it. I found it to be eloquent in both writing style as well as content. My 1968 Signet printing begins with a preface written in 1845 by William Lloyd Garrison. Written in the midst and passion of early abolitionism, Garrison's albeit well-meaning comments are much too preachy, long-winded and redundant; and could probably deter anyone from going on with the book. After a couple of pages of this preface, I put it aside and delved right into Douglass' narrative, and did not return to the preface until after I finished the book. Douglass, however, writes more like the early moderns than his 19th century contemporaries. Highly efficient in his syntax and word choice, he creates images and impressions in a sentence or two which are more powerful than what might take other authors 2 pages. While Douglass, in no uncertain terms, conveys the stark horrors of slavery, he never dwells on them. He r! ushes the narrative to the light at the end of the tunnel, his escape, where he and us both come to the harsh realization that escape to the North is not the end of his torments, but the beginning of new ones. I was most fascinated by the moment in time in which this piece was written. Douglass is not looking back and writing this as a free man in post Civil War America, but rather as an escaped fugitive slave in an America where slavery was still very much a fact of life and the Civil War was 2 decades away. This creates a distinct tone of panic and desperation throughout the narrative. In addition, in its brief 120 pages, Douglass uses this narrative to make several important points about slavery and life: slavery destroys the slave holder as well as the slave, no slaves does not equal a lack of prosperity for a country, the value of education is most appreciated by those who are denied it, and there is a vast difference between the &quot;Christianity of Christ&quot; an! d &quot;slaveholding religion.&quot;"},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

In the literature section, among the few stale, pseudo-classics, I found a book that I had never seen nor heard of before: &quot;The Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; by himself.You HAVE to read this book ... especially if you think you already know what slavery was about. It makes Roots look like a Disney special. It is a shocking portrayal of inhumanity.It's also very uplifting to see proof that a person raised in the most inhuman conditions and forcefully deprived of any education can turn around and be so intellegent and such an excellent writer. Accomplished through the shere will, desire to know the truth and determination to control his own destiny.He also provides some interesting views on organized Christianity in this country which is still applicable to this day.You can read it in a day or so ...

Written by Himself","review":"I read this book as a freshman in college and have often though about in the last 10 years. I believe it is the first written by a former slave in the U.S., and it clearly outlines the disputes surrounding the anti-slavery movement and the movement for the then status quo.Though slavery is long gone in the U.S., it is useful to reflect on the process that lasted for many centuries before it was successful. In his case, we see how his masters, who were often considered more benign than other masters, tried to prevent Frederick from learning how to read, arguing that reading was beyond their needs.Aside from the historical importance of this book, we also have a very interesting character in Frederick, as he is not resentful but rather fair and refined, which I believed added much to his reputation as a leader of the anti-slavery movement."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Written by Himself","review":"Few books of our time have ever had such an impact on the American abolitionist movement as this one. Even fewer books can say that they were written by a man of so many accomplishments. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave is a detailed description of the life of arguably the greatest abolitionist speaker to ever walk the planet. This book breaks down the entire life of Frederick Douglass in chronological order. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in learning more about the foundation that this country is built on, and who helped build it. This is truly a masterpiece and should be shared by all.The detail and thoroughness put into this book is amazing. Mr. Douglass never seems to skip a name, a date, or even the slightest detail of what might have gone on whilst being a slave. An example of this is when he explains how his mother used to visit him from another farm sometimes, a petty detail, but still included.A great feature about this book is how vivid and descriptive the vocabulary is. A prime example of this is this sentence alone: \\"It was a hot summer day, sun beating down, sweat dripping from hard-working slaves, the heartrending shrieks coming from the whipping post; it was all very common out here in the fields.\\"Another great feature about this book is that it told the truths about slavery and compromised many of the myths you hear today. One myth this book proved to be wrong is that all slave masters are evil and cold-hearted. In this book Mr. Douglass wrote of a compassionate mistress who taught him the basics of reading and writing.Overall, this one of the greatest Biographies of its kind, about one of the greatest men of his kind, and should be read and enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

While reading this book one understands that this is non-fiction and this really did happen. Douglass tells his experience as a slave and how he ran away from it. It is cruical that everyone reads this book so that no one forgets our past and to make sure we never repeat it.

I like this book because it gave me a picture what he was doing. It makes me Frederick Douglass instead of himself. When I read this book, it makes me feel like a slave. The sad part of this story is how the slaves were treated during that time. They were whipped, slashed, burned, and even killed by their masters. Comparing this book with &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, I like this book more. It is more exciting and very educational. It brings me to the life of the slaves in the past. The more I read it, the more I liked it. All the educational books I read in the past, I like this book the best.

Written by Himself","review":"\\"The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\\" was published in 1845; it is a story about Frederick Douglass' life as a slave, and his ambition to become a free man. He talks about how he was raised by and working for his owner without being able to see his mother as a child. His mother died when he was seven, but he never felt sorrow because his master would never let him spend time with his mother as a child. He does not know who his father is, but believes that his owner is his father because of rumors.Douglass' life got better when he moved to Baltimore because he had new owners, Mr. and Mrs. Auld. Mrs. Auld was the person who taught him how to read and write in English. At first she was very kind to Douglass and taught him different things, but later her husband forbid her to do anything to help a slave because they might take advantage of it. Later Mrs. Auld became cruel and started whipping Douglass. After his owners were brutally beating him every day, Douglass decided to end this and fought back, and eventually conquered himself. He was later transferred to a different place and became friends with other slaves, where he taught them how to read and write. In the end he lived happily with his fianc&eacute; and lived a better life.I liked this book because it showed me how it is possible to do anything you put your mind to. Douglass's main thing to do was find a better life and get away from the life of slavery, and he eventually did succeed. I liked how the author put almost all the details he could possible know about him: he told us everything he can remember about his life and how he went through a lot. Many of us cannot express how we were ever abused or harassed during our life journeys. The persuasive method that the author used was encouragement because he believed that you can be physically imprisoned but your mind and spirit can never be imprisoned.I highly recommend everyone to read this book because you will learn about the life of slavery and how humans were treated differently. It was really a fun book to read, and you will never regret how much you learn from the life of Frederick Douglass.Senior English Student 2011"},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"Douglass' narrative is typically assigned to high school and college classes to provide a more personal, emotional account of slavery that is not typically found in history books. While this is important, I believe reading this Narrative can provide more than an account of the brutalities of slavery (though it certainly does show the brutality). One quote I think encompasses the book: \\"You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man.\\" I look at this book as more of a character study for Douglass, how he remembers his life and chronicles the changes he goes through. It was also interesting to see how literacy changes not only his mind but his personality. Reading brings knowledge but also pain. If you've read Walter Ong's \\"Orality and Literacy\\" this becomes even more apparent and interesting.

Written by Himself","review":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass gives a vivid first-hand account of what nineteenth century slave life was like for one man. Unfortunately, abolitionist ideas and money steered that one man in the writing of his stories.Douglass, a slave born in Maryland in 1818, wrote the novel with publishing and publicizing support by white abolitionists in the years following his escape to freedom. First published in 1845, the novel was clearly produced with the hopes of gaining abolitionist support in a nation being torn apart by the issue of slavery.Knowing that these motives were behind Douglass' book, I'm led to mistrust the severity of some of Douglass' stories. Douglass tells many heart-wrenching tales about his days in slavery. His motherless childhood starts the narrative and is followed by numerous beatings and very long days of hard field work. He does counter these stories though, with stories highlighting a good side of slavery that abolitionists would not have wanted people in 1845 picturing. This allows Douglass' to regain some of his creditability.Douglass' motives for telling his story are obviously questionable, making his content questionable, yet his narrative stands with few others as a personally written account from a slave. Douglass shines light on many aspects of slavery that blacks hid from whites and the feelings that slaves felt it necessary to keep to themselves. This inside view makes Douglass' narrative even more valuable as a historical tool.The book is easy to read and understand, as well as being an interesting account. Taking into consideration Douglass' Abolitionist aims, his narrative still surfaces as a very valuable piece of history."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

Written by Himself","review":"Frederick Douglass was a major figure in the era leading up to the Civil War, and the furious debates raging about the nature and fate of the \\"peculiar institution\\" of slavery at the time. Born a slave, brutalized and beaten down for much of his early life, Douglass ran away, educated himself, and became a major voice and major celebrity within the abolitionist movement. Eloquent, dignified, and forceful, he was an important personality in the growth of the abolitionist movement, and someone in our history that everyone should know about. This book was a sensation in it's time, exposing to the general population what the real conditions of slavery were, and what they entailed. It turned thousands against slavery, and was an important influence on the opinions of many who were ambivalent.

What an inspiring story!"},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself","review":"Frederick Douglass's autobiography makes a powerful indictment of slavery. Slavery was a growing national controversy at the time the book was published, so it was both a narrative of a life and a contribution to ongoing debates.Douglass's autobiography shows how cruel the slaveholders could be. There are over a half dozen descriptions of whippings administered by slaveholders, often for some trivial infraction, and several examples of murder or manslaughter that went unpunished.The book also documents that the slaves have no recourse against this mistreatment. On several occasions, Douglass describes the turmoil caused by breaking up slave families, a routine occurrence if the owner decided to sell one or more of his slaves. In the case of one murder, committed in plain view of many slaves, the overseer who committed the murder was not even removed from his job. The slaveowner did ask the overseer why he had destroyed an article of property, but the overseer's answer (if the slave was permitted to get away with disobedience, no slaves would obey) was satisfactory. The slaves who observed the murder had no rights either to institute a lawsuit or to present testimony.Douglass also denounces what he considers the hypocrisy of Southern religion, stating: \\"I assert most unhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes - a justifier of the most appalling barbarity - a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds - and a dark shelter under which the darkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protection.\\" He provides numerous examples of supposedly religious people - even preachers - who are particularly cruel to their slaves.I have toured several plantation houses where the issue of slavery is discussed (including Carter Grove, Monticello, Mount Vernon, and Gunston Hall); virtually all of these tours stress that, while slavery was wrong, the slaves AT LEAST ON THIS PLANTATION were well fed and treated with respect by the master and his family. However, according to Douglass, while different slaveholders (and overseers) showed varying degrees of brutality, very few if any showed any humanity or decency.Jefferson and others of his generation considered slavery a necessary evil that future generations would hopefully have the wisdom to solve. But by the time Douglass's book was published, Southern slaveholders had developed an elaborate justification for the benefits and morality of slavery. This argument included the rationalization that: slavery was justified in the Bible; the Africans were an inherently low and degraded race, unfit for freedom or the rights of citizenship; and slavery was actually beneficial for the slaves, because (in contrast to \\"wage slaves\\" in the north) they were protected, sheltered, and well cared for by their benevolent masters.Douglass's autobiography provides an effective counter to these rationalizations. By showing that slaves love their families, feel pain, have desires, and yearn for freedom, Douglass rebuts the assertion that they are a \\"degraded\\" race. The slaves he describes show similar emotions to any other human being: happiness and sorrow, hunger and weariness, anxiety about separation from friends and family, desire for safety and security, etc.In addition, his descriptions of the brutality of life on a plantation rebut the slaveholders' claim that their slaves are happy and well-treated. His description of the slaveowners' \\"base ingratitude and fiendish barbarity\\" to his grandmother at the end of her days is an especially effective rebuttal of the claims of paternalism. Here was a slave who had \\"served my old master faithfully ... been the source of all his wealth ... rocked him in infancy ... and at his death wiped from his icy brow the cold death sweat and closed his eyes forever,\\" yet in her old age when she was unable to continue working, she was put out of the home and left to die alone, unable to care for herself.His descriptions of the behavior of slaves also make a powerful argument for the ability of humans to endure. Despite the degrading conditions he describes throughout the book (beatings, overwork, forced sex with the males of the household, poor food and shelter, etc.), the slaves show the will to survive, to be free, and, when given the opportunity, to learn. Additionally, despite numerous hardships (forced separation of families, lack of free time), he describes a number of occasions when slaves (including his own mother) went to considerable effort to be with their family members.The absurd views of loyal slaves and kindly masters in old movies like \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and \\"Birth of a Nation\\" are pretty well discredited. But the view that \\"slavery was, well, not exactly justifiable, but, you know, sort of ok and the slaves didn't really mind all that much\\" is surprisingly widespread. Go to any Civil War re-enactment or any Sons of Confederate Veterans meeting or \\"Southern Heritage\\" ball and you will hear that the slaves loved their masters so much that they enlisted in the Confederate army by the hundreds or thousands to defend THEIR country against the \\"Yankee invasion.\\" Until recently, many Virginia middle schools happily taught this to their students and apparently no middle school teacher noticed. Douglass's autobiography is a good antidote to this \\"Lost Cause\\" nonsense."},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave.

In essence, this is a remarkable and insightful compendium on Italian humanism; and it will be supremely beneficial to impressionistic students and accomplished scholars alike. The only fault to this volume is that it does not sufficiently handle northern humanism. True, it rightfully pays a particular respect to the grandiose surge of English poetry during the 16th-17th centuries. However, everyone knows that Northern Humanism was a far greater phenomenon than that, for it was a movement that touched every facet of European society and then molded it. So it is sad to say that these essays only offer minimal lip-service to northern enthusiasts like Erasmus, More, Colet, Melanchton, Rhenanus and Estiene, whose vision of humanitas was just as clear as Pico's, Petrarch's, or Valla's. Regardless of this, it may be estimated that the chairman, the committee and the worthy scholars who wrote, edited, and compiled these essays had viable reasons for leaving much of northern Europe's role in humanism untold, as it is a subject in itself that calls for a complete volume of its own."},{"Title":"Tales of India: Magical Adventures of Three Princes- Selected from the Mabharata","review":"I remember this book from my childhood.

At CNN and in her book, Lynne Russell has helped make professional journalism sexy to a new generation, male and female."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends, Kick Ass, and Influence People","review":"Lynne Russell teaches women that they can do anything.

It'll give you a kick start as well and keep you from holding down the lady in your life."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends, Kick Ass, and Influence People","review":"First of all, know that this is not exactly a &quot;self-help&quot; book, and Russell is not really attempting to provide an instruction for life when she offers advice; in fact, the title seems more of an ironic commentary on a life not lived by reading handbooks and following guidelines. That said, this can still be an inspiring read for women and a delight to men who are not afraid of independent, intelligent women. Those who know Russell as a talking head on TV may be taken aback by her off-camera persona, but that's what makes her unique: the woman who enunciates so well on CNN will be putting dents in a heavy bag with her bare feet and peppering her speech with the &quot;f&quot; word after hours. She won't pander to fragile egos: she calls 'em like she sees 'em because she's likely seem 'em all, more than once, as a journalist, a private investigator, and as a woman. No pretense or phony sentimentality like many of her male collagues, folks: this woman tells it like it is. Russell is a refreshing break from the utter pomposity of people like Ted Koppel and Tom Brokaw, and neither of those guys could kick your face in, either.

And can anyone, male or female, take seriously Russell's pigeonholing of personality types?

My travels in search of gustatory ecstacy have revealed many a depressing deficiency in American food, one of the most egregious of which is the state of this country's meats. Besides the much-publicized and lamented feed-lot economy that guarantees cheap and flavorless meat for all, we have forfeited the rich, varied, and highly-localized meat traditions of Europe. We have replaced flavor, texture, and local nuance with industrial products that satisfy the huge distributors but leave our tongues and bellies beggared. I am writing a series of reviews that laud a few recent books that do a great job in trying to rectify this impoverishment.Perhaps the most thorough and comprehensive of the bunch is Jane Grigson's. Over almost 350 dense, detailed pages she covers the hows and whys of charcuterie. Everything from tools and methods to the meat itself is presented in lucid prose, with a fine eye to determining what, exactly, the reader needs to know to make good meat products at home. Sausages of every kind and description, pates, terrines, puddings, saltings, fresh pork preparations, sauces, gallantines... the scope of this book approaches the scope of knowledge a Franch charcutier might possess. Few details escaped Grigson's attention, for her purpose was no humbler than to revive charcuterie in Britain. If she accomplished nothing more than to inspire Fergus Henderson to become the greatest meat-man of his generation, she should rest in peace.The book has many virtues, readability and enthusiasm not least among them. But its real gift is its comprehensiveness and its almost unique ability to guide the reader through unfamiliar territory. This is a real, fundamental, primary cookbook. Anything more basic would be a farming manual. Which brings me to the point I started to make at the beginning of this screed: our American meat situation is bad because we allow much too much mediation between live meat animals and what we put in our mouths. What Grigson proposes is a hands-on, direct, sensory, real involvement with the raw materials. This, as the great French and Italian food traditions demonstrate so unasailably, is fundamental to great food. When you give up the cheap pleasures of supermarket hamburger and try your hand at basic charcuterie, you will enter a world of memorable pleasures and perhaps rekindle that most basic human value: respect for the sources of what we eat.You may find my review of Fergus Henderson's The Whole Beast useful in your education as a carnivore.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery","review":"\`Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery' is the prominent 20th century English culinary writer, Jane Grigson's first book, first published in 1967. Like her last book, \`English Food' and unlike many of her intermediate books, this is a very scholarly book that may not have much appeal to the average amateur cook. It is much closer to a technical book on how to make and cook with forcemeats and cured pork products than a source for the home cook. As I will discuss later, that doesn't mean it has no value for the amateur cook, especially those for whom cooking has become a hobby or avocation.Grigson is one of the most prominent disciples of the great English culinary writer, Elizabeth David, who, through Grigson, Alan Davidson, Jill Norman, Claudia Roden and American, Richard Olney has influenced a large share of a generation of English language culinary writers and restaurateurs. David is a palpable presence throughout this book with references to her works and her London cookware shop sprinkled liberally throughout the text. In a sense, this book is an extension to David's own \`French Provincial Cooking', as Grigson picks up on one of the most important specialities of French home and commercial cooking.I sense an increased interest in \`charcuterie' throughout the American culinary reading public. Of course, the Food Network has not yet come out with a show on \`charcuterie' but I have seen on DVD an episode on sausage making done by Julia Child and at least two of Alton Brown's \`Good Eats' shows have been dedicated to these subjects. The most convincing evidence is the publication of the recent book, \`Charcuterie' by Michael Ruhlman and Brian Poleyn and certainly the easily satirized Emeril Lagasse exclamation that \`pork fat rules'. Although it sounds like a gimmick, it is certain, confirmed by millennia of practice, that pork fat (lard) is by far the most useful animal fat, far more useful than beef s suet, chicken fat, or lamb fat. It has the finest consistency and by far the best taste, as evidenced by the high value placed on bacon fat as a flavoring throughout the European cuisines, most especially in the cuisine of the southern United States. As Grigson so neatly summarizes at the end of her book, pork fat is to ambient temperature meat preservation what sugar and acid is to fruit and vegetable preservation (pickling and preserves).For those with no sense of what \`charcuterie' is, let me identify the most common examples. These are ham, breakfast sausage, \`Italian' sausage', meat loaf, pates, and scrapple. As this book includes recipes for things to do with \`charcuterie' products, I recommend this as a source of recipes for things to do with ham. Outside of the thousands of uses for the famous dried hams such as Italian procuitto, German Westphalian Ham, Spanish Serrano ham, and Bayonne hams, I am often at a loss when looking for something to do with a small ham dish for one or two people. I will also recommend this book to all those who are fond of brining techniques. I can't say this with any authority, but I suspect the current wisdom about brining springs from Grigson's writings, as interpreted by writers such as Shirley Corriher.Even if you have no intention whatsoever to invest in sausage making equipment or a grinder attachment to your Kitchen-aid, this is a great foodie read. And, that is not only for entertainment. The recipes for the dozens of sausages, pates, and other forcemeats can offer a wealth of ideas on making new stuffings for things like cabbage, peppers, and tomatoes.The only problem one may experience with the procedures in this book is with the scarcity of fat on our new pig. One can only gasp at the comparison between the average American pork chop and the richly fatted chop exhibited on an \`Oliver's Twist' show by Jamie Oliver, harvested from an artisinally raised porker in rural England.In many ways, this is actually a better book than the much more recent Ruhlman / Poleyn book, as it covers a much broader range of procedures and recipes and takes a more critical attitude towards the subject. It is immensely reassuring to find an informed writer say that the Italian sausage, mortadella is really a bit on the bland side. And here, I thought my taste had not refined enough to appreciate this famous Italian product. And yet, for the casual reader, Ruhlman is probably a better choice as all his sources and references are modern, while Grigson often refers to sources which are nothing more than a find memory."},{"Title":"Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery","review":"This is not really a text on Charcuterie as the term has come to be used recently in America. It is a text about French Pig Cookery and here, Jane Grigson does an excellent job. To repeat, if you are looking for a text about making fresh sausages or salamis, look elsewhere (use \\"a pinch of Saltpeter\\" indeed)....However if you are looking for a book to learn how to make Pates, Galantines, Rillettes, etc. or a text on how to use feet, head, tripe, etc. you have found a great text. Sausages made entirely of tripe, who'd of thunk it? 10 different ways to prepare the head....Great stuff.This text will not work for you if you don't already know how to cook. Most of the recipes are a bit \\"loosey goosey\\" when it comes to precise measurements of ingredients and heat and cooking time...that said, most of these recipes will also work well within in wide parameters.Summary: If you want to learn ways to cook a pig that you've never thought of...or seen outside of Europe...this is a great book.

So what sells this book to me?...its no nonsense and thorough approach to traditional charcuterie. This not a book for the novice cook who just wants to dabble in French cookery. This is a book for real foodies/cooks/chefs who want the authentic pork product to cook real and ancient recipes from France. It is especially useful for people like me who live on the other side of the world (New Zealand in this case) who, without re-mortgaging the house, have no access to genuine French charcuterie.Also be warned that this is not modern, beautiful, trendy food. This is the real thing. Go buy a Gordon Ramsay book if you want pretty restaurant recipes. This is also not a book for the health conscious. We're talking about meat, fat, salt and saltpetre. But I just love it. Creating your own hams at home with love and care; with pork sourced from the best farms, you can prepare the most spectacular food. This is definitely my kind of book.

As a physician, I find it very difficult to discuss nutritional products with my patients. Not because I don't believe in supplementation, but because I don't trust many of the companies who make supplements. The PGN gives me all of the information I need to make an informed decision about what products to recommend to my patients. If there are warnings or interactions - it lists them, if I need to know what a specific herb or vitamin can be used for - I can find it in either the Quick Reference Guide, the Universal Index or the Glossary. This is the most informative product specific reference I have ever used. The reason for my 4 star rating is because I would like to see all the manufacturers of supplements in this book. But then again, if the companies that are in this book are the only ones that are making good products - then the book gets the full five stars."},{"Title":"Physicians' Guide to Nutriceuticals (1998 Edition)","review":"This book goes into detail about the applications of specific brand-name formulas.

This man is on a mission to help people, he is completely devoted. I learned more in ten minutes while speaking with him than I had over my 15 years of trying to understand how supplements are made and how to use them. His objective reasoning was refreshing.

We found this latter listing useful. Likewise, the Glossary contains concise descriptions of drugs, medical terms, and substances with some helpful comments regarding uses. Summary results of clinical studies are noted. The main portion of the book, however, consists primarily of a reprinting of manufacturers' statements of intended use, make-up of the substances and suggested doses, and puffery regarding the uniqueness of the product. The near universal warning that manufacturer statements have not been evaluated by the FDA do little to help (potential) consumers of these remedies and health aids. Because competing nutriceuticals (TM) contain such a wide and varying mix of ingredients, we were hoping to find extensive comments regarding possible interactions between them, guides to interpreting the various doses when stated in different units by various manufacturers, and expanded summaries of research findings so widely cited in the book. Nevertheless, the book is a useful adjunct to one's library.

The book's subtitle &quot;A New Culture for Corporate America&quot; is very apt - they're talking about nothing less than an entirely new way to think about life in our traditional organizations. If you're looking for a simplistic cookbook of new-age tips and tricks, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a book that requires some careful reading and thought, and is well worth it, get hold of a copy.

Herman and Gioia reflect on the subtle aspects of the lean organization which are often overlooked in many lean initiatives. &quot;Meaningful&quot; addresses the human conditions surrounding the removal of wasteful processes in the organization, options for a flexible workforce, and advice for management considering a move to lean processes. Also helpful to understand the emerging conditions important to the new workforce of the Generation NeXt, and how to keep those critical knowledge workers supportive in a lean organization."},{"Title":"Lean & Meaningful : A New Culture for Corporate America","review":"For a perspective that focuses entirely on the human components of organic companies, pick up Lean &amp; Meaningful: A New Culture for Corporate America (Oakhill Press, 1998) by Roger E.

Nowadays it most likely would be released under their paranormal line but that didn't exist when this romance originally came out. Recommended for people looking for a different twist than the usual boy meets girl plots that are more typical for these series romances."},{"Title":"You Again: Showcase (Harlequin Superromance No. 698)","review":"The Girl: Jessica Myles, a resident GP who is dedicated to her job because her family is filled with superstar doctors and she's pressured to keep up in the Whiz Kid department. She's intensely shy and still pining over her ex-husband, but in typical WASP fashion emotions are for little people and so she goes home every night to her adopted cat, Cattoo, and reads medical journals.The Guy: Sam Kirby, an absent-minded genius Nobel-winning scientist who runs a branch of the Human Genome Project (Remember when that was big? Ahhh, these nostalgic 90s reads...). While he's a big, strapping Texan who turns women to goo, he's never gotten over the divorce either and has shunned the girls in favor of work. He's also dedicated to his 1996-era Powerbook and is as obnoxious an Apple fanboy as those you find today. It's a breed that won't die out, unfortunately. They must procreate to keep the Air of Smug Superiority alive. ;-)The Setup: Jessica and Sam meet by chance at a convention and she runs off like a scalded cat. She also has had hinky feelings about her psychiatrist-colleague, Raye Talbot. Turns out the woman is an imposter, blackmailer and all around sociopath (this is all revealed early on) and decides to take Jessica out by setting her apartment ablaze. Jessica escapes with her cat, but in the leap to the nearby tree, her spirit channels into her cat while her coma-fied body gets carted off to the hospital. So, she's got quite a job ahead of her, because Sam? Not the brightest bulb in the lamp when it comes to seeing what's in front of his face that's not under a microscope.The Good Stuff: Even though the cat on the cover plainly seems horrified at what's going on behind her, and the expression clearly didn't bode well for what was contained inside, it wasn't a horrible book. The protagonists were very likable, even if Sam was as dumb as a bag of hammers. (\\"Drink wine given to me by a slinky woman who gives me very strange/weird feelings and whom the cat hates with a spitty, yawly hate? Sure! Guess I got drugged! Look at that, the apartment's filling with smoke. Whoopsie cuddles!\\")My Gripes: The first part of the story was real good and it had a mystery with Raye Talbot, but then....the cat-woman soul transference happened, of which there was no hint on the back cover. The moment it happened, I said out loud, \\"Oh come on! This is getting silly.\\" And it really dragged the story down, because the last 2/3rds of the book was Jessica inside the cat trying to get Sam to see her, and he bumbling around like a boob and talking to her like one would to a cat. The author was probably going for the idea of \\"what a man says when he thinks nobody's listening,\\" but it went on for far too long. Too much talking at one another and to themselves, with such minimal steps in progress that this Superromance ended up being Superfrustrating.Also frustrating was, towards the end, when Jessica-Cat has \\"proof\\" inside her kitty carrier for Sam to be wary of Raye, it's conveniently neglected so that Raye can show up and wreak her havoc. After going through all the trouble of printing stuff off the computer, I'd have latched my claws into it and dragged it out when Sam took me out of the carrier. Not...forget about it? That was a big, raging plothole that broke my reader axle as the author barged right along towards the conclusion.And boo to the author for having it seem like Cattoo died after Jessica rejoined her own body until almost the last sentence. Cheap ploy, Ms. Nicholson. Very cheap.Harlequin Check List:* Shy, insecure heroine who is post-divorce celibate* Rugged, catnippy hero who is post-divorce celibate* Sidekick, this time a cat* Evil woman (and I mean Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-vil!)* A humorous premise that might (or might not) work :-P* So many contrivances to keep the TA-DAH! moment from coming that you wanna rip your freakin' hair out"},{"Title":"You Again: Showcase (Harlequin Superromance No. 698)","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read.

Jessica, on the other hand, is so withdrawn and has so many hang-ups that its hard to sympathize with her at times. She is a really nice person inspite of a hard childhood, and she also has her reasons to run from Sam, but at the same time the villainess Raye has a lot more fire than her. Of course, the drawback to spicy Raye is that she's pure evil, but at least she could never be called a coward. &quot;You Again&quot; is still a charmer, especially once Jess becomes a black cat, but Nicholson's &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; is far better - I ADORE that book!

It's the only erotica anthology I've seen with personal ads (from Israel) that had me bursting out laughing. Some of the stories are not overtly sexy: one of my favorites, Leslea Newman's \\"The Babka Sisters,\\" features an elderly woman in a nursing home who narrates the tale of falling in love as a teenager, losing the one she loves, and then finding her again as a 50-something widow. It it not necessarily sexy, but it is a beautifully bittersweet story. And that is the Jewish condition: with joy sometimes comes sorrow and vice versa.

His book is about differential equations with discontinuous righthand sides; a subject that you will not find in regular text books on differential equations. Filippov starts the discution stablishing a new concept of what a solution is in the context of discontinuities and states the main theorems on existence and uniqueness of these solutions. This book requires from the reader a deep mathematical background. Topics such as nonlinear systems, bifurcation theory and differential inclusions are addressed. Despite the fact that this is a math book, it is a highly recomended fundamental reading for every control engineer interested in nonlinear systems, especially in sliding mode control. The only bad thing about this book is that almost all bibliographical references are in Russian."},{"Title":"Angels of Light","review":"My praise for this address book is that the spaces for writing in your contact's details are nice and roomy!

Wolff, a prize-winning art critic, is an artist as well as anart lecturer, writer and judge.Controversy could understandably be a synonym for modern art, especially abstractionist art. By 1950, abstractionism had become the dominant force in the art world, partly because of the influence of the likes of Peggy Guggenheim who had more money than taste, knowledge or morals. Guggenheim used her inexhaustible supply of money to promote artists whom she liked for personal reasons that had little to do with their talent or abilities -- at least artistic abilities. This influence led to prominence. Prominence led to contempt -- for traditionalists and those who dared to criticize abstract art.In this atmosphere of prejudice and suspicion strides Wolff with this collection of intelligent and witty articles. He is motivated, he tells us, by concern about the &quot;cavalier manner in which entire categories of artists were...not recognized as serious creative figures.&quot;&quot;To prefer one kind of art over another is one thing,&quot; Wolff writes, &quot;but then to condemn the rest is to make a mockery out of art.&quot;Artists essayed here are varied: from Munch, Mondrian, Roualt and Klee to Warhol, O'Keefe, Cezanne, Homer and Matisse. There's even an essay by Wolff on a charcoal by Wolff. MASKS is a passionate and learned voice expressing with a lyric charm a very personal and individual appreciation of an eclectic assortment of artistic works.Find a copy and put it in your permanent collection.

Legend Of The Twilight is in fact a sequal to .Hack//Sign, the RPG, and the underhyped OVA, Liminality, taking place four years after the apparant threat to the virtual world of \\"The World\\" has passed.Here, Shugo and his twin sister Rena have won the character avatars of original .hackers Kite and Black Rose, meaning that their online selves resemble those of the playable characters from the RPG, accept slightly younger looking. Once online, Shugo dies during a quest, but is brought back thanks to Aura, who is an AI that exists within The World's mainframe. She grants Shugo a bracelet which has the same abilities that Kite's did, accept this one can actually be seen as a real wearable item. This attracts the attention of a young rare itemhunter named Mirielle, who is really the 4-year old daughter of Mirelle who was one of the original .hackers too. They also befriend an American player named Hotaru, and Ouka, a female werewolf who fights barehanded. Shugo also attracts the attention of Balmung, who was a key player in the video games, but now is a system administrator for CC Corp who runs The World.Shugo later runs into Zefie, a young AI who turns out Aura's \\"daughter\\". Shugo and the others then set out to find a way of reuniting Zefie with her mother, despite that fact that Zefie is selfish, pushy, and clings to Shugo like a monkey. However, the Cobalt Knight Brigade, who are an official group of player thugs for CC Corp, like a Nazi version of the Crimson Knights, learn of Zefie's existance and plan to wipe her out. After capturing Shugo and his party, they lock them up. But Zefie's abilbity to manipulate the world Neo-style allows themto escape and seek out Aura.The manga follows a different approach than the anime based on it. In the .Hack//Legend TV series, Zefie isn't in it at all, and Shugo's party has to take on a sort of anit-Aura and her group of hacking followers from destroying The World. The manga goes on for two regular-sized volumes, and then one double-sizedthird volume complete with bonus chapters. Rei Izumi's artwork is great though and really brings the story to life, \\"offline\\". A for real fans who've played all four video games, and seen both prior anime series.

Book 1 is an excellent beginning and a very promising manga.Admittedly, this is one manga that probably shouldn't be read by anime's younger fans. It contains a good bit of language and sexual innuendo, so parents should probably refrain from letting their younger anime fanatics read this.Still, it's an awesome manga chronicling the lives of two players in a manga MMORPG called The World.

This first volume serves more to build the settings than to detail any hair-raising adventures. Most of their experiences seem to arise out of the interference of Balmung, who is now a system administrator. They are being tested to find out if they are more than simple players - a strange fate seems to dog their steps. But for now, the mood is mostly silly.To be honest, I found the manga a bit disappointing. Both the TV series and the OVA set are fairly intelligent stories - as much about the players and both their lives as they are about gaming in a virtual fantasy. The game itself is fairly straightforward, suitable for a wide range of ages. The manga, however, seem tuned to the younger end of the spectrum. The characters are depicted more as children than young adults. Their behavior is in much the same vain.It is probably unfair to expect all the parts of .hack to be written for the same audience, but the manga are shallower than I would have ever expected. Of course, the prevailing mood can change at any time, but so far the most dramatic moments seem to arise out of Shugu's defenses of Rena's virtual honor. And his outrage when she isn't all that thrilled with his efforts.Still, if you are a .hack junky you are going to want to have this. And it is neither expensive or offensive. Just another piece of .trivia ."},{"Title":".Hack: //Legend of the Twilight, Vol. 1","review":"I got no. 1,2,3 from the library.And on the front it says national best seller now yould you say that this manga dosent deserve that title.i mean like in every 30 pages they have a picture of rien or raien or how ever you spell her name!!naked with like a sword or hands covering her(>>>) O_O.and if its not her its some other girl.its a good fantasy and has good art though.if you like hack try zatch bell or naruto!!!! ^_^"},{"Title":".Hack: //Legend of the Twilight, Vol. 1","review":".Hack is the most awsome manga book I've ever read!

What happens 2, 14-year old twins named Shugo and Rena enter a game called the world where they meet a lot of interesting players and one Shugo already knew. they won the charecters the dot hackers kite and Black Rose [see .Hack Infection.] Anyway it's the best book I've ever read.

Now the real adventure will begin.The first volume is kind of slow, mostly dealing with the players and their interaction.

I read them as they came out, meaning I would read the first one and wait for the second to be released. I just recently finally got the third book and read it. The funny thing is, the whole time I was reading the third book and was almost finished with it, I did not realize that it was the last book in the series until I bothered to read the back.Honestly, this manga is not good. It's for younger kids. At too many points in the manga (especially the third book) they get way way way way waaaaaaaaaaay too mushy for me. \\"Oh yay! I love this game and all the friends I've made! Lets go adventure and be friends and frolic and\\" oh spare me!!!!I just don't understand why this manga was made. It was a waste. The story sounds interesting. It's similar to the other .hack stories you are familiar with. The thing that interested me was that this takes place after the main .hack storyline. Here you are revisiting the world years later and you get to see characters from the original story and how they have developed over the years.However, when it comes down to it, the story just ends way too quickly. By the end of the third book you think the story is finally about to reach its climax but then you find out that there is nothing beyond the third book and you realize that what you just thought was the rising action is now the resolution. The story was just not well told and very uninteresting. It had potential.This is NOT a must have, even for .hack fans. This story introduces nothing new to .hack. Younger fans may like it. That's the only thing I can recommend it for. Also be warned that there is some slight perversion, such as Reina being naked and covering herself with a large sword. There's no nudity and there is some cussing, but overall it's not a horrible manga for the younger audience.Overall, I'm displeased and pissed that I bought all three not realizing it ended at three. If I had known the story was going to end so abrubtly, I would have completely passed over this manga."},{"Title":".Hack: //Legend of the Twilight, Vol. 1","review":".hack//Legend of the Twilight, for those not in the know, is one piece of the vast multimedia puzzle that is the .hack// franchise and one that ties into several other of the pieces. But instead of focusing on the story, like several other reviewers have, my short discussion will be more about how Legend of the Twilight works as a comic.When I first read this book many years ago, it felt as if something was \\"off\\" about it and I could never put my finger on what it was. Revisiting it now, I realize that Legend of the Twilight (henceforth referred to as LotT) is a victim of bad comic design. The paneling can be chaotic at times and frequently seems awkwardly jammed together. A particular issue I noticed was the usage of using more panels to express an action or scene than were actually needed and I found myself restructuring pages in my head to flow better and more efficiently capitalize on the available space. Another particularly irksome thing I noticed were the massive white spaces that were so depressingly prevalent. Characters float in a white, insubstantial space void, with an occasional establishing shot to remind us that \\"oh, they're in a garden\\" or \\"oh, they're at a lake\\". Paired with the bad paneling, this often leads to the characters and maybe an item they're interacting with being literally the only things present in the page. (For examples of this see pages: 76, 96, 123, and many, many more.) Perhaps the most blatant example of this would be in \\"Login 5: Get Well Grunty\\" in which Shugo goes to an area called The Valley of Hades and runs off a cliff that pops up out of nowhere. Except for one panel prior to falling, there was no indication that this cliff was there or that he had an option of avoiding it.I feel these types of shortcomings are due to the issue of many mangaka not having much formal art training before entering the field. With Comptiq (the magazine in which it ran) updating monthly, there's no real reason that these flaws couldn't have been avoided with sufficient skill.That said, the story itself is fine. The World, the game that all the .hack// media take place in, lends for many different types of stories as there are many different types of players. Not everyone will be Tsukasa (.hack//Sign) and that's okay. It ties in to other installments within The World V1 canon, most notably the IMOQ games (the character models for the games' protagonists are recycled for Shugo and Rena's in-game designs) and the AI Buster novels (the appearance of Lycoris and several other characters in a later volume). Is it necessary to get the full .hack// story? No, certainly not. Most of the core stories are handled within the games, novels, and anime series. LotT is fluff, plain and simple, a way to get a little more extra mileage out of the .hack// experience. Might be good for readers in middle school, if their guardians don't mind the sometimes sexual humor."},{"Title":".Hack: //Legend of the Twilight, Vol. 1","review":".Hack://Legned of the Twilight Volume 1By: Tatsuya HamazakiThis manga is the story of Shugo and Rena, a brother and a sister who win a contest to receive the character avatars of two legendary fighters.

Unfortunately, this book is no doubt written from a christian point of view so if you don't know the mythology don't expect to get very far in understanding this book. In truth I found the book just to be a summary recap of the movie 'The Last Unicorn'. He didn't really answer any of my questions which had to do with recognizing and communicating with &quot;unicorns&quot;. He talks about how unicorns and lions will come together at the end of days to fight the &quot;evil&quot; dragons/red bull.

The Mission and Meaning of Unicorns.","review":"I bought this book, expecting a moderately good book, potentially New Age-ish, about a popular, beautiful cultural icon. Instead, I got a short (93 pages in large print), badly packaged summary of the film and book The Last Unicorn, with Bible verses and Scottish history tossed in. The author, Wilkinson, disrespectfully misuses Laurence Gardner's work, by taking Gardner's conjectures on Jewish and European history, treating them as fact, and then using them to prove his own point, without even mentioning Gardner's actual thesis. Wilkinson's views of non-Christian religions are bigoted, particularly his claim (in the author's foreword) that all &quot;truths,&quot; all inspiration, and all magic, in the end, *really* come from his Christian God, whether the person saying or hearing the &quot;truth&quot; believes it or not. There are numerous myths and concepts of Unicorns that are not biblical, or allegorical or suggestive of the Bible, and Wilkinson ignores them all.

We live in the 21st century and we're highly advanced in math, science, technology, the arts, psychology, etc. We don't need to fall back on medieval beliefs."},{"Title":"Are You a Unicorn? The Mission and Meaning of Unicorns.","review":"I would really only recommend this book to people that are really, really interested in unicorns or the idea of spiritually identifying with a non-human creature in some way. It's heavily Christian-based, which I see as unfortunate, because if those thoughts and quotes were combined with other mythological references to unicorns it would help broaden the concept of what a unicorn actually is and give you a more well-rounded picture. There are a lot of myths (even in Christian culture) that could have been put to use, I think.Also, the idea of what a unicorn is is vague; it's characterized here mainly as a person who is kind-hearted, shy, and naive. There's some discussion of descendents of Ephraim (referred to as unicorns in a Biblical quote) interbreeding with other people and thus spreading unicorns across the world, but elsewhere it seems that being a unicorn is completely spiritually-based (in which case I'm not sure why the interbreeding would matter...) I think describing a bit of what is meant by \\"being\\" a unicorn would help (is it a totem? a heavily influential archetype? a good-hearted person? someone that just likes unicorns a lot? someone with some sort of religious connections?) There's too much time spent quoting parts of the bible that, given the book's focus, would be better off summarized quickly and replaced by more information on different views (even within a Christian schema), information on unicorn myths, and an explanation of what a unicorn actually *is.* However, for someone that shares the viewpoint of the author the book might be uplifting. If you want something to make you feel joy and pride about being a unicorn (metaphorical or otherwise), then this might be enjoyable; if you want something truly informative or thought-provoking, go for some well-researched texts on unicorn myths, spiritual development, or archetypes."},{"Title":"Are You a Unicorn? The Mission and Meaning of Unicorns.","review":"I have to say that as someone who has long felt an inexplicable kinship with Unicorns, it was genuinely heart-stopping to find a book titled &quot;Are You A Unicorn?&quot; I thought that at last, someone would be able to explain this odd, intense, unceasing passion I have felt for these creatures of mythology- creatures I don't just recognize, but with which I identify to the point of believing I am in fact a Unicorn. Reading this book, however, was a crushing disappointment. I have NEVER believed that Unicorns stem from any type of religious tradition, Judeo-Christian or otherwise. It was almost insulting to read the author's very wide and ambiguous conjectures concerning the ties between Unicorn origins and Christianity. Unicorns have been around much longer than Christianity has- it is ridiculous to call Christians &quot;unicorns&quot; and Jews &quot;Lions&quot;. The book views itself on a quest to answer the questions Lady Amalthea posits in Peter S Beagle's The Last Unicorn, but doesn't come close to answering any of the questions- the book is far too preoccupied with generalizing and categorizing &quot;special&quot; people as Unicorns. Personally, while reading this book I felt as though author was insulting my intelligence, patting and prodding readers as though they didn't understand the special circumstances that come with being a Unicorn. The writing is amateurish and the analysis very shallow. This book is for the fool-hardy and insecure- if you really, truly love Unicorns- if each time you see one or think of one you know what it is like to be such a creature- you will not find much meaning or importance in what Mr. Wilkinson has cobbled together in this would-be Unicorn manual.

Those of you who are interested in the folklore and legend of the unicorn, I suggest you grace your eyes upon this work. The work explains what a unicorn is like, many emotions that are related to a unicorn personality, and that physical pang one gets as we adore these creatures. (Although never knowing exactly why they appeal to us so.) Many parts are &quot;written from a Judeo-Christian point-of-view&quot;, which should not be a reason for disregarding his work. I, myself, do not personally believe in the same religious views, however, I have been a unicorn lover all of my life, and I have found that this book has opened up new views to ponder on. It gives us historical information, as well as legendary wisdom which could engage your spirit, if you take the time to induldge your soul. It is a fairly short, but complete work, that will take you through a time portal and convey a beautiful look into one man's heart. Unicorns are glorious and fantastical creatures.

There is nothing wrong with that, per se, but it suffers mightily from the lack of polish that a good editor could have given it. The spelling and grammar could use a lot of work. The original illustrations are good, but they are overshadowed by the pictures which were obviously taken off of the internet (and some of them copyrighted, to boot!).The biggest problem from which this book suffers is poor research. The primary sources for this work appear to be the Bible, and the book &lt;I>The Last Unicorn&lt;/I>. Of the &lt;I>seven&lt;/I> references listed, three have very little to do with actual unicorns and one is an album of Scottish music! And there are no mention of some truly seminal books that should be required reading for any searching unicorn, like Odell Shepard's &lt;I>Lore of the Unicorn&lt;/I> and Ted Andrews' &lt;I>Treasures of the Unicorn&lt;/I>.On the whole, I am disappointed by yet another stereotypical book that relegates unicorns to some tenuous Christian symbol. A biblical perspective on the unicorn is all well and good, but some of the leaps of logic which this author takes are simply dizzying, and any reasonable scholar of the subject would have to disagree with his inference that the only true unicorn is a Judeo-Christian unicorn.In short, this book has limited value when compared with many others out there.

To the contrary, they have the strength of a heart that strives to be pure, weakness is in the perception of 'being alone'.

The Mission and Meaning of Unicorns.","review":"Ok, I have to say that once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. While there are some grammatical issues, one spelling error repeated a few times and an issue with some spacing, nobody should dwell on them. It is a great and insightful book.To those who say that the author is claiming that the only Unicorns in the world are Christians, you obviously missed part of the message of the book. While the book did quote the bible a lot, as a basis for where Unicorns came from, it is obvious to me that the author simply stated that Unicorns are kind, gentle and caring people who have an urge or will or drive, if you will to help others and to guide others. IN fact, in the second version of the book (the one I have) the author states several times that unicorns are non-denominational. That they are very spiritual beings but, it does not mean they have to be Christians or Jewish for that matter.Thirdly, as mis-stated in another review, the author does in no way try to link the Bible directly to The Last Unicorn at all. The Biblical chapters are completely separate from the ones on The Last Unicorn except for a single quote at the end of one of the chapters. The Biblical information is meant as a history of the origins of the Unicorn and to show that Christ was a unicorn. That is all.I think that this is probably one of the most insightful things I have ever read. It gives me an idea of where I truly came from and what I should be doing in life. Not as a career or anything, but just as a general mission in life. I now know, without a doubt that I am a Unicorn. And while I may be a Christian, I am very sure that not all Unicorns are. However, our mission is one in the same.If you feel sad or melencholy when you see an image of a unicorn. If you feel like you are Lady Amathia in The Last Unicorn when you read the book or see the movie. If you walk in the woods and expect to see a unicorn around the next tree or just feel like there is some part of you that you are missing. Then get and/or read this book. It will help you immensly.Chris"},{"Title":"Are You a Unicorn? The Mission and Meaning of Unicorns.","review":"Sorry to say I found this book poorly written and absolutely blasphemous. I think this was a poor attempt in connecting \\"The Last Unicorn\\" with the Bible. These books should never be used to support one another. And even so, the comparison and supports were weak. He would ask rhetorical questions and than not answer them very clearly; instead, he would throw some scripture down and move on. His independent explanations were very vague. The book tells us a 'Mission Statement' which to me is a mission statement that any individual can live out.Unicorn &#65533;souls&#65533; maybe contained in people, and I may very well be one of them. But the fact of the matter is that I am a human being, set on this Earth to be a human being (designated by God). If indeed, God wanted me to take on another form He/She would have done so. This life is a gift and to waste it on wondering what I should have been on this earth is just meaningless. I was granted freewill as was my &#65533;enemy&#65533;. Just because I choose to be a good person does not make me a unicorn and just because they choose to be a bad person does not make them a &#65533;dragon&#65533;.This is a work of a hopeless romantic that is playing into the emotions of other hopeless romantics. He is putting them (and his self) into the delusion that they were meant to be something else and were meant to be far more important than anyone else. The fact of the matter is we all ARE important in God&#65533;s eyes. Why make it anymore then it is? The book was saying: that \\"People who suspect that they are Unicorns are some sort of caretakers of mankind.\\" To ever consider one&#65533;s self in this manner is arrogant and egotistical.

Only then will we find the unicorn.&quot;This doesn't necessarily mean that we could find the actual creature, but rather we could find the unicorn inside ourselves. The word &quot;Unicorn&quot; could very well be the word of all words, a word that represents much more of what the human race could strive to become.&quot;Are You a Unicorn&quot; clearly shows us that we as humans, should not decide whether or not the unicorn exsisted, but rather remember what the unicorn stood for.

Of course, I am also a student of religions and could understand the position Roy was coming from. We've already discussed this topic about the religious slant. The knowledgable reader will note that Roy makes no excuses for this slant and does recognize it. He never claims this is the only way unicorns can be seen and is very open to the fact that other religions and cultural views incorporate unicorns. As a unicorn lover and a unicorn, I loved this book. While I may not have agreed personally with every theory, it certainly opened my mind to some possibilities, even just of how people of a Judeo-Christian background interpret unicorns in their lives. I never thought of myself as a unicorn before, but I agree with Roy that there are people of a certain nature which could be identified as human unicorns as we view unicorns. --An interesting thought is how this book reflects what society thinks of unicorns, the general agreement of people. Is it analogous with Roy's vision?--A wonderful thought provoking book, and the author is a great guy to talk to. If you disagree with some of his material, talk with him via email, he'd appreciate it. If you feel you are a unicorn, let him know.

I suppose it really says a lot when a person publishes his own book to get what he believes is an important message out in the world. The idea of people being unicorns is charming and provacative and certainly has been written before(I've read at least two). But then again so is the idea of humans becoming other animals(which has been going on for since who knows). One of the biggest problems I had was how it was explained how the Ephraimites were explained as unicorns. The scripture pointing this out said LIKE or AS the horns of unicorns, not ARE(but then again I don't know much about translating scripture). I also found the part about the re'em/monoceros contorversy to be a bit distracting from the real argument about the unicorn's validity in the Bible. Now I believe in the unicorn and that Jesus loves them(along with every other being in creation) but I'm not sure how the author felt he could proclaim that He is the father of unicorns.

It is written in Teddy's classic modest style (who else could float the Missouri during spring break up chasing criminals with guns and describe it with as much excitement as buttering toast).It also is a repeat of some of his earlier works as this seems to be a bit of transitional book of when he was about leaving the Elkhorn for the east.The Wilderness Hunter is more poetic and Hunting Trips of a Ranchman is a better read, but the history in this book of how Montana and the Dakotas were made safe by lynch justice makes this one interesting too.The sketches by Remington are wonderfully historic to study and add a great deal to this book.This book though is like all of Teddy's in settling down with a friend and always looking for his next book to find a campfire with him again.Thank God Mr. Roosevelt wrote so many wonderful books."},{"Title":"Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail","review":"Having misplaced my earlier printing of this book (by the University of Nebraska Press) I ordered the Kessinger Publishing, LLC release of this title, only to be terribly disappointed.

See my reviews. I like true stories about the Old West.I knew some of the famous Theodore Roosevelt's life but this book taught me much about his frontiersman/outdoor life and his being a hunting sportsman. The 187 page book read very well with no boring parts. I read it in 1 1/2 days. Some great B/W drawings and illustrations. A few were a little darker than I would of liked but still good. T Roosevelt was a very good writer and the reader has no problem following the descriptive flow of his writing.I target shoot but don't hunt. I don't put down hunters especially if they use their kills for food. Roosevelt was a very good descriptive writer about the outdoors he loved and hunting. He owned a ranch on both sides of the little Missouri River. A really nice place.We see the hardships he experienced in hot and cold weather. He only had very limited experiences with hostile Indians but had a few experiences with bad white men. A group stole his boat ( the only one on the little Missouri). The group of three is tracked down and captured. Also scenes of men shooting in saloons, etc. Theodore was deep in the tail end of the Wild West.What I really liked was his descriptions of the wild life he hunted, how he stalked them and the difficulties getting a shot. Some of the animals like the White Goat were quite rare. I was extremely interested in his hunting of antelope.We have a small ranch in Oklahoma and the Proghorn Antelope sometimes come right under the barbed wire fence to drink from a very small overflow pond from a holding tank from our windmill. I was sitting on a bench with my Remington 700 .308 with scope on a rest and pointed it at a beautiful Buck Pronghorn Antelope( the same kind of animal T Roosevelt describes in his book). I pulled the trigger on the unloaded rifle and said \\"Bang, if I wanted you I could have you. Too beautiful an animal INMO for me to kill. If I was desperate for food I would though.Back then in the mid to late 1800s in the mid west interior there were no supermarkets to get your hamburger. You got out and shot your game.This is a classic book by a really famous man and a great writer. The vast majority of the time Teddy killed for food while enjoying the sport of hunting. There were a few times in the book he shot a particular trophy just for the trophy. I wasn't too interested or thrilled about that.Anyone interested in the great outdoors of the Old West, great descriptive detail about many different kinds of wildlife, survival, Indians, outlaws/badmen,combating severe weather, ranching and sportsman/hunting will like this book. 4 stars"},{"Title":"Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail","review":"The reprint publisher appears to have simply photo-copied an original edition, upsizing it to a larger format.

Some dog eared pages but still a good buy,"},{"Title":"Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books which I also appreciate for its historical value, having been written by one of our greatest presidents, yet before he became a national political figure. Reading Roosevelt's own words is pure pleasure.Some people say the \\"Wild West\\" is simply a Hollywood concoction; that is never happened. It did happen--it just didn't last much longer than a decade. After the virtual eradication of the Indians and buffalo, they were replaced by cowboys and cattle. The cowboys were needed to keep the cattle together and steer them always toward fresh, safe grazing, away from other outfits, in a completely unfenced Western frontier. In only a few short years, however, the lands were claimed by wealthy cattlemen, fenced, and became ranches. The cattle could no longer wander off, and so really the cowboys became ranch hands, and the West began to lose it wildness.Roosevelt was there on the Great Plains directly after the Indians and buffalo were removed, and before the fencing was accomplished. He greatly admired, and perhaps romanticized the cowboy life, but he wrote a first-hand account of that life, persuading his friend the great Frederic Remington to accompany it with what have become many of our most-loved classic Western illustrations and paintings.The account of his venturing out into the Dakota winter to bring a band of common thieves to justice is rather mind-blowing, when you consider how our history would have been altered had he died during this escapade, which he easily could have.Roosevelt was also a keen observer of nature, which is actually what true sportsmanship is about. Seeing--for himself--wild animals and birds in their pristine natural habitats brought joy to his soul. Along with earning the respect of the cowboys he so admired, living the ranch life and riding the hunting trail also healed his heart--broken at the deaths of his wife and his mother--enabling him to go on and lead the United States into the 20th century with such foresight that it can truly be called The American Century."},{"Title":"Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail","review":"What a great book - too bad the reproduction in this hardcover is not so good.

Beyond being an intellectual and psychological mystery story, the book provides deep insight into the nature of the mind's responses to childhood trauma. Schatzman develops a simple, even elegant, approach and terminology (\\"transforms\\") for thinking about the symbolic distortions, including frank delusions, that can occur as a result of trauma. Perhaps I should put \\"delusions\\" in quotation marks because (in opposition to the widespread psychiatric notion that such delusions do not correspond to reality) Schatzman shows how they can reflect painful childhood realities in distorted but still highly accurate and meaningful ways. The book also has important implications for understanding religion and even certain philosophical ideas, which can reflect cultural patterns of childhood mistreatment, and Schatzman discusses some of these subjects, at the end of the book, in an extremely interesting and readable way. Until this book returns to print, therapists and students of trauma and also of religion should either obtain the book used or take a copy out of the library (and photocopy and bind it for reference!). It is essential reading on trauma, and psychology, and therapy, and the mind's capacity to symbolize, and religion. A masterpiece. [In this 2010 revision of an earlier review, I will add that I think the 3-star review posted here is entirely off base. Though Schatzman develops his ideas in the context of a specific historical moment, his ideas remain entirely valid and are useful for understanding a wide range of psychological phenomena.]"},{"Title":"Soul murder: persecution in the family","review":"The book compares the written teachings of Daniel Gottlieb Moritz Schreber (father) with the written record of Daniel Paul Schreber (son) of his (the son's) \\"explanation\\" of his mental illness in the 19th century. Evidently no previous comparison of the two men's writings has been done in any effort to understand the son's breakdown. The younger Schreber was a famous mental patient (because he had written about it) but even Freud neglected to investigate the effect that the father's teachings had on the son.The father wrote extensively about his theories of how to raise children so that they would be under the total control of the parents (which he thought would lead to improved children), but would not realize it. He evidently applied his teachings to his own children. One of the sons committed suicide, the other broke down mentally, but this fact had no apparent effect on the father's reputation as a leader in how to raise children. Hitler thought he was an authority for the German people to follow.The term \\"soul murder\\" is not a term invented by the author; it was actually used by the son in writing about his experience. He attributed the attempts to murder his soul to God (apparently being unable to attribute it to his own father).The father's methods were widely admired among many of the intellectual classes of Europe, and were imported in many respect into America and other countries, where their effects remain unto this day.

That both father and son were mad is not to be doubted. Nevertheless, the son's madness was informed by the demented twists and turns of his father's techniques, which involved such niceties as tying the tips of a child's hair to a neck brace so that the child was unable to lean his head in an \\"unhealthy and unbalanced\\" manner or turn away from his studies. He undoubtedly practiced his techniques upon his son. Both father and son surely were in part the inspiration for the horror movie \\"Peeping Tom\\" by Michael Powell. Mr. Schreber's obsessional ideas about balanced growth and control of the body would be best applied in the masochist's private parlor. Yet, his notions and devices were used religiously in Germany on the little boys and girls who grew up to become...Nazis. It is obscene that the book is out of print.

At least when someone is tying you to a bed you have some clue about what's being done to you. The Skinnerian punishments and rewards mixed in with talk about love and \\"doing this for your own good\\" can produce mindless followers, angry defiant individuals or a combination of both who never understand what's being done to them or who they are as they are being manipulated and controlled through the Behaviorist tricks of the trade.

Setting the play at Mount Holyoke College, Wasserstein focuses on six young women who are about to graduate and enter a world newly sensitized to feminist goals. Caught between traditional values of home and hearth, and rival goals of sexual liberation and personal liberation, these women are on the cusp of a whole new way of life. The play opens a few years after graduation as the women meet to reminisce about their lives in college, where \\"milk-and-crackers\\" teas and \\"gracious living\\" have dominated.The play is both sympathetic and satiric, as an Emily Dickinson-reading \\"housemother,\\" works to make these students into \\"ladies\\" while they explore options never before open to them. Discussions of Women's History courses, references to Father-Daughter Weekend, and interactions among the various women as they explore who they are and who they will become illustrate the changing values of the times. Rita is the dominant figure, a promiscuous and iconoclastic woman who wants to write the great American novel and who refuses to bend to convention.In contrast to her is Leilah, a shy student who avoids the spotlight and who plans to study anthropology in Iraq after graduation. Other characters include Kate, who plans to attend law school; Samantha, who is in love and believes her primary role is to be wife and mother; Holly Kaplan, who is not sure what she wants her role to be; and Muffet, who becomes \\"partly liberated\\" but has yet to define her ultimate goals. Throughout the play, a disembodied male voice narrates a promotional film for the college, illustrating the gap between what is real (as presented onstage) and what is ideal (as the college presents its PR).Wonderfully poignant pictures of the social, sexual, and personal conflicts faced by these bright students in 1970 evolve as the students fumblingly make the transition between traditional expectations and unlimited possibilities. The humor is broad but to the point, and anyone who attended a similar college in the 1970s will identify with the conflicts experienced by these \\"uncommon women\\" on the cusp of true \\"liberation.\\" Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Uncommon Women and Others.","review":"It was in wonderful condition and was exactly what I was looking for!

Great Feuds in Technology opens your eyes to how controversial credits for developing these and other technologies were in the past and how some of them have not been settled even today. It also tells about disputes, such as the long-lasting one that Henry Ford had over a patent on the automobile, that had an enormous effect on how the technology and industry developed. Another outcome could have made the world we live in today quite a different place. The book ranges from technologies that are now obsolete, such as the miners' safety lamp, through the electric power industry, television, and to the currently controversial topic of genetic engineering. I was sorry when I came to the end of it."},{"Title":"Great Feuds in Technology: Ten of the Liveliest Disputes Ever","review":"Enjoyable book about some topics of which I had little knowledge.

Would recommend the other titles in this series as well."},{"Title":"Great Feuds in Technology: Ten of the Liveliest Disputes Ever","review":"The book start from the Luddite and end into the current biotech world. There is a lesson that the author wanted to share in this book. That is the Luddite is not phoebe about technology. It is more about economy. The end of the chapter, chapter 10, however, has a deep meaning. It would, in my opinion, describe a true Luddite, phoebe about technology. The last chapter is about genetic modification.I really like reading from chapter 2 to 7, but I don't like the rest of the chapter. I plan at first to give this book a 5 star, then after reading half of chapter 9, I began to sense this book has a deep meaning about technology. I don't like a very sad ending. So I subtract another star after I find out that, in my opinion, the other really good chapter about technology invention, the telegraphy, the television and other great invention is used as a tool by the author to show the true but sad ending.I would still recommand that you buy and read this book."},{"Title":"The people that time forgot","review":"this is the second segment of edgar rice burroughs' &quot;land that time forgot&quot; trilogy and, in my opinion, the best of the three. ex-cowboy tom billings leads a rescue mission to save bowen tyler, the protagonist of the first novel of the series, &quot;the land that time forgot&quot;, and manages to have more trouble keeping his own hide intact than in finding his friend. remember, this was written about 1920, but the adventure holds up evev today. anyone not familiar with edgar rice burroughs, prepare for a treat!"},{"Title":"The people that time forgot","review":"The 2nd in the \\"Time Forgot\\" series.

He was fortunate to be released after seven months with the charges of heresy lifted and his head and limbs still intact.His 1564 wall map of the British Isles (included in his atlas) was the first detailed and accurate geographical picture of those islands -- and was used by a Scottish traitor to help France and Spain invade Britain and overthrow the Protestant Tudors. Mercator was one of the first mapmakers to cut up maps and bind them inside boards, later coining the term 'atlas' to refer to such collection of maps. One of the most revolutionary inventions in the history of cartography, Mercator's cylindrical world map projections (first used in 1569) enabled navigators to plot a long course in straight lines and has greatly influenced our image of the world to this very day.In 1967 an anonymous buyer purchased a large, tattered book of maps in a second-hand bookshop in Belgium and unknowingly brought to the present a long-lost atlas by this renowned 16th century cartographer. The Mercator Atlas of Europe: Facsimile of the Maps By Gerardus Mercator Contained In The Atlas Of Europe, Circa 1570-1572 is a beautiful book showcasing seventeen facsimile map prints (suitable for framing) and a large-format 96-page book with 100 illustrations (80 in color).

Its' writing is such that one cannot but feel that the author is truthfully sharing his observations. (Interestly, the preface is written by a gentleman who coroborates Mr. Hobson's observations, but who spends his time observing larger energetic beings.) The book transformed the way I look at the world. If these entities are in nature as purported (and after reading this book I beleive they are) it is nothing short of a revolution in the way we percieve the world. I highly recommend this easy to read, miraculous and consciousness expanding little book!"},{"Title":"Fairies at Work and Play (A Quest Book)","review":"This book is really a useful little handbook for anyone wanting insight into the deva realm. Fairies, gnomes, undines, sylphs and other nature spirits are described here in a convincing manner from actual attunement. This work of clairvoyant observation by the author led to his later work including the well-known \\"The Kingdom of the Gods\\" which is now a classic in this field.The carefully recorded observations by the author were all done in England in the early 1920s. There is homeliness about the way these stories are related. The author was deeply committed to learning about the ways of the small creatures. As far as freshness and authentic, clear observation I rate this small book alongside Dora van Gelder's very similar book written also in the 1920s. There are many books on nature spirits but few better than this for detail and understanding. I just wish it had colour pictures like \\"Kingdom of the Gods\\", as maybe then more folks would have found this book to appreciate it as I have."},{"Title":"Fairies at Work and Play (A Quest Book)","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the most extraordinary - and one of the most beautiful - books that I have ever read. A copy of it was presented by Jean Overton Fuller to Noor Inayat Khan, when she went on her fatal mission as a British SOE agent in France during WW2 (she was finally captured, brutalised, and shot by the Nazis). Its author, Geoffrey Hodson, was a Kabbalistically-trained psychic whose speciality was that of examining and describing nature spirits, i.e. the faery world. If it is fantasy, then one somehow has to account for its astonishingly detailed - and often exquisitely beautiful - description of elemental life, and it has an overwhelmingly convincing truth about its pages. Just ignore Leadbeater's introduction - he wouldn't have known a sylph if he fell over one - and treat yourself to a copy of this wonderful work.

I have been a graphics' specialist since the earliest days of my accounting curriculum major when I wanted to express the numbers as a pie and as a bar chart and had to labor for hours with marking pencils. rulers, and press-on type (not to mention calculators, allocation formulas and such). That was while as a high school student, I had a winning Science Fair project on the effect of heat and light on the eating characteristics of guppies--something that today, probably only a cat would appreciate.Yes, there are many reasons to present. And not all of us have the luxury of 30 years of desire and hard work to call upon when placed in the spot of having to do it quickly. So, that is the &quot;what&quot; of the author's book.The what this book is about is the hands-on experience of the author being made real in type. From the opening intro on the three key elements of all presentations being &quot;How the presentation is shown,&quot; &quot;How the presentation looks,&quot; and &quot;How the presentation reveals the content,&quot; the substance of the book is distilled.But the remarkableness of the book is the author's keen ability to delve into the matters that really matter.First up is the &quot;down-and-dirty doing of a presentation&quot; that is kept fast paced, clear and to the point (almost angelic and certainly worthy of a cat's meow}.The author cites his own &quot;Reilly's Laws&quot; on key issues. These issues (seldom referred to by most PowerPoint authors) are insightfully useful.A case in point is the instance of having to present on a screen (where people in the back of the room can only read the type that is 20 points and larger) and yet provide the material in printed form as well. One of Reilly's Laws state: &quot;Expect the worst, and you'll never be disappointed.&quot; Reilly explains, &quot;You have to execute this presentation anticipating the worst-case scenario.&quot; Continuing, &quot;Use nothing less than 20-point type.&quot; Reilly concludes, &quot;The reader of the screen version will be happy, and the reader of the paper version will be able to read it without glasses.&quot;The worst would be a screen version where the type is too small to be read by those in the back of the room.Communication is the operative issue. As Reilly notes, &quot;If the communication is not effective, it is a poor presentation no matter how fancy or cool the techniques are.&quot;And the doing of techniques are not overlooked (as is often the case in more than half of all presentations). Reilly covers the bases of scanning pictures, incorporating sounds and movie files as well as using tables, graphs and org charts. But not just by stating how to insert them as another kind of object. Reilly delves deeper into these objects to once again help the creator stop or foresee the glitches in what he/she is doing or would like to do.After all is stated, Brian Reilly has a vested interest beyond your purchase of his book.

Then the book was an assigned text for all students in English in New Zealand. The language and the concepts were then frankly beyond the comprehension of 15 year olds. As I grew older, I became aware of the position Kipling held in the Late Victorian era, and the period following the end of the First World War.I came to understand a little of what the British Empire meant in those times, and the great debt owed by the world to the British Army which subdued Iraq, Pakistan, and the Indian Continent for almost 200 years.Without the benefit of the bomb, with a tiny armed service, and a desire to provide fair and equitable government, the Raj governed fearlessly through the efforts of the thirds sons of many of the great English Families, while the fourth sons provided the humanity of the Church. Patterns we could well emulate again today!This was bread and butter to Kipling. In his early years as a huge supporter of the system, as a spiritualist after the death of his son in the First World War, and in his later years as the designer of the huge Military Cemetaries established in France and Belgium after the War to the Empire's dead, he truly became in his own words a \\"Builder of the Silent Cities\\".In 2006, the concepts of his writings are remote from many. In terms of the trials of people, and their attempts to rise over their circumstances through a sense of duty and moral propriety, Kipling's works are without peer. For those starting out to discover him, start with \\"Stalky and Company\\", and move to this book, and his other works as extended learning. I hope you come to love his simple characters as I have, and that your School System, and its weird sense of Boyhood Literature does not destroy the desire to read Kipling until your late 60'sThis book has brought great joy to someone in the prime of life, and brings back some important memories of Scouts, Church and Honour in a time when these are so sadly lacking."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"My copy has 36 stories, but Kipling's Plain Tales tells about life in British-occupied India from every imaginable angle. It's touching, it's funny, and at times it's unbelievably sad. Don't let the author put you off, this is a highly readable book. My personal favorites are &quot;Thrown Away&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot;, but be careful; they're sad."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"Rudyard Kipling writes concisely and with great insight on a wide range of issues. With each story only taking up a few pages the depth of characterisation is superb. 'The gate of one-hundred sorrows' is one of the finest short stories ever written."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"Here we have a compendium of forty-two brief (3-8 pages each) tales of Colonial life, and originally targeted for those already familiar with an existence in India. Most of these charming stories were originally published in the Lahore \\"Civil and Military Gazette\\" (1888) but Kipling subsequently revised the tales (1890, as \\"Plain Tales from the Hills\\"), injecting them with more of the details and flavours of India so that the folks back in England could cognitively read of the Empire in the East.Featured are highlights of the lives of the British soldiers in late 19th-Century (Colonial) India as well as those of their wives, lovers, Indian associates, and even their horses. Kipling punctuates levity and outrageous behavior with sorrow and humility. He knew quite truly that one cannot cast shadows without light.Kipling's writings are much akin to tales scribed by eastern European and Middle-Eastern Arab and Persian authors: ergo, he told each of his stories as the details entered his head with an eye to the journey rather than to the destination. Here you will find an odd mesh of the subtle wit of Anatole France (A Mummer's Tale / The Red Lily (The Irresistible Stories of Anatole France series, Vol. 6)) meshed with a Dostoyevsky-ish slant on man's dark side (The Brothers Karamazov.) These encounters are all quite savory and gratifying to the avid reader of classic literature.Various critics have remarked on Kipling's insensitivity toward foreign cultures but, given that he wrote these tales more than 100 years ago, I see this commentary as a revisionist posture -- Kipling's views on ethnicity were shared by most of the English peoples of his era.I should also mention that the insightful and informative introduction written in the Penguin softcover edition by David Trotter prepares one to great advantage in digesting Kipling.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"The stories are wonderful. I've read a decent amount of Kipling and am always pleased to find more of them. This particular collection contains a bunch of really charming tales that range from funny through tragic. These types of short stories remind me why I love Kipling so much. As with all Kipling, it's worth noting that he was a product of his time and some of his writing could be considered offensive to the modern reader.This particular Kindle version is quite good with proper formatting and few if any typos. My only complaint (and only reason that this lacks a full 5 stars) is the lack of hyper-links in the Table of Contents. This makes it very difficult to jump to specific short stories."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"I usually like Kipling, but couldn't get through this book. The stories I read were all about the vain and foolish goings-on of the British in colonial India, told with a more voyeuristic than satirical tone. Sort of like watching a trashy soap-opera set during the Raj. I've read many fine novels about colonial society (e.g. The Siege of Krishnapur, The Long Day Wanes) and found the depictions of stubborn provincial habits and cultural ignorance to be interesting, outrageous, and often amusing, but in Plain Tales from the Hills they just seem pathetic."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"Too many people, when reviewing Kipling, review what the they assume to be the man, not his work. It is fashionable to think of Kipling as a nasty imperialist bigot, and all then flows from that opinion. In the end, such exercises, while occasionally entertaining, are pointless.Kipling was an extremely gifted writer who contributed a great deal to the art of the short story and part of the joy of \\"Plain Tales from the Hills\\" is that we get to see him developing. In many ways, his work here is fresher than his later efforts and while less well formed, on the whole I personally prefer them.Kipling writes with a incisive grace not often met with anymore; his descriptions are economical, immediate, and gripping. His ability to forcefully convey a complex impression with a single, often understated, sentence is unmatched. Unlike so many modern authors - and especially those in what now passes for \\"literature\\" - Kipling's prose does not get in the way of the what he is trying to show us. He never labors to be \\"literary,\\" which is quite refreshing.His insights into the human condition are well worth reflecting on today and cover the full range from light humor to irony to deep pathos: \\"The Gate of the Hundred Sorrows\\" is a masterpiece. The world Kipling portrays in one in which people were not yet alienated from each other or their environment; it is a world without the comfortable cocoon that those who snipe at him today generally inhabit, and for some that is problematic, since Kipling does such a good job of presenting that world with it's complexities, contradictions, and \\"unthinkable\\" things that were then, taken mostly for granted.I highly recommend anyone interested in Kipling start here before moving on to his later work (although I also recommend reading these stories in conjunction with his \\"War Stories and Poems\\" which also includes some earlier work).As for why I give this collection four stars and not five, that's only because I think \\"Kim\\" is markedly better and deserves five stars, which inevitably takes \\"Plain Tales from the Hills\\" down a notch."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"I don't agree with the racist aspects of the book. However, when one considers the era in which the book was written, such views were commonplace and give us insight into colonial India."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"I believe Kipling was wildly popular in his day. This collection of stories about English life in India may have entranced the masses and sold a lot of newspapers in the first decade of the 20th century, but in the context of almost exactly a hundred years later, they have lost most of their shine. While Kipling might have been the foremost raconteur of British India, compared to great short story writers like Chekhov, de Maupassant, or Twain, he comes across today as coy and contrived. Certain phrases make their appearance in far too many of the tales, for example: \\"Once there was a....but that's another story.\\" Cute kids, the wisdom of animals, the wiles of the fair sex, the unfathomable nature of \\"natives\\", gruff officers, perfect ladies, the one-dimensional earthiness of the common soldier---these are stories filled with stereotypes. Kipling's stories may hold your interest for a short time and you can wonder at the change in taste that has occurred between 1907, when he published these, and today. In many tales, Kipling depicts the lifestyle among the higher echelons of the British Raj, but only through a veil of irony or humor. A regular topic is the struggle for social status among the British; efforts to short circuit the pecking order and reversals suffered thereby. People marrying \\"beneath them\\" or trying to marry \\"above them\\" are often found here. Though people still refer to Kipling as \\"a writer about India\\", it is still true that he wrote about his compatriots, not about India. The two or three tales with Indian characters who are anything other than servants lack any depth. Even the pathos-filled \\"Story of Muhammad Din\\", which shows understanding, ultimately deals with illness as something inevitable in India---there are no questions as to why death comes to small children so frequently. Overall, Kipling provides a certain local color to British literature of the late 19th and early 20th century, but cannot be regarded as a great British writer on the level of Maugham, Conrad, Lawrence, Forster or Greene because he lacks broader humanity, deep thought, and universal vision."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"A fine collection of extremely well-crafted stories.But these pages are crammed with racism, with remarks on the worthlessness of a native indian's life, their stupidity and their weakness.One of the stories starts with \\"we are a high-caste and enlightened race\\", any man who shows interest in the ways of life of the natives is ridiculed over pages and the only remark on the death of a native child is: \\"They have no stamina, these brats.\\"Well written, but disgusting."},{"Title":"Cartographies of Desire: Male-Male Sexuality in Japanese Discourse, 1600-1950","review":"Pflugfelder's book, the product of 20 years of research, provides a necessary foundation for students of Japanese history and sexology. What is much more, he resists reinforcing the kinds of master narratives that this kind of history usually inforces. \\"Homosexual,\\" for instance, becomes not an identity but a term situated in time and space with certain uses by and for certain people. His Foucauldian approach focuses mostly on shifts and resists any notion of progress. I think this book is important to students of History as a model for their own scholarship, not just as a substantial contribution to the more specific field of Japanese Studies."},{"Title":"Cartographies of Desire: Male-Male Sexuality in Japanese Discourse, 1600-1950","review":"It is very interesting to read a this kind of book for us Japanese. However, as far as I know, we don't have a religious prejudice to homosexuality at all, therefore it sounds a little bit strange that in Meiji-era the goverment of Japan made a \\"Sodomy Law\\" imitating the western countries (though directly from the Manchurian China/Qing)---- of course it was soon repealed.I prefer to read a book on male/male love of pre-Tokugawa period, since in those days, especially in Muromachi/Azuchi-Momoyama-period, male homoeroticism was most flourished and prosperous.And I also want to read about the history of male-love in Korea, Tibet and Southeastern Asia."},{"Title":"The tree of liberty","review":"Have owned this for over 40 years.

This collection of manifestos, Supreme Court decisions, congressional testimonies, speeches, articles, book excerpts, pastoral letters, interviews, song lyrics, memoirs, and poems reflects the vitality, diversity, and changing nature of religious belief and practice in American public and private life over the last half century. Encompassing a range of perspectives, this book illustrates the ways in which individuals from all along the religious and political spectrum have engaged religion and viewed it as a crucial aspect of society. The anthology begins with documents that reflect the close relationship of religion, especially mainline Protestantism, to essential ideas undergirding Cold War America. Covering both the center and the margins of American religious life, this volume devotes extended attention to how issues of politics, race, gender, and sexuality have influenced the religious mainstream. A series of documents reflects the role of religion and theology in the civil rights, feminist, and gay rights movements as well as in conservative responses. Issues regarding religion and contemporary American culture are explored in documents about the rise of the evangelical movement and the religious right; the impact of \\"new\\" (post-1965) immigrant communities on the religious landscape; the popularity of alternative, New Age, and non-Western beliefs; and the relationship between religion and popular culture. The editors conclude with selections exploring major themes of American religious life at the millennium, including both conservative and New Age millennialism, as well as excerpts that speculate on the future of religion in the United States."},{"Title":"Religion in America Since 1945","review":"This book has a lot of information that is important while looking at a history of America since 1945. This book describes in detail the events and movements that have taken place since 1945 and describe religions involvement and thoughts on the events and movements. What I found the most interesting about this book is it explains why religion is so important to America in every aspect. After reading this, it was hard for me to understand why religion has been left out of many history books, even though this book proves why religion is so important. I find it so interesting that state and church are supposed to be separate, but in America it is almost impossible to do. This book is great for people who want to show the importance of religion to America."},{"Title":"Religion in America Since 1945","review":"Patrick Allit gives a thorough history of the way that religion has taken place in The United States since the second world war. Allit divides the text into different eras such as by time and theme. He makes sure to include different perspectives as it does not simply address majority religion. People of different ranges of life are represented. Allit keeps different religions and ethnic groups in his history of religion.Through the text Allit traces a history of the American people. It is interesting to see a history of a people through their religious activities. Rather than watching political, social , and cultural history in a vacuum here we see the interaction of people and their religion. Another thing I liked is that it brings into focus people and events that normally are not present. Allit supports his story with a lot of evidence from different areas."},{"Title":"Assisted Living: Needs, Practices, and Policies in Residential Care for the Elderly","review":"This thoroughly researched, scholarly book is just as valuable to the consumer seeking to learn more about assisted living, as it is to healthcare professionals, students of gerontology, and policymakers. The authors have amassed a wealth of information concerning key issues in assisted living, including the evolution and future direction of long term care in the U.S., as well as policy and regulations across states.Each chapter is written by professionals who are experts in their field. I highly recommend Part II of the book, which focuses on assisted living in four specific states, illustrating the diverse nature of long-term care facilities. Topics such as physical environment, characteristics of residents, types of care provided, special concerns related to dementia, and financial issues are all explored in depth.As an eldercare executive who works with assisted living facilities across the country, I believe it is crucial for all of us to have a thorough knowledge base in order to make informed decisions about care for our loved ones."},{"Title":"Assisted Living: Needs, Practices, and Policies in Residential Care for the Elderly","review":"As a lay person anticipating residence in Assisted Living before all is said and done, I wanted to find out just what it is, how to evaluate it, and what pitfalls and protections await the residents. I had read Internet articles suggesting that there are problems with defining Assisted Living, that protection for residents varies from state to state, and that variations are great, even within states. Mr. Lawton's work, combined with B. Schwarz's Aging, Autonomy, and Architecture: Advances in Assisted Living, managed to provide me either with the answers or with an explanation of why there are still so many unanswered questions. Lawton's Needs, Practices and Policies in Residential Care for the Elderly presents the results of studies and investigations in a number of states, one a potential retirement destination of mine. Both volumes deal with the issue of \\"aging in place,\\" which turns out to be an urgently important concept to those whose needs might be better served by skilled care (nursing) but an often unwelcome practice to those residents not wishing to be surrounded by the very frail. What happens to those wishing to age in place but who are unable to do so without risk to themselves? What are the issues of liability, as regards the institution? Marketing departments promote the concept of living in a \\"homelike\\" atmosphere, but architectural design has traditionally been dictated, and often still is, by practical needs and has been patterned after a \\"medical\\" (hospital-like) model, as is the typical nursing home. In the nursing model, the lack of independence and the hospital-like appearance of the establishment apparently contribute to the depression and despair of many residents. What kinds of building styles lend themselves better to the creation of a more homelike atmosphere? Mr. Lawton's studies deal with most of these issues, and his conclusions tend to confirm the information of the other text. The difference? Mr. Lawton's work, as suggested, is based upon studies executed in several states. Mr. Schwarz has compiled a text containing a variety of articles by respected experts in the field from around the country. Both books are valuable because they arrive at many similar conclusions, using different approaches. Mr. Lawton's is a hardback text, perhaps one that more easily fits the bookshelf. But both are excellent, and both enabled me to have a well-informed interview with an assisted living administrator. The lay reader can appreciate these texts by reading attentively, and the elder care administrator will undoubtedly find well-documented discussion and many names familiar to those in the field -- features that would make this a worthwhile text in the office."},{"Title":"Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe","review":"Historian Benjamin Lieberman's \\"Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe\\", is the first, exhaustive account I have read on this hitherto relatively unknown aspect of modern European history; one which has regrettably played such a prominent role in reshaping the map of modern Europe. Lieberman demonstrates convincingly that both the Ottoman Turkish Armenian genocide of World War I and the Nazi Holocaust of the Jews in World War II can be seen as the most horrific manifestations of a long-term history of ethnic cleansing in Europe which started nearly 200 years ago and has continued to the present. Lieberman's riveting account begins with the Greek War of Independence (1821 - 1830), in which he notes - much to my own amazement - that there were substantial Turkish populations residing in Morea - better known both historically and today as the Peloponessus (Regrettably this is misspelled in Lieberman's book.) - who were driven out via massacres and the burning and looting of Morean towns and villages and were forced to flee to the Anatolian portion of the Turkish empire. Then he describes the bloody history of the Balkans in the latter half of the 19th Century and the first two decades of the 20th Century; the relatively recent ethnic cleansing in the Balkans since the early 1990s may be best understood by examining anew the Balkans' first wave of ethnic cleansing.Lieberman reminds us that substantial episodes of ethnic cleansing accompanied the rapid decline and fall of the Habsburg Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and especially, Ottoman Turkish empires immediately after World War I. Probably the best known example is the mass expulsion of Anatolian Greeks - which I might add is vividly recounted in an early chapter of fellow Brunonian Jeffrey Eugenides' bestselling novel \\"Middlesex\\" - by Turkish nationalist armies commanded by Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, but there were other, almost equally dramatic, episodes between the two world wars which involved mass deportations of German- and Polish-speaking peoples among others. The Holocaust is covered succinctly in the chapter entitled \\"There Was No One Left for Me\\", in which Lieberman reminds us of substantial support for the Nazi genocide against the Jews by Poles, Ukranians and others living in Nazi German-occupied terrorities. World War II's end was marked by yet another series of ethnic cleansings, which would remove finally Poland's resident German population, virtually all of the Soviet Union's German population, and the Ukraine's Polish population. He also treats the mass exodus of Arabs and Jews in the Middle East marking the birth of the nation state of Israel as yet another Ottoman legacy of ethnic cleansing, along with ethnic strife between Cypriot Greeks and Turks, before turning his attention once more to the Balkans in the 1990s. Without question, Lieberman's book is an important - indeed definitive - look at ethnic cleansing in shaping modern European history and is required reading for anyone interested in understanding the history of Central and Eastern Europe."},{"Title":"Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe","review":"Lieberman performs yeoman service in presenting many examples of genocide and ethnic cleansing in the twentiety century, but misses others, possibly from lack of space. This in an important book, although I wondered why the author dwelt so extensively on the details of many atrocities. I agree with almost all of the other reviewers, although I would emphasize that population displacement and genocide have been the norm in history rather than exceptions following wars between empires and nations. Conquerors generally have attempted to make their empires stronger by displacing troublesome peoples and controlling populations. It is only in modern times that these policies are seen to be heinous.Again and again the author seems surprised that ethnic cleansing has had grass-roots support or even origin. Perhaps he forgets the \\"Children Tax\\" placed on the Serbs by the Turks or that the Bosnian Muslims enjoyed a privileged status in the Ottoman Empire, particularly in comparison with Serbian Christians. In times of troubles or want, people always retrench on their family and others of their own nationality, race, religion, language and culture. Why is this surprising to an historian?The author also seems surprised that democracies have not been able to defeat the desire for ethnic cleansing in their citizens, but again, why is this surprising? Democracies are weaker than totalitarian regimes in controlling their citizens, and are more liable to fly apart on ethnic lines when under stress.The most disappointing part of the book was the conclusion. The author seems to take the naive position of assuming that all people can live in peace with each other in multi-ethnic societies in well-run democracies of the future. History provides no long term example of this except in very small countries (like Switzerland) where there is a great amount of local autonomy. The worst case of ethnic cleansing is probably yet to come when the United States is partitioned. No doubt it will be split during this century into at least five countries: Aztlan in the Southwest from Texas to California for Hispanics, Hawaii going to Japan, Southern Florida joining some Caribbean Confederation, Atlanta becoming the capital of a new African-American country, the Northeast becoming a secular, Euro-centric but multi-ethnic country containing most of the current country's Muslims, Jews and easily identified ethnic groups, and the heartland consolidating on its white Christian base. Some 150,000,000 people will have to relocate to bring this into effect.No doubt that many European countries will soon begin expelling troublesome elements of non-native ethnicity, religion or culture. As economies become increasingly strained during the twenty-first century Europe's nation-states will be forced to strengthen their national ethnic purity to survive times of trial and civil disorder.All this means that Lieberman's topic will become increasingly important in the years to come rather than a historical curiosity on what happened in the days before democracy took hold throughout the world. Democracy is a luxury enjoyed by nation-states, and with the U.S. becoming increasingly an empire with ever greater diversity, its days are numbered."},{"Title":"Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe","review":"It's surprising to note this is the first comprehensive history of ethnic cleansing in Europe to appear in print: surprising because you'd think by now there'd have been many works on the topic, since over the last two centuries ethnic cleansing has virtually changed empires and united or divided nations throughout the region. TERRIBLE FATE: ETHNIC CLEANSING IN THE MAKING OF MODERN EUROPE surveys the history and social impact of these events that murdered millions and forced migrations of survivors. From ancient to modern times, TERRIBLE FATE describes violent transformations which have impact and meaning into modern times. A 'must' for any who would understand both the face and the underlying tensions of modern Europe."},{"Title":"Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe","review":"Commenters before me said a lot of great things about this book.I will be critical.I am Ukrainian and I am well aware of the traumatic history my country and my people had. So it is no wonder I really wanted to see what part of the Ukrainian history made it to this book.Well, I must admit Ukrainians were mentioned many times. As pogrom-ready Cossacks and violent revengers of Poles. With not a single mentioning for what Ukrainians wanted to take revenge. No Pacifications mentioned at all.They are also vastly mentioned as anti-Semitic. The chapter on Ukraine dedicates 7 pages to Jewish pogroms during 1917-1919 all over the territory of Ukraine during the war some consider civilian, some consider Russian-Ukrainian. Half a page on pogroms by Makhno whose army had hundreds if not thousands of Jews in it. No mentioning of this.But about the Holodomor, a disaster that took lives of at least 5 million innocent people -- there is one line. Just one line. Who cares if Ukrainians were starved to death, or brought to Siberia in tens of thousands -- with no warm clothes and no food -- just like other peoples conisdered by Stalin to be traitors. He wanted to send all Ukrainians to Siberia like he did to Crimean Tatars -- the thing that stopped him was lack of cargo trains for this task.There is not a single mentioning of this in the book.UPA is traditionally presented as anti-Semitic and anti-Pole. With not a single word about numerous Jews who joined it during the war.No Ostarbeiters mentioned either. Neither one in every four of Belarussians killed during WW2, or one in every five Ukrainians.What this book also fails to do it to mention another people that was destroyed by Nazis to the scope comparable to Jews -- Roma, or Gypsy. Not. A. Single. Word.There are thousands of books on Jewish Holocaust. How many books on Roma Holocaust have you seen? Here on Amazon.com I found one.Well, that explains it, right?There are also several methodological issues I have with this book.I don't quite understand how Europeans are listed alongside with Jews, Poles, Ukrainian, Armenians.I also don't quite understand why Belarussians are mentioned as White Russians.And Kaunas is a Lithuanian name of the city, not Jewish, as surprisingly as it is.I also don't understand why the author who is obviously well-read in the issue never mentions that people who were hiding Jews on the occupied territories risked the lives of their entire families -- if caught they were executed together with Jewish people they were hiding.That places the situation in a somewhat different perspective, doesn't it?I really wonder if I myself, not a historian at all, found that many issues with the book -- how many of those would find specialists in the field?One last point -- before the WW2 there were _no_ Russians in Lviv. They did come in 1939. But this is a different story."},{"Title":"Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe","review":"This book provides an excellent history of ethnic conflict in modern Europe in a very readable, compelling form. It presents esential material for anyone wanting to gain an understanding of how Europe came to be the way it is today, and provides a context for ongoing ethnic conflicts from Cyprus to the Balkans to Chechnya.

Genocide is never pretty"},{"Title":"Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe","review":"This book chronicles the development of ethnic cleansing in Europe during the late 19th century and well into the 20th century. Even before the Treaty of Lausanne, which formally established ethnic cleansing as a national policy (as well as a foreign policy), numerous European nations were practicing it. One thing that is particularly bizarre is that many of the victims of ethnic cleansing were very loosely categorized as being members of a certain \\"foreign\\" ethnic group, even if they didn't particularly see themselves as such (i.e., the Pontic Greeks). Perhaps Professor Lieberman should have chronicled how these groups fared upon being \\"returned\\" to their \\"national homeland\\" (which many of them had never previously seen, let alone considered moving to). The book is well-written and balanced. Professor Lieberman includes horrifying eyewitness testimony of ethnic cleansing, making the book more persuasive. I would have liked Professor Lieberman to have also included the Indian partition and the expulsion of Jews from much of the Middle East during the 1940s and after (this is just a personal preference, and in no way takes away from this book)."},{"Title":"Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe","review":"Lieberman has done a good job of focusing this book on \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in modern Europe, as the title promises, based on historic fact and not wild speculation or political agendas as is found in many other books that deal with the issues. This is not an attempt to psychoanalyze entire populations, but it does give the reader some history and insight into ethnic rivalries and hostilities without excessive navel gazing on human nature.Not overly emotional about an emotional subject, but not so clinical as to be devoid of the kinds of human details that make for a compelling story. This book actually covers \\"modern Europe\\" going back to the early 1800's as nation states evolved from Empires which had been in existence for many centuries before such as the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian, and others. While the true numbers will never be known, it is easy to count up over 100,000,000 people who were killed, injured or dislocated in this short sliver of human experience in the name of nation-building or some other such movement.Especially good is Lieberman's treatment of the massive shifts in population which occurred after WW II, the redrawing of boundaries which resulted in even greater population shifts than occurred after WWI, and how \\"ethnic cleansing\\" is not really a modern-day phenomenon in the context of human interaction. While Lieberman does not get into the even more massive shifts in population which occurred when the British left India and Pakistan during the same time period, he does acknowledge that he has carved out only a part of the story, and is to be congratulated for making this slice of history very readable and educational for those who do not have much experience in this field. For those of you interested in this kind of history, this book is a far better read (and much cheaper) than most others such as Levene or Bloxham which covers an even smaller piece of this period and far better than Mann's ridiculous theories of how this all came about."},{"Title":"Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe","review":"The history of the modern world is partially one of ethnic-cleansing given the modern world's and especially Europe's interest in the nation-state. The advent of Wilsonian self determination and the nationalism of the 19th century led to the creation of homogenous nation states and the end of minorities. Many of these minorities were pushed back to their 'motherlands' and when there was no home country for them, such as the Jews, they were simply exterminated. This is an important contribution for it goes beyond the usual examination and looks into the topics of the Pontic Greeks, the Circassians, the Kurds, and other cases such as Cyprus and Iraq. Most importanlty it examines Eastern Europe between 1900 and 1945 and the fate of the Poles and Germans after the Second World War.There are several missing topics, the genocide and ethnic-cleansing of the Nestorian, Assyrian and Jacobite Christians in Turkey, Syria and Iraq is mostly ignored and this is unfortunate because these groups have never had any history examine them. But a book cannot be all things. Many of the stories are covered failry and there is only minor bias. The topic of the cleansing of the Jews of the Arab countries is included and that is an important topic, but as the book goes so far afield it is actually a history of ethnic-cleansing in Europe and the East.Seth J.

The Nathan Wallace MTS book (MFC and ATL) is a good companion to this one if you desire reinforcement, some wordier examples, and both ATL and MFC variations.Only caveat: One of the strengths of this book is its weakness. This book does not cover C++ programming language basics so if you can't read procedural code or understand objects in a general sense this could be a little steep.

Haslam has been toying with the affections of Elspeth the blonde beauty who is married to Flashman. Both Flashy and Elspeth are serial adulterers! Flash is jealous of Solomon! Harry loses a bet with Haslam which result in he, his wife Elspeth and his father in law (whom Flashman detests) to journey to Singapore where Haslam has a large estate. Their time spent on Haslam's lavish estate is described in detail with Fraser's pen describing the exotic sights and sounds of Malaysia.Part Two-Flashman is hit on the head and wakes up learning that Elspeth has been kidnapped by pirates. Haslam turns out to be a Muslim pirate who is in love with Elspeth. Haslam flees with Mrs. Flashman. Harry joins forces with Harry Brooke a British born aristocrat. Brooke, Flashman and a troop of soldiers seek to find Elspeth and defeat the Borneo pirates. Scenes in the jungles of Borneo are vividly described.

We learn of various tortures the horrible queen inflicts on both her enemies and subject. Harry and Elspeth (who being held captive ) manage to escape after a dangerous flight to the coast. The Flashmans are rescued by British and French naval personnel. The battle scenes are bloody and realistic.The novel is narrated in the first person by Flashman as in the other books in the series. However, in this novel we also are privy to the thoughts of Elspeth as we are allowed to read her diary. Elspeth is much more prim and proper than is Harry!I was unable to understand the pages devoted to the esoteric English game of cricket being a benighted American. Fraser delights in using slang when describing parts of the female anatomy. Some readers will find his use of the \\"N\\" word to be offensive.This is a good light novel of adventure managing to convey a good deal of information about life in 1844-45 during the Victorian era.

I always find myself Googling the characters and events in the books so I can learn more about them.

Flashman empowers me to run boring errands, endure dull political correctness and other mealy-mouthed characteristics of our era.

Along comes a swarthy Oxford type called Suleman who's on the hunt for Flashy's Elspeth, and before you know what's what we're boffing Lady What's-her-name and on a slow boat to Singapore to avoid the London bookies. Blink and you'll miss Flashy getting mugged by knife-wielding triads and Elspeth getting kidnapped by Suleman, who turns out to be an infamous pirate (but with Oxford manners). Then we're off to Borneo with the Royal Navy, fighting pirates and fornicating with their locals and eventually Flashy's reunited with Elspeth after months of enforced servicing of Queen Ranavalona in Madagascar, that nookie-loving despot who ruled by boiling her opponents and force-feeding them chicken bones and poison.

(One of history's truly insane individuals that I was not acquainted with until reading this book) This one, as might be expected, is just a mess. Flashman on the run from cricket gambling thugs (Don't ask.) ends up halfway around the world as his wife has become the prey of an infatuated pirate. Gone is the semblance of reality often found in the other Flashman novels, instead we find a half baked plot, that lacks the focus of the novels I've previously read. Even for Flashman fans, this one could be missed with no problem."},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"Flashman's Lady is yet another installment of the Flashman series. For those who are not aware, the Flashman series is about a mythical 19th century British soldier who, despite being a coward and a cad, finds himself on the winning end of some of the most historical battles/situations. The books succeed by being both well-researhed historical fiction and, well, comic novels. So how does Flashman's Lady hold up?Not so well I'm afraid. Flashman's Lady is really three separate novels. The first third is, inexplicably, a historical piece on cricket in the 1840s. The subject is completely out of context with the remaining two-thirds of the novel and, well, I found it to be only marginally interesting.The second third of the novel picks up nicely with a pirate adventure in Indonesia. Flashman's ditsy wife is kidnapped and, reluctantly, Harry Flashman runs to the rescue. Unfortunately the author doesn't do enough with this promising story. Flashman rescues his wife and soon finds himself back on the high seas.On to the last section of the novel, and Harry Flashman and his wife are captive in Madagascar. Madagascar in the early 19th century was rule by a tyrant queen that defies believe (..in terms of the atrocities she inflicts on her subjects). Naturally she can't help to fall in love (or at least 'in lust') with Harry. Silly, yet the Madagascar setting is most intriguing.Bottom line: three disjointed stories. Fortunately the last story is the most interesting. Too bad George MacDonald Fraser didn't choose to devote more on the latter two stories. So overall I consider Flashman's Lady something only a loyal Flashman fan would want to read."},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"The author brings several worlds to vivid life, in this novel that links several stories into a seamless whole. I personally think that Frasier missed his calling: he should have been a sportswriter. The cricket game, with poor idiot Elspeth as the prize, is told so well that I've re-read it several times. Each of the worlds he creates, Frasier fills with such colorful characters that they are three-dimensional. The cricket game brings us Deadlius Tighe, esq., a classic scoundrel; Singapore is personified in Catchick Moses; and British imperial/missionary zeal in James Brooke. (The depiction of Brooke inspired me to read everything that I could find on this fighting seaman and colonizer.) Best of all is a villan equal to Flashy himself: Sulemann Usman. The novel gives the reader the wide world, and does it in such a way as to make it seem real, as in the eyes of a 19th century mind. A keeper that brings genuine enjoyment with every re-reading. -Lloyd A. Conway"},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"Harry Flashman - despicable poltroon or modest unreliable narrator, depending on your literary whim - shows himself eclipsed by a bolder rogue and a genuine hero in the first half of this too-long novel. The bolder rogue kidnaps Harry's wife, and the genuine hero, the authentic White Rajah of Sarawak, rescues her... almost.By far the most entertaining portion of this sixth Flashman novel is the first quarter, which features a hilarious account of cricket as played in Jolly Old England in the middle of the 19th C. Harry, naturally, is a cricket phenom, whose skill is exceeded only by his skullduggery. Then Harry find himself once more en route to hellish adventures in the colonies. His travelogue description of Singapore is worth the price of a ticket there, and in Singapore, he encounters James Brooke, the White Rajah, the Hotspur character who overshadows him for another quarter of the text.The second half of the book is effectively another novel, one that seems thin and anticlimactic after the first. Harry gets himself imprisoned in the clutches of a madwoman-queen. Finally he escapes. Ho hum. But another side of our Flashman is revealed; he actually risks his skin to save his addlepated little wifey. How will we ever be certain again that he's as much of a coward as he boasts?Author GM Fraser introduces an innovation in this volume; part of the story is told by Mrs. Flashman, in the form of pages from her diary. She's not the narrator her husband is.Except for the cricket chapters, this is a less amusing Flash than the others I've read. If you're plowing your way through the life story of England's most meretricious hero, you have every right to skip an episode now and then.The more I think about it tonight, the more uncomfortable I find myself getting over the question of whether one should laugh or vomit at Harry's racism and sexism. I begin to think I'm obliged to do both, or else give the series up."},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"In the 1966 screen adaptation of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield) advises his daughter Meg (Susannah York):\\"If (God) suffers us to come to such a case that there is no escaping, then we may stand to our tackle as best we can. And, yes Meg, then we can clamor like champions, if we have the spittle for it. But it's God's part, not our own, to bring ourselves to such a pass. Our natural business lies in escaping.\\"One of the most endearing qualities of author George MacDonald Fraser's anti-heroic protagonist, Harry Flashman, is his natural cowardice, which he freely admits with a certain degree of pride. Flashy is an expert at escaping; More would have been impressed.In that volume of his memoirs entitled FLASHMAN'S LADY, Flashy is still young in the mid-1840s. His talent for a prudent and precipitous departure has yet to mature, as evidenced by his delayed response when beset by thugs in a dodgy section of Singapore:\\"I'm not proud of what happened in the next moment. Of course, I was very young and thoughtless, and my great days of instant flight and evasion were still ahead of me, but even so, with ... my native cowardice to boot, my reaction was inexcusable ... in my youthful folly and ignorance, I absolutely stood there gaping ...\\"The larger portion of this book's plot involves the kidnapping of Flashy's beautiful but scatterbrained wife, Elspeth, by a certain Don Solomon Haslam, a moneyed and mannered member of English high society who's not what he seems. Harry's determination to stay out of harm's way is severely taxed as he pursues Elspeth's rescue into the pirate-infested interior of Borneo, and later into Madagascar, where Flashy finds himself the slave of that island's mad and despotic queen, Ranavalona.A chief attraction of Fraser's Flashman series is the knowledge it gives the reader about historical and factual, but arcane, events and places. In FLASHMAN'S LADY, the reader is apprised of the private war against the pirates of the East Indies by the eccentric English imperialist, James Brooke, and the reign of terror perpetuated by that female Caligula of the period, Queen Ranavalona I of Madagascar. Indeed, the author's research into the latter has prompted me to place a non-fiction history of the subject on my Wish List.Deep down, I think, Flashy's personal appeal is based on the realization that he's Everyman, whether one would wish to admit it or not. Our natural preference is to escape, and it's only through blundering circumstance, good luck, or an odd quirk of fate that any one of us might, like Harry himself, be perceived a hero by our fellows."},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"Flashy - after, incidentally, pulling a hat trick on the three most celebrated cricketers of his time - accepts a &quot;friendly&quot; wager in a single-wicket match against Don Solomon, a foreign-born Eton-educated socialite. The tie score results in he and Elspeth accompanying Solomon on a cruise to the Far East, where Solomon's true colors are revealed, and he absconds with Elspeth. Flashman must fight, however unwillingly, to get her back - until they both end up in the hands of the bloodthirsty queen of Madagascar, Ranavalona I. This is a fine entry in the series, possibly a little more heavy on the humor this time around than the adventure. The first half of the book is all cricket and social intrigue; a more thorough look at Madagascar might have been in order, tho' perhaps Fraser was dealing with limited intelligence on that subject. Another minor quibble: At the book's opening, our hero is caught in a damned-if-he-does-damned-if-he-don't trap that pushed him again into adventure (lose the cricket match and see Elspeth go on a cruise with Solomon, or win and be beaten by crooked bookies?). And, as in Flash For Freedom, the dilemma that prompted him into action, when he returns (in that case, cheating at cards), is completely forgotten. I would have liked to see some closure in the matter of the threatening bookie, at least. All that aside, this is, of course, another witty, well-researched adventure. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"This is a deeply moral book in that for the first and last time the scrapes that Flashman gets into are the result of beastliness of someone other than himself. I hope that Mr. Fraser is as good a historian as he is a novelist, as most of my knowledge of Victorian history comes from his books. Particularly worth savouring are his narratives about the White Raja and Queen Ranavalona of Madagascar; splendid, gripping stuff and all the more memorable for the author's wonderful gift for character portrayal."},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"This is one of the best, and most underappreciated, book in the Flashman series. The two main criticisms are that the book is really three books and the beginning part is slow. However, many of the Flashman books have several parts. Flash for Freedom transitions from Africa to the United States. Only the first half of Flashman at the Charge deals with the Crimea. This book's transitions are logical.While the beginning is slow, it is informative on the British 19th century sporting scene. The cricket game is fun (and I know nothing about the sport). Flashman's welshing and wenching creates some suspense.Now that the book's drawbacks have been addressed, let's look at its advantages. To me this is the funniest book in the series, with all sorts of eccentric characters. The campaign with Brooke in Borneo is the best sustained action sequence. The escape from Madagascar is one of the best chases, only surpassed by the chase on the Jornada del Muerto (Redskins) and perhaps the escape in Russia (Charge). The ending at the beach is exciting, romantic, and funny.If you like the Flashman series you will definitely like this entry."},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"Our intrepid hero, Harry Flashman, is back for volume six of the Flashman Papers, a narrative of the life and times of one of the most ne'er-do-well wastrels to ever grace the pages of a published autobiography.Heretofore, the adventures of Flashman have been presented in chronological order. With this installment, however, a previous \\"gap\\", between the years 1842-1845 is \\"filled in\\" by the contents hereof, which consists of adventures in Borneo and Madagascar.As in the previous Flashman novels, our Harry is revealed as the premier coward and opportunist of his era; faults which he quite willingly admits and even boasts of. Much as a prior day Forrest Gump, he has a way of finding himself among the most powerful and famous personages of his era, as he takes part in the great events of the period.I was somewhat put off by the first 100 pages of this work, which dealt to a great degree with the sport of cricket. Only passingly familiar with the game, the blizzard of cricket terms and descriptions of cricket action left me at something of a loss. Much can be discerned through context, but some simply flew over my head. In any event, after the cricket action we're back to standard Flashman fare, as he undergoes numerous adventures in an attempt to rescue his silly wife, Elspeth, who has been kidnapped by pirates of the South China Sea with stops in Singapore, Borneo and Madagascar. He does so not so much as a result of the love he holds for his wife, as much as the embarrassment and ruin he would suffer should he fail to do so.Aside from uproarious fun and games, the Flashman series is set against historical events and actually serves as an educational experience. On to volume seven of the Flashman Papers."},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"Welcome to the sixth installment of the Flashman papers.To the uninitiated the cad and bounder from Tom Brown's School Days left several volumes worth of manuscripts detailing his adventures from when he left school.This volume starts with a chance meeting with Tom Brown who talks Flashy into playing a game of cricket for his old school. Of course Flashman ends up getting a hat trick at Lord's. But then gets into serious trouble with a bookmaker.The adventure continues when his wife gets kidnapped by a pirate and the story travels through Sarawak meeting James Brooke,the White Raja and onto Borneo and Madagascar. Most of the historical figures encountered actually existed.As with all the Flashman stories, historically they are very accurate apart from the hero himself who is entirely fictional.He managers to \\"roger\\" anything female he encounters and run away from anything that would require the slightest bit of courage. If you have ever wondered about where brothel cricket originated, you need look no further than here.All these stories are good fun and worth a read ideal for the plane trip or beach."},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"Another cracking adventure in the Flashman canon, this episode takes us from the cricket field at Lord's to colonial Singapore, the pirate nests of Borneo and the insanity of 19th-century Madagascar.As always, fate, and Flashman's attempts to suborn it in pursuit of cash, women and fame, lead him into hair-raising situations where death is an ever-present with disgrace not far behind. But Flashman is on supreme form this time around. Unusually, his wife Elspeth accompanies him on many of his adventures, and her presence allows a richer examination of Flashman's character, which proves to be less selfish and caddish than earlier episodes have led it to seem.As he finally escapes from the palace of the crazed Queen Ranavalona, pursued by her praetorian guard, with Elspeth at his side, adventure, action, affection and character are perfectly meshed to make this one of the very best of the high-quality Flashman canon."},{"Title":"Flashman's Lady","review":"Flashman's LadyThat I give Flashman's Lady only four stars is misleading as I am judging it against other books in the Flashman series and not on an absolute scale where it would deservedly receive a full five. Flashman's Lady is George Macdonald Fraser's sixth book in the series, but third chronologically as it fills in gaps from 1842 to 1846.Flashman's Lady includes three tales all centering to some degree around his beloved wife Elspeth (don't worry, that doesn't keep Flashy from straying). Flash first encounters Tom Brown in London, which leads to Flash's involvement in cricket matches involving some of the great names of the sport (or so I am informed). Elspeth attracts unwanted but not unwonted male attention (unwanted by Flash anyway) that leads to a cruise to Singapore where Elspeth is kidnapped. Flash follows the trail to Borneo with the great pirate fighter James Brooke, the White Raja of Sarawak. Harrowing battles on the Batang Lupar River leave Harry and Elspeth captive on board ship in the Indian Ocean. Harry \`escapes' into slavery and the not-so-tender mercies of Queen Ranavalona of Madagascar. The reader is treated to the oddities and savagery of that island; a land that is outwardly European-influenced, but Ranavalona has kicked out all whites. Ranavalona's portrayal is doubtless distorted by Harry's pro-imperial Victorian views, but it makes for fascinating fun. (Elspeth also lands there, but is mostly out of sight.)The book was edited by one of Elspeth's sisters, who kindly excised the swear words, but left in the blood and gore, all the naughty bits. It also contains brief notes from Elspeth's own journal.Flashman's Lady will not disappoint fans of Flashman (and if you have not read it, then go buy the originalFlashman: A Novel (Flashman)) and some will argue it's the best in the series. In my estimation, the book slips to four stars on the Flashman Scale only because adding the Madagascar adventure seems contrived. Ending the book with the adventures in Borneo would have been tidier. One speculates that Fraser wanted to write a tale involving Ranavalona, but lacked enough material for a full book. Too much Flashman, not much of a beef, is it? Let's hope the rumor that Fraser is working on another Flashman book proves true.The reader should also try out Fraser's McAuslan stories (McAuslan in the RoughorThe General Danced at Dawn) for a whimsical look at post-war life in a World War Two regiment of Scottish Highlanders.Note: Flashman's Lady ends with Flash being summoned to India where he gets thoroughly mixed up in the first Anglo-Sikh war, a story that is told inFlashman and the Mountain of Light (Flashman), the ninth book published in the series."},{"Title":"Dawn-Apocalypse Rising: Book 1 of The Windows of Heaven","review":"This book was very intriguing and exciting. I enjoyed every word of it. It really made Bible-times seem more personal and gave life to many of the characters in the Bible."},{"Title":"Dawn-Apocalypse Rising: Book 1 of The Windows of Heaven","review":"While the vocabulary KG Powderly invented for this series can be hard to get through in the beginning (the glossary in the back keeps you updated), you'll be glad you stuck with it. This is a classic fantasy, with well researched history/mythology. Once you've moved into the reality of this series, you'll want to read them all. And trust me, they get better with every novel in the series as you grow to know the characters and as the author moves more comfortably in his medium."},{"Title":"Dawn-Apocalypse Rising: Book 1 of The Windows of Heaven","review":"Overall, I was blown away by the depth and knowledge Powderly deployed in writing this novel. It reminded me of the Dune series and the Lord of the Rings, both in style, and in the detailed background those stories rely upon. It departs from those novels by setting the action here on Earth.One of the exciting parts of the book was that it took strange but true historical discoveries that don't mesh with the grand scheme set out by most historians, and uses these facts to create a very different ancient-world history. Spears and guns, Dinosaurs and ancient tanks--does that wet your appitite? It did mine.But this is only the backdrop.The story centers around one relativley young man (300 years old wasn't old in those days, or didn't you know?) and the weight placed upon him as the promised \\"Comforter\\". He is pitted against a ruthless land, where fallen angels and giants are consumed with power, and good men are becoming fewer and fewer.I recommend getting a copy of this book!"},{"Title":"Dawn-Apocalypse Rising: Book 1 of The Windows of Heaven","review":"I love this novel series, \\"The Windows of Heaven,\\" for many reasons, not the least of which is the quality of writing and the powerful storytelling. The author has created not just a believable world of engaging, varied and even fantastic characters, but has managed to \\"fill in\\" a quite brief biblical narrative of world development and subsequent destruction, starting in the sixth chapter of Genesis, with a richly imaginative account that entertains while challenging the modern mind to reconsider the \\"received\\" wisdom regarding human history and evolution.In this first book, \\"Dawn-Apocalypse Rising,\\" not only are we introduced to many of the characters that we will encounter throughout the series, but we are also ushered into a dynamic and challenging world where many forces, both human and otherwise, are at work to mold and shape not only the destiny of individuals but also that of the entire human race, and even the destiny of other beings, often with outcomes that are not always assured or obvious even though the storyline adheres to the essential elements of the biblical narrative in Genesis.Part of the other worldly, yet \\"so near,\\" picture the author has painted is due to a careful \\"transliteration\\" of many words and phrases into a form that evokes something that seems as though it should be familiar to us, but is just outside of our normal experience or memory. Examples are \\"A'Nu-Ahki\\" for Noah, \\"Atum-Ra\\" for Adam, \\"Ufratsi\\" for Euphrates and the list goes on. There are also many formulated, descriptive words the author originates or borrows from the fantasy/fiction lexicon that are used in place of our more common terms such as \\"quickfire\\" for electricity, \\"straticon\\" for general, \\"kapar\\" for bituminous cement, etc.The author has combined yet carefully balanced such literary elements as fast action, romance, mystery, tragedy, religion, politics and conflicts between world views into a gripping and challenging narrative. The author's literary style is reminiscent of the best of classical science and fantasy fiction and evokes such luminaries as Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars series, C.S. Lewis' space trilogy and Ray Bradbury's many classics. To top it off there is a majestic sweep to the story and the narrative accounts and yet the author superbly crafts both fine descriptive details and wonderful word pictures that add depth and makes the reading a delight from beginning to end.For this reader, \\"The Windows of Heaven,\\" is one of the most delightful and engaging works of fiction I have ever read."},{"Title":"Dawn-Apocalypse Rising: Book 1 of The Windows of Heaven","review":"K.G. Powderly's &quot;Dawn Apocalypse Rising&quot; is one of the few novels concerning the Biblical antediluvian world, and it is most likely the best.

This is a must read."},{"Title":"Dawn-Apocalypse Rising: Book 1 of The Windows of Heaven","review":"We all know the story of Noah, right? Old white man with a long beard who built a cute little boat to save the elephants, just like the picture in our story Bible that Grandma used to read to us.If you would like to keep that view of the story, don't read this book. In Dawn Apocalypse Rising, we are introduced to the pre-flood world in way that few could ever imagine. A'Nu-Ahki is the most compelling characters I have ever come across in a book, and his world is a world so unlike and yet like our own, that you cannot help but be captivated. With dragons and Titans and men who live for centuries, and so much more, I was not able to put this book down.I also adore Avarnon-Set, and if you want to find out why that makes me utterly wierd, you gotta read it.Anyway, be warned.

When he dies, apparently by suicide, his young wife comes from Australia to uncover the truth about the husband she barely knew.Jay (actually a pseudonym of Geraldine Halls) packs plenty of Conradian themes into this brooding slim tale. When Stella arrives from the mainland, she finds that every white person is either lying to her or on the verge of a mental breakdown. Gone from the protective cocoon that has shielded her for her entire life, she finds herself wholly capable and unafraid to journey to the heart of darkness, to the village that holds the secret of her husband's death.

Alfred Jobe had two moons in his.David Warwick is a distinguished anthropologist living in Marapai on New Guinea. He is in charge of protecting the natives from exploitation. His young wife is in Australia taking care of her invalid father. When Stella is told that her husband has committed suicide, she doesn't believe it and travels to Marapai to investigate for herself.At first, I wanted to slap Stella silly because she's exactly the type of woman who drives me nuts: \\"She had come here for comfort and peace, to be helped by her husband's friend, to be looked after, to be guided and directed as she had always been.\\" Stella is a young woman who's been convent-educated-- not because her family is Catholic, but because her father believed that this sort of education would make her more biddable and \\"womanly\\".

Once she had an idea in her head, she clung to it like a barnacle, and since she was so young and innocent, the men she was trying to deal with went out of their way to avoid scraping her off their keels.I can see why this book was the winner of the very first Edgar Award for Best Novel.

It has given people a great place to start with very good suggestions as to what to name their characters.The book is filled with thousands of names of Pharaohs, Queens, god-names, Egyptian symbols, sacred animals, Nomes and Districts in Ancient Egypt and different Ancient Egyptian words and phrases that are translated into the English.

As we are led room by room through Japanese buildings of his time, we acquire an appreciation for the highly imaginitive individual expressions made by artisans of many crafts working within the standardization that gave the style longevity through many generations.His study ranges from the historical origins of Japanese architecture to covering room floorplans, as has become a staple in introducing Japanese tatami mat rooms since he first wrote this book in the 1886, to lavishing minute attention to the details of various crafts that made the Japanese interior design accessories touchstones of excellence throughout the world. He also provides intimate vignettes of individual design principles, items, materials, and construction utilized throughout Japanese houses, rooms, and tea rooms.His ability to translate the often fleeting impression of a space into precise identifiable elements makes him a valuable guide to this deceptively simple-looking style of interior design whose rigorous structure and aesthetic guidelines make it one of the great design styles of history. The extensive etchings included in the book provide concise, delightful, and sometimes humorous examples of the principles applied.Because he covers the essential architectural and design elements thoroughly without becoming bogged down in mundane enumeration of tiny variances, the lively text gives the reader a very good sense of how spaces within a Japanese home are a sum of more than their constituent parts and how principles are applicable across the many disciplines that comprise the Japanese style. That he did it so sympathetically in a timeframe in which nationalistic chauvinism so predominated the world landscape makes it all the more impressive.As an introductory volume to what makes traditional Japanese architectural design so delightful, this book is hard to beat. It's depth of understanding and comprehensive coverage of the style also make it an excellent reference volume for the more advanced student of Japanese design. That it is a standard item in bibliographies to Japanese design and on &quot;must read&quot; lists for Japanese design is no surprise."},{"Title":"Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings","review":"This is a great book which describes in fine detail theJapanese home in the late 1800s. This book captures a period of timewhen the Japanese house still had its unique cultural style and hadn't been excessively influenced by american or european style architecture. The book is clearly written and there are many detailed drawings which illustrate the text's descriptions. It is an interesting book both for its architectural detail as well as for its historical perspective."},{"Title":"Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings","review":"I purchased this book simply to get a quick overview of Japanese domestic architecture. The price is always right with Dover books so I just ordered it without any research. What a pleasant surprise to find myself reading a definitive work on the subject a few days later. The text is thoughtfully written and the illustrations skillfully done. As with any well written and illustrated book, color pictures are not overly missed. As a result of this book I find myself much more interested in Japanese architecture than I ever intended to be and heartily recommend it to anyone with an interest in home or interior design."},{"Title":"Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings","review":"I picked up the Dover paperback edition at a library book sale and was charmed by the author's detailed drawings as much as the description of domestic life in 19th century Japan. Morse originally published this in 1885, barely 30 years after Perry's expedition, and traveled around Japan documenting as many houses and styles as possible (including those of the Aino culture). There are no photographs, but the intricate line drawings and intimate descriptions of functional households -- kitchens and cooking utensils, washing areas, sleeping quarters -- are minutely detailed and thoroughly described in the text. Not just a book for those interested in architecture but history as well."},{"Title":"Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings","review":"I bought this book about 3 years ago from Amazon. So you'd think that it would be old hat by now. Yet I find myself picking it up at least once every few months to either refer to it for a construction detail or just to look for something new. What a wonderful resource for traditional Japanese design this book is.Trained as a Zoologist, Morse put his scientific powers of observation and systematic description to work during the 1880's in producing the sketches and text that describes a world of everyday Japanese design right before it was swamped with Western influence and largely disappeared. There are plenty of books that can show you pictures of ancient Japanese temples and teahouses, but what about the method of constructing the roof of an ordinary 19th century Tokyo home? This was stuff that few people thought was worth recording for posterity. Which is why Morse's book is so unique and valuable to us.Anyone with more than a passing interest in the way that things are built or designed would do well to put this book on their shelf. Interior decorators, architects, DIY types (such as myself), finish carpenters, contractors and furniture makers should all have a tattered, dog-eared copy of 'Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings' within easy reach. It is a constant source of inspiration."},{"Title":"Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings","review":"\\"Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings\\" is a great book. If you've any interest in traditional Japanese architecture, get this book. Edward Morse was an American who went to Japan in 1877 to study brachiopods. He ended up recording a vanishing way of life instead. He tells you how Japanese homes were built and why they were built that way. Not much escapes his eye. In serviceable prose and clear drawings, he tells us about carpenters and their tools, houses, furnishings, privies, fences and gateways, water supplies and gardens. Most of it he compares favorably to American and European counterparts.Best of all, it's a Dover book and cheap."},{"Title":"Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings","review":"Several years ago I bought a reprint of Dr. Morse book and it has become not only a treasured Clasic but a Bible of information.

Each time an author braves the winds and waves of time to re-capture how we say things, and why we say the things that we say is a cause for not only for excitement, but a reason for celebration.Geneva Smitherman has accurately captured the humor, wit, and wisdom of our language in her revised volume \\"Black Talk: Words and Phrases from the Hood to the Amen Corner (2000, Houghton Mifflin Publishers, 305 Pages).\\" With 300 additional new terms, phrases and definitions included, the book is quickly going to be a writer's companion, a teacher's dictionary and a journalist's friend. It covers a great deal of distance, and provides some explanations as to OUR language, our customs, and our traditions.Now, the work was originally released in 1994. Smitherman has expanded this volume by including a little history behind our pronunciation patterns, the pros and cons of the great Ebonics debate of the 1990s, and brought forth explanations of terms that have found their way into the American mainstream from our people. One of the true beauties of this work is the inclusion of the Amen Corner--some of those terms and phrases that have emerged from the walls and pulpits of many a Black preacher, and Black church congregation.This book will have young and old alike anxiously turning the pages to find out the meanings and the history behind such phrases as \`Stuck On Stupid' (which is one of my personal favorites), and \`Benjamins' (which has several sub-meanings coming from the Hip Hop language of today). No, it won't have the \`exact' time and date of such word origins--but it does provide enough uncluttered background confirming whether or not a phrase or word which originated with us has/has not slipped into the American pool of daily conversation.With all of the \`fuss' being made over being bi-lingual because of the infusion of more and more of the Hispanic community into the American mainstream, Smitherman's work clearly shows that our language had long cleared the way for such inclusion. I would encourage any parent interested in teaching/reaching their youth concerning the historical origins of our language to invest in a copy of this book. Who knows? You, like I, may re-discover part of your childhood, as you can reflect on some of the sayings of your parents and grandparents around the dinner table, or on the porch during those summer evenings \`Down Home'. I highly recommend it.Mike Ramey"},{"Title":"Black Talk: Words and Phrases from the Hood to the Amen Corner","review":"I read a review for this book and thought that I'd check it out.

The material is remarkably current, though its usefulness is weakened by the lack of a pronunciation guide. Overall, Smitherman exhibits a strong appreciation of current black slang. It's too bad that she destroys her credibility as a linguist by pushing a leftist political stance in some of her definitions of the words. The most glaring example is her definition of the term 'rebellion', which she defines as an \\"African-Centered\\" term for \\"manifestations of a people in struggle, in contrast to the perception of European Americans in the media, who refer to these uprisings [she gives examples such as the upheaval following the Rodney King trial] as 'riots'\\" (page 192).

The book is a dictionary in a way but the presentation is giving a central idea. Black talk is the language AfroAmericans create and use in their community both to differentiate themselves from the whites and to speak a language that is not understood by the whites. They are thus smuggling meaning into white society that only them understand. But the main phenomenon the author shows is that the whites are copycats and borrow that language from the blacks and keep it on loan, without interest, and enrich their own language with it. In a way today's black talk is tomorrow's white talk and today's white talk is yesterday's black talk. This shows a great level of creativity and even a great level of inspiration : AfroAmericans inspire the whites with their creativity, which tends to imply that the creativity of the whites, particularly among young people, is black driven and black inspired. The question that is not answered is why AfroAmericans, as a community, are not recognized for what they are : an essential engine in the creativity of American society and culture. Some will say that this is only words, but words are the tools of the mind and these words transport meaning. This is the other question that is not answered : the meaning the whites use in those black words is not what the blacks convey with them. Are the whites unable to get this meaning ? Doesn't this meaning apply to white society ? Is it a last form of racism, the racism of the language and the mind? I think it is more complex and words, when they shift from one situation to another, necessarily change meanings. This is a case of languages in contact. The whites borrow the words but they implant the meanings they want in them.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"Communication & Swallowing Management Of Tracheostomized & Ventilator Dependent Adults","review":"This book is an excellent book for those speech therapists who haven't worked much with the trach/vent population and would like to learn more.

While his role cannot be overstated, it does overshadow the difficulties that the second wave of black players had, of which Hank Aaron was one. Most of these players began in the old Negro leagues and then were given the chance to play in the major leagues after Jackie's success. Aaron was one of those players and he was also one of the black players that integrated one of the minor leagues based in the south. It was a harsh existence as the players were forced to follow the Jim Crow segregationist norms. They knew that the integration of baseball was a critical step and pushing against the Jim Crow norms would have endangered it. Therefore, the black players tolerated the daily humiliation.However, nothing compared to the hate mail that Aaron received when he was approaching Ruth's record and several of the letters are reprinted here. The vileness of the comments is so appalling that it shocks you thirty years later. These stories are a sad aspect of what was an incredible life and career.Henry Aaron was one of the best and smartest players of all time, his career statistics, done without the benefit of chemical enhancement, speak for themselves. His life story was one of fame, incredible achievement and the changing of America as it moved towards complete integration. While that movement was difficult and sometimes went into reverse, it did happen and Aaron lived to see the country move from a point where a black was forbidden to even step on a ball field to where a black is now President. His story is a moving one and the look back is of great historical importance."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"James Dodson does a great job in this book as in all of his books. Takes time to get the details correct. Nice book on a very nice person Arnold Palmer. Carl Welty"},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"\`I Had a Hammer':The Hank Aaron Story, is quite a remarkable book. Mr. Aaron had a magnificent career as one of the greatest baseball players of all time, yet he was not as flamboyant and luminous as other figures in the game that most fans are accustomed to remembering such as Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams, Ty Cobb, Stan Musial, Joe DiMaggio or even Babe Ruth. Aaron was a methodical productive hitter that was a reliable back bone of the Braves organization going back to it's Milwaukee days. He was the man who hit the game winning hit that propelled the Braves into the 1957 World Series, and I later years the only man to break Babe Ruth's home run record making him still the all-time home run king in Baseball. What is sometimes over-shadowed by his home run title is the fact that he was also a very all around hitter throughout his career. Aaron had 2297 RBI's, 240 stolen bases, 98 triples, 624 doubles, 2174 runs, 3771 hits out of 3298 games he played and batted .305 in his career. Incredible all around numbers, and a man any coach would die for in their starting line-up. This story tells much of the untold story of Aaron's career which he candidly lays out in detail for the reader. The high pressure racism he experienced from his early days in the negro leagues, the South Atlantic League and throughout his days as an Atlanta Brave. The flood of death threats and hate mail for his sole \`crime' of being a black man approaching Babe Ruth's record. The book is beautifully presented and is extraordinarily engrossing in it's dignified manner in which Aaron breaks his long year's of silence portraying a tale of an illustrious career and a thrilling American triumph. Mr. Aaron is a legend, and this is more than just any other sports biography. I strongly recommend this book to anyone, as it shines a light on our country's history that is seldom told. I found this to be an astonishing tale about the baseball odyssey who hit the glorious and impossble 715 in more ways than one."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"The Henry Aaron story is one of the few that transcends the realm of sports. It really should become part of our national consciousness. He is a symbol of American identity. H is book tells it like it is. One thing that Henry Aaron does not muse upon-- he graciously lets others draw these conclusions --is that he leads by example much more than by words. His remarkable abilities are underscored by a sense of grace, modesty, consistency, and decency that have few parallels in sports, especially compared to today's fallen heroes. &quot;I Had A Hammer&quot; touches upon his modest-but-hardworking background, and emphasizes the strength and cohesiveness of his family. Indeed, Aaron makes it clear that he is a product of the values instilled in him by his father, mother, and older siblings as much as anything else. And if his current position on race issues seem a bit extreme now and then, well, read the book and you'll understand why he sees things the way he does. It wasn't so long ago that he was the victim of crude, stinging racism-- REAL, in-your-face racism, not subtle, ambiguous, or imagined! He bore a tremendous burden successfully. He pays significant homage to Jackie Robinson, and he has exemplified the same spirit through and through. Of course, he had support from good people-- white and black --and his book acknowledges this, too. Henry Aaron is our perfect American symbol of triumph over oppression. I was lucky to spend some time with him at a Harvard Commencement a few years ago (he was aptly elected as Class Day speaker for Harvard), and the entire Harvard community was thrilled and awed by his gentle grace. (As I shook his hand, for some reason it flashed through my mind that this hand hit seven home runs off the great Sandy Koufax!). Henry Aaron is, as Ted Turner says, a &quot;right thinker&quot; and he deserves even more credit and acknowledgment than he receives. In an era of flash, unbridled arrogance and conspicuous consumption, Aaron shows us the true path to respect, recognition, and character. He is the Zen Master of American sports."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"333 pages chronicling wrongs inflicted on him by players, fans, owners, officials and reporters, mostly due to their distaste of his skin color. He has every right to be angry, but even righteous anger can be wearisome unless leavened by generous doses of humor and humility. Aaron's career statistics tower over all but a handful of legendary players, yet he rarely connects with the heart. This book will help you understand why."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"In this baseball season where my favorite team is floundering in the cellar, and every good story(compelling divisional races) is counterbalanced by the bad (steroids), I have been trying to maintain interest by re-reading some baseball books that I have read over the years. After re-reading \\"I Had A Hammer\\", I remember why it remains one of the best biographies/autobiographies that I have ever read.The sports genre in books is much harder than one would think to keep up interest in. There are very few gems in any sporting subject; mostly it's very mediocre to terribly vapid. Usually a fan becomes disappointed in their sports \\"heroes\\" when they read a biography about them, because the writing can be so bad. Fortunately, for a ballplayer as great as Hank Aaron, the work lives up to the character and legend of the man.Mr. Aaron does a splendid job of taking the reader through his life in Alabama, his discovering the game of baseball, and - of course - his remarkable career. His writing style provides enough description to allow the reader to get a true mental \\"picture\\" of what his life was like without getting bogged down in minutiae. Throughout the book, I had the feeling like I really was there watching his career unfold.Of course, that brings us to the real core - and most important part - of his life story. That is, what Mr. Aaron experienced as he neared and eclipsed Babe Ruth's home run record. Most celebrities or sports figures would relate this in that sensational, \\"woe-is-me\\", tabloid-tell-all sort of way. Not Mr. Aaron. He shares many of the truly hateful and despicable letters he received from people across the nation who saw the idea of an African-American breaking the record of a white man as egregious. Mr. Aaron relates how this inundation of hate mail affected him, but he manages to avoid expressing any hate towards the senders of those letters. One obviously gets the sense that Mr. Aaron steeled himself against those attacks with grace and dignity, allowing himself to still play the game the way it was supposed to be played, and to do it with class and personal enjoyment.It is striking to return to Mr. Aaron's autobiography after the events in baseball over the past decade. We as a fan base in general express outrage over the strike, the steroids (and questions about those players that broke records), outrageous salaries, and the like. It seems to always elicit a response demanding a return to the \\"innocence\\" of baseball seasons and players gone by. However, Mr. Aaron's experience demonstrates that there was controversy in almost every era of the game. In his case, it was a despicable form of racial hatred expressed by a very vocal minority in this country.Again, \\"I Had A Hammer\\" stands out as one of the great books in the sports genre, and stands out as one of my favorite biographies/autobiographies. I rate it the full five stars, and encourage readers of all interests to give this one their attention."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"This is a terrific autobiography that transcends the classification of sports writing. It is written in a style and format that that is compelling and informative. The typical sports biographies tell a series of funny and dramatic inside stories around memorable moments in sports history that the subject participated in. When well done, the reader gets what he or she is looking for and then some. When poorly done we get some stale jokes, old stories and an inept attempt at describing the true meaning of courage. In &quot;I Had a Hammer&quot; Henry Aaron and Lonnie Wheeler have given us a glimpse at a young black man growing up in the Deep South to become the greatest home run hitter of all time. In the odyssey we see the elements of society alternately denigrate and celebrate this gifted athlete. We are given these insights through the co-writer's preambe to each chapter and the personal recollections of key players in the life and career of Hank Aaron. This array of perspectives is excellently done and gives the book a good flow. What gives it the greatest impact is the candid personal recollections of Mr. Aaron. He is outspoken in his contempt for the elements of racism that followed (or is it lead) him every step of the way to the top. Yet he is forgiving of many who may have slurred his race in the past and then later learned to overcome their biased opinions. Much of that transition came through their experiences with him and other early black major league ball players. This is a book about our nation's racial attitudes as seen through the experiences of the author.Don't be mistaken, this is still an excellent book for the sports fan. The casual fan will come away with a greater sense of sports history. The Braves fan will really enjoy some of the historic events recreated in the middle chapters. The Milwaukee fan need only read the last paragraph of chapter 7 and a tear or two will likely fall. The Atlanta fan will come away with a challenge to accept the validity of Aaron's view of his experiences in that city. Some will and some won't. However, all sports fans will come away with an excellent education on race relations in America from the 1930' to very recent years. They will gain this insight not through a lecture by the authors but by the very human expressions of a man telling his own compelling story."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"In his autobiography, Henry Aaron takes you back to the beginning of his baseball career and makes you feel that you were right there with him. You felt the hurt, disgust and anger that he did as he confronted racism around every corner and in every ballpark. And he handled it all with such dignity. It follows his career from Milwaukee, a city that loved him and still does, to Atlanta, a city that never fully understood or appreciated him. Whether you are a baseball fan or not, this book looks at social issues and how it related to baseball of that era and transended into today. I strongly recommend this to anyone who just wants to read a terrific life story."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"I started following baseball when we moved to NJ in the late 60's and, serendipitously, the first season that really captured my attention was 1969. We had a color TV (a rarity at that time--it was a big old console job with stereo &amp; turntable built-in. You sometimes had to bang underneath the picture tube with a hammer to fix the vertical hold) and our next door neighbor Joe Koberlein would come over to watch Mets games.) Unquestioningly loyal to our beloved Amazins, my brother and I had little doubt that Tommie Agee and Cleon Jones (both of whom happen to have come from Aaron's hometown of Mobile, AL) were the two best outfielders in baseball, maybe the two best ever. Our Father, who had doggedly remained a Dodger fan despite their move West, would put in a word for Duke Snider. We lived in Yankee country, so Mickey Mantle still had his backers and their were those residual Giants fans who stumped for Willie Mays--who also won allegiance from many black fans on racial solidarity grounds. But I really don't ever remember a Hank Aaron fan. Sure we knew he was good, especially during the NLCS were we reminded of how dangerous he was, but he just wasn't terribly glamorous or personable and he played for a team that noone rooted for, so to our minds he was barely worthy of notice. The, seemingly all of a sudden, we realized the guy was about to catch Babe Ruth. I remember NBC breaking into their regular programming to show his 715th HR live. Then began the arguments over just how good he was; arguments that always seemed to have a whiff of race about them. In the ensuing years this argument has hardly died down and the racial overtones have certainly not faded. In fact, the subtle assertion that the only reason you would deny Aaron primacy is that you are a closet racist has added an additional layer of bitterness to his legacy. All of this combined with Aaron's own demeanor, whether he is aloof or shy or whatever, has always led me to view him somewhat askance. There's that visceral level on which I just can't grant him equality with Ruth, let alone with the more personable Mays.So it came as a great surprise and a pleasure when this book was published, to find in its pages a Hank Aaron who was not only a great baseball player but a compelling hero and human being. Beyond simply providing a complex portrait of a gifted and proud human being, the book serves to provide some context for the pure numbers that Aaron put up in his career and, more importantly, reminds us of the backdrop of persistent racism against which these feats were achieved. We all find things easier to comprehend if they follow an easy narrative form, so when we say that Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier it is easy for us to misperceive this as meaning that racism in baseball ended in the late 40's. And Aaron, because he was so good for so long, seems to us a figure of the 60's, or even the 70's. But the book reminds us that Hank Aaron began in the Negro Leagues (with the Indianapolis Clowns), played in minor leagues which had only just lowered the color bar, had to stay in separate hotels and eat at different restaurants on road trips, etc. And still, some thirty years later, as he approached the Babe's HR mark, received virulent hate mail. Aaron's incredible career takes on a patina of real grace when considered against this pervasive and corrosive pattern of racial animus. His accomplishments, monumental in themselves, must be judged as singular when taken in conjunction with the unique challenges he faced.If I were picking my all-time team today, I'd still take Ruth and Mays over Aaron (Aaron vs. Ted Williams is a tougher call.) But if you were trying to judge them all as men, I think this book makes a compelling case that Aaron is one of the really great men in the history of sports and even one of the great men in our nation's history. A lot of people have been yammering about the stupid things that John Rocker said in Sports Illustrated, but when I read Aaron's comments that he found them unacceptable, I was struck by how much more moral authority he brought to the question. So many of the great men of the Civil Rights era are gone--Jackie Robinson, Martin Luther King, etc.--it is important to recognize that one remains, and he just happens to have been a great hitter too.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"Henry Aaron is probably the most underrated baseball player of all time. His story is seldom told or mysticized like other baseball gods. 'I Had A Hammer' is story from the heart. Honest and bold, it tells of Aaron's and other black players' struggle to make it in the big leagues. A must read even if you have the slightest interest in baseball."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"If you are a baseball fan, of any age, this is the ultimate book by one of the greatest to play the game. Hank Aaron is a true American hero, and this book gives quite a bit of information on his early days and his struggles both on and off the field. This country needs more heroes like Hank Aaron."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"\\"I Had A Hammer\\" is a wonderfully written autobiography about the struggles and the triumphs of one Henry(aka Hank) \\"The Hammer\\" Aaron, the career home run record holder, and one of the last of the \\"Negro League\\" players to make it big. Aaron describes his upbringing in Mobile well, and shows us the different levels of racism in the Deep South. The book reveals that Aaron fought against segregation in the minor leagues, helping to end \\"white-only\\" minor league teams, and shows us Aaron's love affair with the city of Milwaukee and it's long-gone Braves team, and the tense relationship between Aaron and Atlanta, which had the first Deep South major league team. This is recommended for lovers of baseball as well as those who want to know more about civil rights heroes. Atlanta is not cast in a good light in this book, but Aaron harbors little bitterness towards the city or the racism and death threats he had to endure while trying to break Babe Ruth's record."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"This is an excellent baseball autobiography, and one of the best of its genre. Henry (Hank) Aaron speaks with an impressive dignity, in a book he wrote (with Lonnie Wheeler) 15 years after his playing days ended. Aaron describes his early life, from growing up in the segregated south, to playing as a teen for the then-declining Negro leagues, to his helping integrate the minor leagues down south. He then describes reaching the majors in 1954 at age 20, where he was soon a superstar on the powerhouse Milwaukee Braves teams of Eddie Mathews, Warren Spahn, Lew Burdette, etc. Aaron recalls being well-treated by the Milwaukee fans, in contrast to the reception he received after the team moved to Atlanta in 1966. He also describes the pressure as he neared Babe Ruth's home run record in 1973-74, including hate mail and even death threats. Racism had a hand in many of Aaron's experiences as a player and baseball executive, and he leaves an impression by confronting prejudice in a firm but reasoned manner.Hank Aaron was a calm, steady, not-that-colorful superstar playing in smaller markets. For these reasons he never got the attention of other star players (at least before his home run chase). Aaron isn't perfect, but he speaks with dignity and class. This is an impressive biography by an impressive man."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"The book is a must read. It shows Aaron fight against prejustice to evenutually break a record that he would be scorned and have his life threatend before he could break it.

These modern day players could not survive what he and others went through."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"In the early 1970's, as Hank Aaron was chasing Babe Ruth's career home run record, he received mountains of racially motivated hate mail. He received death threats. Undercover guards followed his children to protect them from kidnapping. The commissioner of baseball threatened to fine Aaron if he took days off while his team, the Atlanta Braves, played in other cities, and when Aaron finally passed the Babe, the commissioner did not come to Atlanta to witness the event. And when Aaron spoke of this, or when he wondered aloud why blacks weren't getting more opportunities in baseball management positions, the white media labelled him a bitter racist. In his autobiography, Aaron succeeds in setting the record straight. He discusses his poor upbringing in Mobile, Alabama, and his journey from those humble beginnings to the Hall of Fame. But what shines through this memoir is the sheer brilliance of Aaron as a ballplayer. Every baseball fan knows that Hammerin' Hank hit 755 home runs, but that number has actually obscured many of his accomplishments and the impossible has happened: major league baseball's all-time home run leader is actually underrated. Modern players like Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey, Jr. may eventually challenge Aaron's mark, benefitting from an offensive era the game has never before seen, an era in which players routinely hit fifty home runs in a season, a number rarely approached in Aaron's day, but they won't win batting titles on the way, and they surely won't end their careers with 3,000 hits. For my money, Hank Aaron is the greatest all-around hitter of all-time, and his book isn't bad either."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"I Had a Hammer brought back a lot of memories for me.

This is a must read!"},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"The beauty of growing up in the 1960's and early 1970's was the greatness in baseball. Before a line of authentic black sluggers appeared on the scene in the mid-1950's, there was Babe Ruth and four others who had hit 500 or more home runs in the major leagues. By 1980, that number had nearly tripled. Aside from Mickey Mantle and Harmon Killebrew, all the others were black.Hank Aaron, of course, broke Babe Ruth's venerated record for home runs in a career. He was by no means the most colorful or visible of this grouping of players. Willie Mays was considered the most talented, Mickey Mantle the most popular, Frank Robinson the most driven, and Roberto Clemente (who never got close to 500 home runs) the most skilled.And yet Aaron perservered. Often seeming phlegmatic, he just seemed to hang around, always doing things right, always in the mix of home run leaders, and top five batting averages.This is his story, in his words. Equally inspiring, enlightening and painful to read, we enter the inner sanctum of a man who broke one of the truly important sports records in our society.The reader sees what it was like to enter the baseball world as a balck man in the 1950's, often having to both dine and room away from his teammates. What it was like to encounter virulent racism during his chase of Babe Ruth's record, and finally, the racial divided that kept many solid black baseball men from landing jobs in their sport when their playing career was over.One thing not heavily on display here is Aaron's sense of humor. 25 years in baseball dugouts had to yield some truly funny moments, but Aaron rarely takes us their. We do get his take on many of his teammates and some of the great pitchers of the day, however.This was a surprisingly well written auto-biography. Worth reading for anyone wanting to get to know a bona-fide baseball hero."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"Book arrived very quickly.

Mr Aaron is a man of dignity and class, his success through clouds of racist hate provides a shining example of what a man can be under extreme circumstances. Thank you Henry, for your marvelous career in baseball, and for your open, honest sharing of the story."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"The athletic proficiency of Hank Aaron is probably the greatest in the history of baseball if not all sports.

Statistics show that he is an excellent all-round player, probably better than most fans make him out to be.On top of being a star, Aaron's story is amazing with all of the racism, discrimination &amp; hate that he went through.After reading this book, you will probably wonder why No. 715 was only SECOND on mastercard's most memorable moments. Also, you may, like me, want Hank to keep the home run record forever.

The prose is wooden and we learn little about Aaron's personal life. But as a depiction of what he went through as part of the &quot;second generation&quot; of black baseball players, this is great stuff.Aaron was one of the last great players to start in the Negro Leagues. He was also one of the players who helped break the color barrier in the minor leagues in the south. We learn the many hardships and dangers he faced long before his historical chase of Babe Ruth's record.Aaron also &quot;tells it like it is&quot; about the great and not-so-great men with whom he played. If you admire men like Stan Musial, you won't be disappointed.Aaron also tells a compelling story of how the white media consistently misportrayed him.Finally, this book has a lot to offer about baseball. You'll read impressive testimony from men like Eddie Matthews why Aaron, and not Willie Mays, was the greatest player of his generation."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"Hank Aaron is one of the greatest men to ever live. To gain knowledge of his life in an entertaining way has been a light in my otherwise dark and dreary life. Also, I found the fact that there are other records which The Hammer set that he is more proud of interesting. As my personal compliment to Hank Aaron I won't mention the record or the man who some people can't resist mentioning when speaking of Hank Aaron. Hank Aaron would be a great man without the record, just not one who we remember. Afterall the record didn't make the man, the man made the record."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"I Had a Hammer is a wonderful book if you are a fan of Hank Aaron or of baseball in general.

The audio book, with a Foreword and Afterword read by Henry Aaron himself, really brings the player and the man to you. He was an all-around player, at least once he found a defensive position where he had major-league talent.His offense was outstanding, setting many more records than just Most Home Runs and reaching many milestones. He also is a man of conscience and character that pushed through a number of color barriers without the flamboyance of some of today's leaders.The narrative, read by Courtney Vance, shifts without warning between 1st and 3rd persons. I found this interesting and it helped hold my attention. If you enjoy baseball entertainment like the movie &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, this is for you."},{"Title":"I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story","review":"I heard part of this on NPR when it first was published as a book. Hank Aaron came across as a warm-hearted, positive, wonderful person. His stories entertain, but they also educate us on what it was like to grow up African American. This set of audio tapes would be great for listening to while driving to and from work. His story is an inspiration to us all."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"This is one of those books that will surprise you in many ways. It was not what I was expecting - of course I did not have the subtitle, only the main title at that time. I was expecting a book on philosophy from Peter Kreeft, a professor of Philosophy. But it was three debates on issues surrounding abortion lead by Socrates.The format is three discussions led by Socorates with three groups of people. The first is with a Dr. Rex Herrod (King Herrod) held in a hospital in Athens in the present time. The second is again with Dr. Rex but also with his friend, a philosopher, Professor Atilla Tarian (Atilla the Hun) who is an ethicist, and it is held at a Philosophy convention. The final is in a Psychiatric ward with \\"Pop\\" Syke, (Pop Psychology) the psychologist.Each debate is written as a mini morality play, like those of classical Greek plays. Each is written as a dialogue and written somewhat tongue in cheek, filled with puns and word plays.This book was not an easy read, in that the material it deals with is very difficult and very controversial. It raises many questions that most people on both sides of the abortion debate probably do not think about. It is easy to read in that it was written in an easy style and flows nicely.The main focus of all three debates is when does life begin, and who will speak for the most helpless, the unborn. This is a tough read but one that will not leave the reader unchanged."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"The author clearly shows how emotionally-charged and irrational pro-abortion arguments really are when they are held up to the truth-penetrating light of logic and natural reason, which Professor Kreeft, using his brilliant wit in the role of Socrates, masterfully applies. The charge in a previous review that the author did not accurately present the women's perspective on abortion because all the characters in the book were male is somewhat puzzling--the characters are fictional to begin with; and besides, I can think of no argument that only a woman would be able to use to justify abortion that was not triumphantly refuted. Anyone who has argued himself or herself blue in the face with someone who is pro-abortion knows how discomfittingly illogical--oftentimes downright silly--and motivated by selfishness the arguments employed are. To the Christian this volume demonstrates that one does not need to rely solely upon Church teaching to argue that abortion is morally wrong--a strategy which will rarely succeed against a non-believer. Instead, it reveals the power that logic and reason alone can have in critically examining issues of social morality, which when used properly, can greatly bolster religious arguments. To the non-believer, this little book plainly shows that abortion is not exclusively a religious issue, as many people in today's society assume. I enthusiastically recommend this book to any pro-life person who wants to be successful in arguing against abortion as well as to persons who, being instinctively pro-choice, honestly desire to understand how anyone could be against this apparent woman's right."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Peter Kreeft, who is famous for his religious/philosophical dialogues, has another witty materpiece here. As the title suggests, Socrates is playing the role of the questioner against those who might defend abortion on demand. Socrates engages a doctor, lawyer and philosopher who argue for the pro-abortion position. The great thing about this book on the abortion issue is that Kreeft forces the reader to see what is at stake in this issue. He strips away emotionally loaded cases and bad arguments for abortion. This is a must read for anyone who isn't sure where they stand with abortion. If you don't get why pro-lifers are so uptight about about abortion, you need to read this book. The dialogue is easy to read, and it is unapologetically honest about where the truth leads."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"In this imaginative work, Socrates is resurrected and finds himself talking with various specialists about the issue of abortion. The questions he asks are appropriate for considering the ethics of this issue. A good book for those reflecting on the morality of abortion."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"This book is an excellent introduction for the person who is just getting started in the abortion debate. Kreeft's clear logic and concise thinking will keep the reader entertained and convey the true issues behind the abortion debate.If the book is considered as such, this book should get five stars. Its staged conversations are a great way to keep the readers attention. Kreeft also shows how many of the pro-abortion arguments beg the question, and that the pro-life side has a lot to say on this topic. However, I would stop there. Because Kreeft authored the book, one might get the impression that Kreeft is going to give a complete analysis of the abortion debate. Like is generally his style of doing with other topics. But this is not the case nor do I think that is what Kreeft intended to do. Given this books short size, and pages, I think Kreeft just wanted to give a good overview of the principles behind the abortion debate. In this regard, Kreeft did an excellent job and I would recommend the book to any person looking for that. So just keep in mind that there are some strong arguments for abortion that are left out in this book. Such as &quot;unplugging the violinist&quot; argument by Judith Jarvis Thomson.If anybody gets more interested in the abortion debate, and would like to have a book that is guaranteed to convince even the most ardent pro-abortionist, I would strongly recommend, &quot;Politically Correct Death : Answering the Arguments for Abortion Rights&quot; by Francis J. Beckwith. This book is sure to shake the ground of any sincere pro-abortionist out there. It includes all arguments in the abortion debate and clearly shows the logical power on the pro-life side."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Though parts of this book struck me as cheesy, an abortionist named Dr. Rex Herrod for instance. I think that Peter Kreeft has crafted a good analysis of the arguments around abortion, presenting a fair picture both sides of the argument. It's a short and enjoyable read. Kreeft can be accused at times of using cheesy dialog, but at least his writing remains unbiased and logical."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Overall, I think this book is a fair representation of the issue. The book is a debate among four characters, written like a Socratic dialogue. At the end everybody still basically believes in what they already brought to the table with little or any, change. The question at hand is: Is abortion right or wrong, do circumstances change that answer, and if so, why? All that aside, the four characters:Socrates- your typical gadflyRex Herod- an abortion doctorAtila Tarian-a utilitarian philosopher who is pro-choicePop Syke- a psychologist that tries to discredit Socrates via psychoanalysisCons:1) I am by no means a feminist like some other critics, but I agree that having a woman in this dialogue would be appropriate. In fact, as Kreeft mentions in the book, that men tend to be more pro-choice than women. Most, if not all of the active pro-lifers I know are women! So having a woman here could really only strengthen the argument. Also, just for fairness, adding a pro-choice woman might help.2) This is just one issue, where try as we might, logic often breaks down. Emotions and subjectivity always enter the discussion, despite our loftiest philosophical intentions.Pros:1) I think it defines the real heart of the issue well: Either you believe that a fetus constitutes human life or you do not. Women's rights are important, and women do have the right to go through with this procedure in most countries; what critics must understand is that the morality, and not legality, of this action is the premise of the book.2) A spinoff of 1, the book demonstrates that morality and legality are not the exact same thing in our country, yet suggests that in a more idealistic sense they probably should be. This argument is right out of Republic, where wisdom and virtue are not very optional.3) There are 3 people arguing the position that Kreeft dislikes, and only one arguing the alternative. I think most of the best arguments for the \\"pro-choice\\" position are articulated within the book (women's rights, democracy cannot legislate morality, fetus is not truly human). If this book was written by a pro-choice apologist, I would expect these arguments to prevail. However, this is not the case and thus people should expect to see counterarguments that are well prepared and delivered. Depending on your stance, this could be a pro or a con.4) The book is true to life as opponents attack Socrates by calling him a man without compassion; since Roe v. Wade, both sides have often viewed the other as merciless.5) I don't know why critics say that women's rights is a non-issue in this unfolding argument. Women and their stake in this issue is the main argument of the third and forth characters introduced, Tarian and Syke. I could see how people would dislike the idea that the personhood of the fetus, and not the mother's rights, is the central factor in deciding abortion. However, Kreeft makes a case, a rather strong one, for that being the central issue on the morality of abortion.6) Again I would like to reiterate that the book brings up a fascinating philosophical question: Just because it is legal, does that make it moral? Should the laws of a country represent moral truths? If so, what would that mean for abortion laws if abortion is immoral?I've just come to expect 1-star ratings from some of the critics of Kreeft. I might add that as I read their criticisms they don't sound like those of someone who actually read the book. The book covers the major rhetoric that has occurred since Roe v. Wade. I like Kreeft, and thus have a bias that I admit. Nonetheless, I hope my opinion has been helpful to you."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Professor Kreeft (philosophy dept., Boston College), through the character of Socrates, eloquently and convincingly demolishes all the major arguments for abortion rights. He shows that unless one holds that human persons are more than physical property-things (that is, beings that can be exhaustively described by science), then there is no basis for &quot;autonomy&quot; (since there is no absolute substance or agent existing over time), no &quot;rights&quot; (since moral properties do not exist in a universe exhaustively described by science), and no purpose or nature to human persons (and thus, pro-aborts could not say that prolifers are &quot;ignorant,&quot; for objecting to ignorance means that human beings have a natural purpose to know). The unborn, according to Kreeft, have an instrinsic dignity because they are human persons by nature. Whether they are able to act &quot;autonomously&quot; is irrelevant, for they are individual substances whose nature is human. A comatose person, a newborn, and someone sleeping lack the present ability to act autonomously, though they have the natural inherent capacity to do so. The unborn, because it is a human person, has the same natural inherent capacity. When a being lacks a particular function (e.g., it is unconscious, cannot speak, cannot hear), it does not lose its nature; it simply cannot perform the function. In fact, the lack is testimony of its nature. For example, rocks don't &quot;lack&quot; the ability to speak; they cannot speak by nature. Newborns, the dumb, and fetuses lack the ability to speak, because they are human persons by nature. It seems to me that those who label such thinking &quot;Aristotelean&quot; think that name-calling is sufficient to refute a viewpoint. The question is: Is it correct and do the arguments for it work? Also, if this view is wrong, which one is right and why? And can this alternative view ground the notions we think are intuitively correct: rights, the wrongness of prejudice, etc. If one were to call Kreeft's view &quot;Feminism&quot; rather than &quot;Aristoteleanism,&quot; it would not make a wit of difference as to its cogency. The secret is to refute the position with real arguments. Some people think that reciting postmodern feminist mumbo-jumbo gobbledy-gook rather than actually making an argument is academically respectable. It isn't. And by the way, appealing to &quot;science&quot; as arbiter in a metaphysical debate is flawed in at least two ways: (1) it is a category mistake, and (2) the appeal to science itself is philosophical (and metaphysical) since it is something not discovered by science but something concluded as the result of philosophical reflection."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Peter Kreeft does not oversimplify a complicated issue -- he shows how UNcomplicated the issue of abortion can be, once it is seen as justification for the convenience of some.

Thank you Peter Kreeft."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Keeft does a fair job in parts of making Socrates \\"come alive\\" on a contemporary issue; that is, he replicates his style in many respects, and conveys much of both the humor, sarcasm, and earnestness with which Socrates argued. There is of course little reason to think the content of his argument is at all related to what the historical Socrates would have believed. This is a relatively minor point. However as an introduction to or serious treatment of arguments about abortions, this work is a travesty.In the first section \\"Socrates\\" debates an abortionist who confessess immediately that he has no idea whether the fetus is a person or not, and does not have a clear definition of a person which he attempts to defend. Unsuprisingly Socrates trashes this position, but this will have little effect upon anyone who has thought seriously about the obvious fact that rational capacity is what most adult humans (including those sleeping, vegging out, or in temporary comas) have, and which human bodies which are brain dead or which have not yet developed brains do not.In part two Socrates debates a \\"philosopher\\" whom we learn right away is a defender of \\"relativism and utilitarianism.\\" Now either Kreeft is unaware that relativism and utilitarianism are incompatible philosophies, or he naively believes that other people, including real philosophers who defend abortion, are unaware of this. In either case he's wrong on fundamental points, and hence again it is no surprise both that \\"Socrates\\" can demolish this \\"opinion\\" and also that this has absolutely nothing to do with any serious philosophical defenses of abortion.About the third section, where Socrates debates a pop psychologist who thinks that feelings are more important than truth, there's little more to say, and the conclusions drawn are obvious. If Keeft's point is that it is easy to knock down straw men, then he has accomplished something, but this is hardly news. If his goal was to argue that the *actual* arguments given by *actual* philosophers or medical professionals on this issue are incorrect, he has missed his target by a mile. Socrates/Kreeft spends most of his time showing that all of the supposed \\"arguments\\" for abortion are moot or seriously weakened if the fetus is a person. This is challenged by a few philosophers like Judith Jarvis Thomson or Jane English, whose arguments are simply ignored here. But even if we conceded the point, this simply emphasizes how useless the whole dialogue was because he *never* considers a serious argument that the fetus is, while human, *not* a person, though there are many in the philosophical literature which he could have drawn from here. Don Marquis, John Noonan, and Sidney Callahan have much more serious pro-life arguments in their widely-anthologized articles, which also try to seriously engage actual pro-choice arguments rather than simply ignore them in hopes that nobody will notice, and I would recommend their works over Kreeft's rather fluffy treatment."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"I think Aristotle would have been a more honest choice for Kreeft as a conservative Catholic, and as a source of &quot;natural law&quot; popular discourse that advances a priori reasoning, teleology and a debatable, unscientific theory of essences. The reader is recommended to consult Trefil and Morowitz's work to see how Aristotlean anti-abortion arguments collapse before an elaborated scientific framework."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"I consider Kreeft's work to contain one dubious central lacunae, which should be apparent to any honest classicist reader. In his Timmaeus, Plato talks about the chora, an empty, receptive and nurturant space that is configured as &quot;mother.&quot; In Kreeft's recapitulation of Aristotle and Plato, women still occupy the place of the chora in anti-abortion discourse, and this means that his argument founders on a serious a priori flaw. Women are not passive receptacles, they are active embodied, relational citizens. Thus, their own interests or obligations to others must be considered in any proper consideration of abortion ethics. Unfortunately, Kreeft only succeeds in showing us how anti-abortion discourse screens out women's bodies, accounts of their own lives, and social relationships. From a Lockean perspective, we can then move on to establish harm and injury on empirical grounds that must affect any serious evaluation of the abortion issue. As for our friend Hypatia, I suggest that any dramatised rebuttal of this book include a character called Cora, who will voice the narratives that this book tries to silence."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"I see that the same shrill anti-abortion polemics in defense of the moribund Aristotlean theory of &quot;logic&quot; and &quot;rationality&quot; are advanced here. To put it bluntly, playing with loaded dice does not a fair game make.Anti-abortionists should be honest and admit what really happens in Kreeft's book. There is an a priori conservative Catholic natural law position taken that the zygote, embryo or foetus is a &quot;person&quot;, and the author produces a set of syllogisms that are based on isolated tenets or scraps of evidence that constitute a loaded &quot;case&quot; against the right to choose abortion. The embryo or foetus is assumed to have an essence and develop according to a teleology. That's fine, but I agree with the previous pro-choice reviewer that cited Trefil and Morowitz. Genetic codes and resort to irrelevant surface attributes that don't affect prenatal viability do not a scientific argument make.Or perhaps Kreeft and his defenders are not interested in a scientific basis for anti-abortion philosophy? For a pro-choice theological defence of women's reproductive choice that does use science, and which unmasks the implication of natural law theory in biological determinist arguments that underpin anti-abortion discourse, homophobia and slavery, see Beverly Harrison's excellent Our Right to Choose (Beacon, 1983)"},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Kreeft's so-called socratic argument does not find it neccessary to include scientfic propositional content in his work on abortion, yet surely it is science that proves that anti-abortionists have no factual basis for their claims that the embryo or foetus is an autonomous organism. A shallow display of Aristotlean a priori reasoning, debatable essences not based on scientific fact, and an argument that doesn't work in real life. Hypatia, break Socrates out of there!!"},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Kreeft's book is responsible for a second-generation neo-Aristotlean piece entitled Politically Correct Death, but his own book lacks any empirical or scientific referents to prove his points.That is where his book falls down,as Aristotlean philosophy was never dependent on rigorous scientific evidence to begin with, and replete with a priori assumptions that led to its abandonment after the Renaissance. I agree with other pro-choice reviewers who argue that Kreeft's book is not a proper socratic dialogue, but a repetitious monocausal set of Aristotlean syllogisms. I think feminists should write our rebuttal of this book and use our own classical philosopher of note, Hypatia, to counter its flawed arguments. Would the next anti-abortion reviewer please respond through epistemology, and not through personal invective, thank you?"},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"The previous reviewer argued that the book in question caused people to re-evaluate their views on abortion. According to the New Zealand reviewers,the book in question screens out womens bodies and narratives about the consequences of abortion for them and their own self-interest. I thought socratic dialogue involved critical assessment of both sides of an epistemological case? This book does not do that. I also find it fascinating that the book deals with a dialogue between two men on this issue, but I suppose that is the anti-abortion argument for you- abstract deontological axioms that have no reference to women's lives or empirical scientific facts about abortion. Hypatia and her other friend are right- feminists need to author our own rebuttal to this and argue our own consequentialist ethics of abortion"},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Peter Kreeft shows takes just about every argument for abortion and completely refutes it perfectly. A must read for people on both sides. Some people said he lacked scientific info.

Not only it is masterful and clever but allows the pro-abortionist to fully develop his argument, only to be met by an utter refutal founded not in emotions or theology but by pure, plain rationality.A must for any pre-med, current doctor and those who pursue knowledge."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"I loved the book so much that I translated it in French and have used it with some of my students in Quebec.

Peter Kreeft breaks the arguments down to the first premise in a fun and enlightening way. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"The indictment is clear, but the argument for it is still rather sketchy and limited. Those who perpetrate abortions are murderers (though a woman who allows her fetus to be killed is merely an unwitting murderer, tricked by modern philosophy). This is a somewhat brief, breezy, and entertaining look at the question of abortion, and it is surely no surprise that Peter Kreeft, a Catholic apologist of some fame and doggedness, has his rational Socrates come down squarely against the practice. Still, you've got to give Kreeft some high marks for not once refering to the Bible or religion to make his case against abortion. The three quick dialogues wander a bit, seemingly to make the characters appear real and their conversations off-the-cuff, but when the participants finally get around to making their best points, they all make fairly good ones. In my view, Kreeft is correct to center the entire moral argument for and against abortion on the personhood of the human embryo and fetus. Nevertheless, his case for considering the human fetus as a person -- made through Socrates' question-answer dialectic -- is sound but weak. Much more could be said in objection to Socrates' rapid, blithe conclusion that the human zygote should be considered a person than Kreeft allows his pro-choice opponents to say. Also, Kreeft does not even enter the world of law and democratic politics, which are, of course, as firmly in the center of the abortion debate as the definition of the fetus. Still, let me be clear, I am pro-life and agree with Socrates' conclusions. I just don't think his opponents in this debate are given the best or fullest challenges to the pro-life position. All in all, this is a worthwhile read. Sad to say, though: it has probably had little to no affect on the abortion debate. But all those who are pro-life must keep on talking, trying to persuade people to see the evils of this practice, in the dim hope that some day we shall overcome. We have no other choice."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Peter Kreeft, who truly is one America's great academic gems, and a prolific author has done an excellent job with this book on the topic of abortion.He uses both humor and logic to prove a point - that abortion is gravely evil and is objectively wrong.In the book Socrates and an abortionist get into many discussions with respect to what is a person, is abortion murder, etc. Kreeft does an a great job with presenting both sides of the \\"debate\\" (debate is in quotation marks because there really is no debate - just certain individuals displaying the effects of original sin - i.e. the pro-death people, the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, etc.) The dialog is fast paced, entertaing and educational. Kreeft has put a lot of thought into this book. It is not an academic treatise on why abortion is wrong, but rather a \\"down-to-earth\\" presentation on the topic. I hight encourage anyone to read it.After reading this book with careful thought, one can only come to the conclusion that the 4000 deaths per day in this country from abortionists must be stopped.Our Lady of Guadeloupe, pray for us. St. Joseph, patron of departing souls, pray for us."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Kreeft does a good job of capturing the character of Socrates as it has been recorded in the books that are believed to be actual accounts of conversations with him. Kreeft's Socrates helps modern men thoroughly examine the issues of abortion in a logical manner. The book also has humor that fans of the straightforward Socrates reasoning will especially enjoy."},{"Title":"The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion","review":"Despite the New Zealand trashing of this book, I found it very worthwhile. As a previous review pointed out, if nothing else, the book makes one examine his or her life and beliefs about abortion.I love the book and the dialogue was very intreging.

Enjoyable book over all.I would have liked to see a little more work with anti-abortion ideas rather than just dismantling pro-abortion ideas."},{"Title":"Cold War Fighter Pilot","review":"Whether you're a pilot (of any experience level) or simply an aviation/military buff who has never been at the controls of an airplane, this book is an exceptional read. Captain Wade does a wonderful job giving you the feel of the Air Force culture of that period, of creating a picture of the lives of the men (they were all men back then) who kept us safe during the cold war, and of bringing us with him into the cockpit for many different flights and types of missions. As a jet pilot myself I found the discussion of instrument procedures and radar/ATC services fascinating - but I should also add that nothing he presented was too technical for anybody who might just be interested in some good flying stories. In every story I felt like I was right there in the cockpit with him. I was on the edge of my seat reading about his missed approach at well below minimum fuel, I could feel the pucker factor of returning from a middle of the night scramble back into below minimums weather that no freight dog would consider flying in, and I could feel the tension of trouble shooting maintenance problems in flight because they could not be clearly reproduced on the ground. This man can really tell a story, and I think I've learned some things from him.Captain Wade, sir, America is strong today because men like you raised your right hand and swore to defend us. Whether those men strapped on airplanes, sat in front of scopes, turned wrenches, or operated a radio and code key in some remote place, you did it to make sure we stayed free.

Each picture is accompanied by a historical and analytical text. This book is a great collection to add to your bathroom reading material."},{"Title":"Outhouses by Famous Architects","review":"Outhouses by Famous Architects clearly is a fine mixture of cerebral humor.

But, they do the right thing: they head down to the Bayport County office to apply for gold-hunting permits.In the recent past, we've seen the devastating consequences of inexperienced or unlicensed quail hunting. Why should gold be any different?Well, the revised version sold here has Frank and Joe as shameless scofflaws, brazenly hunting for hidden gold without the proper permits. They are correctly described as wearing fuzzy hats with big earflaps, though, perhaps so as not to hear the wailing of approaching forestry ranger sirens.Of course, I won't tell you whether they actually find the hidden gold for which they are hunting. However, one last thought: whose gold IS it, really?Great point."},{"Title":"Hunting for Hidden Gold (Hardy Boys, Book 5)","review":"This is very exciting. I don't know how they made the words Black Pepper and other names. This is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Hunting for Hidden Gold (Hardy Boys, Book 5)","review":"At last the Joe and Frank Hardy and their father Fenton get away from Bayport for a mystery. I always thought Bayport must not be a very safe place with all the crime that seems to occur there. Anyway, the boys are wandering around in the fog near Bayport when they encounter an old man who was accidentally shot by hunters. The boys learn that the old man is Mike Onslow, who the boys were seeking because of his knowledge of the Lucky Lode area in Montana. Their father is chasing criminals in the area and he was hoping that Mike could provide information about where the crooks could be holed up.Mike tells the boys about his time in that area as a gold miner. Mike and three other miners were getting ready to leave their claim when Black Pepper and his gang jumped them. One of the miners, Bart Dawson, had a plane nearby with the gold already on board. Bart slipped away and took off. When Black Pepper and his men followed Bart, the other three miners escaped from the cabin. The miners were supposed to meet up later to split the gold. However, Bart Dawson disappeared. Mike then drew the boys a map of the area.The boys travel to Montana through Chicago. In Chicago, men posing as their father's associates kidnap them. After a harrowing escape and stupid actions on the part of the kidnappers, the boys were able to continue on their journey.In Montana it appears their adversaries are ruthless, and their adversaries attempt numerous times to stop the Hardys from investigating their activities, including trying to kill the Hardy boys and their father. As the story proceeds, we learn that there may be someone telling the criminals about the Hardys' plans. Who can the Hardys trust? The boys also fend off assassins, a fall from a cliff, and a cave-in in their most harrowing adventure yet. All the while the boys and their father must discover the hideout of the criminals, and, as you have already guessed, where the gold from the plane is located and what happened to Bart Dawson.The Hardy Boys face many mysteries and yet the author managed to clearly explain how the mysteries did or did not relate to each other. Each of the first five Hardy Boys mysteries were quick, enjoyable reads, and I would recommend them for children in the age range of about eight through whatever age the series holds their interest.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"Hunting for Hidden Gold (Hardy Boys, Book 5)","review":"Hardy Boys, Hunting for Hidden Gold is one of the best books I have read in my life. It combines mystery, adventure, and suspense all crammed in one book. The Hardy Boys series is a really great series. I usually don't like mystery books but this one is really good.Unlike some books that have boring parts. Hunting for Hidden Gold doesn't have any boring parts. That is very good. I really don't like parts where they just talk and talk about boring things that don't interest me. The Hardy Boys have been around for awhile and people still read them. Hardy Boys can be read by all ages. it is not really hard to read. In the whole Hardy Boys series there are 58 books. I am looking forward to reading more books from the series. Hunting for Hidden Gold is a sort of long book. It is about 150 pages long. That is not too long but it is not very short either. Since it is long, it gets lots of action in it. If it was any longer, it would have some boring parts in it. In conclusion, this book deserves five stars."},{"Title":"Hunting for Hidden Gold (Hardy Boys, Book 5)","review":"This review concerns the 1928 edition. When Fenton Hardy is injured during a case, he asks Frank and Joe to join him in Montana to find some stolen gold. I'd more accurately give the book 4.5 stars. The mystery was great, with plenty of action and the book was well-written; however, the book is half over before Frank and Joe finally reach Montana and I found that this was too long. Also, while it was good to see Frank And Joe singlehandedly catch the criminals for a change, unlike the first four books, it seemed a little too simple. But, still, it was an enjoyable book; well worth reading."},{"Title":"Hunting for Hidden Gold (Hardy Boys, Book 5)","review":"This review is of the 1963 Revised Version of \\"Hunting for Hidden Gold\\". The first 38 titles in the series were revised over the course of 15 years (some with minor changes, others were completely re-written). \\"Hunting for Hidden Gold\\" is the fifth Hardy Boys mystery. This edition is said to be drastically altered from the original. What this means, according to the Hardy Boys Unofficial Home Page, is that the text and plot have both been changed.Frank and Joe Hardy become involved in another mystery when their father calls them out west to help with a case. They are searching for a gang that is involved in robbery, and even on the way out west, they are kidnapped and attacked and it is only with great luck that they even are able to meet up with their father. They find him hurt badly, but begin the investigation on their own and learn about a mystery about gold that was stolen from a prospector years ago. Can the brothers keep out of harm's way long enough to solve the case?\\"Hunting for Hidden Gold\\" is another solid offering in the Hardy Boys series, though I would not say this is one of the best. It is a bit of an adventure story and it gives the sense of really being out west (as opposed to a story set in Bayport). There is a definite sense of place in this book. As usual, this book is recommended for kids of all ages (even the 25 year old kid).-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Hunting for Hidden Gold (Hardy Boys, Book 5)","review":"I read this particular number of the Hardy Boys series only after reaching middle age.

The ice skating scenes were realistic and got me involved. The little house falling over the hillside I found hard to understand, as the boys cooked something on the stove after that. I assume it's a type of structure or something 1920's that I might not understand. Riding the train into Chicago was true to life for a small town boy, also the snow storms in Montana, are written by someone who had experienced them, or better had a strong imaginative understanding of situations.

Even more so, they always seem to enlist the help of friends such as Biff, Chet, Iola, and Callie. However, in book five of the series, the author takes a different approach.The location of this story is \\"Big Sky\\" Country, AKA Montana. Fenton Hardy, father of Frank and Joe, has asked his sons to help him round up a gang of thieves who also seem to be implicated in a botched gold heist some 25 years in the past. The gold, while not stolen, has been missing ever since. Hence the set up for the adventure.Personally, this book did not work for me as much as the previous four have. First, being on location in Montana, searching for hidden gold, allows this book to be more of a cowboy/western adventure than a good mystery. For those who like cowboy/western adventures you'll definitely like the story, I just don't care for the genre. Next, the supporting cast of characters have changed dramatically. There are no \\"chums\\" to help out and even their father has been nearly written out of the story delivering the occasional one-liner, such as \\"Be careful boys.\\" The entire book rests with Frank and Joe. Finally, the book did not read as smooth as the others have. The plot was rather confusing with the introduction of several new characters. You almost had to keep notes as to who was who.

I tried to research the ratings on this novel and I was disappointed to find nothing as I scoured online for more information. I just finished the book though and it definitely delivers in all the right ways that a dark and fantastic novel should. I am an AVID reader and love novels, fantasy and sci-fi and this story is unlike anything I have read before.It is set in an unending castle and when I try to imagine the immensity of this castle with its never-ending rooms and corridors and catacombs, it is almost like imagining the very concept of infinity and so that task is too daunting for my mind but it still leaves a sense of awe within your mind's eye at the magnitude of this huge structure. The story was very well put together with only one discrepancy that I caught but well worth the read! This is the best $5 I spent in my life. The author - Penelope Love - has an expertise in the vocabulary and syntax she uses in the book. It is singular and ties in very well with the whole atmosphere of the book.Penelope Love knows how to play into the dark fears of the human mind - ones you never knew would have existed without this book to bring them back into the surface of the wake of your consciousness. The castle has immensity that knows no bounds, the main character suffered amnesia and only remembers bits and snatches of her past life, there are castle politics and intrigues, magic and sorcery, unseemly at times but interesting characters, and various relentless foes and set orders and rules that can drive a person to despair.I don't want to ruin the book for future readers but I can't stress enough that this is a hidden and overlooked gem and it pangs me deeply that it is out of print. More people really need to read this! Perhaps one of the ONLY things I didn't like was the ending! I wish Penelope Love would write a sequel to this. But anyways, I think I have said enough of praise that you should pick this book up and be confused but intrigued enough to read it since I have not written a proper summary for that very reason!"},{"Title":"Prepare for the Great Tribulation Volume 9","review":"for all that are interested in the &#34;last days&#34;, this is a must read.

I understand why the author had to include this information, but it is still difficult reading for those of us who consider our dogs our friends -- and who applies electric shock to their friend? I only wish she had placed the caveats of using these methods at the beginning, rather than at the end, of their respective sections.If you are looking for more depth and science than found it dog training books or &quot;Don't Shoot the Dog,&quot; in a book that won't bore you to tears, get a copy of Excel-erated Learning, well worth it's reasonable price."},{"Title":"Excel-Erated Learning: Explaining in Plain English How Dogs Learn and How Best to Teach Them","review":"This is a terrific book for students wishing to fully understand learning theory.

It is about how dogs learn and the why behind it, covering all the different training techniques and how learning occurs through those techniques. For the average reader, it can get a little heavy going with the jargon and theory at times, but I think Pam uses good illustrative examples at the right moments to help you through. Don't be too put off, you will definitely take a lot away from this book.Dog trainers:This book was good reinforcement of the concepts I have learnt in my dog training & behaviour course (the book was recommended by the facilitator).

The second thing I find extremely inappropriate is the author's advocacy of leash jerks, shock collars and ear pinches. There is plenty of new research out there that offers ways to train your dog without doing irreparable damage to your relationship or exercising animal abuse as a sound way to exhibit control.

Rosa was arrested when she sat in the colored section of a Montgomery, Alabama bus. A white person came on, and she refused to leave her seat to give white passengers more room to sit. When arrested, she confronted the policeman and asked him if he wasn't ashamed of enforcing these laws. Subsequently, she lost her job due to taking the stance she did. Martin Luther King and Ralph Abernathy subsequently led protests to desegregate the Montgomery bus lines. Parks helped in organizing the 13 month protest.This was a brave lady, who endured threats of violence. She took a stance that was against the standing norms. King and Abernathy's protests and non violent demonstrations showed how this unfair these laws were.This also shows the later life of Parks as she worked in offices and factories in Detroit. She did not benefit financially from her stance in later life, living a normal existence. She endured much personal disappointment, but her arrest and stance changed the country.A good read about a courageous American."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"An inspirational story about the life of Rosa Parks, a mulatto woman who refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Montgomery AL on Dec 1, 1955. Her courageous act became known as the beginning of the Civil Rights movement in the United States. Her quiet and non violent action sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycot, provided the NAACP with a model case to end Jim Crow laws in the South and gave opportunity for young minister, Martin Luther King, Jr. to display his enormous leadership potential. The story reveals little known facts about the quiet and demure seamstress. It tells of her personal struggles with racism, poverty and chauvinism. It is a heroic story of an ordinary person with incredible inner strength."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"Written with an eloquence and grace more often associated with poets than with academic historians, Douglas Brinkley's biography of Rosa Parks (part of the highly-touted Viking 'Penguin Lives' Series) is a moving portrait of an iconic American figure. 'Rosa Parks' relates not only the climactic moment of Ms. Parks' courageous refusal to relinquish her seat on a segregated bus one winter day in Montgomery Alabama, which triggered one of the seminal events of the Civil Rights Movement, it also weaves together a compelling narrative of one woman's path from the struggles of her youth in Tuskegee, Alabama to her post-boycott experiences in Montgomery and Detroit. Brinkley's research for the book is remarkable. He obtained rare interviews with Ms. Parks herself, and presents illuminating new details about her life and the Civil Rights Movement of which she was a part. Brinkley's depiction of Ms. Parks' encounter with Nelson Mandela alone will move even the most jaded of readers. Intended for lay readers while invaluable for scholars, Brinkley's exquisite literary craftsmanship has resulted in a work that will stand as a classic, not only in the fields of African-American and women's history, but among the great works of American history and biography as a whole."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"Douglas Brinkley brings out the essence of Rosa Parks' humanity and her role in the Civil Rights movement. This short, highly-readable book provides useful background on Mrs. Parks' parents, early childhood, and introduction to the NAACP.The impact of Rosa Parks' actions on her family and friends was among the most revealing aspects of the book. The web of support, before and after her refusal to give up her seat, is truly inspirational.The author explores in detail the involvement of Mrs. Parks in the NAACP, church groups, and other activist organizations during the early-to-mid '50s. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s first national exposure in the movement is interesting for those not having read &quot;Parting the Water...&quot; and other such works.Douglas Brinkley's telling of the Rosa Parks story is not the first - and certainly not the last - but is the best!"},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"Walking into restaurants and shopping malls, I see short and tall people, young and old people, and black and white people. You may be thinking, &quot;Well, DUH!&quot;, but think about it for a minute...were black people always allowed to eat with and shop where white people did? I don't think so! I mean if it weren't for certain people such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, black and white people wouldn't even be able to drink out of the same water fountain, let alone shop and eat among each other.After reading the book entitled Rosa Parks, written by Douglas Brinkley, I realized that life today isn't at all the same as life was 50 years ago.Rosa Parks is mainly an autobiography of Rosa Parks. It does although mention other great people such as Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth. All these people helped create equality throughout all of the human races.On December 1, 1955, a 42-year old black woman, named Rosa Louise Parks, refused to give up her seat to a white man. You see, back then, white people had the privilege of sitting in the front of the bus, due to their so-called &quot;superiority&quot; over blacks, and blacks were sent to the back. Rosa Parks' refusal set off a 381-day boycott led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and is now considered to have been the beginning of the American civil rights movement.Rosa Parks' case was different from many other people who disobeyed the laws. Rosa Parks had this biblical quality, which made her a saint, somewhat divine. Also, Rosa Parks only spent 2 hours in jail, while others were in for days, weeks, perhaps even months.This book not only recognizes some of the most influential people of all time, but also tells exactly how black people were treated and how they reacted.If you are interested in finding out more about Rosa Parks and other interesting people, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"I do not think this is a very good book for a book report on Rosa Parks. Despite the fact the title is \\"Rosa Parks\\", I received more information on other things that were happening at the time and about other people than you did about Rosa Parks. However, this is a good book if you are doing a report or want to learn about African American History in the late 1800s and 1900s."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"The most recent in the highly-praised &quot;Penguin Lives&quot; series, Douglas Brinkley's brilliant portrait of Rosa Parks is an example of biography at its best. Brinkley's breathtaking research and literary skill are combined in this book to produce a narrative that not only vividly paints the story of Rosa Parks' life, but that also illuminates the complexities of the Civil Rights Movement of which she was an important part. Beginning with her youth in Tuskegee, Alabama, Brinkley adroitly weaves together the details from Rosa Parks' life which shaped her character and her values. In elegant prose, he depicts the path that led to the legendary day in 1955 when Rosa Parks refused to move from her seat on a segregated bus; he then leads the reader through the journey of the Montgomery bus boycott and the half century Ms. Parks has lived since. This slim biography manages to trace the significance of figures from Booker T. Washington, to Martin Luther King, Jr., to Nelson Mandela in Rosa Parks' experience without ever losing focus on Ms. Parks herself. It compellingly shows that Parks' religious faith and her unwavering strength of character are essential keys to understanding her life and worldview. Brinkley's &quot;Rosa Parks&quot;, however, is not a mere hagiography of an American heroine. The rare interviews that the author obtained from Rosa Parks and the extensive research that he unearthed throughout Alabama and Detroit, where Ms.Parks has lived for many years, provide the foundation for a biography that contains both individual depth and historical breadth. This beautifully written book is certain to become a classic for lay readers and scholars alike."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"For those of us who have not experienced the segregated South of the early 50's, this slim volume paints a vivid picture of what life was like for Rosa Parks. Thorough research gives us a rich picture of the influences of the people and forces in her life. Far from being a tired seamstress, it portrays Mrs. Parks as a bright and inquisitive woman, willing to risk everything for what she believed. Disappointments and disillusionment are also chronicled, but we never lose sight of her essential strength."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"Every American should know the story of Rosa Parks and all the people who helped dismantle Jim Crow and raise the dignity of all Americans. This is a fascinating and enlightening book that would serve well to be a part of every American's library. Despite its modest size it packs plenty of details most likely not part of the familar Rosa Parks lore. For instance, the bus driver James Blake had previously had a run in with her 12 years earlier and had since become a person she avoided. Also she had attended non violence resistance workshops at a School in Tennesee before her arrest. That her father had left when she was a child and that her husband was a barber who later had a drinking problem. These details give us insight to the human being Rosa Parks was and is today. The most important thing I got from this book is that courage, intelligence and hard work of many people are required to change society for the better."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"This biography of Rosa Parks presents a very well balanced, fair description of its subject. Regrettably, as with Martin Luther King Jr., social activists and historians have all too often exalted the heroes of the Civil Rights movement beyond the bounds of human existence. This deification is both degrading and unfair, as it not only deprives our heroes of the right to live - and die - as normal human beings, but it also places many of them out of reach - discouraging many to whom them would otherwise serve as excellent role models.In refreshing contrast to that destructive tendency, this book does an excellent job of peeling back the aura around Rosa Parks and depicting her as the simple, virtuous woman that she is. Brinkley's depiction of her is refreshingly human and honest, and he does a magnificent job of describing her in the simple, straightforward way that so characterizes her.Also worthy of note is Brinkley's willingness to include so many of Rosa Park's circle of acquaintances in his narrative. From her hard-drinking yet loyal husband to people who have met her only briefly, he touches on their influences on her life, their reaction to her, and what they all mean within the greater scope of her place in our history and society.Regrettably, whites - with a few notable exceptions - are seen as oppressive, racist boors with a permanent vendetta. Even at that time, that was not true.Overall, this book is an excellent, enjoyable, and enlightening read - and one that does refreshing justice to the woman and warrior that Rosa Parks is.&lt;P..."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"The preceding reviewers of this little book sum the whole darn thing up nicely. So I thought I'd pipe up to say YES! I wholeheartedly agree that this is a delightful book. It, in fact, has inspired me to embark upon what is becomming a &quot;phase&quot; of reading on the subject of the African-American experience. I even went so far as to walk the African-American Freedom Trail (a National Park) in Boston, MA while I was here on business! This is the stuff that public school educations SHOULD be made of.P.S. I can't wait to get my hands on the Penguin Lives book on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"Rosa Parks is a name we should know. As an icon of the civil rights movement, her legendary refusal to give up her seat on the segregated bus started one of the greatest revolutions since the Civil War. Many of us a familiar with this non-assuming woman who was the catalyst in inspiring the careers of Martin Luther King, Jr. and other famous civil rights activists.We are comfortable with the image of the mild mannered Christian woman who always stayed in the background. Ah, but just how much do we really know about Rosa Parks except for the myth created? Are we really appreciative and aware of this woman who has been ignored only to be thought of again when politically expedient for others? Douglas Brinkley, in this short concise biography, removes the shroud of obscurity and myth about Rosa Parks. For the first time we are shown that the &quot;Mother of the Civil Rights Movement&quot; was more militant than we suspect. A highly intelligent and organized person, Mrs. Parks was an activist long before her famous bus ride and was very informed about what was going on in the movement locally as well as globally.The Rosa Parks presented in this text had a great aura of spirituality, strength and dignity that exuded calm during a period of unrest. Misunderstood by her peers and her friends Rosa Parks emerged as the underlying spirit that enabled the movement to begin its course of action.We learn about the Rosa Parks who was a quiet young woman but had a fierce anger against injustice. She stayed an activist throughout her life inspite of the personal hardships in her marriage and with her mother.She is a woman of great spiritual strength and power. Brinkley presents us with a portrait of a woman that we never knew and have come to rediscover."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"True Life: Rosa ParksBy: Mariah SanchiousThis book states all the facts about Mrs. Rosa Parks and how she basically struggled to be equal her whole life. Mrs. Parks didn't really understand in her young years, why they happened to be separated by color. As she grew older she began to learn why. Why did she make such a difference in the south? Come experience her growing up memories with me and how she had a huge impact on today's society.I enjoy this book because it notified me that people struggled to get what I have. Even though Mrs. Parks isn't before Irene Morgan or Claudette Colvin she made her stand up for her rights famous. She went through things like getting kicked out of restaurants to getting threating phone calls. She also cost her husband Raymond Parks his corner barbershop job. She also had KKK mobs running up and down the street throwing fires. She worked all the way on the opposite side of town and she walked six miles everyday until justice was served. As this happened to her, her close friend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's house was burned down. His church also got burned down while two little girls were in the bathroom. She later lost her job and her husband was abused by policeman. She was also aware that her friends got raped and murdered by policeman and nothing would be done about it. A lot of pregnant women would walk a great distance just to protest with the bus boycott. People really believed separate but equal but a lot of African American leader strived to make that change.I also enjoyed how the book gives specific details on her childhood years. Rosa McCauley was born on February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama. She had a mom Leona that was a rural school teacher, and she had a dad James that was a carpenter. In her toddler years her mom and dad separated and Rosa, her younger brother Sylvester, and her mom moved into a farm. They moved in with their former slaved grandparents in Pine Level, Alabama. She was home schooled until she was old enough to realize how the law was. At age eleven she went to an all girl's school with her friend Jonnie Carr. She continued that all girls school until she went to college. She went to Alabama State College for Negroes but had to dropout because her mom and grandmother were diagnosed with a terminal illness. That's when she got a job and married a local barber named Raymond Parks.I also enjoyed how they showed how much awards she received and how much honor she received when she died. after the Montgomery Bus Boycott,In 1979, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People awarded Parks the Spingarn Medal, its highest honor, and she received the Martin Luther King Sr. Award the next year. She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1983 for her achievements as a civil rights activist. She was aslo asked to welcome Nelson Mandela from is imprisoning in South Africa. She also received rthe Rosa Parks Piece Prize in 1994 in Swedan. She also received the highest award given by the U. S Executive Branch in 1996 called the Presedintal Medal of Freedom. She also received the highest award from the legislative branch in 1999 called the Conggressional Gold Medal. Sha also got the Windsor-Detroit International freedom award that was pesented to her at the Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival. She died in Detroit, Michigan at age 92.In conclusion, I would like to say that Rosa Parks stood up for a lot of coloreds . Her and all the civil rights activist led us to vitory and achieved their goal. Those 382 days of that bus boycott proved that we are strong and can do and be anything that we want to be. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys learning about black history. I also would like to say that this book makes you apprciate everything you have. It also has makes you feel that your in the obsticles that happened to african americans. I think that people would enjoy this book a lot ."},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"I knew who Rosa Parks is. Who doesn't? But I had no idea just what all went on in the beginning of the Civil Rights movement. I literally had no idea. I have been reading bits and pieces of the Civil Rights Movement and the more I read, the more I am appalled that we, as a country, even had to go through something like this. The more I read, the more flabberghasted I am at what Americans in our own country had to endure simply because of the color of their skin. I've never quite understood the hatred and the anger that went on for years and after reading this book, I must say that I have the upmost admiration for Rosa Parks, a gentle woman who was not only bone-tired that fateful day, but was also tremendously involved with ending segration in her own hometown. Then after that fateful day, she was thrust upon a national stage where her name was linked right along with Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcom X and other famous leaders of the Civil Rights Leaders.And what a woman! What a story! I had no idea of what all went on and this book did a great compilation of facts of not only Parks' own history, but of the times and people that went on during those early years. I must say that times were fraught with tension and fear, but Rosa never let it stop her from living her life as she saw fit to live. After reading this biography, she is definitely now one of my favorite heroes of all time. This woman has the courage that not even a lot of men had. She is inspirational even now because she stood her ground because of her moral convictions that it was time to stop all the injustice and craziness that was going on simply because of one's skin color.I picked this book up two nights ago and to my surprise, as I thought it was a dry biography at first, I could not wait to read more of this book until I finished it tonight. It's kind of strange to say that a biography is a page-turner because I normally don't find biographies a page-turner ... but this one definitely is. My illusions of a shy gentle woman who was just sick and tired of being bullied were shattered by the wealth of information that this biographer had on Mrs. Parks. This woman did more to further the Civil Rights movement than people realized.Rosa Parks is definitely a hero that all people should read on ... she is one tough act to follow.6/12/10"},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"This book was very informational and very detailed. I loved learning about each part of Rosa Parks life. I did not know much about her from the beginning and this book helped me a lot. It was a good length and had very good comments with it. I would highly recommend it for those who are wanting to learn more about her and the life she lead. She is an amazing women and Douglas Brinkley did a wonderful job of showing it!"},{"Title":"Rosa Parks","review":"On December 1, 1955, a 42 -year old African American seamstress, Rosa Parks, earned a place in history by refusing to give up her seat on a bus in Jim Crow Montgomery, Alabama. Parks's action sparked a 381 day boycott of the bus system. It lead as well to related litigation in a case called Browder v. Gale in which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional segregated seating in buses. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. rose to prominence as a result of his leadership of the boycott, which marked the watershed event of the modern Civil Rights Movement.Douglas Brinkley's short biography, \\"Rosa Parks\\" (2000) is part of the acclaimed Penguin Lives series, but it differs from its companion volumes in two ways. First, Brinkley's book appears to be the only volume of the series devoted to a person still alive at the time of the writing. The other highly diverse subjects of the series all were long dead at the time their Penguin biography appeared.Second, virtually all the subjects of the Penguin series had been the subjects of much longer and detailed earlier biographies. The Penguin series and similar series were written to provide short overviews of important lives for busy people. But when it was written, Brinkleys' book was the only full-length biographical study of Rosa Parks, and it remains so today. Parks's autobiography, \\"My Story\\", was written for young people. Thus, Brinkley's book remains, at present, the standard biography of Parks.Brinkley's book is valuable for the light it casts on Rosa Parks's life and character, her relationships with other figures from the Civil Rights Movement, and life in the segregated South. Most readers are likely unfamiliar with the story of Parks's life beyond her courageous action on December 1, 1955. Brinkley sets the stage for this action in terms of character and circumstance and its follow-up in Parks's subsequent long life. Parks's father abandoned his poor rural Alabama family when Rosa McCauley was a child. As an adolescent McCauley was compelled to leave high school to care for her ailing mother. Rosa McCauley married Raymond Parks in 1932 and completed high school with the encouragement of her husband. She became politically active and succeeded in registering to vote in 1943, a rare accomplishment for African Americans in the South. Parks was highly networked to the leaders of the Civil Rights movement in Birmingham, both white and black people, and served as the secretary of the local NAACP. Although the Civil Rights community was looking to develop a test case to end bus segregation, Parks's actions on December 1, 1955, were not planned to create the test case but rather were spontaneous and the result of individual determination.In 1957, following the boycott, Parks and her husband moved to Detroit when they lost their jobs and were the subject of many threats in Birmingham. Parks lived her remaining 45 years in Detroit. She was a seamstress and an activist in her church, as she had been in Birmingham. From 1968 - 1988, Parks worked in the Detroit office of African American Congressman John Conyers. During her years in Detroit, Parks wrote her autobiography and a short inspirational book, \\"Quiet Strength\\". Among many other things, Parks became an admirer of Malcolm X (she was substantially more radical than was Dr. King), founded a series of \\"Pathways to Freedom bus tours\\", read extensively, and developed an interest in Buddhist meditation to compliment her Christian practice and belief. Parks received many honors and awards, primarily late in her life.Brinkley's book does not cover the last years of Parks's life. Upon her death in 2005, Parks became the first woman and the first American non-government official to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. Congress passed a resolution honoring Parks as the \\"Mother of the Modern-Day Civil Rights Movement.\\"Parks deserves to be remembered for her courage, her unassuming quiet character, and her accomplishments. She is among the rare group of people that are properly considered as both an individual and as a symbol for something larger than herself. Early in his book, Brinkley observes that Park's \\"character represented one of the isolated high blips on the graph of human nature, offsetting a dozen or so sociopaths.\\" (Brinkley at 4, quoting Taylor Branch, \\"Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954 - 1963) Brinkley's book will help keep Parks alive for readers.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Mineral Processing Design and Operation: An Introduction","review":"Great introduction to mineral processing with detailed analysis of the different processes involved in comminution, flotation, and other processes.

Raised by nuns after his mother's death, he served in the navy, fought sharks and pirates in the South Seas, fought just about anyone who got near him, abused drugs, and managed to scrape by in life. So, what could possibly cause this man to suffer a complete breakdown? Because that's what happened to Jamie--he awakens in a mental institution with a mixed bag of memories, a terrible fear of the coming of night, bullet wounds where the police shot him, and a strangely ambivalent feeling to Hawkes Harbor where he has spent the past several years.Author S. E. Hinton bounces around in time, from the mental institution, to the days Jamie spent with his friend Kell surviving the merchant marine, cocaine, and alcohol, finally leading to the dreadful confrontation that cost Jamie so much. But even the doctors in the mental institution, people who have seen so much, can't believe what really happened to Jamie, or the strange connection he shares with the man who rules Hawke's Harbor, the man Jamie refers to as IT.Hinton's compelling writing grips the reader, makes us savor the hints of disaster and appreciate the strange, but symbiotic relationship between Jamie and Kell, and then Jamie and Grenville. Both men struggle for their sanity and a form of redemption, find journeys that take them where they never thought they could go, and ultimately lead them to a sort of contentment that no one who knew Jamie's background (or Grenville's) could have imagined possible.This is a strange book, but it dragged me in and sucked me dry--I'm happy to recommend it."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"What a disappointment! This book reads as though it was written by two different authors. The first hundred pages are an interesting story of a young man and his adventures and then...this book totally falls apart...vampire...GIVE ME A BREAK... then, you reach the last chapter which is where the story becomes totally ridiculous. The parts do not fit together. If I were teaching cretive writing I would tell the author, \\"You can't do this.\\" The story just doesn't hold together.SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"This has got to be the best book I have EVER read. I started reading S E Hinton a long time ago and was more than just a little pleased to see she came out with a new book. I had my doubts that even a phenomenal author like Ms Hinton could write a great book after all these years. When I first started reading it I was a bit confused but that just makes the book even more interesting. As soon as I started reading I fell in love with Jamie Sommers. Jamie is exactly what you picture a hoodlum to be but can't help but to love him for all his honesty and hard work. Jamie went through a lot in the book and if you don't cry while you read this you honestly have no heart. Books usually don't touch me but this did. I can't help but to stress that you NEED to read this. This is exactly what a book should be about. This shows quality work and dedication to writing. I've always loved Ms. Hinton's work and I always will. But this novel has made me respect her perspectives and plots. She is an amazing writer. Keep up the excellent work Ms. Hinton. You show inspiring new authors what they should put into their work; heart and soul and emotions."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Is it just me or have we heard this story before.

I felt that these tales were never fully fleshed out, but nevertheless kept me interested and turning pages.Then the book takes an abysmal turn into Vampiredom and becomes silly, childish and not worth your time. The tough hero turns into Barney Fife. The evil Vampire then evolves into a well-respected Master of Industry and Everything Else. Our hero becomes best buds with the vampire that bit him. It just keeps spiraling downward, becoming ever more ridiculous and boring. The ending is the worst ever."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"S.E.

At first, you think you're reading a typical S.E. Hinton novel...troubled young man, rough childhood, etc.. Then suddenly, you're reading a ridiculous VAMPIRE story! Yes, you heard me - VAMPIRE. The craziest thing about this book is that the vampire actually gets \\"cured\\" - of course, the author never lets the reader in on how this amazing little feat occurs - but, suddenly the man that has been tortured by the vampire is now all buddy-buddy with him. Again, a very bizarre book."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I was so swept into the story, and the first hundred pages were fantastic. The character of Jaime Sommers is wonderful but as soon as I realized the Vampire thing was inteded to be \\"real\\" and not in Jaime's mind, I lost faith. I guess I was hoping for a \\"serious\\" adult book but this rapidly turned into a farce. The writing was excellent throughout, but in the end I wound up thinking it was still a book for a younger, less sophisticated reader. Could not recommend except as a novelty."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"An 8-year-old orphan boy, Jamie Sommers, is packed off to a grim Catholic orphanage in 1950 in the prologue to award-winning author Hinton's first novel in fifteen years or more. Jump to 1967 and he's an almost catatonic patient at a Delaware mental asylum. He has been transferred there from the state hospital for the criminally insane after charges of kidnapping a young woman were dropped for lack of evidence. Jamie's employer, Grenville Hawkes, a wealthy, powerful and somehow threatening scion of the town's founding family, is paying Jamie's bills, though he hasn't been to visit.Hinton reveals how Jamie got to this point through tantalizing glimpses into his tortured, fractured memories and through the tales of adventure on the high seas that he relates to Dr. Phillip McDevitt. Partnered with an older man, Kellen Quinn, Jamie has seen fortunes come and go. He has smuggled jewels and faced armed pirates; he has lost skin to sharks and outrun them too; survived foreign jails and countless fights; gun runners and vicious rich girls. So what brought him to this broken pass?We're almost halfway through the book before the real horror of Hawkes Harbor is revealed: the \\"It\\" Jamie is so terrified of, the \\"thing\\" that has engendered this swashbuckling young man's absolute terror of the dark. And it is a shock. Partly because the sharp turn into the supernatural is so unexpected. Hinton's best known YA novels, \\"The Outsiders,\\" and \\"Rumblefish,\\" are masters of street-level reality.But once the adjustment is made, this new aspect is intriguing, involving issues of addictive psychology (including coercive mind control), love and redemption. And terror, of course, plenty of visceral, graphic terror, and suspense too, though both taper off towards the end, in a resolution that defies the horror genre. Jamie is an engaging character and Hinton peppers the narrative with plenty of humor as well as dark suspense. Veering away from genre even as she incorporates its classic elements, Hinton has produced an unpredictable and compelling narrative."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Hawkes Harbor was an uninspiring, bland, boring read with characters that did not connect nor inspire sympathy, empathy, or any other response. I thought the premise of the book sounded promising; however, I finished the book feeling empty and cheated for spending the time and effort to read this drivel. It was interesting to read many of the other reviews, especially the information that this was a Dark Shadows tie-in, or was meant to be. I have never watched that show, so maybe this book could have been a little better had I been familiar with Dark Shadows.I cannot in good faith recommend this awful novel to anyone. I know that Ms. Hinton is rather popular. This was my first go at one of her books, so I will not base my overall impression/opinion of her writing style until I have tried one of her other works. As for Hawkes Harbor, I want my time invested back."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"It's hard to believe that this book was published. I suggest that future books by Hinton have a collaborator or ghost writer assigned. This story is unbelievable and I don't mean as a fantasy; so awful that I'm embarrassed for the author. The characters are less than one dimensional; I found it impossible to care about anyone in this story.Quite unlike the Outsiders."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I asked for this book for Christmas because I was a fan of Hinton's as a child and I am sadly disappointed! I finished the book only because I kept thinking it would have to get better. I would love to ask Hinton what she was thinking, to wait so long to deliver such a weak story. The main character is totally not believeable, first he is a tough guy, a troubled orphan, then he becomes someone who is \\"sobbing\\" all the time because of what happens to him which is again, totally unbelieveable. vampires? please. Toward the end, the story begins to flow more smoothly but are we really expected to believe that the vampire has become a good guy and now everyone is friends? I am sorry to have wasted my time on this book."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I don't regret reading Hawkes Harbor, but this may be because I didn't buy it myself.I liked the main character a lot, I liked the friendships and relationships he had with other characters. I liked how the story was told; the nonliniar fashion allowed for 20+ years of life to be clearly understood in the low number of pages.But, my goodness, does Ms. Hinton need an editor. If I was an english teacher, and this story was turned in to me, she'd get a C in grammar, and a B- in language use. Oh, and some points off for the unanswered questions (some raised in the last few pages).As a rainy-day read when you want a break from your normal diet of anything easily genre-classified, Hawkes Harbor is definitely a decent choice."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Simplistic, predictable, slow, and anything but horrifying. The plot starts out promising, but it's soon lost amid seemingly unimportant details that are never satisfactorily tied together. There is no mystery within these pages. The characters never really come to life. They are poorly developed stereotypes in a town that is hardly described and fails to capture the 'every town' element that might have at least kept things interesting.Jamie's breakdown foreshadows some sinister revelation that never comes. His chant of 'don't let it be dark' hints at trauma that is never described in enough detail for the reader to feel the horror, the breakdown, and the unending fear that Jamie's life embodies.The ending is a huge disappointment. I read to the end hoping there would be something that would save it, yet nothing did. The author is capable of creating worlds that are so vivid and real, it makes you wonder why she bothered to write something halfway. Detail, description, and some insight into the characters would have gone a long way to fixing this."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I don't claim to have read every vampire novel ever written, but I'd definitely like to nominate this one for the award. What starts out as an entertaining tale of bad boy Jamie Sommers quickly degenerates into an abyss of disjointed attempts at a plot. And, one would think that, with the unusual twist of the vampire being cured, e.g. no longer a vampire, that this 'cure' would be a part of the story. But no, that's not the case.Don't waste your time on this one!"},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Maybe I've lived a deprived childhood having never read a Hinton book before Hawkes Harbor, but I love this story. There is no predictablity as Jamie Sommers' life unfolds, then unravels. Jamie lives his life to the fullest but trusts the wrong people and is launched into heart wrenching situations often with no possible outcome but tragedy. Yet he perseveres thorough some of the most difficult of life situations, including horror no one would believe - even if he could speak of it. But by the end of his story, Jamie is a completely remade man with a rich life he so deserves.It is this last glimpse of his life which moves me most; and though I know I will be emotionally wrenched once again, I find myself putting that first cassette in my player and willingly live it over again.Ms. Hinton, thanks so much for this first foray into an adult story. It is one of the best I've found."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"This is my favorite book of Hinton's so far. I'm a bit perplexed by the reviews so far. I think people have had some pretty fixed expectations. I've seen vampire story fans here hating this book. That may be why. I was disappointed when I read enough into it to realize it was a vampire story. I was also very confused that Hinton would go that route. I figured maybe she needed some spending money or something. Then it took a sharp right turn and got REALLY good.So, if you want a good read, get this book but don't expect anything going into this.The first two thirds of this book are a vampire story. The vampire is a stereotype vampire, the protagonist is a stereotype warf rat. It's like two completely different cliches mixed. It's weird.Then, the vampire is cured. That's when it gets interesting. It's sick and disturbing in a very realistic, truthful way, all of a sudden. This is when she makes her point. This is when she really starts examining some raw humanity.Don't read this story is you're looking for a vampire story. This story is NOT about vampires. It just has a vampire in it. This book is as much a vampire story as Lunar Park by Bret Ellis was a horror story.In fact, I would only reccomend this book for people who don't particularly enjoy vampire stories and think Ann Rice is a bit too full of herself for no good reason."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"this is my favorite S.E.

Yet, it isn't quite as bad as the other reviews would lead you to believe. The style (use of flashbacks, 3rd person omniscient VP, etc) is entertaining, though difficult to write. It can be tedious, but ultimately you care enough about the characters to complete the book.So why the bad reviews? Simple enough. The lead character, Jamie, is not particularly likeable. Bad enough that he has little-to-no moral compass, but he has got to have the world's worst learning curve. Just when his vampire-mentor decides to play nice and take him on a cruise, he gets soused and carouses with two women - motivated to join him by who-knows-what. Just doesn't make sense, and it doesn't ingratiate him to all those female readers out there.There seems to be a trend in popular literature to make really, really unlikeable narrators. I can think of a dozen or more examples. I suppose in a high brow fashion this is an admirable challenge to a writer. Unfortunately, every book needs characters that readers like (or at least can identify with) in order to care about/like what they are reading enough to finish it and hopefully review it favorably.Ironically, this is the strength of Hinton's YA work - even if you don't like Dallas Winston, you can understand why he is who he is. That element is missing with Jamie Sommers. You don't like him, and there just isn't enough there to excuse away all his errors."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"For more than fifteen years S.E. Hinton's pen has been silent. The author of THE OUTSIDERS, RUMBLE FISH, TEX and THAT WAS THEN, THIS IS NOW has now published her first novel for an adult audience. HAWKES HARBOR is set in a tiny seaside community in Delaware, where Jamie Sommers, a mental patient, is treated at Terrace View Asylum. Dr. Phillip McDevitt tries desperately to break into Jamie's amnesia and blurred memories of the past.Hawkes Harbor becomes the key to opening Jamie's closed mind. The action begins in the past, in 1950, and then speeds forward to Jamie's present in the asylum, in 1968. A bastard and orphaned, Jamie grows up street-smart and willing to take on the entire human race. He's a likeable young man, with a slight chip on his shoulder. He becomes a sailor, serves a stint in the navy, and then embarks on a series of seafaring adventures with his friend and mentor Kell Quinn, an Irishman. Together, they set out to gather treasure from the deep and seek fortune in daring schemes. Kell is the architect and Jamie the workhorse.After having been nearly eaten alive by sharks, captured by rogue pirates and thrown in foreign prisons, Jamie and Kell attempt one final scheme --- that of gun-running. But Kell's agenda involves the IRA and Jamie is none the wiser. The ruse fails and they land in a tiny waterfront community, Hawkes Harbor. Kell has come from an educated and mannerly background and can fit in with the town's gentry. Jamie's rough edges land him in small troubles in the town and the two part ways.Jamie finds work doing odd jobs for a rich family, the Hawkes, for whom the town is named. He's fascinated by tales of treasure on the island across from the estate where he lives. His curiosity finally bests him. On the night Jamie ventures to the island to find and open a large treasure chest, his life is changed forever.Soon thereafter, he becomes the handyman and manservant for the wealthy but mysterious Grenville Hawke, a loner who resides in the bleak manor that overlooks the island. Subsequent chapters are a rollercoaster ride for the reader. Jamie falls from grace into a depressed, suicidal mental patient who is terrified of the dark, especially at the first twilight. Years of psychotherapy do little in breaking into Jamie's mind to calm his terrors.Hawkes Harbor gives one hope that Jamie will break through the curtain of darkness he has entered and tell all. But at every opportunity, McDevitt bumps into yet another closed door. The story is about relationships, however absurd. By the final chapter, there was no resolution. HAWKES HARBOR is compelling because one seeks closure to a young man's problem. I discovered none. A bizarre tale of coercion, terror, dependence and resignation, HAWKES HARBOR will certainly be an unusual pick for 2004.[...]"},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Hawkes Harbor is an extraordinary read.

And while I still watch \\"Outsiders\\" time and time again, I'll take the book anyday over the movie! So imagine the pleasant surprise I got one day when I was in the DOLLAR STORE, and this was staring me in the face. Heck yeah, I swiped that sucker up, quicker than most people blink! And I know that this isn't always the case, but there seems to be a reason as to why books like these are sold at dollar stores. S.E. Hinton sorely disappoints with her first adult novel.It centers around Jamie Sommers, a young man who's had it pretty tough most of his life. He's seen everything on a ship there is to see, and taken what life has thrown his way. From prison to fights, he's been attacked by a shark, and in the beginning (after the homely childhood prologue!) we find Jamie in a mental hospital. And eventually, we find him in the service of Grenville Hawke. So what exactly is Grenville Hawke, if not somewhat of an aristocrat? Well, he's a vampire. But does that make Jamie's story any more interesting? Not anymore than his buddy, a player who goes by the name of Kell. For me, unfortunately, it just kept getting dumber with every page.In the end, at times, you have to actually agree with Publisher's Weekly, and \\"Hawkes Harbor\\" would be one of those times. Give Hinton her first adult novel, and she uses the F word as adjectives at times, and turns what used to be great for her, into almost worthless garbage! I never thought an author could be so accomplished one day, and then be outright awful.There were a few thoughtful scenes here and there. But the next time I shop for an S.E.

His life changes when he arrives at Hawkes Harbor, Delaware looking for reported pirate treasure near Hawkes Hall. Grenville Hawke tries to kill him before hiring him. Jamie quickly calls Grenville the Thing or the Vampire. Several years later, Grenville is paying for medical treatment for his servant Jamie with Dr. McDevitt of the Terrace View Asylum, who hears quite a bloodsucking story.Highly regarded young adult author S.E. Hinton (see THE OUTSIDERS) takes her youth tales and places them in an adult setting (to include sex and profanity). The story line is actually told in flashbacks as Jamie talks about his life with McDevitt especially how he met his employer when Hawke stepped out of a coffin to drink his blood. Readers will enjoy the plot twists and along with McDevitt initially wonder if Jamie is so deranged as to believe in the supernatural, but after a time so convincing ponder whether Hawke is truly a vampire.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"The book reviews are so bad, that I will not buy it. I would be a liar if I now said that there is an unanimous reason to pick up one copy and read it from cover to cover. Maybe it would be better to use a tissue for a bookmark in the book I imagined that \\"Hawkes' Harbor,\\" would be and leave that copy for the next guy. For S.E. Hinton, it seems that she has failed to write the novel well. Maybe it's because vampire's can not feel human passion that he does not pursuit them for more than blood. The flashbacks would only make sense to vampires needing to understand something that was important to human minds. No where does it say that S.E. Hinton wanted to take us into the mind of a vampire, nor do I profess to be one. Thanks. Keep a light on."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Every October, I choose a scarey book to read in honor of my Halloween mood. I regret to say that this was my choice this year. I would be embarrased to put my name on this work of dribble. Thank goodness I still have time to go out and find a real author to read."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I purchased HAWKES HARBOR less than six hours ago and I've already finished it. The book is splendidly written in true S.E. Hinton fashion with characters and scenarios so vivid and complete. As a longtime fan of Hinton's early youth oriented works, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Needless to say, I'm pleased beyond words to see that she has returned to the writing scene and that she is writing for an older audience.S.E. Hinton is the master at creating characters that you would not necessarily want to be associated with and then pulling you into their world where you'll soon feel non-judgemental about their actions and even sympathy for their problems. The main character here is Jamie Sommers, an orphan from hard times. He works as a pirate, smuggles, drinks, whores around, and even commits murder at one point. One can't help but reference her famous character Dallas Winston from \\"The Outsiders\\" and wonder if this is what would have happened to him if he had lived. Unlike her previous books which take place in a particular setting and follow a straight forward plot, HAWKES HARBOR bounces all over the place. The reader is quickly drawn into Jamie's life as a pirate which is told in flashbacks during his stay in a mental hospital. The story turns upside down and back again as we witness Jamie trying to get back in touch with who he is and was while working as a manservant for a vampire. It sounds bizarre, but it is actually a quite touching story and full of thought provoking anecdotes about humanity, all told with a fun sense of humor.I've read THE OUTSIDERS, TEX, THAT WAS THEN THIS IS NOW, & RUMBLEFISH numerous times and I have no doubt that I will be re-reading HAWKES HARBOR many more times in the future. This is one of the most enjoyable books I've read in years and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I had no idea this book would be so compelling.

I did enjoy gothic novels (Daphne du Maurier) during my teens.Hawke's Harbor was a change of pace. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It held my interest far better than most of what I've read lately.

Hinton has been one of my favorite authors since I read The Outsiders in seventh grade and I was SO excited when I found out about Hawkes Harbor. I'm a little too old for her young adult stuff now, but everything that was appealing to me when I read her earlier books is still ever present in Hawkes Harbor. One of the things that I adore about Hinton's novels is how great she develops her characters and by the end of Hawkes Harbor I truly felt like I knew Jamie Sommers and my heart went out to him.Although Hawkes Harbor is just as appealing as Hinton's other works, it is not quite what you would expect! I've never really been a fan of horror or science fiction novels, and I was a little disappointed to find out that Grenville Hawkes was a vampire. That being my only complaint I would definitely give this book an A+. Parts of it were actually laugh out loud funny and parts of it were sad enough to nearly make me cry! If you are a fan of S.E. Hinton's earlier novels, I would definitely recommend this book to you!"},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Sloppily written tale of an orphan who grows up to befriend pirates,shrinks and vampires is annoyingly structured with virtually no plot.It had potential but it feels like a bunch of ideas lazily tossed together.The blending of different elements from pirates to vampires drew me to buy this book but pardon the ovious pun...this semi-vampire buddy novel really Sucks."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"When i started reading Hawkes Harbor, i wasn't too terribly impressed. But get past the beginning and it gets good fast. Its an incredible story and I do recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"S. E. Hinton like me must have been very taken by the T. V. series Dark Shadows. Three of the four major characters featured in Hawkes Harbor are straight out of the series. Only their names are changed. I wouldn't be surprised if the fourth major character had been buried away in episodes that either I didn't see or fail to remember. Hinton's take on the characters gives them more depth than they revealed on Dark Shadows, but Hinton's writing is fairly pedestrian. The book is a quick and good read."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"i grew up reading s.e. hinton as well, and she was the only author i was able to get my son to read. in fact, he has read all her books, and they are the only ones he has read in his 21 yrs. so when he gave me this book to read, i of course was expecting another teen book similar to her others.about halfway thru i told him this sounds like dark shadows, which i watched as a kid. he'd never even heard of it. (i guess i didnt raise him right haha) i have to say, i really enjoyed this book. it was a pleasant surprise and i think if you keep an open mind and give yourself over to the story instead of wanting it to go in a typical hinton direction, its a fun read. what i got from it was not so much a vampire story, but if you peel back the layers, it was quite touching. the 2 main characters, jaimie sommers and grenville hawkes, came full circle and by the end, both had come to depend on each other and appreciate each others loyalty, and really, despite their different stations, reguard each other as family. i would recommend this to anyone who is into fantasy, and can read this book without a chip on their shoulder."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"A terrible book, what happened? Something about an orphan boy meeting vampires and zombies. What's that supposed to mean? The second half of the book is terrible. A third person omniscient view.

I regret having wasted five days of my life reading this book."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"It's hard to believe that this book was published. I suggest that future books by Hinton have a collaborator or ghost writer assigned. This story is unbelievable and I don't mean as a fantasy; so awful that I'm embarrassed for the author.

And it's even better now that we're grown up and S.E. Hinton is still writing for us. This is her first adult novel, with adult themes, hot sex and racy language. And it still has that cool, stark, minimal and, most importantly, REAL feel of \\"The Outsiders,\\" \\"Rumble Fish,\\" etc. The story's lead protagonists, Jamie and Grenville, are classic outsider characters -- imperfect, vulnerable, and trying to overcome the bad hand they've been dealt. Only in this book, Hinton takes her plot around the world, back and forth through time, and includes adventure and suspense. AND she also does once again what she's always done best -- without a trace of sentimentality, the emotional currents of the novel build up slowly until they crash over you like a tsunami. You become more invested in these two fascinating people than you realize, making the end both moving and devastating. A must for Hinton fans as well as first-timers! (Also appropriate for teens over 15.)"},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"This book was truly awful. Not only was it boring, but it read like it was written by committee. There was no depth of character and the story was disjointed at best. Grenville goes from being a hideous vampire to kindly Mr. Hawkes. Also there were several typographical errors not caught by the editor. Very sloppy. I've never read Hinton's work before, and this book left me very unimpressed. What a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I hadn't read S.E. Hinton since \\"The Outsiders\\" and \\"Tex\\" so I was really looking forward to this new release. It is an interesting story, told in a somewhat confusing way. But it is relatively short (250 pages) and once you buy into the plot, it is easy to have some fun with the story and it becomes entertaining. But if you are looking for a real human interest story that says something about our society (a la her more famous titles), don't waste your time with this. There are plenty of better books out there."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"S.E. Hinton delivers in this entertaining fast, fun read. Fans of her teen lit (of which I'm a big one) will not be disappointed in the story of Jamie Sommers' journey.

Tasty reading for what it is."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I'm so glad that I didn't waste money on buying this book (I recieved a promotional copy) because I certainly would be asking for my money back now. The book is very disjointed and where the critics have praised Hinton for defying and mixing genres, I would just say she can't focus. I found the first half of the story pretty tolerable and if she had actually chosen to write a \\"grown-up\\" novel, the protagonist's journey back from madness might actually have made an interesting story. But as soon as she introduces a VAMPIRE(!) from before the Revolutionary War into 1960's America, all interest is gone. And a vampire is not the only example of the disconected style of this book: pirates, a shark attack, smuggling guns to the IRA, strangely detailed medical jargon about how the human body experiences pain, group sex, all of these elements appear in this book and not in any kind of harmony. Trying to explain the plot to my friends who had not read it was nearly impossible. Now that Hinton is writing for adults, her technique suddenly appears shallow. The story could very well have been your run of the mill book for pre-teens, but it attempts to appeal to an older audience by introducing sex (two scenes, both seemingly just for the sake of having a sex scene) and four letter words. The book is a light read and goes very quickly, which is good, because if it took you any longer to read you'd kick yourself for wasting that much time that you'll never get back."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I was excited to learn that S.E Hinton had published a new book, and greatly looked forward to reading this new novel by one of my favourite authors. I think ultimately, S.E Hinton should have just left well enough alone. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I found this book hugely disappointing. It was limp and boring; the plot \\"twists\\" were obvious, and the characters were transparant. It almost felt like she was trying to channel Bram Stoker but ended up with Anne Rice instead...I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Hinton has clearly not improved at all since her adolescent works. I get the impression that she has tried to apply the same amount of talent that she had as a sixteen year to her works of \\"adult fiction\\", and unfortunately they still read as fanstical teen-fic. A story linking an insane asylum, pirates, and vampires would be difficult enough for a truly gifted and dedicated author. Unfortunately, whether she lacked the talent or the effort, this one is a bomb."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Jamie Sommers (I kept thinking of the bionic woman), is a sympathetic criminal who meets his match in the form of Grenville Hawke, a reclusive millionaire. Things go rapidly downhill from there. While at first I was intrigued and spellbound by the narrator's excellent narration, I soon found myself irritated by the constant flashbacks. Jamie's life and sexcapades were less interesting than the resolution to the characters issues. Sadly it was never to be. Reading Hawke's harbor was like watching a brilliant firework...You light the fuse, wait for the glorious display only to have it fizzle. A Dud. Nothing is ever resolved, Jamie's life remains sad, dysfunctional, and in the end, depressing.I guess I wanted things to work out better for Jamie. I wanted Grenville to be a vampire (I hate stories where vampires must be cured), and I want Kellen Quinn to be snarky, full of trouble and un-reformable. This story turned out to be everything I don't like! What a waste of time. 2 stars."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I am a book worm. I read a lot. I insulted my own intelligence reading this terrible book. Hinton couldn't make up her mind about what kind of story to tell, so she combined a number of genres and create literary crap."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I was extremely excited when I found out about Hawkes Harbor being released! I have always been an SE HINTON fan...and have read all of her books.I came into Hawkes Harbor with an open mind- and was pleasantly surprised. The book is the story of Jamie Sommers, an orphan who was conceived in adultery. The nuns at the orphanage were brutal and mean to Jamie and told him constantly that he would end up no good-- and they were right. Jamie became something of a pirate, smuggler, and arms dealer- fulfilling the prophesy the nuns bestowed upon him. But Jamie viewed his rough life on the high seas the adventure of a lifetime- surviving shark attacks, foreign prison terms, among other things. It wouldn't be until Jamie settled down in a small Delaware town called Hawkes Harbor that Jamie would find something evil enough to break his wild spirit, eventually driving him insane.The story is a gripping one. A story that I thoroughly enjoyed despite the disjointed style in which it is written, which I noticed many other reviews found a fault with. I believe that the disjointed style the author used showed readers just how badly Jamie had been broken by the ultimate evil that he ran into, an evil named Grenville Hawkes.My only complaint about this book that is is too short and some areas could have been expounded upon. Like Jamie's life before he was orphaned- demonstrating the life he had before he was brought to live with the nuns. Other than that I give this book four stars- for an excellent story that moves well and is gripping in both suspense and timeline."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"If you are an original Dark Shadows fan, I highly recommend this book. You will know who each character represents. IMO, Ms. Hinton gives the best DS wrap up of all the other attempts and perfectly captures the essence of both the characters and story line. I just wish to have seen more on Grenville, since I only had eyes for Barnabas Collins/Jonathan Frid. Hint Ms. Hinton-please write more and concentrate on Grenville. There is still a strong DS cult following out there and I'm sure further stories would be well received, especially filling the void left by Mr. Frid's recent death.I was also a fan of Hinton's books while growing up-they were the few age appropriate books I ever even bothered to read. For fans of that genre, I would only give the book 2 stars. But fans, keep an open mind. If you like Hinton's earlier works, perhaps borrow this one or buy it on sale somewhere. You might not only be surprised at liking it, you may find yourself drawn into the whole Dark Shadows following-it is a good ride."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Although the story of Hawkes Harbor remains dominated by a male character, it is quite a change from Hinton's earlier novels. This story is filled with detailed descriptions, and carries the reader quickly from page to page learning of the wild adventures of Jamie Sommers and the people and events he encounters. Unfortunately, despite this book being a page-turner which will undoubtedly immediately hook fans and new readers alike, many fans of Hinton may not appreciate the different writing style in this story, and may be left wondering about a few critical parts of the story, including the most important, how Jamie involved himself in the predicament which ultimately led him to near destruction."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I, like so many others reviewing, LOVED S.E Hinton and her books that I read as a child. The Outsiders is still my favorite book. I finally picked up Hawks Harbor (I got it as a gift from my sister who knew how much i loved Hinton,) and I fell into it within the first few pages.I admit it is confusing at times, trying to remember what date it is taking place in. (so if you do read it, take note of the year stated in the chapter title!)But in all, I loved this book. I loved Jamie. I smiled when he was happy, I cried when he was sad. I most definitely got attached to the characters from the get go and would definitely recommend this book to those who are looking for a deep and intriguing book."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I too, loved S.E.Hinton's books as a kid, so I thought I was in for a treat when I picked this book up. I was shocked that is was not very good, the characters were half there, the plot had many holes in it, and the ending was beyond trite. I can't believe I actually finished it, after finding out it was about a vampire, I found it ridiculous that this was the so called horrifying secret.Maybe S.E. Hinton needed the cash. There could be no other reason that she would put forth such a pathetic story line and call it a novel."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"Review of Hawkes HarborI reviewed the book, finally, after putting off the task, and cannot say I can recommend it. In fact, I would say instead: stay well away and save your money for something else.It took me two hours to read the book, so it's not very long. Certainly not long enough to deal with the subject matter, which is the life of a young man from the age of 8 to the age of 40. It barely skims the surface of most of Jamie Summer's life, leaving out the development that would tell us why and how he came to be as he is.The writing itself is inconsistent and poor. There are sentences and thoughts ending in ellipses on almost every page. Ellipses typically indicate information that has been removed from a quote. Here, Hinton uses them, as some writers do, to indicate unfinished thoughts on the part of the protagonist, the antagonist, and everyone in between. It might be said, however, that the ellipses mostly seem to indicate unfinished thoughts on the part of Hinton in writing her story. It's almost as if she's not sure what her characters think. For example, on page 21: \\"Dr. McDevitt sighed. There had been no mention in his record of these fantasies....\\" Pardon me? Either there was a mention in his record of these fantasies or there wasn't. Either the doctor knows or he doesn't. Why the ellipses? Is there some dramatic statement that Hinton feels she is making? I know a great many gothic novels from the 1970's that use this technique to far more effect than this.The point of view (pov) skips trippingly from character to character, never staying long enough in one place for the reader to be able to get a very good idea of what motivates that character. On any given page, we get the points of view of at least two people. For example, on page 62 we get the pov of both Jamie Summers and Dr. Louisa Kahne. It starts with Kahne looking at Jamie, and then Jamie looking at Kahne. The objective of this, one assumes, is so that Hinton doesn't have to develop the point of view of one character too much. It's easier that way. The last time I read a book with that many points of view on a single page was a romance novel, where this technique is used so that not only the beauty of the heroine is described from the pov of the hero, the reader gets an eyeful of the handsomeness of the hero from the heroine's perspective. But truly, the worst part about the jumping pov is that the main character, Jamie Summers, is never fully fleshed out and can never be fully understood by the reader.The structure of the book muddies the waters even further. For the first half of the book, the story is told in flashback and flash-forward mode, during McDevitt's question and answer sessions with Jamie while he's in the mental institution. The last half of the book mostly moves forward, but there are inexplicable flashbacks there, as well, moving over as much time as a year, or as little as a month. For example, on page 237, it's 1978, and we flash forward to January 2, 1979, to a scene between two characters, Lydia and Richard Hawkes. We've never really seen these characters before, just heard about them from afar. Half a page is devoted to them discussing an odd delivery man that has come to their door. The second half of the page jumps back to December 26, 1978, barely two weeks earlier, where we find Jamie and Grenville in Washington, D.C. together. How does the flash-forward move the plot forward? Moreover, when did Grenville get an office in Washington, D.C?Since the story was originally a Dark Shadows novel, most of the work is based on the original plots developed by the writers of that show, though they are never given credit. Since the story was not to be published as a Dark Shadows novel, Hinton apparently was willing to change it enough for mainstream publication. That's all very well and good, but to me it appears that too much of the Dark Shadows elements still remain, and the rest of the story was not developed enough to hide the fact that the it is based on very badly written personal fan fiction. For fan fiction it is, a story based on a television series to further develop characters or plots as the writer sees fit. On page 189, an original character from the series mentioned, Roger Collins; Hinton obviously used search and replace for all the other names, why did this particular name slip through? As a nod to DS? Or as a written version of the finger?Other plot and character elements, as well, remain, intact. Grenville Hawkes is Barnabas Collins, the reluctant vampire. Kell Quinn is the jaunty Irishman, Jason McGuire, who takes Jamie Summers around the world with schemes and dreams. Maggie Evans, as kidnap victim, is found in Katie Roddendem. And Jamie Summers, himself, is based on Willie Loomis, the caretaker of the vampire's residence. Jamie receives three bullets in the back, the original character receives five. Both end up in horrible mental institutions. Both are left there until their masters come to get them. Both are afraid of the dark. The only original part of the novel is the background to Jamie Summers life, and then, what comes after the part where Grenville is cured of his vampirism.The book, after all, has a vampire in it, and vampires must be cured! Somewhere, between the pages of 142 and 179, Grenville has a miraculous recovery from his curse. How? When? Where? We don't know and we never will. Just all of a sudden, BAM, he's well. Well enough to take Jamie Summers on a cruise around the islands, Jamie, who is suddenly well enough to enjoy himself. There, the two bond with incredible speed and intensity. Yes, sure, they've been through a lot, and it's possible that the two of them could become friends, but excuse me, Grenville tortured Jamie for a long, long time. If Jamie is in denial, that's fine. I can use the Stockholm Syndrome to explain that, as well as the next person can. What I can't understand is how in the world the two men got to the point where they can exchange stories about having sex? I never see Grenville develop the guilt he supposedly feels about what harm he's done to Jamie. I see Jamie, one minute, addicted to a great many drugs, then suddenly, he's cured, with no sign of having gone through withdrawal. I never see how or why anyone changes. They just suddenly have, and with great speed, too.Speaking of the Stockholm Syndrome. It's a condition that has been around, one supposes, for years. It's a condition whereby the victim in someone else's power comes to view their captor in a kinder, gentler light. This enables the victim to survive. It's coping mechanism, and easy enough to apply to Jamie Summers. The term is mentioned in the book on page 189. (The same page, incidentally, where Roger Collins is mentioned by name.) {Did the editor of the work (was there one?) skip this page altogether?} On page 189, the year is 1968, as clearly indicated at the beginning of the chapter on page 179. In 1968 there was no term \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" that had been coined. We'd have to wait till 1973, when bank robbers in Stockholm, Sweden (hence the name), kept hostages captive in a bank they were robbing. The hostages bonded very quickly in various ways with their captors and the whole thing was caught by the 10 o'clock news. World wide. It was then, in 1973, that the term existed. Yet, Louisa Kahne uses it in 1968. Why? Perhaps Hinton was flash-forwarding and flash-backwarding so often she lost track. Or, perhaps, she didn't care that there was this inaccuracy. I can't call it poetic license, because this isn't an alternate universe. The fact that the term Stockholm Syndrom was coined in 1973 is a fact, and a badly used one. Certainly not a well-researched one.Other elements, as well, are ill-timed, ill-used, or badly done. For example, on page 62, Louisa Kahne asks Jamie if Grenville beats him. Jamie replies, to himself, \\"...Like It needed to do that...\\" Later, however, we learn that Grenville not only bites Jamie to keep him in line, he smacks him around. So...Grenville does beat Jamie. Right? Either Jamie is in denial, which is possible, or Hinton does not have the ability to be consistent within her own work.Another scene that bothered me was the scene where Jamie meets Kell. This happens on page 32. It takes only half a page for Hinton to passively describe the meeting between two men who would travel around the world for years together. Who got into and out of as many scrapes as might be imagined. They meet, they drink, and Hinton sums it up by saying, \\"So Kell and Jamie shipped out together.\\" The whole incident is told in the passive voice and we are left being told about the bond, but never shown it.Throughout the book, paragraphs are one, maybe two sentences long, and characters are half-developed. Towards the end, when it's suddenly 1978, Grenville suddenly gives Jamie a warm quilt. He suddenly realizes that it's cold and drafty where Jamie sleeps. What happened to the bonding that happened on the ship ten years ago? Weren't Grenville and Jamie friends after that? Don't you think that Grenville would have noticed sooner? And then Hinton, obviously unable to figure out what else to do, kills off her main character. The ghost, ta-da, of Kell Quinn comes to take Jamie away, perhaps to a heaven where there are only schooners and warm breezes. What a disaster. And a disappointment.But, the worst part about the book, I feel, is the fact that it must have been in Hinton's head for quite some time. A lot of fiction is, before the writer gets around to putting it down on paper. And like a lot of fiction, the idea in her head probably centered around a main scene or idea, which she ruminated over for hours on end. Unlike a lot of fiction, however, Hinton did not develop her story beyond this particular idea. This particular idea, I think, was developed in a chapter called The Last Scam, which starts on page 153. The entire scene is told"},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"&#65279;First thing I will say about this book is read it with a box of Kleenex handy, a really bigbox! HAWKES HARBOR is the life story of Jamie Sommer. This is a young man wequickly come to care a lot about. His wild escapades around the world with his friendKells are filled with adventure and sound almost unbelievable: pirates, gunrunners,treasure hunter, scams and outright cons among the wealthy.But when Jamie releases a 200 year old vampire his life takes a totally unexpected andterrifying turn. The story begins with Jamie in a mental hospital, withdrawn, depressed,and with large chunks of his memory gone. Slowly his past is revealed as he talks to hisdoctor, remembering what happened in bits and pieces. The happy and sad timesclimaxed with the horrible tragedy that literally broke Jamie. Much of the story isconfusing because it is told in flashbacks, jumping around through time. It is a jumble ofpieces, a puzzle which the reader must fit together. But it is worth the effort.At the heart of the story is the relationship between Jamie and the vampire, Grenville.Treasure hunting, Jamie opens a coffin and releases an imprisoned vampire, acreature filled with 200 years of hatred and unbearable thirst. Jamie becomes his guideto the modern world, his creature, bound by blood and need. Jamie must break thebondage to save a young woman from Grenville. But his act leads to him being shot,accused of kidnaping the woman, imprisoned, and eventually in the mental hospital.If it was a horror story, it might end there, but it isn't a horror story. Jamie starts torecover. The vampire Grenville, who manages to break the curse and become humanonce again, feels responsible for Jamie and offers to take care of him. And what startsout as a relationship of fear and unwilling submission becomes through the years astrong friendship filled with trust as both men struggle to put behind them their personaldemons and build anew their lives. There are no happy Hollywood endings, but triumphand happiness of a sort.HAWKES HARBOR is like no other vampire story I have ever read. It is a uniqueexperience. My only complaint is since this is Jamie's story, we only learn about thevampire in bits and pieces, surmising how he became a vampire and how he broke thecurse to become human. I found it a bit frustrating since I wanted to know more aboutthe vampire. Although the vampire is integral to the story, it would be hard to classifythe book as a vampire novel.But it is an emotionally powerful novel that will touch the reader, sometimes bring a tearto the eye or a smile to the lips. It is the kind of book that stays with a reader, thatdraws the mind back time and again to the story. A true reading experience beyond andabove the ordinary."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"If you're a hardcore S.E. Hinton fan, you probably won't like this book, it is very different from her other work. The people that gave it horrible reviews are expecting too much from Hinton; this is her first adult book. Now onto the book itself. This is a very good book, with complex characters who you care about, at least I did. It was also very entertaining in my opinion. I gave it four stars because how Grenville was cured of his vampirism was barely, if at all, explained when it seems like this would be a big part of the book. But this book isn't necessarily a profound storyline and plot itself, but rather the story and development of Jamie Sommers and how his life changes.If you are looking for The Outsiders, don't read this book.

A lot of fiction is, before the writer gets around to putting it down on paper. And like a lot of fiction, the idea in her head probably centered around a main scene or idea, which she ruminated over for hours on end. Unlike a lot of fiction, however, Hinton did not develop her story beyond this particular idea. This particular idea, I think, was developed in a chapter called The Last Scam, which starts on page 153. The entire scene is told in past tense. The font is italicized, for some reason, perhaps to let us know that it happened long ago. Or something. Anyway, in this scene, Hinton sticks to a single point of view, that of Jamie Summers, which raises the intensity missing in the rest of the book. She tells the scene from beginning to end, with no flash forward or flash back. There are ellipses, but perhaps Hinton can't help those, at this point. But you know Hinton loved this scene. It's the one that took her to bed at night, helped her get through chores, and helped her relax when paying the bills. It's the scene. The one the story is based around. The one she takes her time with.In it, Kell comes to say goodbye. His scheme has gone wrong and he's leaving town, wants to say goodbye to his pal, Jamie. Only it's sundown. Grenville awakens. Kills Kell. And Jamie, upon Grenville's instructions, is forced to stake Kell to keep Kell from turning into a vampire. The scene goes deep, and possibly develops why Jamie has nightmares. He makes himself pretend it's not Kell he's staking, and makes himself think of something else through the long ordeal. It's marvelous torture that Hinton performs on Jamie, and she takes her slow, sweet time with it, letting the reader know that she's savoring every last second. It's the scene she wanted to write originally. It's her little fantasy. Unfortunately for her, and for us, in order for the fantasy scene to be published, Hinton had to develop a story around it. And also, unfortunately for us, the rest of the story has all the craft of a below-average Harlequin novel, and even the intensity of six pages of The Last Scam cannot make up for the passively told remaining 144 or so pages of badly constructed framework.The book jacket describes Hinton as an \\"honored storyteller,\\" and an \\"international bestselling author.\\" These accolades are the only reason I think that Hinton's private fantasy got into mainstream publication at all. Hawkes Harbor is a far cry from The Outsiders. Perhaps Hinton has forgotten what she once knew. Perhaps she's a closet DS fan out of touch with what works in fan fiction, let alone mainstream fiction. There are stories out there that have never seen the inside of a bookstore that outshine Hawkes Harbor with enough brilliance to blind. They are written not for profit or acclaim, but instead are written only for the pleasure of writing a well-crafted story with fully-fleshed characters and a plot that engages the reader with intelligence and heart. I know Hinton remembers those days. Perhaps she can return to them."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"The similarity to \\"Dark Shadows\\" isn't co-incidental, nor an \\"homage\\". This book was intended to be the third entry in Harper Collins \\"Dark Shadows\\" novels based on the classic gothic soap opera, but it was rejected due to the subject matter and explicit nature of some of the events.The book was simply reworked slightly by changing a lot of character names and removing some copyrighted elements, but any fan of the gothic soap will easily be able to tell which characters were to be which.Those who are not familiar with \\"Dark Shadows\\" will likely be lost!

I love that it seems to be a book for adults, rather than for adolescents. The main character is real and I was quite surprised by the turn of events in the cave. I didn't see that coming. The ending was a surprise as well, and I am not one who is surprised by much."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I was looking forward to a new book from S.E. Hinton, until I read part of the book. I could not believe all the profanity and explict sexual content in Hawkes Harbor. The story line was additonaly weak and unrealistic. I wish I had never purchased the book. I love her other books and used them in a classroom setting for reading remediation and the students never had to be be reminded to read. Hawkes Harbor has tainted my feelings for the author and her works. I will think twice before recommending her books for fear the student would do as I and think Hawkes Harbor was of the same caliber as her earlier works."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I knew that this book had been poorly reviewed when I bought it, but because I like both Hinton's YA novels and novels about vampires, I expected this book to by right up my alley. Unfortunatley, the characters in the book were universally unappealing. I just couldn't bring myself to care much about any of them. I was frankly relieved when I finished the book and could move on to something more interesting."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I initially bought this book b/c I was excited that a Dark Shadows fan fiction had actually been published in mainstream. The onlyreason why I liked it in the slightest was b/c this story contains a favorite character of mine: Willie Loomis. Oops. I mean \\"Jamie Sommers\\". *wink* :p I think this was very poorly written and very anti-climactic. Just when I found a certain part exciting, she revealed it's outcome before reaching the ending. That alone was like watching a movie with someone who leans over and tells you what happens at the end when you're right smack in the middle of that movie. I would NOT recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I loved Hinton's books when I was a kid so I gamely tried her adult offering. While I agree with the previous reader that the book very often felt like a ya novel I still found lots of points of interest.But that's neither here nor there. This book is a pastiche inspired by the vampire soap opera Dark Shadows and for fans of that show I recommend this book. Imagine the early Barnabas Collins episodes retold from Willie Loomis' point of view and you've got \\"Hawke's Harbor\\" in a nutshell.Most of the original cast are represented. Willie is now Jamie, Barnabas is Grenville, Jason McGuire is Kel, Maggie is Katie, Julia is Louisa. Hinton combines Joe Haskell with Sherrif Paterson and takes some liberties here and there but the characters and early storylines are all here.Most interestingly she presents the Collins (Hawkes) family as moneyed snobs who look down on the little people of Collinwood (Hawke's Harbor)and have nothing to do with them.If you are a Dark Shadows fan you will have fun picking out the references. It's great how she takes this campy 60's soap and infuses it with real terror and sorrow and even- dare I say it? Poetry.Not for all tastes to be sure- but it's a fast read and quite fun."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I read Hinton's classic YA novels when I was young, and enjoyed their grittiness. This novel, however, is quite different, because it was originally meant to be a Dark Shadows-tie in novel. That's why some of the characters aren't as fully drawn out as if they had been created for a fully original story - just as if you read a Star Trek or other media tie-in novel, where you already \\"know\\" James T. Kirk or Spock. Only in this case, the novel was not published under the Dark Shadows imprint, but characters were renamed as if they were original, with Barnabas Collins, the famous Maine-born vampire, becoming \\"Grenville\\". If you enjoy Dark Shadows, and are familiar with the storyline that made the 1960s soap a runaway success and continuing cult favorite, you'll \\"get\\" this novel and may enjoy its new, more adult take on the original story. (There's more explicit sex than in the soap, which was very popular with teens.) If you've never seen the show, but are a S.E. Hinton fan, you might want to rent Dark Shadows' first DVD collection in order to understand the storyline better. If you find that Dark Shadows' campy, theatrical feel doesn't appeal to you, you probably won't like this book either."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"When I was in high school, I loved The Outsiders, and I loved S.E. Hinton's characters (I was a little in love with many of them too). I read everything else she wrote: Rumble Fish; That Was Then, This Is Now; Tex. I read some of them several times. I saw the movies. And so, this fall, when I walked by a display with Hawkes Harbor, I did a doubletake, then went over to read the back cover, and lingered awhile before moving on with a longing backward glance. My husband then bought it for me as a gift.I read Hawkes Harbor yesterday--it's a quick read. When I was halfway through my husband asked how it was and I said it was awful and he gave me one of those knowing looks and said, \\"How long has it been since you've read her?\\" Meaning, maybe you've got it wrong, maybe you're misremembering how good The Outsiders was, it's been 20 years, hasn't it? \\"No,\\" I said. \\"She was really good. I was in high school then, and there were books I loved then that were awful, but I knew they were awful and loved them anyway. The Outsiders was something special.\\"So we went online, and pulled up the first few pages here on Amazon. And the voice is just as strong as I remember it, and the prose is just as clear. On the second page, there's the sentence, \\"When I see a movie with someone it's kind of uncomfortable, like having someone read your book over your shoulder,\\" a great sentence that puts you right inside her narrator's skin. I don't think there's a single sentence that good in all of Hawkes Harbor.Hawkes Harbor is a mess. Hinton hasn't figured out how to write in third person, and her point of view is all over the place in a way that's both jarring and distancing. She has no real feel for these characters, and characters who seem to be important turn out to be minor. The timeline isn't clear, the story is jumbled and feels cobbled together, everything from the language to the plot is cliched, and the sex is gratuitous and ... silly, actually. Not one character is developed into someone who feels as real as Ponyboy feels in the first three pages of The Outsiders. I read the whole thing, in part because I kept expecting it to get better--this was S.E. Hinton, after all--and in part because I was fascinated by how awful it was.If you loved S.E. Hinton's novels, and the sight of Hawkes Harbor brings up a nostalgic longing for the worlds she created so beautifully, go back and re-read her early novels. Or rent the movies that were made of them. But don't read this. Keep your impression of S.E. Hinton as a writer untainted by this garbled mess that should never have been published, and hope that she finds that old voice that enthralled for the next one."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I got this at a library book sale and read it in two nights. What an incredibly compelling book and wonderful find. I LOVED IT. I'm pretty sure I fell in love with Jamie Sommers and maybe even Grenville a little bit. Their journey to friendship was a beautiful thing to read. I'll be keeping this as one of my special books instead of passing it on as I normally would."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"I read this book as part of a reading group of which I am a member. Base on the preson who picked this book, I was looking forward to an enjoyable read. However, this was a very very disappointing book. Simply put the story line is silly and a waste of time. It appears to be the author's goal to have the story broken into three parts but there is no flow and very little connection between the parts of the story. For example, the last 30 pages do not connect with the rest of the story at all and looks like an ending that one sees when the author does not know how to end a book. Also, there graps in the story line. Such as, what does the Vampire do to address the curse? It seems to get better but how? The bottomline is that if you want a story on a Vampire, go rent a video of Dark Shadows."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"This is SE Hinton's first novel in over fifteen years, according to the blurb on the back. As such, there are many expectations that can come regarding the author of such works as The Outsiders, Rumble Fish, and That was Then, This is Now. Almost inevitably, Hawkes Harbor will be compared to those works that most of us will remember fondly from our younger years.Unfortunately, Hawkes Harbor just doesn't live up to The Outsiders, which is unfair to Hawkes Harbor. On its own, Hawkes Harbor actually ends up being a very nice story. However, it does suffer on a couple of points. There is a lot of jumping back and forth in time as the main character, Jamie, struggles to remember his past while in a mental institution. Whether or not the feeling is on purpose, the disjointedness of the piecemeal recall can be disorienting and disheartening.Also, as with the expectation of Rumble Fish quality, the reader may be confounded by expectation of plot and/or genre. Due to some of the reviews and blurbs on the covers, some people will come in with the expectation of a supernatural thriller, but the book doesn't start out like one, instead choosing to set the stage through the flashback scenes. Once involved in the book, it doesn't read like a normal supernatural thriller or romance in the vein of an Anita Blake novel. What the novel truly ends up focused on are relationships between Jamie and other characters and how those relationships change. There are certainly some exciting and terrifying moments, but more importance is placed on how people change and the evolution of their interpersonal relationships. In this exploration of perception and misperception is where there is some common ground with Hinton's previous, more well known works.In the final analysis, I found the book very rewarding. I was ready to put it down in the middle due to the disjointed recollection of past events, but wanted to stay with it due to the book's relatively short length. In staying the course, I found the exploration of different relationships ultimately very satisfying. The jumping back and forth will kill off some readers' enthusiasm as will false expectations of what the book is supposed to be about. In the end, the enjoyment each person will derive from Hawkes Harbor will ultimately be up to that individual's taste. Your reaction will be a very personal thing."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"For those of you reading or wanting to read S.E. Hinton's latest book, you should know a large part of what she wrote was not of her own creation. She has, however, given no indication that she got her idea from somewhere else. The reason I wish to expose this is because she is passing this story off as her own. What most do not know is that Hawkes Harbor was originally a book she wrote for publication with Harper Collins. It was to be the next Dark Shadows novel, a story about character Willie Loomis, including other characters, locations and basic storylines from the old soap opera. Harper Collins turned it down, and she changed the location, and the character and place names, and submitted it elsewhere. It is still the same story, the same characters and takes place in a New England town, with nearly all the same events. Hawkes Harbor is a fanzine, disguised by new names, parading around as mainstream fiction.I don't fault her for being a Willie Loomis fan and wanting to write about him, but if she is going to pass it off as something else, she should have changed far more than names and a few facts. Does not doing so make it plagiarism? On Dark Shadows, Willie is a sea tramp, is partner with an Irishman, becomes a vampire's slave, gets shot and ends up in a mental institution, and the vampire has a woman doctor (who falls in love with him) trying to cure him of the curse. Basic facts taken straight from Dark Shadows. If she wanted to lift the character, she should have come up with something other than those facts I just mentioned to make up her premise.Why is Dan Curtis Productions (owners of Dark Shadows (DS) copyrights, I presume), allowing this? Perhaps there was a stipulation that she not mention DS in any connection with Hawkes Harbor. Well, I have made no such agreement, and I want it known that this so-called \\"character only S.E. Hinton could create\\" as one review stated, was not her character at all.Collins? Roger? Out of the blue, these names from DS come up-we've never seen them in the book before (or ever see them again). Collins should have been Hawkes, and Roger should have been Richard in order for the information to make sense. But somehow they got missed when she was changing the names to hide that she got the story from Dark Shadows. (Wonder how come she didn't use a word processor Find and Replace function?)Hawkes Harbor itself suffers from structure problems and inaccuracies. The action jumps around so much, it's often not clear in the first half if the flashbacks Jamie is having are what he is telling his doctor in the sanitarium or if it is just for the reader's benefit. There is a whole small section where she tells what becomes of one character.Jamie releases the vampire in March of 1965, yet in February of 1965 he tells people he's got a new job, (he's going to work for the vampire). Interesting twist of time there. How'd he know? Or maybe in her version of time, February comes after March. (Couldn't she have checked to make sure her dates were correct? There were other times in the book where the dates jumped ahead, then back a few days, much to the confusion of the reader.)She has one character telling another that Jamie suffers from the \\"Stockholm syndrome.\\" She says this in 1968. The label \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" did not come into use until 1973 when bank robbers held hostages at a bank in Stockholm, Sweden. The hostages came to identify with their captors, and doctors trying to explain why this would happen, coined the term Stockholm Syndrome to describe the phenomenon. The phenomenon had already been noticed, but there was no label for it until 1973.Now, on the DS Willie Loomis List, an online discussion group, it has been proposed that Willie suffered from the Stockholm Syndrome. This proposal came about in spring of 2000 on this list. I submit that Ms. Hinton has lurked on this list, agreed with that diagnosis, and so put it into her story. Nothing wrong with that, except she did not check her facts. Very sloppy. If she had come to this conclusion about Willie on her own, without anyone suggesting it, it seems likely that she would have paid more attention to her research, and thus, noted the date the term was coined. She would then have had to either take that out of Hawkes Harbor.But that is not even all of it. In addition to taking a large chunk of her story from DS, it seems she has lifted ideas and images from other DS fan fiction. Her use of the term \\"the Thing\\" to describe the vampire was straight from a fanzine called My Boy Willie by Christina E. Pilz, published in summer of 2000. And there was an incident in Hawkes Harbor that looked to be lifted from a Virginia Waldron story, which was published in KarlenZine (KZ) II in 1987. (After his release from the sanitarium, Jamie is accosted and pelted with rocks by kids in town. This same thing happened to Willie in \\"Overshadowed.\\") This could certainly be chalked up to parallel development, as are some similarities to stories in KZ III & IV. (KarlenZines are the large fanzines whose main focus is the DS character Willie Loomis as played by John Karlen. KZ III was published in August 2001 and IV in August 2003, long before Hinton's book saw print.)She does, however, handle the main character with sensitivity, though the ending was a big disappointment.I cannot claim absolutely that Ms. Hinton committed plagiarism, but it is a known fact that she submitted her book as a Dark Shadows novel once before. It is still the same story. She certainly owns the background scenes she created, but the rest of it? I guess that's up to those parties who feel their work has been taken."},{"Title":"Hawkes Harbor","review":"S.E. Hinton hasn't written a book in 16 years, beyond a couple of children's books.

Absolutely. I stayed up later than I should have, reading this book.

I want to give the author the benefit of the doubt.So:It fell flat on its face.The first scene in the psych hospital is the only one in the book that's \\"alive.\\" The rest is dead info-dump, and the plot and characters straight out of a certain cult soap opera of the 1960s.Some of the story is lifted straight out of Dark Shadows, dialogue included. A \\"relative from England,\\" buying an old dump of a house? Jamie/Willie Loomis, explaining: \\"His car broke down on the road---he hired me when I fixed it.\\" I would list all the other coincidences but they'd contain too many spoilers. Add to that Hinton's choppy, disjointed prose and plot, and you get a misfire of a book.Then there is the anachronism of Stockholm Syndrome, not known until years after the book's timeline. And the inevitable PC nonsense, straight out of the guilt-ridden 90s, like the relentless comments about \\"homeless people.\\" They were called bums back then.There's a story in here, maybe. But characterization and events are just skimmed over in favor of gratuitous sex scenes and vile language. Jamie's doctor is simply a plot device to unreel his backstory.

Hinton's first novel for \\"adults\\" (her first novel of any kind in over nine years) does not offer a positive first impression. I originally thought that Hawkes Harbor would not be likely to appeal to anyone past high school age, that it had exactly the same kind of troubled protagonist in Jamie Sommers that Hinton had been recycling for years in books like The Outsiders, Tex, Rumble Fish, and That Was Then, This Is Now.Luckily, around page 100, it begins to take a turn for the better. When we first encounter Jamie (no relation to the Bionic Woman), he has just lost both of his parents, and his priest -- who, we learn, had promised to look after Jamie himself -- is sending him away to an orphanage with a thieving nun. Seventeen years later, Jamie is admitted to Terrace View Asylum. Hawkes Harbor then jumps back and forth between his therapy sessions and flashbacks from the intervening years, particularly his time sailing and smuggling with mate Kell, a greatly influential figure in Jamie's life.Then we get to the good part and what turns Hawkes Harbor into an almost entirely different book: Jamie follows Kell to the titular locale Jamie meets one Grenville Hawkes, a local eccentric who will later pay for Jamie's stay at the asylum, but not before he has exacted his own price.Despite the presence of \\"adult\\" subject matter and swear words, the first part of Hawkes Harbor feels as if Hinton is still writing for teenagers. I actually found it a struggle to get through this part because of the condescending tone. Jamie's lack of real personality also hinders the book's impact. I much preferred the company of Kell, Jamie's shipmate, on the many smuggling expeditions. Also, Grenville Hawkes is constantly surprising the reader throughout the book. The supporting characters definitely rule the day here.As I read, the tone changed from condescending to accessible but I think that the first third of Hawkes Harbor should have been reedited to match the rest of the book, because it feels as if Hinton is practicing novel-writing without a clear idea of where she is going. Eventually, she found her way and discovered a plotline that worked within the context of Jamie's story, adding more than a little sex and violence along the way to keep our interest, but the flaws are distracting. The narration never feels like Jamie's thoughts but the author's, the practice of giving a header to every time-change quickly became annoying, and the whole thing feels more like a series of vignettes than a cohesive novel. The dramatic \\"redemption\\" ending is entirely out-of-place, though predictable given the preceding events, so I guess it works, but not really.Hawkes Harbor is a good book, but with some more work, it could have been much better."},{"Title":"Celia","review":"I've always enjoyed Ruby Jean Jensen and felt she deserved more recognition. Perhaps the silly covers that Zebra slapped on most of her novels have discouraged people from taking her seriously. But she really does know how to craft a good chiller and despite a few stumbles in her large volume of work, she's a horror author you can trust for a good story and genuine chills. Knowing all this, and having enjoyed several of her books, CELIA really took me by surprise. This is by far, one of the creepiest novels she's ever written... CELIA has lived with fear and violence for most of her life, every since she married Durk, a psychotic and strange man who seems to have some weird affinity with the swamp behind their Florida home. In a desperate act, to save her life and three children, she kills him and pushes him into the swamp. But his reign of terror will not end there and she knows it. \\"I'll come get you, Celia,\\" he always promised her. \\"You kill me and I'll come back as your worst nightmare.\\" With the help of an Underground Railroad of lawyers and shelters and good samaritans who assist abused women and families, Celia escapes with her children. A new identity and new life awaits her on the otherside of the US. But none of her rescuers know what happened that dark night in the swamp and none of them know that Durk is on their trail. Not even death has stopped him and he has become a slithering, crawling demonic thing that seems to embody the darkness of the swamp. No matter how far Celia travels or the protection of a strong, kind man named Mel, the creature that was once Durk will get his revenge on Celia and her children... Fast-paced, full of creepy-crawling darkness, and truley harrowing. This is an exceptional read for horror fans and one of Jensen's best. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.

NOT for for faint of heart! Very disturbing scenes, as well as some truly creepy scenarious. No happy go lucky endings or scenes here.

Howard)","review":"ContentsThe Gothic Orient (introduction) by Mark FinnSkull-FaceDead Man's HateThe Fearsome Touch of DeathA Song out of MidianShadows on the RoadThe Moon of SkullsThe Hills of the DeadBlack Chant ImperialThe Voice of El-LilRobert E. Howard's writing career began in 1924, and by 1929, he was selling steadily to different markets. However, Weird Tales continued to be his most dependable, if not financially reliable, market. In the pages of \\"the unique magazine,\\" Howard had plenty of room to explore ideas and cross genre barriers that he may not have been able to with other pulp fiction magazines.Continuing the collection of Howard's fiction and poetry in order of publication, Volume Two of The Weird Works of Robert E. Howard picks up where Volume One left off-at one of the most startling and controversial Howard stories of all: \\"Skull-Face!\\" A potent combination of gothic themes and oriental mystique, \\"Skull-Face\\" was the first novella Howard sold, and in many ways, is a key to understanding the rest of Howard's canon. A detailed, complicated plot, a compelling cast of characters, and a collision of themes and ideas make \\"Skull-Face\\" required reading for Howard fans.The Moon of Skulls collects Robert E. Howard's fiction and prose published in Weird Tales Magazine from October 1929 to November 1930, plus one from Oriental Stories. These works represent literary stepping-stones to Howard's infamous Cthulhu mythos stories and his most famous character of all -- Conan the Cimmerian -- and ably demonstrate that each of Howard's stories improved and added to his formidable skills as a master of fantasy and adventure."},{"Title":"Robert E. Howard's Weird Works Volume 2: Moon Of Skulls (Weird Works of Robert E. Howard)","review":"This, the second volume in the series, is an excellent book. Every story is good, and three of them-- \\"Skull-Face\\", \\"The Moon of Skulls\\", and \\"The Hills of the Dead\\"-- are superb. Howard is just as fine a story-teller when he writes of something other than Conan. The _Weird Works_ series is shaping up to be an essential collection of his most entertaining and thrilling stories."},{"Title":"Robert E. Howard's Weird Works Volume 2: Moon Of Skulls (Weird Works of Robert E. Howard)","review":"This, the second volume in the Weird Works editions, is another fine addition to the body of Howard's works. Containing 9 stories and poems, it continues the marvelous printing of REH's work in the order of origional publication. Most have appeared elsewhere but some, such as\\"The Fearsome Touch of Death\\" have not appeared in print since its publication in Weird Tales. And the poems show that Howard was not only a master of action/adventure tales but also a very accomplished poet. As with other publications in this series, this volume should be in the library of not only the hardcore long time Howard fan (43 years for myself) but the new fan as well.Do yourself a favor...pickup these volumes."},{"Title":"Robert E. Howard's Weird Works Volume 2: Moon Of Skulls (Weird Works of Robert E. Howard)","review":"I am a big fan of Howard and this book has some fine stories. One thing that is a little strange is that the stories in this book overlap somewhat with \\"Shadow Kingdoms (The Weird Works of Robert E. Howard)\\" Shadow Kingdom's was not listed as a Volume 1, but I sort of assumed that it was coordinated with these books (vol 2, 3, etc.). because of the \\"Weird works\\" tag in both. Looks like a different publisher - just thought I would point out a quirk if you were planning to buy more than one of these books.Just a general note that these stories were written in the 1920s - some of the depictions of certain non-white racial groups might be offensive to some people."},{"Title":"Robert E.

Howard, Volume 1, but Cosmos Books, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Since this looked like volume 2, I bought it, but it's not quite what I had in mind. There are two series called The Weird Works of Robert E. Howard/Robert E. Howard's Weird Works. This book is number two in the series by Wildside Press, and each volume is about two hundred pages; the series by Cosmos Books (a division of Wildside Press), is a newer collection of the original series, combining more than one of the original books into each. For example, theShadow Kingdoms (The Weird Works of Robert E. Howard)by Cosmos Books reproduces Shadow Kingdoms by Wildside Press AND half of Moon of Skulls, and it's cheaper than either of the original collections.Since Cosmos Books decided to give some of their collections the same name as existing collections, make sure you buy the Cosmos Books collections, since they're larger AND cheaper."},{"Title":"Robert E. Howard's Weird Works Volume 2: Moon Of Skulls (Weird Works of Robert E. Howard)","review":"The primary story in the book is \\"Skull Face,\\" which the editor states is a take off on Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. That's an understatement! \\"Skull Face\\" is very close to being a less exciting, less intricate copy! It's complete with odd origin story, \\"eastern\\" birth, (Egypt instead of China), dark plot to take over the world, obscure death ending, and the almost requisite anti-non-white bigotry, which, if you're going to read these stories, you just have get through with some salt. (Remember it was the early 1930's, nearly everyone was a bigot, it was almost a requirement of being a white person.) The story is a middling entry compared to most of Howard's work. The masterpiece of the book is \\"The Voice of El-Lil,\\" in which a WOMAN saves the men from an ancient society in darkest Africa. (Again, remember it's the 1930's.) The greatest problem most people will have with these stories, will be that the endings are obvious to a person reading this 80 years after it was published. So much has come since that built on these stories it requires noting that these were first, and original when they were written. Keep these points in mind and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Robert E.

She even has a big, unruly dog....just like Jan Karon's books! The characters are such obvious copies of the characters in the Mitford books that it becomes a real annoyance.And again, her version of Catholicism is a little skewed. She acknowledges several priest friends in the preface to her book....did she get them to read it carefully? For example, she refers to \\"The Sacred Heart of Mary\\". What?? It's the \\"Immaculate Heart of Mary\\"....we only refer to Jesus' Sacred Heart. These and other errors just jump off the page to an even moderately well-educated Catholic. \\"Rent A Nun\\"????

As the community faces some unexpected turns they come together to get through the tragedies that are thrown their way. You'll get to know the local townsfolk a bit better and appreciate the sense of community as they help one another in trying situations.Valentine has a very cozy writing style, so if you're looking for a book you can sit back and relax with, this book is for you.

In &quot;A Gathering of Angels&quot;, Dorsetville folks confront a wide range of challenges. A businessman is left with a mountain of debt when his partner runs off with the money; a bag lady is wrongly accused of setting the fire that levels a church and Father James is recovering from a hit and run accident and learning to be the recipient instead of the giver of grace.Unlike the Mitford series which is mostly fluff, the Dorsetville series digs into the questions that we all ask about the workings of God and faith..Where is God when tragedy strikes? How are we to find the faith that will help us to keep on believing when prayers go unanswered?Besides being well written, the things that sets Dorsetville aside is that it leaves the ready with some deeply moving answers to some of the most difficult spiritual questions."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Angels","review":"Karen Valentine's characters in this book are people I know!!

You can either choose to have faith or you can choose to doubt.When I 'discovered' this gentle, faith-filled series, I discovered that each book had something in particular that spoke to me. I don't know it this was the author's intent, but I actually printed up the words that 'spoke' to me so I could look at them often, and pause, and slow down, and think about them."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Angels","review":"I was given this book as a gift. Having not read any of the author's previous works, it was immediately apparent that her series borrows closely from the Mitford books. But my take on this is: Who Cares? Speaking as someone who is tired of reading books on incest, domestic abuse, rape, and other horrors (which we read about daily in our newspapers) just having a new series to read that brings pleasure is most welcome. I could not put this book down. It's a simple story, with simple charactors, but the plotlines were many and knowing that they would all be tied together in a happy bundle at the end of the book was reassuring. The small town charm, the way Ms. Valentine teaches nuggets of the faith by sprinkling learning episodes throughout the book is a nice touch. As a practicing Catholic, it's wonderful to have a series of books that reflects my faith, even if she sometimes makes a mistake or two. Granted, the Rent-a-Nun concept is troubling, but other than that, it's a wonderful read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Angels","review":"Though I had looked forward to reading this book based on Katherine Valentine's first novel, I came away from it disappointed and even a bit disturbed. Initially, I was pleased to see Valentine addressing tougher questions about God, faith and suffering; but as the novel progressed it seemed as though every distressful situation was miraculously remedied by the presence of an angel or the rosary at the center of the story. While I realize that this was part of the plot device--people being inadvertently touched by holiness which then passes by--it nonetheless completely voided any realism in the novel whatsoever. And I, too, was troubled by \\"Rent-A-Nun\\": it conjured up the notion of indulgences and seemed to invoke the very worst stereoptypes about Catholicism. In terms of stylistic merit, I continue to prefer the Mitford novels, which are so artfully put together while deceptively seeming simple and which address difficult issues of faith in a subtle yet revealing fashion."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Angels","review":"I finished this book in one day. It was a nice, pleasant read. I feel, however, these series of stories come very close to copying Jan Karon's much better Mitford series. There are just too many of the same type of characters. If you haven't read the Mitford books,(you should!!) you probably would enjoy this series more. I kept comparing the two."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Angels","review":"In this second book of the Dorsetville series, many events take place in the lives of the people.For starters, Barry Hornibrook has himself in real trouble. He is in very serious debt from trying to start a hotel and is at the point where he cannot even pay his contractors anymore much less anything else. The gentleman that gave him a loan turned out to be a bad person, and escaped, leaving Barry in limbo without the money he needed. These two men are after him for money as well, and if Barry does not come through with the money he owes which is a couple million, they are threatening to kill him. As he is under the gun with time running out, he desparately searches for a way to get out of the terrible situation he is in.Nellie Anderson is another example of faith here in the book. She has a threat hanging over her head on foreclosure with her home. She has been struggling hard to try and make ends meet, while having fallen behind on the bills. She is working a teaching job during the day, and doing another job at night. Nellie has also been working on a children's Christmas book for a very long time. And the book is her last hope to save the house. But it will have to be a quick save since time is running out for her too.There is a huge fire at the church opposite Saint Cecilia's, and the Galligan twin boys started it during the week of bible school. Sara, Lori's daughter was down in the basement, and couldn't find her way out. She falls asleep there in the basement when the fire gets going, but luckily gets rescued just in time.The Galligan twins are always full of pranks and also set off a firecracker that caused some major problems. The boys own up eventually after Father James makes them confess to Sheriff Bromley all their recentpranks.Father James gets run over by two men who take off without even stopping, knowing too well what they did. Father has a broken leg for a very long time and has to stay on bedrest pretty much, putting up with his cranky housekeeper Mrs. Morris whom is driving him nuts.The two men that hit Father James are the two guys that have threatened Barry Hornibrook for the money. The answer to Barry's prayers will come when the sheriff captures these two men who have been up to no good for a long time.This book was great all the way through, and I look forward to Grace Will Lead Me Home, the third book in the series."},{"Title":"People on our side","review":"Snow's books and Theodore White's other WWII observations were responsible for my earliest sip of that time in history when all our later enemies were our friends and allies. This book travels through China, has great photos of Mao as a young man, compares him with his arch-enemy, Chang, and gives a brief history of pre-WWII China. Then it moves into the Soviet Union and discusses the War Effort there, Uncle Joe Stalin, Stalingrad, and includes a photograph which (for me) is one of the most ..... poignant of WWII.... Von Paulus during the moment of surrender of his Army at Stalingrad.If you're a history buff, a China buff, a USSR buff, read this book. You'll love it."},{"Title":"People on our side","review":"In 1942, at the age of 36, Snow is highly enough regarded as an expert on Asia to receive a personal invitation from F.D.R. to come chat. The Washington Post sends him on an Asian tour to see how revolutionary upheaval is affecting the war effort. In India he finds upper class Indians and Congress Party leaders so frustrated with centuries of racial discimination and economic exploitation that few are willing to heed the British call to defend the subcontinent without guarentees of independence that Churchill refuses to give. Mohammed Ali Jinnah, India's Muslim leader, envisions an independent state called Pakistan. He plays his political cards more adroitly than the jailed Gandhi, who remains dangerously deluded that Japan will lose interest in India as soon as the British leave.A brief interlude in Iran, on the way to Russia. \\"Iran is as exciting and romantic as it sounds until you get close to the filth and disease that kill eight out of every ten children before they are five.\\"Snow's main focus on this trip is the Soviet Union. He greatly admires the efficiency and toughness of Stalinism; if one wants to see planned, regimented \\"total war,\\" here is its showcase. Hitler has fatally underestimated the resilience and productivity of the workers; there is virtually no non-military industry. With no history or expectation of individual rights, cities and industries can be moved overnight and every worker told exactly what he or she must do. Snow claims that even the Asiatic republics find this burst of modernized productivity liberating. Stalinism's excesses pass unmentioned. Americans fail to understand Soviet ruthlessness because we have not experienced the horrors of Nazi invasion. After the war, the Soviets will expect to be surrounded by a buffer zone of friendly states -- just like our Monroe Doctrine.In Burma he finds only one admirable Briton: the brilliant guerilla war tactician Gen. Orde Charles Wingate, soon to die. Back in China, where he spent so many years, Snow resumes his criticism of the venal, short-sighted Chiang Kai-shek. He sees to Kuomintang as the capitalistic, oligarchical descendant of China's semi-feudal landlords, prolonging its doomed life with Allied war supplies. The true war against the Japaneseis being conducted by Mao is his armies (about whom Snow has written other books). The Allies need to recognize that that northern China, where the Communists are fighting, is much more strategically valuable as potential territory from which to attack Japan than any turf Chiang is likely to seize. Thus it is imperative that ways be found to get American military aid to Mao. Japan ultimately cannot win, however. Her empire rests on a semi-feudal government; she can never grant the independent democracies she has promised to the Asian peoples she has overrun. They will rebel against her as surely as they have the western colonial powers.All in all, a clear-eyes assessment of how the colonial legacy is dragging down the Allied war effort in Asia and a prescient forecast of what will happen after 1945."},{"Title":"DK Compact World Atlas: The Essential Atlas for All the Family with Easy-to-Read Maps and Country Factfiles","review":"With everything going on in the world these days, you can help your children understand world events as they happen by showing them were countries are in this very compact World Atlas.Even the small print was easy for me to read.

Although the actual writing of the book is excellent, conveying wonderfully the flavor and character of the times as well as the vanity of the monarchs and suitors, the plot ends abruptly with a tragic ending. Aside from altogether disliking tragedies, I found this ending a surprising disappointment because the book gave very little indication of the horrific climax which was to come. After finishing the last page, I almost felt as though I had finished reading two separate books - a romance and a tragedy"},{"Title":"Kenilworth","review":"Kenilworth is set in 1575 during the reign of Elizabeth I. It is the story of Amy Robsart who has secretly married Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester. But Leicester is the Queen's favourite and fearful that he would lose his status if his marriage became public he keeps Amy secluded in Cumnor Hall. However, such secrets are hard to keep in an Elizabethan England full of plots and intrigues between factions vying for Elizabeth's favour and as Leicester entertains the Queen at Kenilworth castle the truth will out.As usual Scott tells a good story in Kenilworth. He takes as his point of departure the known incidents of history and weaves his plot around them. He is not always faithful to the historical record, but he captures the mood of the time. His characterisation of Elizabeth is particularly fine, showing her fair and just but swift to take offence and with a devastating temper. Scott builds great tension into his plot, because it is a story rooted in a period where one false step can bring instant downfall, where the highest can be brought to the block in an instant, if Elizabeth's capricious mood turns angry.Kenilworth is quite a difficult read. Scott's scholarship was such that he often uses the language of Elizabethan times and continually refers to historical events and literary texts which are now obscure. It is for this reason that it is important to read an edition of Scott which uses the best modern experts to clarify and explain the text. The Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels, published by Edinburgh and Columbia University Press, is the definitive edition of Scott and is a stunning example of modern scholarship. The glossary is full and the notes are detailed and useful. The editor, J.H. Alexander, has gone back to Scott's original manuscript and first edition to provide a text of Kenilworth which is in a number of crucial respects different from that which has been commonly read since 1831. In the end the most important thing is that this edition makes Scott easier to read and easier to enjoy. Scott ought to be enjoyed. He was one of the most popular novelists of his day and with a little practice, reading him becomes a great pleasure. Kenilworth is quite a good place to begin an acquaintance with Scott's writing. Being set in England, it has no dialogue in the old Scots dialect, which can be difficult nowadays even for Scottish people to understand. Moreover it has a fine story with many interesting characters both virtuous and villainous. It may not be one of Scott's very greatest novels, but it is a good one and well worth reading even if at times it may be something of a struggle."},{"Title":"Kenilworth","review":"Don't read any of the following reviews unless you've already read Kenilworth. Scott deliberately withholds from the reader key facts (facts which all of the following reviews reveal) until well after the plot has started. Anyway, I've been on a Sir Walter Scott binge recently and, of the three Scott novels I've read -- Ivanhoe, Quentin Durward and this -- I'd place this book well above Ivanhoe but equal to Quentin Durward. It takes place in Elizabethan England; it has some sword fights; it's fairly funny in parts; the plot creaks only occasionally. Still, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Kenilworth","review":"As a ardent reader of medieval England stories, this is one book which I found as entertaining and romantic as any other book I have read. It has everything from castles and Knights in horses to damsels in distress. Scott is magnificent in the portrayal of Amy as well as Sir Walter Raleigh and Elizabeth is the crown of his characterisation. A book worth reading.."},{"Title":"Kenilworth","review":"Readers of Scott know not to read for plot, for even his most highly regarded novels meander and stray wilfully from the strict path of story-telling. Kenilworth, in addition to being a typically marvelous example of Scott's allusive narrative power, also happens to be the tightest and best contrived of his plots, one of the very few of his novels where all the ends are tied together convincingly. The novel has a gloriously conveyed Elizabethan atmosphere, which it is not timid about evoking at all levels and types: there is peasant comedy, taproom humor, stately politics, an aritocratic love story, villainous alchemists, and a sort of self-taught, lesser artisan hero whom its easy to root for (Wayland Smith).If you're familiar with the movie Elizabeth, you'll recognize some of the situations in this novel. But Scott isn't particularly historically accurate here, nor is he trying to be. His source is an Elizabethan ballad, and he tries to convey that world in all its Shakespearian complexity.Overall, one of the best, one of my favorite, of the Waverley novels, finally available in a dependable, well-edited edition. Bravo Scott, bravo Penguin Classics! More please!"},{"Title":"Kenilworth","review":"In Sir Walter Scott's 1821 novel KENILWORTH, very young Amy Robsart of the English country gentry had once been engaged to marry a serious young scholar of Cornwall, Edmund Tressilian. But the handsome, rich, powerful Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, comes between them. Tressilian and Amy's father, Sir Hugh, know that Amy has either eloped or been carried off by someone. But they suspect ungainly Richard Varney, not the handsome, vastly wealthy Earl of Leicester. Richard Varney, as it happens, is the hugely influential right hand man of Dudley. And one of Varney's jobs is to scout out pretty women for his Puritan master to seduce.To this end Varney systematically ingratiates himself with Sir Hugh Robsart and brings his master and Miss Robsart together in clandestine meetings. Amy loves Dudley as woman has never loved man before but will not, like his other conquests, willingly go to bed with him unless and until they are married. The Earl, for his part, is smitten by Amy and impulsively weds her, over Varney's objections that he is ruining his political career. But the great Earl remains ambitious and prudent enough to keep the wedding secret until he can find a time and a way to make it known without doing harm to his rising status with his old childhood friend and onetime fellow prisoner of the Tower of London, Elizabeth Tudor.Dudley has Varney fit up splendidly as Amy's closely guarded residence a ruined abbey which Varney has been given as spoils from Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. It pertains to the village of Cumnor near Oxford. The Earl hides his new wife in Cumnor Hall, where, after a search at novel's beginning, Tressilian finds her but cannot persuade her to return to her father.From that point on, the plot becomes more and more complex and the secret marriage harder to keep secret or, once discovered, to explain. Varney assures the inquisitive Queen that Amy is his wife, not Leicester's and Leicester takes his good time telling the truth. Meanwhile Varney convinces the already great Earl to do his best to win Elizabeth's hand and become King of England. The pious Earl trusts the villainous Varney to find a way to make this happen that is both effective and compatible with the Earl's Puritan conscience.Without revealing precisely what happens to love-smitten Amy Robarts, who remains devoted to Leicester through betrayal upon betrayal, let me quote her keeper's comment to Varney in the final pages of KENILWORTH on how Amy's love of her unworthy husband has scalded her: \\"It is a seething of the kid in the mother's milk\\" (Ch. 41).There are twenty or more other rounded, energetic characters whom readers will enjoy seeing pass across the stage of KENILWORTH. They include Sir Walter Raleigh and his legendary muddied cloak. There is Will Shakespeare, whose rhymes the Queen can't get out of her mind. There are other memorable real and fictional minor characters of both sexes.Walter Scott is famous for his descriptions of costumes, armor, jewelry and clothing. When the Queen visits Dudley's castle at KENILWORTH, her ladies must moderate their dresses lest they eclipse the vain monarch. But Elizabeth likes her men young and well turned out and the Earl of Leicester outdoes them all in dazzling white: \\"his shoes being of white velvet ... his stockings of knit silk, lined with cloth of silver ... the scabbard of his sword of white velvet with golden buckles\\" and on and on (Ch. 31).This is a rich fable of a Lord who did his devious best to have his cake and eat it too. Its dramatic possibilities led into almost as many Walter Scott operas as did IVANHOE. KENILWORTH inspired Auber, Klein, de Lara, Donizetti, among others, to set the story to music.Finally: a friend of mine grew up in affluent Kenilworth Village, north of Chicago. She says that street names there are daily reminders of characters from Sir Walter Scot's novel of the same name. My friend cites Amy Robsart as the prime example. An American town created as a monument to Sir Walter Scott! And why not? Sir Walter Scott's great historical, almost gothic, novel of 1821, KENILWORTH, deserves celebrating and is more exciting and heart-stopping fiction than plodding, minutely accurate history. Thank you, Illinois!-OOO-"},{"Title":"Kenilworth","review":"As the book opens, Amy Robsart has left her family home and has secretly married Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Amy's father, Sir Hugh and the man her father intended her to marry, Edmund Tressilian, have no knowledge of Amy's whereabouts and suspect foul play at the hands of Dudley's sneaky master of the horse, Richard Varney, and Tressilian goes in search of Amy at an old manor house, Cumnor Place. As Elizabeth I's attraction to Dudley grows, so does Dudley's ambitions to reach for the stars and a greater place at court than he ever dared for, and Amy becomes a bit of a liability -- especially to Varney who hopes to rise in power alongside his master--and thus the game is on.This is the first Walter Scott that I have read, with the exception of Ivanhoe and that was many years ago when I was a young child. I admit to almost giving up a couple of times, as the vernacular used by the characters was hard to follow at times, but it's worth slugging through the first 50 or so pages until the story starts cooking along as Scott takes the reader on a grand ride through the court of Elizabeth Tudor. Even Walter Raleigh makes a wonderful secondary character, his characterization of Elizabeth I was spot on, and I loved the way Scott worked Dudley's famous fete of Elizabeth at his castle at Kenilworth into Amy's story.Although Scott based this tale on an old English Ballad (which is printed in the back of the book) and not known history, it's still a jolly good yarn peopled with interesting characters, poison, astrology, treachery and all the well known intrigues of the Court of Elizabeth I. Those of you who are well versed in Tudor history already know the fate of Amy Robsart and I will have to warn those potential readers who are picky about historical accuracy that Scott definitely diddles with history in this tale. But for those readers who are willing to forget what's in the history books and ready to enjoy a jolly good yarn by a master storyteller about Elizabethan England, this is one book worth checking out, and I intend to read other books by this author. Five stars."},{"Title":"Kenilworth","review":"Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) is Scotland's greatest novelist. The poet and lawyer turned to fiction after Lord Byron's poetic star ascended while his declined. Scott is the father of the historical novel. In his Waverly novels he revolutionized the novel and won glowing immortality in English literature.Kenilworth (1821) shows Scott moving south of the border to Great Britain. Tne book is set in 1575 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Historical figures such as Sir Walter Scott and Shakespeare (fleetingly) appear in the excitingly melodramatic tale of intrigue, murder and court politics at Elizabeth's court.The plot: Amy Robsart is secretly married to Dudley Lord Leicester. Leicester wishes the marriage to remain secret as he is courting Queen Elizabeth. Dudley dreams of becoming King of England. Amy is also loved by the Cornishman Tresillian who seeks to help her escape from Cumnor Place where she has been forced into seclusion by her husband. Scott is good at imprisonment images: Amy is often described as a bird in a cage.Leicester and his chief henchamn Richard Varney want it believed that Amy is wed to Varney. Elizabeth learns the truth. Amy is murdered by Varney and the thughs who are in his employ (this is a fictional account; historians are divided as to what led to Amy's early death). Richard Varney is the most interesting figure in the novel. He is an amoral overachiever whose Machiavellian plotting leads him to disaster. He is one of the most dastardly villains in all of English literature.The novel is divided into three parts:Part One-Set in Cumnor Place and a local inn. Part II-The Elizabethean court in London. Part III-The estate of Kenilworth, owned by Leicester, where he is holding a magnificent reception in honor of his guest Queen Elizabeth.Scott adds humor in his minor characters such as innkeeper Giles Gosling and Flbbertigibbet. Kenilworth is free of the Scotch dialect of most of his novels but is still a formidable read for 21st century eyes. The book is filled with excerpts of poetry and quotes from literary works. Scott is an acquired taste since his style is convoluted, formal and difficult to decipher.As a fan of Scott I love the new Penguin Revised edition of his works based on the Edinburgh Edition. The Penguin edition includes a glossary of words used by Scott and over 50 pages of footnotes explaining the many arcane references.Scott committed many literary crimes! Among them:a. Difficult sentence structure hard to understand on a first reading.b. Implausible plots based on coincidencec. Wooden characters who are one dimensional. They are puppets.4. Intrusive authorial comments on the plot development and characters.5. Creaking plot manipulation.6. Unrealistic dialogue. The characters talk as if they are on stage declaiming and revealing themselves to the audience. At times I thought I was watching a Shakespearean drama.7. Too many words! The books needed better editing.With all these failing Scott excells in the primary fictional requirement of an author. The author of Waverly knew how to tell a story! His tales will long be remembered by readers who soldier through the prose to reach their final page. Great Scott! What a genius was this father of the historical romance novel!"},{"Title":"Kenilworth","review":"Sir Walter Scott (1771 - 1832): Kenilworth. A Romance. Edited and with an Introduction by J. H. Alexander. London and New York: Penguin Books, 1999. xlvi and 467 pages.Scott started his literary life as a poet and only later turned to novel-writing. Perhaps that is why his plots are not always as brilliantly conceived as his descriptions of the life and times about which he writes. \\"Kenilworth\\" was his second novel, after \\"Ivanhoe\\", in which England and not Scotland stood in the centre of attention. Unlike \\"Ivanhoe\\", however, \\"Kenilworth\\" is set in the Renaissance, during the long reign of Elizabeth I (the year 1575 is mentioned at one point). And I suspect that it is Scott's description of Elizabeth and her court which remains in most Englishmen's common memory of this period until today. The story Scott tells is based, as is usual with him, on historical reality, which he has, using his incredibly full antiquarian knowledge of the period, described and expanded to cover a large canvas with some of the most colourful scenes and characters to be found in any historical novel. Next to the wonderfully evocative descriptions of Elizabethan pageantry I would name the profoundly skilful dialogues between the Earl of Leicester and Elizabeth or between the Earl and Varney, his master of horse, as the high points of the novel. These are reported in such detail that, inevitably, the story-line or plot only develops comparatively slowly, although this, of course, builds up enormous tension towards the end of the book until the whole is tragically resolved. The detailed descriptions and reports of conversations also create character, and Scott has here very ably created some of literature's most fascinating characters. Other reviewers have pointed to Elizabeth herself, here most wittily characterized, but personally I found equal pleasure in the power-hungry, wavering Earl of Leicester, in the cringing, miserly Forster, in the hypocritical astrologer Alasco, in his former assistant Wayland and in the grimassing, inquisitive boy known generally as \\"Flibbertigibbet\\". The villain Varney is painted in very black colours, almost too black to be true; the tragic heroine, Amy Robsart, has, interestingly enough, been compared with Lucy in \\"The Bride of Lammermoor\\", but for my taste Amy seems a little too passive and submissive. If there is a \\"hero\\" to the story, I suppose it is Tressilian, who is, however, lost sight of during considerable chunks of the story.Reading Scott is always something of a daunting task because of his immense vocabulary and his constant use of antique or antiquarian terms. The Penguin Edition of \\"Kenilworth\\" makes this task somewhat easier by providing copious notes and an extended glossary, although these practically entail one in reading with two fingers in different places at the back of the book and constantly turning the pages back and forth. Scott's unbounded delight in quotes from the Bible, from Chaucer, from Shakespeare, from Webster and from Ben Johnson as well as from more obscure literary and historical works is perfectly documented in the notes. The \\"introduction\\" should only be read after studying the novel, not before, and should really have been printed at the end, not before the text. There are various other aids to understanding here, too, including a comparison of the novel with the known historical facts, and some 16th century maps and charts of Kenilworth Castle where the majority of the \\"action\\" in the second half of the book takes place.\\"Kenilworth\\" is definitely one of Scott's major novels, although I would recommend that novices start with his more popular tales of Scotland: \\"Guy Mannering\\"Guy Mannering (Penguin Classics), \\"Old Mortality\\"Old Mortality (Oxford World's Classics), \\"The Heart of Midlothian\\"The Heart of Midlothian (Oxford World's Classics), \\"Rob Roy\\"Rob Roy (Oxford World's Classics)or \\"The Bride of Lammermoor\\"The Bride of Lammermoor (Oxford World's Classics), all of which were published some years prior to \\"Kenilworth\\"."},{"Title":"Kenilworth","review":"I don't know if I would read this book again, but it was enjoyable for the sake of being new. The story is about a young woman in the 1500's who leaves her father's house to secretly marry an Earl. Her husband avoids acknowledging her in order to stay in favor at court. The complications arise when her husband's designing servants try to get rid of her while her fiance comes to return the 'dishonored' woman to her father."},{"Title":"Kenilworth","review":"This is a brilliant evocation of the world of Elizabeth the First as seen through the events surrounding a visit by the queen to Kenilworth, the mansion of her favorite. The descriptions and characters are wonderful. The tragic ending is handled in a manner worthy of Shakespeare. Indeed, I must say that if Shakespeare had lived a few centuries later and written historical novels, the result would have been the same as here."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"Grimes' best book yet, Hotel Paradise is not a page-turner whodunit. Instead, she takes time to leisurely unfold the scene, develop her characters, and intertwine the threads of her plot.Through the eyes of our young detective Emma, we see the quiet, almost decaying life of backwater La Porte. Forty years earlier, a young girl Emma's age had drowned under strange circumstances. And now there is a new death, the victim unknown. Emma, believing these deaths are connected, is determined to interview anyone who might know about either death. Someone needs to care about that long-ago little girl and her unexplained death, and Emma is the only Someone there is.The story of her pursuit is often sharply funny, sometimes bittersweet. For while Emma is a keen observer of adult behavior, she is also a lonely little girl left to her own devices between serving three meals a day at her mother's decrepit old summer hotel. Her loneliness, combined with a zeal for the ! truth, leads her to seek out town characters considered either objects of derision or just plain invisible by the rest of the citizens.The magic of this novel lies in Emma's growing awareness of the kinship she shares with the girl of forty years ago. As Emma learns of the girl's loneliness and despair--what Emma calls the blue devils--she begins to understand and deal with her own pain."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"Hotel Paradise is a time travel vehicle of sorts. It takes the reader back to a simpler more provincial time before words such a potitical correctness and social consciousness became part of our vocabulary and nothing was thought of a 12 year old girl working in the family business.The 12 year old girl in question is the narrator of the story and although she demonstrates a naivete comensurate with her years she also possesses an innate intelligence, insight and compassion far beyond her chronological age.We become intimately acquainted with the people in the narrators life from her preoccupied, overworked mother and demanding spinster great aunt to the verbally challenged Wood brothers and her much admired confidant, Sheriff Sam DeGheyn. Itisn't until the final pages of the book that we learn that our narrators name is Emma Graham.Throughout the book Emma is obsessed with two things: (1) her mothers culinary talent (she describes the tasty dishes in great detail and consumes them with unabashed relish....possibly using the comfort she finds in the food to fill other voids in her young life) and (2) investigating the 40 year old death by drowning of antoher 12 year old named Mary-Ellen Devereau.Although this tale contains the requisite number of unexplained deaths, plus a spooky murky, water-lilly filled lake, an eerie abandoned old house and a town filled with citizens unwilling to share their knowledge of past events, this is less a murder mystery and more a study in morals and character.Die-hard mystery lovers may find this offering disappointing, but for lovers of visually descriptive writing and eloquent observations liberally laced with humor, Hotel Paradise is a book you will savour.Should you choose to check in to Hotel Paradise, your sure to enjoy your visit. 3 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"i felt let down by this book. the characters were forgetable, and so was the ending.i read this for my book club, and i always have a favorite line from any given book.this is the first time that i did not have one. our club did have an interesting discussion, however."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"Martha Grimes is a favorite author - I have all of her Jury series, which I love.

Mystery is a sidelight rather than the keynote. The writing is superb, and one has to love young Emma and the family and characters she lives with and among, Please keep them coming, Martha!"},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"I read Hotel Paradise on the recommendation of my sister, whose taste in books I trust. I immediately enjoyed the voice of the 12-year-old narrator and - not having read anything by Martha Grimes before - was not actually expecting a crime novel, and maybe that was a good thing, because this book doesn't really fit that genre. I'm not sure what genre it does fit - ghost story? coming of age novel? For me, it was evocative of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, as we get this 12-year-old girl's view of her world.And it's a pretty strange world. If not for the specific reference to old Clint Eastwood westerns on the first page, I'd have thought the book was set in the 1950s. Martha Grimes has played with her readers in the time setting, many of the characters seem almost Victorian and Emma Graham, the 12-year-old girl, references things like bombazine, corsets, fingerless gloves, etc. If the story HAD been set in the 1950s, the 40-year-old mysterious death of a 12-year-old girl would have occurred around 1915, which would also have suited some of the details. Since the story is ultimately set in the 1990s (the book was published in 1996), the child's drowning had to happen in the 1950s. Which ALSO fit some of the descriptions. The disparity in time frames made for an other-worldly read, but at times, it also jerked me out of the story. It was disorienting, a bit like swimming underwater, but it made an interesting read.The author's intent was also murky, and again, it helped that I didn't go into the book with high expectations of a crime novel. The plot unwound leisurely, full of Emma's observations of the people around her, and I really enjoyed that aspect. I don't mind a leisurely tale, as long as it's interesting along the way. This book was.Go into this with an open mind. Let Emma's voice charm you, as it did me, and don't rush through the reading. My sister is currently reading the sequel, Cold Flat Junction, and has promised to loan it to me when she's done. I can't wait."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"I actually read this book a couple of months ago - but I just found the sequel to it which reminded me to leave a review.

Grimes' 12-year-old protagonist, whose name we do not learn until the last chapter, investigates the local mystery of the death by drowning of another 12-year-old girl 40 years ago. She traverses the area around her small Appalachian town of Spirit Lake, speaks to interesting people, and describes her adventures in a way that is both poetic and true to her age. In fact, one of the most remarkable things about the book is the voice of its narrator. She is at once wise beyond her years, immature, and precocious. She admits she is not privy to information about sex, the proper names of flora and fauna, or the seemingly contradictory motivations of the grownups around her. However, she seems to get on best with people who are much, much older than her and has a way of getting them to talk to her like she is a person instead of just a kid. She muses about herself and what qualities she must have to be able to blend in at some times, and at other times inspire folks to take notice. I just love her, if you can't tell. When I was younger, I used to pretend I was her and try to start conversations with old folks.

It's everything Tartt's readers had been hoping for. The plot of \\"Hotel Paradise\\" is solid; its characters are lovable and eccentric--their quirkiness is enjoyable, never stretching the rubber bands of credibility.The humor is warm; the mystery is tantalizing; the narrator's perceptions are just right for a bookwormish young girl who is still part child but eager to become a woman.It's a compelling page-turner, and you will feel like an honorary member of the town.

I found that this was the fourth book in this Martha Grimes series and did not stand alone because of the references to prior stories and characters. I liked what I heard of the beginning of Belle Ruin enough to look into the other previous books. I found Hotel Paradise. Thought there is a previous book, the End of the Pier, that one is not about Emma, so I skipped that one. I will go back to it though. Anyway, who would have thought that the ramblings of a 12 year old girl could be so hypnotic? I am listening to the audio book and find myself looking forward to the time in my car so that I can hear more. This story is as much about the insights and musings of this girl as it is about the deaths around her in which she is so interested. Left mostly to her own devices, with little, if any, adult supervision, Emma gets it into her head that a young girl, a girl her age, who died 40 years ago was murdered as opposed to being in an accident. Using her age as manipulation, she goes places and talks to people who wouldn't have given the time of day to an adult in the same way. She asks and asks an thinks and thinks until she comes up with the answer to the death of Rose Devereaux and who killed her. This book ends with that revelation and just stops. I was a bit disappointed in that until I started on Cold Flat Junction where I realized that the story had only just begun.

Hotel Paradise is perhaps the best of the 3 in terms of the writer's craft. The mystery plot can't truly called a plot, since nothing really happens in the space of the few days during which this novel occurs. The story is in the unanswered questions and the pathos surrounding the characters' lives. I enjoyed the lyrical prose, the descriptions, the characters, and the \\"somewhere in time\\" aura - you don't know where or when this book happened, or if some of it ever happened at all.

At some time, Grimes must have read, and been deeply impressed by, &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird,&quot; and decided to write her own novel in which the adult world is seen through the eyes of an adolescent. If so, she has failed miserably, and clearly does not understand what made that book so compelling and memorable. First, the narrator in this book is far too sophisticated and has too adult a vocabulary to be a convincing adolescent. Moveover, the book meanders listlessly and pointlessly, with scene after extended scene that has no real purpose or interest. The book is overloaded with what I imagine are supposed to be eccentric characters, but I found them flat, one-dimensional, and without any true sense of insight, pathos or complexity behind them. The same four or five scenes are repeated endlessly and needlessly, without any significant variation or a sense that the story is moving forward. Reading this interminable, uneventful, slow-moving book is a paralyzing experience. Worst of all, as a mystery, it is an infuriating botch. You don't learn anything of significance until page 400, when the narrator meets some people that she could just as easily have met on page 100, and who simply recite the events that occurred 40 years before. Explanations (at least, those few that we are provided) are anticlimactic and mundane and are given in a flat, off-hand manner in the last 20 pages. Most aggravating of all, we are never told who committed the central murder in the book, or how it was arranged.

One has to wonder if she has ever seen one from the 1950s, which is where I place the time of HOTEL PARADISE (maybe wrong, could be the 30s).Makes a fair summer read, where the author tries too hard to be convincing.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"The main character of this book is a twelve year old girl. One would not, however, know that if the author had not told us. Written in the first person, the language and vocabulary are not even close to typical for a twelve year old. The plot is, at best, sketchy and has no moments of excitement or suspense. But the final blow is that, at the end of the story, the reader is left wondering what really happened. There is no climax or clarity to the plot. The plot is &quot;cloudy&quot; and the author is long-&quot;winded.&quot; Perhaps the main character is reading a story and imagining the scenario set forth here, but that is not clear either. It is a long book, over 400 pages that goes nowhere very slowly. One redeeming characteristic could be the development of the various personalities, but this is overshadowed by the major obscurities of the book. This author has written several more books and I will read another in the hope that this one is her only dud."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"As a young reader and writer, this was highly recommended to me and I thought, \\"Why?\\" There was no mystery, no plotting.

I hesitate to try another."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"This book is soooooo boring. And I usually LOVE Martha Grimes but this book is excrutiatingly slow-paced and pointless. The pace better pick up and soon or I'm going to abandon this book or conveniently lose it somewhere. I'm on page 120 and this is torture. But I don't give up easily so...I'll read on. Big Sigh."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"I am afraid I cannot give this book more than 2 stars. The author is definitely talented; her prose is beautifully rendered. However, the ending leaves one terribly unsatisfied and frustrated.The protaganist is a young 12 year old girl who becomes rather obsessed with a long ago death that happened near the Hotel Paradise on Spirit Lake. As the young girl recounts the history of the death, she introduces the reader to the town of Spirit Lake and the inhabitants. During the recounting of the long ago death, the protaganist goes off on various tangents about her life and the author writes pages of minutiae that never really further the investigation into the mysterious death.We are not even told the name of the young 12 year old girl until almost the end of the story. There is a second book called \\"Cold Flat Junction\\" which looks like it picks up where \\"Hotel Paradise\\" leaves off but I don't know if I can stand to muddle through it.Martha Grimes' writing is beautiful, I will give her that. If you want a really good mystery story with a 12 year old protaganist try the Bradley books. They are much better."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"I must disagree with the reader who skewers this book so dreadfully (regarding a 12 year-old's vocabulary). Perhaps one of the reasons I responded so viscerally to Grimes' book is that I was a 12 year-old exactly like this narrator--bookish and full of Victorian words better written than pronounced. In &quot;Hotel Paradise,&quot; Grimes creates a book that completely pulled me in and when it ended, I was saddened because then I had to give up the narrator's world, one I happily entered for a period of hours. I will collect Martha Grimes' books happily now (this was my first one). I most heartily recommend this book to anyone who likes books for the way they are written, and to those who can use their own imaginations when they read--after all, isn't that part of the fun of reading fiction? Grimes is no dime-store novel simpleton. Her words leap off of the page and the phrases in &quot;Hotel Paradise&quot; are almost edible. Buy this book in hardcover and loan it to a friend when you are finished."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"This is the second of Martha Grimes books which depart from her usual fun English mystery format and I think it is much more successful than the first attempt.This book tells the story of a 12 year old girl living with her Mother in a run-down resort hotel who becomes obsessed with understanding why a girl her age drowned in the lake in front of their property 40 years ago.It is really a great coming of age story about a young girl who has been emotionally abandoned by her family and who needs find a place for herself and understand that sometimes one person in a family may become the family scapegoat for reasons they can't control.You will love the main character. She is spunky and intelligent and brave.This book is usually cataloged in the mystery section but is really just good fiction and shouldn't be overlooked by those people who say &quot;I don't read mysteries&quot;."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"This is--without a doubt--my all-time favorite book. I love it!Our 12 year-old heroine (whose name is not revealed until the very end of the book) has a hard life. What is perhaps one of the more brilliant aspects of the book, is that she honestly doesn't realize how hard her life is. Working 3 meals a day, 7 days a week as a waitress (something that an adult would never stand for), she is ignored by most adults and tormented by the closest thing she has to a contemporary: the awful Regina Jane Davidow.Of course, one of the other brilliant points of the book is that her life isn't nearly as miserable as she believes it to be, either.Her only friends are Maude, the waitress, and Sam, the sheriff (featured characters in the like-wise brilliant &quot;End of the Pier&quot;). But even Maude and Sam can't follow her when she delves into the past, back into a 40 year-old death which haunts her thoughts. What exactly did happen to Mary Evelyn Devereau? What ever became of Ben Queen? Who is the mysterious &quot;Girl&quot; who keeps appearing and disappearing? Most of all--how can one little girl put to rest the ghosts of another child who died nearly 30 years before she was born?From the first line of Chapter 2, you know this is going to be a good book. &quot;My mother was not a Paradise.&quot; Isn't that the most perfect line you've ever read? I only wish it were the first line of the entire book. Ms. Grimes is beyond a doubt one of the most talented fiction writers (ignore the whole &quot;mystery&quot; genre--this woman can WRITE) of our generation. I only wish she had an editor who would guide her a little more. Sometimes she does stray from her characters a bit. But all things considered, it is very hard to find fault with a masterpiece such as this."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"I have to disagree with the negative reviews printed here. Hotel Paradise is exactly the kind of book I love to read. I took it on vacation and lounged in the sun with it for several days. As soon as it ended, I started it again. Martha Grimes obviously has a great respect for young people and their intuitive view of the adult world. I wasn't bothered at all at the lack of plot action or mystery resolution. The resolution is there for readers to decipher on their own. Can't wait to discuss this book with my Mother Daughter book group."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"It is a mystery novel of sorts, but there is not a bit of formula, and I enjoyed the nods to Rebecca and To Kill a Mockingbird. The protagonist is an engaging young girl who is a complex mixture of intelligence, sophistication, strength of character, sensitivity, and vulnerability. In a sense, this is more of a rite of passage story than it is a mystery story.The prose is richly written, describing landscapes, people, and character interactions with an other-worldliness that haunts the reader. If you are looking for something more character-driven than the usual whodunit, and you can live with some ambiguity, I think you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"This book begins a trilogy that surpasses the genre of mysteries. The development of Emma as a young narrator is both real and poignant and humorous--I found I was thinking of her as a real human being, whose brave acceptance of the life she's been given moved me. If you enjoyed To Kill A Mockingbird, or even Anne of Green Gables when you were young, you should find this book and enter this beautifully drawn world of a South from not so long ago."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"I've read most of Grimes' Richard Jury mysteries and have enjoyed them enough to pick-up the next one I run across. But nothing in these novels prepared me for the excellence of this book. Gentle and flowing, the writing pulls you in and holds you captivated in the shadowy interior world of a teenage girl coming of age - a world halfway between dream and reality yet totally believable. The best writing I have encountered in a long, long time."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"Has anyone else found that Hotel Paradise is one of the Most Important Books they have ever read? It is Martha Grime's equivalent of the Magic Flute, a Mozartian masterpiece, a joyous, magical work unlike any other novel I've ever encountered! I did not want it to end; I was spellbound, entranced, transported to my own childhood where everything burgeoned on the edge of mystery. Mystical, earthy, evocative -- it was everything you could possibly want a novel to be. Even the Proverbial One Book You'd Want on a Desert Island! Well, for me -- this is it."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have long been a fan of Martha Grimes and her Richard Jury series and this is the first book of hers that I have read that does not center around that British crime solver. One of the things that I loved about it was its' humor and I have not seen another reviewer refer to that. I found myself smiling at the 12 year old's train of thought. Not all of the characters are fully developed, but that may be left to other books that are concerned with this distinctly American location by Martha Grimes. I am looking forward to dropping into Cold Flat Junction and The End of the Pier to see what Maud and Sam and others are up too."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"I loved this novel and thoroughly enjoy Emma Graham as the narrator. Grimes did a wonderful job, the characters are full, there is humour and conflict, light and shadows which just adds to the atmosphere.Truly an enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"I agree that this book is well written, and has some beautiful phrasing at times,hence the three stars. However, the plot development is poor and the character development is awful. The characters are just plain boring, although it seems as if the author is trying to pass them off as eccentric. The end is so incredibly frustrating. I felt as if I'd slogged through over 400 pages of redundant, stagnated plot and arrived nowhere. Who killed Mary Evelyn? Who killed the woman at Mirror Pond? What's going on between the sherrif and Maude? What's going on between the main character's mother and Lola Davidow? Is she indebted to her in some way? The only thing that got answered was who killed Ben Queen's wife. It's almost as if Martha Grimes just lost interest in the story toward the end. I will try another of her books, because she writes well, but I wouldn't recommend this book unless you're already a fan."},{"Title":"Hotel Paradise (Emma Graham Mysteries)","review":"I couldn't get into this novel. I don't think Martha Grimes took the time to create a vision of a realistic setting, time, and character definitions for this book. As a consequence, I couldn't relate to the place, era, or people that make up the fabric of the story. It felt like being in Disney World...one minute you're on Main Street USA, then a few steps later you're on the frontier 40 years earlier. Disney makes it fun, but in this novel it's just confusing.The main character, supposedly a 12 year old girl, sounds like Martha Grimes, the adult, sometimes remembering to pretend she's a 12 year old girl. And I couldn't tell if this was set in the 90s, 70s, or 50s, because the cues were inconsistent. If this were deliberately meant to be a surrealist novel, it would have been more interesting, but I think Ms. Grimes just couldn't get her context clear. It became distracting. After a while, I got tired of wandering around in this tale and just stopped reading it. Perhaps the ending provides some logical reason for the confusion."},{"Title":"The adventures of Ulysses","review":"I like how quickly this book downloaded to my computer and am looking forward to reading it and using it in home schooling my 9th grader in Honors English.

As a young women in London in the early 20th century, she was acquainted with people like Arthur Conan Doyle, W.B. Yeats, H.G. Wells and James Joyce. She was trained at the British College of Psychic Science by Hewat McKenzie and took part in psychic research. After the beginning of World WarII, she came to America and founded her own publishing house and eventually co-founded the Parapsychology Foundation in New York City.Eileen Garrett was such an outstanding person and author that this book, written in 1968, really needs to be reissued, especially with the renewed interest in mediums and psychics. Fortunately, I was able to find a good used copy through the Amazon used book service."},{"Title":"Many voices: The autobiography of a medium (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"I got this book after Mrs. Garrett was referenced by Edgar Cayce. I am diving into this world and trying to learn as much about it as possible. Mrs. Garrett is a very facinating person and has many perspectives concerning the paranormal. This book was difficult to navigate at times and tended to digress a fair bit. I felt that Mrs. Garrett had many insights and I believe her to be a very gifted medium. I hoped for more information on how exactly she would go into her \\"trance\\" but got the feeling she herself was not quite sure. She is also lighthearted in her approach and maintains that she and we could all be crazy...lol. I like the fact that she did not take herself to seriously and I think this aspect of her personality only gave her more credibility.It's an interesting read."},{"Title":"Many voices: The autobiography of a medium (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"I have found Eileen Garrett's autobiography to be both fascinating and beautifully-written. Eileen was one of the most well-known and studied mediums of the twentieth century. She helped thousands of people with her inner powers and participated in many studies of the paranormal as well as being a very successful businesswoman. She was acquainted with many figures of the early and middle part of the twentieth century, including William Butler Yeats, D. H. Lawrence, and T. S. Eliot, who frequented her early business of a tea shop in Dublin, Ireland. Her descriptions of these luminaries give another side to their characters. In her autobiography she touches on many themes relating to ESP and the unknown. Here is her short chapter on the dream world.**************************************************************************Chapter 46I am happy that in an age of technology there are those who are giving modern interpretation to the dream world which contains the key to the development of the evolution of the race. The dream world, and the world of deep feeling which is interpreted by symbols, relate to us the ancient races, for the dreams of ancient man and modern man are given in the same symbolic language.Symbolism, with its inner feelings and impressions, is expressed with the same sensory aspects of the outer world's intensity and association. Symbolic dreaming is a survival that leads us from different cultures and different historical associations across centuries. It is still the language of the myth and fairy tale, and it is never forgotten in the unconscious, but too often its meanings are overlooked or not understood. In the symbolic dream, where time and space do not exist, we are linked with our earliest ancestors.The language of symbol and dream is the route to the unconscious whole. Within these two facets of mind we must look if we would find security. This has been the route specifically human, the dual level contained within the universal concept of being. It has been mostly a foreign language, but in recent decades we have grown to comprehend that if we could remember the past, we could find the conception of a future which is daily being unfolded.Insight is within the grasp of the dreamer, for he escapes the waking intensity which tends to hold back the vitality that bids us carry on with life, often as underground levels. The eternal now instinctively carries us forward and contains within it knowledge and experience of the routes ahead, even though those routes are dimmed when we awaken to each day's new experiences. The prediction is clear in a dreaming world, but the route is clouded when we surface to live out the day's experience. The outer eye discerns only what is to be undertaken in a three-dimensional world.

The 1969 paperback edition of this book has a psychedelic cover and on the back the blurb states, \\"From ESP to LSD... an Extraordinary Lifetime of Adventures in the Psychic World!\\" Sensational stuff so far. However, the book reveals a life of hard work and dedication to the truth in an attempt to uncover the meaning and value of a capacity to receive apparent messages from the dead.This is a book packed full of incident. Ms. Garrett has a non-sentimental view of spiritualism and concedes that much in the way of supposed communication with the dead is banal and platitudinous. Written in 1968, it accurately predicts the advent of showbiz spiritualism where the emphasis is on showmanship and where alleged communication with the deceased is nothing more than social entertainment. She even speculates on whether the only purpose of spiritualism is as a form of propaganda \\"to deaden sensitivities and keep alive the feeling that all is well with the world\\".As for her so-called spirit controls, she states, \\"I long ago accepted them as working symbols of the subconscious\\". However, when she moved to America, the spirit control going by the name of Abdul Latif, she says, stayed behind, and worked with (possessed?) another medium called Miss Francis.The perils of mediumship become apparent as she suffers one illness after another in the course of her work. On one occasion a mysterious, apparently paranormal hooded being appeared in her hospital room to advise her to practice correct breath control to maintain her health and prevent asthma. She says that by following this being/person's advice she obtained a new elasticity of vision and mind.She says that in anxious times the demand for mediums increases. The message of this book seems to be that it might be best not to bother. She makes reference to the strict training she received from Hewat McKenzie, who sounds like a hard taskmaster, and who spent time training the spirit controls to show respect to the medium's ego.By 1968 spiritualism had become a religion. People attend services, get their bland messages and leave contented. Does it matter if there is no safeguard on conditions? That is one question that is raised. There don't seem to be any easy answers. I suspect that this book is of great value, probably especially to those keen, like Ms. Garrett, to explore the world of \\"dreams, psychic impulses and conscience itself\\" and I wouldn't be surprised if she is unique among mediums in recommending LSD as a means of reaching the unconscious self.Ultimately, perhaps books like this are beneficial in that maybe they get the conscious mind to reconcile itself with the subconscious mind. Ms. Garrett states that she regards the unconscious with awe and veneration. However, I wouldn't be surprised if a psychiatric diagnosis was schizophrenia/multiple personality disorder, and it's probably not a book for those of a dogmatic disposition."},{"Title":"Alaskan Nights (Silhouette Special Edition Series #1547)","review":"Ah, Rand Michaels is barely into his mission when trouble erupts.

After purchashing Gyatso's \\"Introduction to Buddhism\\", I decided to seek out a local practice. Fortunately there was a weekly Buddhism Meditation Class about 25 minutes from my home.I attended the class and felt that it was somewhat valuable. It gave me an opportunity to get out of the house, meet new people and explore Buddhism further. Interestingly, upon further research I found the class I was attending was part of Gyatso's schools! I was quite happy to fall into order.The next book I purchased was \\"The New Meditation Handbook\\", which covers many (if not all) of the meditations that Gyatso recommends his students do on a regular basis. It also includes prayers and mantras and explanations of everything. It seemed to be a great read, although Gyatso does recycle a good amount of his material from book to book.Finally, I purchased Transform Your Life: A Blissful Journey and attended a retreat at the NKT school. I walked away from the retreat with a different \\"feel\\" for NKT Buddhism.NKT stands for New Kadampa Tradition and while I am really not versed enough in what the Old Kadampa Tradition is, I remember reading that NKT was founded by Gyatso in the UK as a means of seperating from Tibetan Buddhism because of the politics. Gyatso has sold countless books and has established thousands of practices throughout the world.NKT Buddhism wasn't for me. There were some things that Gyatso taught that just didn't make sense to me. Granted, he's the Tibetan Monk and I'm just the average Joe, but Buddha himself is quoted as saying \\"Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.\\" And unfortunately, NKT Buddhism just didn't appeal to my own reason and common sense...but it may be different for you.Overall there is nothing objectionable in Gyatso's teachings. I do not care much for how Buddha is revered as a god and considerable time is spent reciting prayers to Buddha."},{"Title":"Meditation Handbook","review":"Let's get down to business, consciousness enters the human body to meditate.

I made more progress thanI ever had in any spiritual or psychological program. So I naturally started to do the meditations for a second 21-days.I treated my family as myself or better. I felt that life had meaning. I felt part of you, the reader of this review, as well.That there was a connection to everything else. Then my brotherasked me what program I was doing. I told him that it was theLamrim meditations of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. He told me that theDali Lama was angry at him for worshipping a protector deity named Dorje Shugden. So I quit. Until now. I did a one month exhaustive investigation of this affair. I have found Geshe Kelsang Gyatso blameless. And the Dali Lama was trying to keep his country intact because a book titled \\"The Yellow Book\\" wasdividing it. This book portrayed Dorje Shugden as a hero entity that was protecting Tibet and driving away the Nyingma influences. I am back. And this book is the best. It may not be the best for you. But it is the best for me. The 21 meditations are a concise psychological map for mental health. I have known lamas and swamis who are quite mean-spirited. But howcan you be mean if you are meditating on love? The mind takes the form of whatever it is paying attention to. After you have this book, you will see that the first meditation involves meditating on your Spiritual Guide. Don't be frightened. You can meditate on Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. Or you can meditate on the Dali Lama.Pick one of them as your Spititual Guide if you don't have a teacher of somekind. The next problem that you might encounter is the meditation on Tranquil Abiding. I just called The NKTCenter in Los Angeles to get an answer. You can achieve tranquil abiding (the ninth stage) at home and in the evenings.Students have done so. This book is such a tremendous achievement. You will have such great joy. I am sorry that I quit. And I wish you the very best of happiness."},{"Title":"Meditation Handbook","review":"This is a very short introduction to Tibetan Buddhist meditation by a very credible author.

There's nothing wrong with that, if you're interested in Buddism. However, as a book on MEDITATION, I expected to learn about meditation, not Buddism. The subtitle, &quot;A Step-by-step Manual for Buddist Meditation&quot;, is more accurate. However, once again, there's little actual information about meditation techniques, and much more about how to meditate from the Buddist perspective. Meaning, that the focus is on the philosophy and not techniques. For instance...The section entitled, &quot;How to meditate&quot;, is 4 pages long. The majority of the book (just over 80 pages!) concerns the &quot;Twenty-one Meditations&quot;, which are things to meditate ON - essentially ideas - which are presented as a sequential process of meditative enlightenment.

Additionally, much of the wording herein is also repeated (in many cases, verbatim), within Gyatso's other audio books (i.e.: Transform Your Life, How To Solve Our Human Problems, Introduction to Buddhism, etc.). There is even considerable repetition contained within the presently reviewed audio book itself. In other words, lots of regurgitation with little in the way of new or revelatory information.At one point, the author claims swatting a mosquito in anger will result in eons in the hell realm. He means this literally, not figuratively or as a parable, and with no discussion of purification.Overall, it is quite preachy (\\"You must...\\"), but Gyatso does not support his rigid certainty on his subject matter other than to establish himself as the only authority on the subject. If you can blindly trust him and can believe only one author can cover the depth of Buddhism (as many seem to be able to do) you will end up with a rather narrow view on the subject.Skip this oversimplified, unsubstantiated, repetitive and preachy volume and get something from mainstream Buddhist authors instead, including Dalai Lama approved sources such as the down-to-earth Guided Meditations on the Stages of the Path by Thubten Chodron, which includes 14+ hours of guided and easy-to-use meditations on an mp3 CD for about the same price, and with a forward by His Holiness (also available from Amazon).This book is clear and easy to understand, and unlike Gyatso's self-important, claustrophobic writings, features an extensive bibliography for further reading. The CD meditations are easy to follow and delivered with extraordinary warmth, combining to yield a most effective outcome. Rest assured with the approval of His Holiness The Dalai Lama and Thubten Chodron's lucid and kind voice, you will be learning how to establish a daily meditation practice from an authentic and mainstream Buddhist.

It must be the officially encouraged/sanctioned word to use as it is ALWAYS invoked in subsequent comments 100% of the time. I genuinely feel no anger towards anyone involved, rather, I am merely amused by the over-the-top defensiveness and the militancy of this group, which only serves to further prove its draconian nature.

I've practised buddhism for more than 25 years, and honestly find the approach outlined in this book among the least attractive, least helpful, and most naive of the many books I've read. The title 'to Make Our Life Happy and Meaningful' especially rings false to me. Of course this is a lovely thought but I didn't read anything in the contents of the book and the practice it describes which made me happy or which clarified anything. Instead it left me confused and irritated. Perhaps some of the awkward writing is due to translation difficulties, though the book credits no translators -- a point of suspicion, as an enlightened author always credits his or her translator -- and one that added to the didactic, pedantic tone of The New Meditation Handbook."},{"Title":"Meditation Handbook","review":"The people buying this book think its a meditation book.

The 21 Meditations are ordered in a logical sequence of complexity, from &quot;Relying on A Spiritual Guide&quot; to &quot;Superior Seeing&quot;, and are easy to follow. Even only reading them is very beneficial to one's well-being.

In Geshe Kelsang's introduction he clearly and concisely describes the importance of meditation and how it can help us in our daily lives.

Without inner peace no matter how great our external circumcustances, we will not be able to experience true, long-lasting happiness.Geshe Kelsang describes twenty-one powerful meditations that cultivate inner peace within the mind. He also includes a special breathing meditation which focuses on a mantra, in the back of the book that is the most powerful breathing meditation I have ever done.This book is a great introduction to beginners as well as deepens the practice of seasoned meditators. The twenty-one meditations themselves are based upon specific tenents of Buddhist thought and philosophy.

That said, it's one of those books that I just had to keep going with, to find out how much worse it could possibly get, and in this regard, the book never once failed me. In fact, in its final pages, it exceeded my expectations in a way no writer has since the first time I encountered Matthew Stokoe (and for much the same reason, for those few of you who've read Stokoe's wonderfully disgusting first novel, Cows). Politically incorrect purple prose, a ham-handed sense of plotting, silly characters, and a taste for the perverse all permeate this book; if that's your thing, than by all means, have fun with it. (half)"},{"Title":"Fan-Tan","review":"It looks like the sort of thing you might stumble across in a remainder bin in a used book store. Fan Tan. Ah hah I thought another obscure masterpiece cobbled together by some old alcoholic expat. Judging by the cover (never do that) it looks like a Harlequin romance set in the mysterious East. There's the exotic Asian woman in some sort of silk kimono thing and the besotted Western sailor on the ground wondering what he's got himself into. So imagine my surprise when on closer inspection the authors turn out to be Marlon Brando and Donald Cammell! Brando of course is the well known actor who spent his later years on an island near Tahiti. But what was Cammell's name doing there? Cammell was a film maker who directed \`Performance' starring Mick Jagger...a destructive little expletive according to Keith Richards in his autobiography \`Life'. Intrigued I picked the book up....bought it and took it home. This could be good.Well not exactly. It isn't a clich&eacute; ridden load of rubbish but it comes perilously close. The year is 1927. Anatole \`Annie\\" Doultry is a middle aged adventurer serving six months in Hong Kong prison where he befriends a well-connected Chinese pirate. Once out he meets and falls in love with Madame Lai Choi San the pirate's beautiful boss. Together they sail around the China Seas on her sampan looking for treasure. They plan to attack a freighter full of silver, the biggest act of piracy the world has ever seen no less. One would think this might provide for some interesting character development. But Doultry is too much like Brando. He's a man of action but his mind wanders all over the place like Kurtz in \`Apocalypse Now' and his philosophical musing isn't coherent. He has an aversion to authority of course, intellectual swashbuckling, that's his game but he can't stick to the plot. Here's Annie on his bunk meditating...\\"However though he was once a Scot, it was not the future of the city that bore on Annie Doultry's brain, not the world's either; his own future it was, or would be. The reality to be expected, the facts of it. But was there such a thing as future fact? There was one for Mr. Wittgenstein, indeed.\\"Huh? There's a kind of surreal madness about the book that kept me turning the pages but a lot of the writing is pretty bad. Fortunately there are steamy sex scenes to make up for it. There's plenty of action including a typhoon, oriental intrigue and hand-to hand-combat. There's even a reference to the butter scene in \`Last Tango' which should amuse movie buffs. It's a strange book, full of perverse little asides, and it all takes place against a background of the revolution in China when the Nationalists and the Communists and others were forming temporary alliances.To be fair it should probably be described as a treatment rather than a novel. And it turns out that putting Brando's name on the cover is a publishing trick. Cammell wrote it. In fact the best part of the book comes at the end where film writer David Thomson explains how the book came to be written. Cammell had tried to get Brando for \`Performance'. Brando was in hospital at the time after scalding his private parts with hot coffee. Anyway he turned the offer down. Later, with Brando weighing about 300lbs due to ice-cream addiction Cammell tried again. They had a complex, almost self-destructive, kind of relationship. The book did get written but getting it published was another matter. Brando baulked again. Maybe he was ashamed of it or maybe he just enjoyed tormenting Cammell. Anyway Cammell shot himself and Brando died. The twists and turns of the publishing process would make a good book in themselves I thought.I should add that the author(s) owe a lot to \\"I Sailed with Chinese Pirates\\" by Aleko E.

Brando must have been one heckuva gas bag; this thing wanders all over the place, and seems to often forget that it's supposed to be telling a story in there somewhere. The main character pontificates minutiae until I found myself bored out of my mind, wondering when some event was going to occur that could conceivably be considered a story advancement. Further, the anachronisms abound: for example, this story takes place in 1927, but the character uses an M-1 Garand rifle, which wasn't even invented until a decade later. Just goes to show how much license a celebrity author gets, I guess. The publishers must have been banking on the gimmick of Brando's notoriety to get the sales numbers on this \\"novel\\". I don't know whether or not it worked, but if he were an unknown author, I can't imagine this thing would ever have been published.As you may have gathered, I can't in any way recommend this book.

A nuclear scientist has defected; his wife, rushing to join him, has died in a plane crash. And Hilary, intrigued, agrees to take the wife's place in an effort to trace the missing scientist and uncover the intent behind his disappearance. It is a mission from which she is unlikely to return alive.Although the premise is interesting, the resulting novel reads rather like the outline for a minor Alfred Hitchcock film. Christie writes with her usual expertise, but the characters here are not greatly memorable and the story itself falls down a bit toward the novel's conclusion. Still, it is a fast and fun read, and fans of the writer will likely enjoy it as a change of pace from her more typical fare. Mildly recommended.--GFT (Amazon reviewer)--"},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Hillary Craven, the main character in this exhilarating story, wishes to take her own life.

There's nothing cosier that sitting in a lovely warm living room reading an Christie novel while it's raining outside.That being said, this novel is very odd and uninspiring. It's not one of her typical murder mysteries...and it's all very farfetched and just barely comes together in the end.Fans of her usual material might seem a bit baffled by this 'novel'. This probably would have made a fine screenplay...but there's not enough coherence or guts to it, to make it a good novel as such. The characters also, are rather forgettable.

Has he been kidnapped or did he depart out of free will to work for the enemy? If Betterton's wife asks for permission to leave the country for a relaxing trip to Morocco, she gets followed by security agent Jessop. It all turns bad when her plane crashes on its way to Cassablanca. Nevertheless she succeeds in continuing her trip, but is not fully aware into which beehive she stumbles.First of all it must be stated clearly that this is not a detective story, but an atempt at an espionage novel. When Agatha published Destination Unknown in 1954, Ian Flemming had just created his famous James Bond character in the novel Casino Royale. Although Agatha clearly has the intention of making the plot flamboyant and bursting with action, she never succeeds in coming close to the fantastic plots that Flemming created. It is clear that the specialty of the Queen of Crime lies in the typical whodunit with Poirot and Marple as the key-characters and not in novels of espionage. The plot of Destination Unknown is straightforward and, although some admirable attempts were made to surprise the reader, lacks the level of suspense that normally characterizes this type of thriller.This book certainly does not belong to Agatha Christie's highlights. But then again, it is still remarkable that seen the enormous size of her oeuvre, she only wrote but a few really bad books."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Ok, Agatha Christie is my favorite author, but this has got to be the worst book she's written; I wish I could give it a 0. I thought it was a murder book by the title, but once I read only 1/4 of it, I knew it was boring and confusing; by the time I got to the middle of a page, I forgot what I read one page before. I almost began wishing Hillary HAD decided to kill herself. I got this book among 8 more books by Agatha Christie, and even though this is the first one I began reading, I know it's the most boring. If you like Agatha Christie like I do, get books that look interesting; believe me, this one isn't"},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Too bad you can't give a book 0 stars, I would if I could. I read this book and found it SO boring (this might be because I read it when I was 10). I couldn't remember what I had read at the top of the page before I go to the bottom! This just proves how boring it was. And believe me, I was reading other mysteries at the time so I know a good one when I see it. Agatha Christie was NOT a good one."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Destination Unknown is possibly my favorite Christie novel. It is filled with twists and turns and follows an incredibly likable woman named Hilary Craven who must pretend to be someone she is not. She is faced with a mysterious journey where each step takes her closer to danger and further from her previous life. Her goal is to find a missing scientific genius who has vanished into thin air. The reason for the disappearance is absolutely impossible to deduce until the very end. One of the main themes of this book is: the acceptance of inevitable captivity."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"One of Christie's more atypical books, Destination Unknown is much more of a spy thriller than a traditional murder mystery. Brilliant scientists are mysteriously disappearing from all over the world, and the British secret service races to discover where they've gone and why.Hilary Craven, a strong and lovely young Englishwoman who is traveling to Morocco to escape from the desperate tragedy of her life, finally realizes that she is trying to escape from herself and the pain she carries with her, so she decides to end her life. Hilary's blazing red hair turns out to be a surprising gift, however, and at this point the Secret Service makes contact with her. Hilary is sent off into the ancient cities of Africa on a wild and dangerous mission replete with the near-certainty of failure and death.Destination Unknown is a colorful and vivid spy thriller remarkable for its well-paced character development, as Hilary progresses from brokenness and utter despair to strength and courage."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Greenway Ed edition? There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead (SO MANY STEPS TO DEATH) editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Bantam, Berkley, Signet, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"I'm not much of a fan of the thriller genre - there's usually so much detailed intrigue that I can't even keep up with what's happening, let alone figure out what's really going on. So hooray for Agatha Christie! Her thrillers are plot-focused (rather than designed to show off how clever she thinks she is), admirably economical, and contain some really appealing characters.Hilary Craven is a woman who has lost her husband and child, and is seeking escape by travelling to Morocco. But once there, she discovers that her problems are within her - that there is no escape. She decides to end her life, but is interrupted by the practical Mr Jessop. Jessop has previously been encountered investigating the disappearance of Thomas Betterton, another brilliant scientist who has vanished without a trace. He suggests that if Hilary is so bent on death, she could make herself useful to him while she seeks it. Deciding that she's up to the challenge and convinced that death is what she really wants, Hilary impersonates the wife of Thomas Betterton and heads off into the unknown. She waits for Mrs Betterton's mysterious allies to contact her and take her to join her \\"husband\\", knowing she will be beyond help if her ruse is discovered. And once she is contacted, then the fun really begins.Hilary is a great character, the mystery she gets caught up in is a satisfying one, and as with all Christie novels, there is a great sense of era as the concerns and foibles of the 1950s (when this book was written) are brought to life."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Most of Agatha Christie novels are murder mysteries. They follow the usual murder mystery formula. Someone is murdered. Enter the detective who must solve the mystery before the murderer strikes again.Destination Unknown is different. It is more of a thriller than a mystery. There are deaths, but it is different. And in a total good way. This was a nice break from the murder mysteries and kept me reading until the last paragraph.Definitely recommend it for all Agatha Christie fans."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Destination Unknown is a departure from Agatha Christie's usual work in that it is not a whodunit set in England. Instead, it is one of her espionage-type works. (I say \\"espionage-type\\" because it starts out feeling like a cold-war spy thriller, but ends up being something else. I won't say any more so as not to spoil it for anyone).Of course, there is no Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple here, nor is there any of the slight quirkiness and charm that is often a trait of Christie's mysteries. Instead, Destination Unknown has a more serious feel that shows well Christie's writing skill.I enjoyed this primarily because I liked the main character, Hillary Craven. Main characters make or break books, and in this case I connected with Hillary right off and that affinity and connection held throughout the rest of the book.As mysteries go, I have to rate this one as slightly better than average. The book starts out with strong suspense and good pacing that continues up until Hillary arrives at her \\"destination.\\" From that point the story stalls slightly until the end, when Christie throws in twists and turns in rapid succession. The whole plot is far-fetched and not very realistic, but it is fun and entertaining and keeps you wondering what is going to happen.The narrator is so-so. She does well enough with most of the voices, although I didn't care for her hoarse, whispery rendition of a couple of the male characters. She didn't do all that well with the American voices, either, but then I have yet to hear a British narrator who can do an American accent well.All in all an entertaining story, with Christie's typical happy ending."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Not the usual Christie fare, this spy story keeps you in suspense from page 1. I thought it was well done, although the plot is highly improbable. Like most Christie's work, it focuses more on the psychological aspect than anything else. The writing is good. I could see several serious philosophical questions addressed, in a light style through the conversations and thoughts of the protagonists. Being a scientist myself, I truly appreciated this piece."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"I listened to this during a long drive from the Bay area to southern California and it certainly made the miles go faster (without my vehicle speed going over the legal limit).I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the character voices were excellently produced.I will certainly look for more titles from this producer."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Most of Agatha Christie's books deal with established characters, such as Poirot and Marple. But, there are a few that stand alone. Interestingly, most of them focus on powerful people who want to rule the world. Destination Unknown and They Came to Bagdad are two of the best known. Some of her works featuring the power-hungry also include an established character (The Rule of Four and Poirot).In Destination Unknown, written during the height of the Cold War, the reader could be lulled into thinking at the outset that it is a cold war novel between East and West. The reader will be fooled! It is instead a novel about scientists and others seeking a utopian world where they can work unfettered by governments. Eventually they discover the illusiveness of their searcb and become pawns in a \\"new society\\" created by a megalomanic.Christie mixes a touch of murder and international intrigue into this great read!"},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"It's nice to take a break from Poirot and Marple. Usually, when Christie gets away from her usual detectives, you get a story that has plenty of adventure and a much more interesting story. A harried detective sends a girl ready to commit suicide on on a hunt for some murderers...dressed up like a dead woman. Needless to say, your heart is racing thru-out the whole thing. Buy it, especially if you feel bored or rather depressed yourself!"},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"As usual, when Christie boots Poirot and Mrs. Marple, you're in for an adventurous and fun book. It all starts when a harried detective stops a girl from committing suicide and asks her to step in the place of a dead woman in order to solve a mystery. From then on you have mayhem, danger, and sweeping romance. Trust me, this is a great book--especially if you're a little bored and depressed yourself!!!"},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"For those who had enjoyed children adventure books like those written by Enid Blyton or Capt WE Johns, this book wouldhave fit right in.Unlike other novels by the writer, this book is not a mysterybook but an adventure book. There is no who-done-it, thoughthere are few clues left around, there is no crime actually defined.Scientists from the West have gone missing. When the wife of one such scientist went on a holiday, supposedly to recover from the trauma, British agents had her tailed, suspecting she could lead them to the whereabouts of the missing scientists. But when her plane crashed and she was seriously injured, the trail appeared to go cold. Enter Hilary Craven, a suicidal woman who bore a passing resemblance. Offered a more exciting way to die in an almost certainly fatal missiong, she eagerly took the chance.Not knowing what she could expect to find, the British agents could brief her little except to play-it-by-ear. As they hoped, she was accepted as the supposed wife, and led to be with her supposed husband. But as closely as the British agents trailed her, the adversary was a step ahead to outsmart the shadowers and Hilary found herself in an unexpected place, with even more unexpected encounters.Would she survive, or would she be exposed as an impostor? The strangely diverse people she had for travelling companions on her way to the lair of the enemy made her wonder if the whole business was what it really appeared to be.In Hilary, the writer had a perfect character for such a mission, a person who had no desire for self preservation, and could mold herself into another being who had a dual purpose in life, one as a impostor wife, another as an undercover agent.To paraphrase a line from a popular song, when she fooled the others, she fooled herself as well and through the ordeal, she actually became the force which pushed others to cling on to hope, and eventually, regaining her sense and purpose of existence.A highly enjoyable book, in the cast of adolescent adventure but written for adults."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"This 1955 novel is a departure from her more well known cosy series books. This one has none of her more familiar characters like Poirot or Marple, the setting is mostly the North African desert and centers on a James Bond type conspiracy complete with secret hideout and mysterious, fabulously wealthy mastermind.Hilary Craven has been defeated by life, her daughter has died, her husband has left her and she has nothing left to live for. She has decided to leave England and in an out-of-the-way spot in Morocco end it all. Circumstances intervene and instead of a quiet end in a lonely hotel room Hilary finds herself cast in the role of secret agent.This is a rather standard thriller type novel. Although a departure from Christie's usual fare there are still many of her more familiar motifs. The 'hero' is a single woman off on a adventure (like MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT), there is also a 'master criminal' (like the Tommy and Tuppence series or PASSENGER TO FRANKFURT) and much of the action takes place in an isolated, contained environment. As always in Christie's work the clues are all there for the reader to follow right up to the surprise ending."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"I read this book a number of years ago and am still fascinated by it. I think that this is one of Ms. Christie's best books."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Whenever Agatha Christie stepped away from her usual detectives Hercules Poirot and Miss Marple, the entire tone of her novels would often shift from mysteries (often called \\"cozies\\" on account of their English village settings) to espionage/conspiracy thrillers. This is especially true of \\"Destination Unknown\\" which spans several countries and a lengthy passage of time, with special agents, government officials and wealthy masterminds making up (most of) its cast.It deals with the scenario of several international scientists disappearing without a trace. International governments are getting concerned as to where they've all gone, and whether they're being kidnapped or going of their own volition. The most recent disappearance is that of Thomas Betterson, who leaves a potential lead in the form of his wife Olive. The officials in charge of the case are certain that she knows more than she's letting on, but are finding her a tough nut to crack...Hilary Craven has nothing to live for. After her daughter dies and her husband leaves her for another woman, she prepares to commit suicide. However, she is just about to overdose on sleeping pills when she hears a knock at her hotel door. It is a perfect stranger who saw her buying a large quantity of sleeping pills and who has a proposition for her. If she does in fact long for death, why not go out in a blaze of glory? British agents have been tailing Mrs Betterson to Morocco hoping that she would lead them to her husband, only for her to die in a plane crash. Since Hilary has a passing resemblance to the dead woman, would she be willing to take her place and hopefully discover what happened to the missing scientists?The set-up is ridiculously unlikely, and yet utterly compelling. Christie draws out the suspense of where Hilary is going and what she will find when she gets there to perfection, crafting a dream-like atmosphere that is nonetheless grounded in reality by the devastating planning of the secret organization that whisks Hilary and her fellow passengers into the unknown. It would be hugely remiss to discuss what it awaiting Hilary on her strange adventure, but I suppose it's fair to say that after such a magnificent setup, any revelation comes as something of a disappointment. Yet perhaps that's the point, as Christie once again draws upon her oft-used theme of the inherent small-mindedness of megalomania and the strength of those dismissed as ordinary.\\"Destination Unknown\\" is certainly not one of Christie's best books. Though most of her mysteries demand a re-read in order to pick up on the clues and red herrings strewn throughout the plot, the enjoyment of \\"Destination Unknown\\" hinges on the suspense of Hilary's journey. Once over, there's little reason to revisit it, despite the last-minute shoehorning in of a mystery that is only tangentially connected to the rest of the plot. There are a couple of loose ends and some characters that remain unaccounted for, but on the whole it makes for an intriguing but light read.Much like a cross between \\"They Came to Baghdad\\" and \\"Passenger to Frankfurt\\" (with a dash of \\"Toward Zero\\" thrown in, what with a wannabe-suicide finding a new purpose in life) Christie draws heavily on her own travelling experiences to map Hilary's journey and her own belief system to explore the nature of power, freedom, progress and knowledge - raising some weighty philosophical questions along the way."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"I know this book has an indifferent reputation and it is sometimes compared unfavorably to Christie's preceding thriller, THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD. But over the years I've come to prefer DU to BAGHDAD, maybe as I've grown older and more reflective. The insouciant and devil may care heroine of BAGHDAD, Victoria Jones, was once more appealing to me, and the social comedy of that book remains a delight. But now I am in a Hilary Craven state of mind. If you ask me, Hilary Craven is one of Christie's greatest accomplishments as a character, and her gradual transformation during the events of her \\"ritualized suicide\\" is so skillfully done it's hard to see how it could be improved.At first she is a frightened, despondent mess, as a result of catastrophes in her personal life, a broken marriage, and the death of her only child, a little girl. She keeps obsessing about Brenda, the dead girl, and visualizing the pathetic tiny mound of her grave. She decides to commit suicide and nothing is going to stop her. Christie takes you deep inside Hilary's mind, and her decision seems perfectly rational and even moral, and then fate knocks at her door. In a way we've heard Christie tell this story before, because a would-be suicide turns into the hero of TOWARDS ZERO, and we get some idea of her philosophy on the subject--don't kill yourself because of the butterfly effect, and you never know when you might save someone else's life if only you live. DESTINATION UNKNOWN shows signs of Christie's interest in French existentialism, and the questions it asks are pretty deep ones. What is the price of personal freedom? Is freedom an illusion? In paradise--real or imagined--is there any freedom of choice? If humans are infinitely adaptable and can get used to anything, where is the spark that separates us from the animals? Is identity itself a learned response?"},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Hilary Craven, the heroine of this story, wishes to commit suicide. The sleeping pills are on her bedside table and all is ready for self-imposed death when a knock on the door changes her plans. A young man tells her the story of a nuclear physicist who has disappeared. Hilary, intrigued by the drama, agrees to impersonate the scientist's wife and begins an improbable masquerade that leads her deep into Africa to an unknown destination.This is a book you will probably want to read in one sitting because of its breathless excitement which culminates in a surprising ending."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"As an unapologetic, die-hard Christie fan, I loved this book. However, it was one of her later ones and is not a murder mystery. Rather it is a sort of spy thriller. The story is that scientists have been disappearing from their posts all over the world, just after WWII. A wife of one of the disappeared men announced her intention to take a trip for her nerves. On the way she dies, and the police set up another red-haired woman who resembles her to take her place. This imposter is taken on a journey to an unknown destination in Africa to meet up with her husband. The trip was described so well that I fell into it and almost felt as if I were along for the ride. I think it had to be based on actual trips she took herself. Once she reaches her destination, she finds herself trapped with a man who is not her husband but who is willing to keep up the pretense for reasons of his own. How she is finally rescued and falls for one of her fellow captors concludes the story. The plot has the trademark Christie twist at the end, but it is admittedly not the mystery she is known for. The remarkable thing about this book is that Christie finally indulges her desire to express her philosphies of life, which she always wanted to do, but was restrained by her publishers. I marked the bits of philosophy which really didn't relate to the plot and found many of them. A lot of this book sounds autobiographical and may reveal more of Christie's true self that her official autobiography. Absolutely fascinating and irresistable to a Christie fan like me."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Another one of Christie's espionage potboilers contains one of her best female protagonists. Hillary Craven starts out a tragic figure and becomes by the end, a clever, determined and complex character. Slight comparisons to Passenger to Frankfurt, which expands on the disappearing scientist thread more chillingly. As usual, Agatha tops off the adventure with some nice final twists."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"A thriller type.

Though I have spent a great deal of time reading about Russia and the Soviet Union over the last couple years, I would still consider myself a novice. Thus, this review is obviously written from the perspective of someone relatively new to the field.Service's History of Modern Russia covers the entire 20th century, though it is relatively sparse post-1994. His handling of the material seems fair; he strives to cover material from a variety of viewpoints, showing both the positive and negative aspects of his subject matter. He covers Lenin, Stalin, WWII, and Khrushchev - along with all their policies, political maneuvers, and so on - in depth (at least as much as can be expected for 555 pages on 100 years!), and covers the Tsarist period, WWI, Brezhnev, and the early 1980s in the USSR in sufficient detail to easily follow the plot. The mild disparity in the treatment of various events and figures is not a flaw in his work; rather, his writing is directed to the more significant developments, of which there seem to be relatively few in the period of Brezhnev and the early 1980s (pre-Gorbachev); his ~40 pages on Brezhnev supply plenty of detail into the USSR from Khrushchev to the early \`80s. In fact, I have found it difficult in general to find material on Brezhnev. For example, there are many biographies of Lenin, Stalin, and Khrushchev, but Amazon.com does not appear to carry even one on Brezhnev!As a newcomer to the field of Russian history, culture, and language, I found Service's work to be readable, informative, and straightforward in its presentation, even when the narrative bogs down in groups of names doing this or that. His even treatment of the Soviet Union allowed me to see aspects of the USSR, Russia, and communism which I had not previously understood in a new light. I would have appreciated a short glossary for Soviet political positions and USSR governmental positions which simply defined the duties and responsibilities of various jobs (and perhaps their relative political or governmental clout, if such a thing were possible). It is not difficult to get bogged down in the myriad offices mentioned in the book.I highly recommend this book as an introduction to the Soviet Union's beginnings, rise to power, and eventual decline and implosion. It covers a wealth of material in a short, readable space and is easily navigable. References are extensive, so further study could easily be pursued with Service as an overview and handy starting point."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"Russia is the ultimate story, a story of grandeur of false hopes and shattered dreams. Churchill gave Russia that interesting title of the enigma inside the mystery inside the riddle. However this book does better by truly telling us the grand story of Russia, without the weakness of similar books on the subject. Many important subjects are covered, from the traditional tale of revolution, Stalin, stagnation, collapse.Here the reader is treated to nuanced stories, such as Krushchevs suppression of the church which left only 7500 Churches ion Russia, whereas 12000 Mosques were left standing. Also evident is the population upheavals of the 1920s and 1930s. Equally important is a very good rendition of the complications of the Civil war and the creation of War communism. All the characters are given a fair portrait from Derzinsky, to Sverlov, to the obvious, such as Zinoviev and Stalin.The successive chapters on the \`mystery years' of Brezhnev is enlightening, to view a nation in stagnation. Although not as insightful as Volkoganov's expose on soviet leadership this book brings to light many tales and is a fascinating, easy digestion, that brings the reader up to date, with Vladimir Putin.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"Overview of Russia during the 20th Century with stops at the Revolutions, Lenin, Stalin Gorbachev and Yeltsin. Provides a historical basis for event occurring today by allowing historians and political scientists to hypothesize about what is yet to come. Well written by one of the prominent Russian historians today."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"This is primarily a comprehensive history of the entire Soviet Union and 1900-1917 Russian Empire, lest the emphasis on \\"Russia\\" in the title fool you.As far as English-language works on Soviet history go (they're normally underinformed and lacking first-hand experience), this one is pretty good. On the political spectrum, Service is not a devout Anticommunist, although he does believe in the failure of Communism to efficiently allocate resources. He has a loose enthusiasm for the Russian people and nation, and this actually tints his vision towards being a little biased TOWARDS Russia, as unlikely as this might seem. Overall, what this means is that he's pretty objective, since his distaste for communism is balanced by his respect for the people, major and minor, behind it.There's a lot of detail, and the book is very comprehensive.However, if one has no knowledge of Russian history, it's better to sample the waters with Orlando Figes' \\"Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia\\" which covers a lot of ground in the history of Russia (largely pre-Soviet) in an original and exciting manner. That book is even more insightful into the reality of Russia's history than Service's book is. Furthermore, \\"Natasha's Dance\\" helps set the stage for a more detailed history of \\"Modern Russia,\\" so that one can witness the \\"continuity and change\\" present in history.With that said though, Service's history is the best English-language, 1-volume work on the history of the Soviet Union. It is also the best history of the past century of the Russian people and the Russian cultural entity."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"I purchased this book to \\"fill in the gaps\\" since my college survey course over 35 years ago! I wanted to \\"catch up\\" as I was on my way for a 10 day visit in the hinterlands of Russia and would be not in the \\"tourist\\" mode but observer mode. This book was easier to read than many history books but did provide insight and accurate historical data. It was especially useful in that while I was in Russia, Putin was very much in the news in the US and Russia, though from very different perspectives! Reading this book, helped me understand better the Russian view which was very different from the US view!I highly recommend this book for background information on Russia."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"This book is an excellent history book for the general reader. His prose is great and enjoyable. He manages to pack quite a bit of information in such a small space from such a long period. After reading this book you will have a very good understanding of what Russia and the former SSR's have been through and through this what may be in store for their future. This book deals almost exclusively with internal affairs in the USSR and then Russia and the break away republics. Worth a read for anyone interested in the subject or would like an insight into what makes the Russians of today 'tick.'"},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"If you are looking for a general introduction to the turbulent history of Russia in the past century, I highly recommend this book. I originally purchased this book to \\"fill in the gaps\\" of my knowledge, primarly 1945-1975 and 1991-modern day. Though I commend the author for cramming 100+ years of history into a very engaging 550-ish pages of material, my sole gripe is the lack of detail spent on the period between WWII and Gorbachev. But, like I said, it is an entire 100 years in a single book. All things considered, it is very well put-together and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"This is one of the easier reads on Russian history. I look forward to reading some of Service's other works."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"It's important to understand the context of this review. I'm not a history buff, and I have no training in history. I'm going on my first trip to Russia in a month and wanted to understand more about Russian history than the five pages of context in my Fodor's. This was quite a lot more than that, but it has served me well. It's an intellectual read, but very well written - as a non-academic I enjoyed it greatly. If you are a \\"casual\\" historian preparing for a trip, this will be a thorough overview for you. If you just want a medium-strength review of Russia (more than Fodors, but not 600 pages), it might be a little more than you need."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"A Good, Highly comprehensive History book of Modern Russia. I really liked it and highly recommend it to anybody taking a course on Russian History, or just curious about History."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"A splendid book on a remarkable country. What a history that country had in the twentieth century and what repercussions it had on the entire world! It is hard to think of another country - including the United States - that had more of an impact on world politics.Robert Service covers it all superbly. He points out that Lenin was no moralist or humanitarian. It was Lenin who coined the term \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" which meant NO to democracy, NO to elections; and as the term implies a dictatorship by an authoritarian state. The secret police was integral in Lenin's agenda.Mr. Service also points out that Russia (Soviet Union) was always a dual society. The top levels had only limited knowledge of what occurred away from the centre. At the bottom, reports and statistics were embellished to accord with the desires of the upper ruling stratas. This made corruption endemic at all layers of society - for the lower classes it would be the only way to survive.Khrushchev is portrayed as a partial reformer. It must be remembered that both Khrushchev and Brezhnev continued the repression in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev had the moral courage to stop this.The only drawback is that little is mentioned on the invasion of Afghanistan and the role it played in the demise and fracturing of the Soviet Union."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"A History of Modern Russia by Robert Service is a fascinating account of the events that begin with Nicholas II and lead all the way to Vladimir Putin.Sometimes a few sentences is worth the price of the book. The author contemplates the death of Stalin and describes the process of embalming and the funeral that took place. Service adds, \\"A silence was meant to descend over Moscow. But such was the crowd in the nearby streets that a commotion broke out. The pressure of bodies led to dozens of fatalities. From under the glass the chemically-treated corpse could still terminate innocent lives.\\"A few lessons stand out:1. Unchecked power corrupts people and nations2. The power of an ideology or worldview does not terminate with the death of a given leader3. Never underestimate the power of an atheistic worldview4. Never take freedom for grantedA History of Modern Russia is a terrific overview. It honestly assesses the strengths and weaknesses of this fascinating country."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"I did not like it at all. It was extraordinarily long, and there was way too much detail on many uninteresting facts. He used many peculiar, elaborate words that I think he made up, and I couldn't find in the dictionary. The editing was dreadful--some incomplete sentences and some very poor punctuation. I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!"},{"Title":"A History of Modern Russia: From Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin, Revised Edition","review":"To write of Russia, one must understand her history and her culture. And to understand these important elements, one must know something of Orthodoxy. And they must have some level of respect for truth. Unfortunately, Mr. Service is quite obviously and painfully ignorant of Russian history and culture. And he comprehends nothing of the Orthodox spirit of Holy Russia. Therefore, his attempt to write of Russia meets with dismal failure.This book is nothing but a pack of lies. It is complete and utter nonsense. A person so prejudiced against the truth, as Mr. Service obviously is, should not be allowed on the University campus, much less allowed to become a published author.For those truly interested in the magnificent history of Russia, we recommend Matthew Raphael Johnson's \\"The Third Rome: Holy Russia, Tsarism, and Orthodoxy\\". No serious student of history should bother himself or herself with this pack of lies cobbled together by Mr. Service. For those, like me, already misled to purchase this silly book, we offer one small consolation: though useless in terms of intellectual content, the book is large enough to be employed as an effective paper weight."},{"Title":"Tip and Mitten","review":"This was my very first school textbook, in grade number 1 of a long public school and college trek. It featured Tip (a dog), Mitten (a cat), and children Jack, Janet and Penny. It opens with an unseen narrator calling, \\"Tip!\\" Page two reads, \\"Tip! Tip!\\" I don't specifically recall the plot after that, but I do remember thinking at the time that all of the characters seemed to limit themselves to extremely rudimentary verbal expressions that were easily spelled and pronounced. It's highly likely you won't have any desire to read this book more than once, but it's good for getting you started as a reader."},{"Title":"The Washington Nationals 1859 to Today: The Story of Baseball in the Nations Capital","review":"Baseball in DC is a sorry topic indeed, with as much success coming via fictitious, supernaturally affected means (\\"Damn Yankees\\") than actually on the field. This book chronicles that mostly sorry history with grace, humor, and tenderness that only a seasoned baseball writer can achieve. The chapter on how the Sens won the World Series in 1924 actually brought tears to my eyes. This is the best history of Washington baseball I have ever read. Go Nats!"},{"Title":"The Washington Nationals 1859 to Today: The Story of Baseball in the Nations Capital","review":"Remember in the movie \\"Jerry Maguire\\" when Renee Zellweger says, \\"You had me at hello!\\"? Well, in his book about The Washington Nationals, Fred Frommer had me with the opening sentence to his preface where he laments that on moving to Washington from New York, the two missing items here were a baseball team and a place to get a good slice of pizza. Much like Fred, I am a transplanted New Yorker (and a lifelong Yankee fan who has adopted the Nats as well), and for my first 31 years here I had to do without a major league team (although the Orioles are within driving distance, they were not and never will be a Washington team). And, Fred's right, the pizza (and bagels) here are definitely not New York.Fred's book is neatly compartmentalized into ten chapters. The first chapter chronicles the earliest baseball in Washington, actually going back to the era of Abe Lincoln! The second chapter of the book is incredibly upbeat as it deals with Washington's only World Championship in 1924. Frommer does a splendid job of taking you through the season. You can feel the excitement being generated here in D.C. by the Senators' unexpected success. The next chapter, called \\"Glory Years,\\" deals with the best years of the Senators in the 1920's and 1930's, when they often contended and even won the pennant in 1933, only to have the Giants exact revenge in the World Series. Fred's following chapter, perhaps the best in the book, focuses on the Negro Leagues and Washington's entry therein, the Homestead Grays. There is plenty of excellent history and a great look at sociological views of the era. There are wonderful anecdotes about Buck Leonard, the amazing Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige, among others.For members of Red Sox Nation, there is a chapter devoted solely to Ted Williams' stint as manager of Senators II. Another chapter is devoted exclusively to interviews with old-time fans who reminisce about attending games at Griffith and DC/RFK Stadiums. These phenomenal fans have wonderful stories to relate and Frommer does a great job of eliciting them. The final chapter is dedicated to the magical 2005 season of the Nationals.My hats (both a Yankee cap and a Nationals cap) are off to Fred Frommer for coming up with a highly entertaining, educational book about baseball in Washington, DC."},{"Title":"The Washington Nationals 1859 to Today: The Story of Baseball in the Nations Capital","review":"This book it the best little compilation of Washington D.C. baseball history around. It is packed full of interesting facts and vignettes about Washington Baseball. It also has great illustrations and photos. A must have for every Washington Nationals baseball fan."},{"Title":"The Washington Nationals 1859 to Today: The Story of Baseball in the Nations Capital","review":"This book gave me a great education on the real story of the Washington Nationals/Senators and the Expansion Senators. Before reading this, I always thought baseball in DC failed because of poor teams. That is still true, but it also had a lot to do with Clark Griffith's selling off of star players; that he missed out on the chance to be the first to integrate the game (he was against integration, but mainly because he depended on the gate receipts of the Negro League teams at Griffith Stadium); and of unstable ownership in the 1960s, that apparently operated without long-term goals.One story in this book really shocked me: Sometime in the 1920s, an elderly black man who had been a lifelong fan of the Nationals/Senators attended an Opening Day parade was spit in the face by one of the players who apparently could not tolerate this black man cheering on the players and calling them by name. The old man was so hurt, he never went to another baseball game again. Of course, he would not encourage any other blacks to go to games either. With all the talk today about the decline of African-American interest in baseball, I can't help but wonder if this incident was another seed sowed in the situation we have today."},{"Title":"The Washington Nationals 1859 to Today: The Story of Baseball in the Nations Capital","review":"Growing up in the District, hearing stories of the Senator's rich past from my 80 year old next door neighbor had to fill in for not having a team in my city. When other kids talked about how the Orioles were \\"our team\\", I'd be the lunatic ranting that the Orioles weren't DC's team, that our city had a long and storied baseball history; DC was once a baseball city.Mr. Frommer's well written book is an easy read that truly imparts the excitement and depth of DC's baseball history, able to bring that history to life for the District's generations that grew up unknowing after the nation's capital was robbed of the nation's sport. A must for all DC baseball fans.

Neither of us is a big Nationals fan, but no matter -- this is an entertaining tale of baseball history and Washington history.

I am aware of so many top-notch writers due to this compilation. Modern short stories have become a let-down to me after reading this book. You have to go backwards to find solid reading material. There is really no need to get into specifics because the proof is on the pages - many of these stories have left me amazed, and if you do not already possess the stories in this anthology, I strongly recommend this book. It is the main source of my awareness of the classic horror short story genre. I read this book and tried to find more like it, and many anthologies do not live up to this selection as far my tastes are concerned. I only wish that Herbert Wise would edit more anthologies. I love short stories, and though I am not a die-hard short story fanatic, I believe that these writers are so superior that anybody would become an instant fan reading them."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"Nearly fifty years ago, in the mid-sized Midwestern town where I spent many of my formative years, with some windfall paper route money, I purchased the Modern Library edition of \\"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural\\" (published by Random House, edited by Herbert A Wise and Phyllis Fraser). That particular edition was eventually worn out from extensive reading and re-reading and had long since disappeared from my possession; but several months ago, at a Montgomery County Public Library sale in Troy, North Carolina, thanks the alertness of my sharp-eyed wife, I purchased, for a mere pittance, the *original* edition of this book, published in 1944; it was like encountering a long-lost friend! The dedication page consists of an Old Scotch Invocation: \\"FROM GHOULIES AND GHOSTIES AND LONG-LEGGED BEASTIES AND THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT, GOOD LORD DELIVER US!\\". Of interest also is that on the publication page the following appears: \\"THIS IS A WARTIME BOOK - The Text is complete and unabridged, but every effort has been made to comply with the Government's request to conserve essential materials.\\" It was in my Modern Library edition that, as a teen-ager, I first read classic supernatural stories by Algernon Blackwood (the well-known \\"Ancient Sorceries\\" and the lesser-known \\"Confession\\" [but not \\"The Willows\\" or \\"The Wendigo\\"]), F(rancis) Marion Crawford (\\"The Screaming Skull\\" [but not \\"The Upper Berth\\"]), M(ontague) R(hodes) James (\\"Casting the Runes\\" [my favorite of all of his 30 stories] and \\"Oh Whistle and I'll Come to You My Lad\\"; both stories, incidentally, illustrate James's adroit and effective handling of understatement), H(oward) P(hilips) Lovecraft (\\"The Rats in the Walls\\" and \\"The Dunwich Horror\\"), Arthur Machen (\\"The Great God Pan\\" [but not \\"The Inmost Light\\"]), Oliver Onions (\\"The Beckoning Fair One\\"), Edgar Allan Poe (the well-known story \\"The Black Cat\\" and the lesser-known but even more disturbing \\"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\\"), and Edgar Lukas White (the eerie \\"Lunkundoo\\"). Also among the 52 stories in this collection are some powerfully-effective adventure stories: Richard Connell's \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\", Geoffrey Household's \\"Taboo\\", Carl Stephenson's \\"Leiningen versus the Ants\\", and H.G. Wells's \\"Pollock and the Porroh Man\\". (Undoubtedly because of the publication date, there is nothing here by Robert Aickman [e.g., \\"The Inner Room\\"], Clive Barker [e.g., \\"In the Hills, The Cities\\"], Stephen King [e.g., \\"Dolan's Cadillac\\" {terror} or \\"The Mist\\" {supernatural/preternatural], or Joyce Carol Oates [e.g., \\"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\\"]). The editors provide an Introduction, an Introduction to the Notes, and interesting and comprehensive biographical sketches of each of the authors. Over the past few months, I have enjoyed becoming re-acquainted with these stories. Although there now exist more modern collections of these types of stories (e.g. David Hartwell's \\"The Dark Descent\\", \\"The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories\\", and \\"Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories\\"), this out-of-print book is well worth acquiring, if you should be fortunate enough to happen upon it in an estate collection auction, at a library sale, in a thrift store, or at a used-book seller's."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"If I would have to choose five books to take with me to Mars, this would be one."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"This book is a compilation of some wonderful classic horror tales.

Dead men do write good tales."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"There's little to add to what earlier commenters have written. But I do want to note that not only are the stories themselves awesome, but the collection as a whole serves as a broad and useful introduction to spooky stories. Many representative authors of the 'old school' are included, like Sheridan Le Fanu, M.R. James, Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, Benson, and the much neglected Oliver Onions. Lovecraft is, of course, there, too. The editor couldn't have chosen better examples to inspire readers to seek out more of the represented authors' works."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"I have been a devotee of supernatural and horror stories since I first began to read. This was the very first one I ever read, and it's still -- after too many to count -- the best. The editors made the best possible selections from such masters as H.P. Lovecraft, M.R. James, E.F. Benson and numerous others. The biographical introductions to the stories are excellent. The editors even give the sound advice to not read too many of the stories at one sitting, so as not to lose the wonderful creepy effect and impact of one or two at the most. A bargain at twice the price."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"Despite the best-seller list popularity of horror novels, the horror genre is often best served by brevity. Remember all the ghost stories told around campfires -- the swift build from unease to terror, the surprise ending whispered or shouted in the dark. The short story format may be the ideal medium for serving up such visceral pleasures. Think of this massive anthology as a box of poisoned chocolates -- taken one at a time, the stories are most effective, delightful and only a little unsettling.This book is almost a necessity for serious students of the horror genre, for anyone who wants to know where writers like King and Koontz got their inspiration . . . or for anyone who just likes a good scare. Wise and company's anthology is a classic for many reasons: its historic scope, its inclusion of various types of horror (from &quot;The Monkey's Paw,&quot; a brutal little cautionary tale that would be right at home by a campfire to the subtler depiction of obsession and madness in the little-known &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot;). There is something for every taste here, from old-fashioned ghost stories to more cerebral suspense. The anthology seems designed to show the range and richness of horror fiction. Of course, concentrating on mass and variety has its drawbacks -- if you are interested in tracing how different strains of the genre developed, you're on your own, because the editors offer no guidance. And despite its size (this is a hefty book; you wouldn't want to carry this with you in your briefcase or backpack) &quot;Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural&quot; is not a comprehensive overview. Types of horror fiction with which modern audiences are more familiar are under-represented. There is little violence, despite the presence of so much death; the collection may even seem a bit genteel. Also, women writers are given short shrift although many women worked the fields of the supernatural from the eighteenth century on. Still, the editors have worked hard to distill the brightest and best (or should that be the darkest and best?) of this surprisingly venerable genre. Buy it. You'll want to read and reread these stories -- maybe even beside a convenient campfire."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"I literally have dozens of horror anthologies, however, this is one, if not the best collection of classic horror/terror stories I have ever read.It does contain many stories which have been included in other books of its kind, yet there are also quite a few which are rarely to be found in the more typical collection.This book is a definite MUST for the library of every fan of the classic \\"scary\\" short story."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"I can't really say with any of the other stories, since I'm not as familiar with them. Maybe they've been abridged, too. Maybe not. But \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" has been drastically cut. And it suffers for it. Nearly all of General Zaroff's exposition and back-story have been removed. This omission takes one of literature's most memorable villains, and turns him into a two dimensional stock character. Worse yet, the dinner scene no longer plays like a verbal sparring match, with Zaroff gradually revealing his plans. There's no suspense in it anymore. Now, it plays more like \\"Please pass the roasted potatoes, Mr. Rainsford. By the way, I hunt people.\\"The three star rating reflects my disappointment at the editing of this particular story. \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" is one of my favorite stories of all time. I'm deducting two stars for getting a gutted version of it."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"as others here have elaborated on, and detailed some of the mastery compiled within this amazing collection, i'll be brief with my comments...if you're seriously looking for \\"the perfect horror anthology...\\" put simply: you've found it. this deliciously thick volume has been one of the cornerstones of my macabre short story collection for quite some time.... and, honestly... i'm quite certain it always will be. it has earned it's place amongst the very best within my bookshelves.for any / all fans of horror this tome is simply a must-have.

This collection features some of the best that the genre has to offer."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"This book is, quite simply, the best collection of 19th and early-20th century short fiction of the dark variety in existence. First published in the 1940s, this single (albeit fat) volume is a goldmine of the roots of modern horror, a great way to see where today's horror heavyweights got their inspiration and influence.Some authors whose stories appear within: Bierce, Blackwood, Dickens, Faulkner, Hawthorne, Hemingway, James (both Henry & M.R.), Kipling, Lovecraft, Machen, Poe, Wells, and many more, a good mixture of horror genre regulars and more conventional or 'literary' authors to whom dark fiction was a departure from the norm. If many of those above names are unfamiliar to you and you consider yourself a fan of dark fiction, you owe it to yourself to read this book.[Sidenote: The book also contains two of my all-time favorite short stories from two slightly lesser-known authors: Richard Connell's \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" and W.W. Jacob's \\"The Monkey's Paw.\\" As far as I know, this is the only single volume that includes both. The latter story is, in my humble opinion, THE most perfect scary story of all time.]Once again: Wagner & Wise's collection is the best thing of its kind."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"Review: Murderous spouses, ancient curses, talking corpses, seductive ghosts--over a thousand pages long, presenting 52 stories from 33 authors, this collection is massive and dated, halfway a historical fragment and halfway a resource, fascinating but deep enough to drown in. It's so vast that it's almost impossible to review: no single opinion can reflect so many stories. There are a few classics here, just as many minor offerings from famous authors, and plenty of forgettable selections. Half the joy is simply seeing what's included, because not all of these authors or stories would be considered genre now--and as such, this collection is a fascinating snapshot of the creation of canon and genre. The exclusions are also telling: there's only one vampire story because \\"these stories all tend to be very much alike\\" (760), and only three female authors (which seems to be a fault of the general climate more than the book's enthusiastic editors).As pleasure reading is concerned, the introduction recommends slow going and I concur. Volumes like this are longterm bedside companions; try to hurry through them, and the stories become so many bricks in a wall. Classic horror has a different pace from modern horror, often finding an uneasy balance between atmospheric subtlety and heavy-handed themes such that it both bores and batters. But then along will come a story like Hawthorne's \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\" with its haunting, insidious beauty, or Lovecraft's superbly crafted imaginings of the unknown, or even Blackwood's tales, deeply flawed but rewarding patience with fantastic atmosphere. There are also authors and stories which helped create the genre but are now forgotten, and pleasant surprises such as Benson's skin-crawling \\"Caterpillars.\\" There's more emphasis on action than modern readers may expect, and a sprinkling of gallows humor. There are too many duds to recommend it to a casual reader, and the selections are too arbitrary to make it the only classic horror anthology you own, but Great Tales is often fascinating and occasionally great fun. It's an enjoyable, if random, overview for fans of the genre, and I loved it. To my surprise, the anthology is still in print--so if you stumble upon it, I well recommend you pick it up and read a few tales."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"I read this (more than once) as a teenager in the 60s. It introduced me to some of the really classic horror and suspense story writers, like M.R. James, Le Fanu, Machen, Lovecraft, etc. Most of these are quite effective in creating terrifying moods. The Bulwer-Lytton story, in particular, scared the crap out of me, and still does. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"Well, this great book is full of 52 fine otherworldly tales -- that are well written and never too long. So, it amounts to a huge hoard of phantasimal prose Blood Gold -- at very modest cost. The classical hardbacked sewn binding, quality pagination and good standard font allow for easy reading of this sturdy tome. The 52 tales are well-picked to represent the best of elder eldritch authors. In particular, as the editors remark in the Introduction -- these tales have been picked especially with concern for internal coherence -- allowing for easier following by the reader and a crucial suspension of disbelief for full impact. This reader most especially treasures the amazingly fluid, clear and sharp Introduction -- with great balanced metaphysical overview of the background and foreground of phantasimal worlds +++"},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"This is yet another one of the books that was required for my Arts & Humanities class \\"The Horror Story\\"...I must say that I'm quite glad that I was introduced to this novel.This book houses some of the greatest horror stories since the genre came into existence. I have a new appreciation for Edgar Allen Poe. Algernon Blackwood is an AMAZING writer, quite possibly my new favorite. There is even a story written by O. Henry!This book could easily be considered a bible among those who are horror-genre fans. I can't say much else about this book other than IN MY OPINION it is worth the money you will spend on it and the time you will spend reading it."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"The book was in perfect condition. Arrived in a timely fashion. A great collection of spine-tingling tales from some of the best authors."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"With this compelation you get 52 short stories with 20 of them in the section of terror and 32 in the supernatural section and they are in chronilogial order of the authors births whith many of them being from the 19th century and a few from the 19th and 20th centuries.I enjoyed most of the stories in the terror section with most of them being good, a few okay ones and a bad 1 or 2 otherwise the stories in the terror section were very well picked. Too bad I can't say the same for the supernatural section because I thought that most of them weren't that good. A few of them are very good and left me with a sense of awe like \\"The Great God Pan\\", \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" or \\"Confession\\". A few of the stories were okay and quite a few I thought were bad like \\"Ancient Sorceries\\" or \\"Out of the Deep\\" to name a few and the reasons why I didn't like some of the stories is because some of them were boring and some I thought had bad endings while the story leading up to the end would be good it would just let me down in the end like in \\"Ancient Sorceries\\".If you like 18th century type ghost stories or writings or you think that you might be interested in them then I would recommend this book because there are some very good stories many good and a few bad but overall this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"They quickly notified me when they were shipping it and it showed up fast. The book arrived in excellent shape. I am very pleased with the level of service provided."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"I've read all the stories in this book at least 3 times. Most of the times I skip around, but twice I've read straight through -- the stories are so consistently good, and, though wide ranging, complement each other so well. These are NOT horror stories. Horror (to me, at least) implies not only more explicit violence, but also an attitude that reality is, at core, physically and morally chaotic. &quot;Dark Descent&quot; is a horror anthology -- &quot;Great Tales&quot; is for the most part (although &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; and H.P. Lovecraft's 2 stories provide some exception) more old-fashioned &quot;ghost stories,&quot; and what mystery genre critics would categorize as &quot;English cozy&quot;: pleasant characters, warm surroundings introduced all the better to scare you with later on. The evil is seen through a hole in the curtain, so to speak, and never engulfs. The first group of stories (&quot;Tale of Terror&quot;) are not exactly supernatural, but extremely suspenseful, with wonderful denouements. Poe's &quot;The Facts in the Strange Case of M. Valdemar&quot; is wonderfully horrible - a dying man is hypnotised to keep him alive (it turns out to be a mistake, of course). &quot;Suspicion&quot; by Dorothy Sayers is NOT a murder mystery, but a perfectly built-up tale of suspense. I've read it a dozen times and the pace of the story still catches me. &quot;Home for Christmas,&quot; in which a nice doctor kills his bossy wife before leaving on vacation, would make a great Hitchcock movie. &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; is the short but shocking story of a man who stays overnight at a friend's house and awakens to an unpleasant visitor (not a ghost, but worse). Despite the emphasis on surprise endings, all of these stories have such great style and atmosphere that they are often, if anything, better the 2nd or 3rd time around. The second group, &quot;Tales of the Supernatural,&quot; have all the qualities mentioned above but are more wide ranging in terms of imaginativeness. My Man M.R. James fits right in here, of course, and 2 of his best tales - &quot;Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad&quot; and &quot;Casting the Runes&quot; - are featured. Also Guy de Maupassant (&quot;Was It a Dream?&quot;, in which a young lover spends the night mourning the death of his mistress in a cemetery, is fabulous). Also Rudyard Kipling; E.F. Benson; Algernon Blackwood (&quot;Ancient Sorceries&quot; features a mild-mannered Englishman oddly drawn to a small French village with a history of witchcraft); and such great titles as &quot;The Screaming Skull&quot; and &quot;The Haunters and the Haunted or The House and the Brain&quot; which, despite the campy names, will leave you far from laughing. There are stories in this section, also, that would better be categorized as fantasy (&quot;The Celestial Omnibus&quot; and &quot;Adam and Eve and Pinch-me&quot;). I liked them a lot even though I don't usually read fantasy. The majority are SCARY, though, and all are well-written by any standard (Henry James gives us &quot;Sir Edmund Orme&quot; and Ernest Hemingway tells of &quot;The Killers&quot;). If you like a more modern style, more explicit sex and violence, less atmosphere and more cut-to-the-chase, this book probably isn't for you. But if you like good, old-fashioned, solid, subtle, clever writing, with lots of atmosphere as well as great plotting (and you like to be scared), then this is a must-have."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"I am now on my second copy of of the Wise and Fraser anthology. I read my first copy (purchased in the late 1950's)to death. Over many years this book has remained one of the greatest anthologies of scary stories ever put toghter. As the title implies it is broken into two parts; stories that have terrifying situations and supernatural stories. It was first published in 1944 so do not look for stories by Stephen King or Cliver Barker. What you will find are wonderful stories that either already were or have become classics.The terror stories include some adventures such as Connell's, \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" and Collins' \\"Terribly Strange Bed.\\" The Supernatural stories include greats such as M. R. James', \\"Casting the Runes\\" and Edward White's, \\"Lukundoo.\\" (If \\"Lukundoo\\" does not make your skin crawl I suggest that you have your skin on too tight) There is also E.F. Benson's, \\"Mrs. Amworth\\" which I believe to be the best short vampire story ever written.Here are 52 stories packed into an anthology tht belongs on the shelf of anyone who likes scary stories and is a basic staple on the shelf of a collector."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"Over a year ago I had been overcome with the urge for horror fiction, but all the modern writers left me a bit cold. Even Stephen King, though he crafted many great tales, still writes in that modern way that will cheat, and throw in sex and violence when the ability to create atmosphere falters.If you are looking for pure mood, and want to read writers that had complete respect for the language, then buy this book. Even one not normally inclined to horror fiction will find this endlessly entertaining. You will turn back to this book for years. It's sad, but there are few who write like this anymore. In my mind, it's understatement that provokes the sense of dread that many of these tales convey."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"Now this is what I call an anthology. I have a special affection for this one because it's where, as a child, I first encountered three stories which have remained important to me ever since - Saki's &quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot;, in which a sickly boy makes a god of a ferret and is well rewarded; Guy de Maupassant's &quot;Was it a Dream?&quot;, in which a bereaved lover has a vision of corpses rising from the grave to inscribe the truth about their lives in place of the pious lies upon their gravestones; and what was probably my first Poe story, the out-and-out nightmare &quot;The Black Cat&quot;. Other gems among the fifty-odd here include Robert Hichens' &quot;How Love Came to Professor Guildea&quot;, one of the most disturbing ghost stories ever written; Conrad Aitken's &quot;Silent Snow, Secret Snow&quot;, a haunting study of childhood madness; and Richard Connell's &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; - a breathlessly paced tale of sadistic sportsmanship which was turned, by the makers of King Kong (and on the same sets) into a far superior piece to the more famous, but idiotic, film. Wagner and Wise have managed to include virtually every famous name in the field (at least up to 1944), and they've almost unfailingly chosen from the authors' best stories. Besides the comparatively clumsy &quot;Dunwich Horror&quot;, Lovecraft is also represented with &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot;, one of his first masterpieces; LeFanu is represented with &quot;Green Tea&quot;; Oliver Onions with &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot;; Arthur Machen with &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; and M R James with &quot;Oh Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad&quot;, one of the handful of truly great tales by this largely overrated (if academically acceptable) writer. Other contributors include Dorothy L Sayers, H G Wells, E F Benson, Algernon Blackwood, Richard Middleton (the comic &quot;The Ghost Ship&quot;), Charles Dickens, Edith Wharton, Edward Lucas White (the downright horrible &quot;Lukundoo&quot;), Isak Dinesen and Rudyard Kipling. If you know your tales of horror and the supernatural, you'll probably know some of the stories already; but the sheer size and scope of this collection make it a safe bet that you'll find some previously undiscovered treasure here as well. If you're tired of inept Stephen King imitations, this book came out two years before the prototype was born (the oldest author featured is Balzac, born in 1799). And if you don't know the field and don't know where to start, I can't imagine a better place. This hardcover edition is also extremely well made, with Fuseli's &quot;The Nightmare&quot; as wholly appropriate jacket illustration."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"This book was published in 1944. It contained 52 short stories by 42 writers. There were 22 from Great Britain, 15 from the United States, 2 each from Ireland and France, and 1 from Denmark. Three of the authors were women: Sayers, Wharton, Dinesen.The collection was divided into tales of terror, which took place completely in the material world, and tales of the supernatural. The pieces ranged from the 1840s (Balzac, Hawthorne, Poe) to 1942 (Dinesen), covering virtually each decade. Two-thirds of the stories were from the 20th century.From the early or mid-19th century, there were Bulwer-Lytton, Wilkie Collins, France's Balzac, Ireland's O'Brien and LeFanu, and Hawthorne and Poe from the U.S. From the late 19th century, Hardy, Kipling, Machen and Wells, France's Maupassant, and from the U.S., Bierce and Henry James.Those from the 20th century included Hichens, Jacobs, M. R. James, Blackwood, Saki, Onions, Forster, Benson, Coppard, De La Mare, and Collier. And from the U.S., O. Henry, Crawford, Wharton, Lovecraft, Connell, Hemingway, Faulkner, Woollcott and Aiken.The book collected a number of classic horror stories: \\"The Black Cat,\\" \\"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,\\" \\"The Haunters and the Haunted,\\" \\"Green Tea,\\" \\"The Boarded Window,\\" \\"The Horla,\\" \\"The Monkey's Paw,\\" \\"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad,\\" \\"The Beckoning Fair One,\\" \\"Sredni Vashtar\\" and \\"The Rats in the Walls.\\"Some of the others were interesting especially for an atmosphere of menace (Blackwood's \\"Confession\\"), description of madness (Aiken's \\"Silent Snow, Secret Snow\\") or struggles against man and nature (Connell's \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" Carl Stephenson's \\"Leiningen Versus the Ants\\"), their irony (Saki's \\"The Open Window,\\" Collier's \\"Back for Christmas\\"), cynicism (Maupassant's \\"Was It a Dream?\\") or as a particularly good example of an author's concerns (Lovecraft's \\"The Dunwich Horror\\"). Stories by Wells, Benson and Household included a tribal curse, a modern vampire and what could've been a werewolf.The tale by Bulwer-Lytton, from the 1850s, has been called the first modern story about a haunted house; it contained a powerful description of a haunting and, as if that weren't enough, threw in mesmerism, a near-immortal, and an astonishing shift in time. One by Blackwood involved the revival of a man's memories of earlier existence. One by Machen dealt with a spirit called from another world by an overconfident surgeon, and contained a seductress who wrecked men's lives. It was interesting for the way conventions of the time forced it to hint at sexual matters, and for calling up a spirt by means of a surgical operation on a patient's nerve, so different from the way an author like Lovecraft would've done it.The anthology contained great examples of horror focused on the mind (\\"The Black Cat,\\" \\"Pollock and the Porrah Man,\\" \\"The Haunters and the Haunted,\\" \\"Green Tea,\\" \\"The Horla,\\" \\"The Beckoning Fair One,\\" \\"Silent Snow, Secret Snow\\"). For this reader, the collection would've been even more enjoyable if more of the pieces hadn't just described a supernatural or other event but also probed more deeply things psychological.Some of the other tales -- Hawthorne, Charles Collins, Henry James -- were among the more ponderous ones. And stories by Wilkie Collins, Hardy, O. Henry, Sayers, Hemingway, Coppard, Forster, Middleton and Dinesen contained little that seemed frightening; a number of these came from authors who usually wrote outside the categories of terror or the supernatural. Relevant writers who might've added something to the collection: Irving, Twain, R. L. Stevenson, Stoker, Lord Dunsany and Elizabeth Bowen.Other large anthologies of horror fiction include The Supernatural Omnibus (1931), A Century of Creepy Stories (1934), A Second Century of Creepy Stories (1937), Dark Forces (1980), The Arbor House Treasury of Horror and the Supernatural (1981), The Penguin Book of Ghost Stories (1984), The Penguin Book of Horror Stories (1984), Masterpieces of Terror and the Supernatural (1985), The Dark Descent (1987), The Penguin Book of Vampire Stories (1989), The Mammoth Book of Terror (1991), The Omnibus of 20th Century Ghost Stories (1991), Final Shadows (1991), Masterpieces of Terror and the Unknown (1993), The Oxford Book of 20th Century Ghost Stories (1996), The Oxford Book of Victorian Ghost Stories (2003), The Mammoth Book of Haunted House Stories (2005), The Mammoth Book of Modern Ghost Stories (2007), American Supernatural Tales (2007) and The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories (2008).Smaller volumes -- below 300 pages or so -- include The Ghost Book (1926), Great Ghost Stories (1930), Great Tales of Horror (1933), Best Ghost Stories (1945), The Second Ghost Book (1952), The Third Ghost Book (1955), The Supernatural in the English Short Story (1959), The Pan Book of Horror Stories, Vols. 1-30 (1959-88), The Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories, Vols. 1-20 (1964-84), The Fontana Book of Great Horror Stories, Vols. 1-17 (1966-84), The Thrill of Horror: 22 Terrifying Tales (1975), Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories (1984), Weird Tales: Seven Decades of Terror (1997) and Haunted Houses: The Greatest Stories (1997)."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"I first discovered this thrilling, enthralling, hypnotic collection of gems back in the early 50s, during a wintry night with freezing rain. Needless to say, this was a great combination to burn this collection into my memory and I've already gone through six copies. My favorites are &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; and &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, with &quot;Sir Edward Orme&quot; and &quot;Afterward&quot; coming in close. These tales inspired me to write my own collection of weird stories, &quot;The Secret of Jimmy X and Other Stories of the Macabre&quot; that came out in early 2001. &quot;Great Tales&quot; introduced me to Lovecraft, Wharton, Machen and no matter how many times I pick up this thrilling anthology, I'm always instantly hooked.

This anthology spans the time period from roughly 1800 to the 1930s--from Poe to Lovecraft, in other words. The chills in these tales tend more toward the atmospheric than toward the gross-out, but chills they are nonetheless. There is not a bad story in the collection, and it provides a fascinating sample of the breadth and diversity of the horror genre. Also, for readers wondering how these stories have aged, I teach several stories from this anthology in a course on horror literature, and I can tell you that they clearly retain their power and effectiveness with an 18-year-old audience. Even better, these stories force them to reconsider modern horror and evaluate authors such as Stephen King within a much deeper tradition."},{"Title":"Great tales of terror and the supernatural","review":"I first bought this book when it was sold for $3.95.

All of the tales were well worth reading, including the Bulwer-Lytton, but some of them were incredible. If you love good horror and terror, minus the supurflous sex and gore of modern horror, buy this book.

What results is a complete and readable synthesis of the main currents in Latin politics, economy, society and literature.Mr. Williamson's underlying thesis is that of the search of Latin American societies for Modernity defined as a democratic, liberal and self-conscious state of affairs.

Slightly disturbing is the absence of at least a pen sketch history of the less important countries, rather than subordinating these countries to adjunctive roles vis-a-vis the big ones. Highly refreshing is Williamson's non-use of tired exploitation and dependency theories, victimization rants, and villainization of \\"the military\\" in vaguely stated polemics. This is sophisticated history. It needs a few simple maps ao that it can be used as the introductory text for the \\"history of Latin America\\" courses.

He gave outstanding coverage to the clash of civilizations between European explorers (and exploiters) and the indiginous peoples of the region. The author gives good detailed analysis of the unique and diverse cultures that have formed as a result of the unique geographical and demographic forces prevalent in each nation.Williamson adds some interesting notes with a lengthy section on Latin American literature and intelligentsia. He covers major literary works from authors like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabelle Allende. Some reviewers have criticized Williamson for not going further and including more excerpts from the authors. I think this criticism is unwarranted as the author reveals which writers are most worthy of attention. If a person wishes, he or she has a list of meaningful literary classics to explore. This is perfect for the scope of this book, which is meant to be an introductory primer.Williamson handles his topic with passion. The writing is interesting and provocative. There is a slight left-wing bias in his work. However, it does not detract from the central purpose of the book. The history relays important military, political, and economic facts to the reader.

This is not a book about proof-texts but about looking at the wisdom of Jesus TODAY through the mind of a psychologist practicing TODAY. The people are real, the quality of life issues are real, but the wisdom is from the mouth of one who lived thousands of years ago -- corroborated by current psychological theory.The effort is not (in my reading) to somehow characterize Jesus as a touchy-feely person, but to reveal the value of what He said to the world in which we live.The book takes-to-task some traditional Christian thinking (e.g. what about original sin? people are good, people are bad...) and explores some very different ways (from my perspective) to understand addictions. Finally, Part 2 forces one to consider oneself -- very important work.110 chapters in 281 pages of text -- that's 2.53 pages/chapter (on average). Makes a great way to start the day with some wisdom for the soul."},{"Title":"The Greatest Psychologist Who Ever Lived: Jesus and the Wisdom of the Soul","review":"Congratulation's to Dr. Mark Baker for recognizing the profound ways in which Jesus speaks to our deepest human needs, wants and desires. I found this book to be a finely crafted reflection on the most complex and congruent person who ever lived. I appreciate the way Baker discusses complex issues without trivializing Jesus or the psychological concepts. Baker does a nice job integrating the timeless nature of Jesus' teaching with the timeliness of modern psychological insights. I see no discontinuity between theology and therapy. In fact, theology is most therapuetic when it is most faithful to Jesus."},{"Title":"The Greatest Psychologist Who Ever Lived: Jesus and the Wisdom of the Soul","review":"Before I give my review I would like to breifly respond to the review I just read by Tom Hinkle. I have difficulty understanding why he would write a review like he did, perhaps he had difficulty understanding Dr. Baker's book. For Mr. Hinkle, a self proclaimed &quot;amature&quot; theologian, to insinuate that the biblical Jesus was not represented is completely untrue. I found the book to be honest and totally accurate. Mr Hinkle seems to have missed the entire point of the book. He accuses Dr Baker of promoting a relationship with a therapist over one with Christ. How he surmised that makes me wonder if he even read the book. Judging by how well the book is selling I would say that virtually no one would support his opinion. The book is interesting, and informative. It has great insights into human behavior and the teachings of Jesus. Dr. Baker did an excellent job and I highly reccomend this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Psychologist Who Ever Lived: Jesus and the Wisdom of the Soul","review":"I cannot believe it took me this long to Google search, \\"Jesus was the Greatest Psychologist That Ever Lived!!!!\\" which could not be emphasized enough, with the under-current meaning of the word psychologist not as a person who is to explain why a person is thinking and behaving the way they do, but rather, from the Perspective of Jesus, THAT the human mind is separated from the Source of it's own Creation by virtue of its own physicality. Depth psychologists Carl Jung entered into this Realm from what i know of Jung, so I'm wondering if he is mentioned in this book. All points made aside, knowing nothing truly of Jesus other than \\"Jesus loves Me this I know, cause the bible tells me so\\"..reading the book of John which anonymously came to me in the mail years ago..knowing truly nothing about Jesus all that well other than \\"He died on the cross for our sins\\" (such reductionist thinking)...the obvious jumped out at me in every thing he said, \\"If nothing more, he understand human nature to a T, and for that reason he could be said to be 'the most awesome psychologist that ever lived\\". It was not even a topic of debate in my mind, it was plain as day. Then we can understand, 'Eternal Truth I tell you, you must (pretty much) have the Trusting mind of child or be born again from above to See the Kingdom of God'. He knew the deal, because he was a maker of the mind itself. I'll buy this book on Amazon if it is available at a low price. As is written in the Sacred Text if we haven't learned anything yet, we can read ABOUT things as much as we want, that does not make it a part of one's being, only head knowledge. Books books books, one of my greatest temptations, when we learn from the Spirit what is there to know from the mind of another 'person'?

This book is all about what Jesus would say if He was your counselor in todays world. It is informative, timely wisdom that never gets old or outdated. A super read for the seeker of Christian wisdom."},{"Title":"The Greatest Psychologist Who Ever Lived: Jesus and the Wisdom of the Soul","review":"Dr. Baker is brilliant. This book settles many age old conflicts between human society and Jesus. It should be required reading for all ministers of the true faith. Truely it is a jewel in my collection."},{"Title":"The Greatest Psychologist Who Ever Lived: Jesus and the Wisdom of the Soul","review":"I do agree that Jesus is the greatest psychologist who ever lived, because he knew people better than anyone in history, plus, as Dallas Willard has said in his writings, Jesus is the smartest person who ever lived. So that would make him the greatest psychologist. Unfortunately, this book falls short in proving that. It takes (mostly) fragments of Jesus' teaching out of context to attempt to prove that Jesus was in tune with late 20th-century psychological thought. Of course, psychology is an ever-changing science, so sound theory in that area today could easily be disproved tomorrow. Jesus is presented in this book as a guy in touch with his feelings, so we get the touchy-feely Jesus, as opposed to the biblical Jesus who said he only did what he saw his Father doing. Another fault of this book is that it seems, in a very subtle way, to promote the idea of a therapy-dependent society. After all, relationships are important, and the most important one, next to God, of course, is the relationship with the guy charging you $150 an hour to listen to your problems. Don't get me wrong, this book is not without value. If nothing else, it was informative concerning more recent developments in psychological theory. But I don't think psychological theory was what Jesus had in mind when he was doing most of his teaching."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"I enjoyed Voltaire all throughout college and vowed to read more of his works after I graduated college and could once again read materials that I wanted to read.I was almost turned off and put the book away after reading so much anti-semitic writings. Then, I took it with a grain of salt, understood that Voltaire was no different from his fellow man on the matter (in the 1700s) so I just kept reading.I am glad that I did for his attacks rolled away from the Jews to many more subjects. A delightful read with a tinge of missogyny, deism, anti-semitism and of course a few old and outdated ideas like these.What is more important is that Voltaire's writings influenced the Jacobin revolution that swept Europe after it devoured France. Kudos Voltaire!"},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"While many claim that Candide is Voltaire's masterpiece, I prefer this collection of essays that are arranged as a dictionary. Reading this book is like sitting in an elegant 18th century salon and listening to one of the great minds of the age declaim on a variety of subjects, both ancient and modern. While Voltaire will occasionally bend scholarship to make a point, he does it so well and with such wit and style that the things that he gets wrong really don't matter. If you were shipwrecked on a desert island, this would probably be one of the books that you should have packed before leaving."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"This \\"dictionary\\" reveals the truth about religion not just in Voltaire's time but in our own time and before his. The term anti-semitism didn't even exist during Voltaire's time, and ironically he would have defended any Jew if he had to, because that was who he was. The point is truth. The truth hurts sometimes and this one is no different. Read the Epic of Gilgamesh, which Voltaire was unaware of, because it wasn't discovered until the middle 1800's. If Voltaire knew about DNA and the Epic of Gilgamesh and other Mesopotamian Stories he may have reconsidered even being a Deist himself. Don't let me tell you. Read, read, read, read. Forget the news, forget TV, they teach you nothing. Read ancient pre-christian and pre-judaic sources and find a new world."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"Voltaire is one of the greatest philosophers that ever lived on earth.

It is not by chance that Voltaire has come to be known as Christianity's or Catholicism's most famous adversary, for almost half of the entries are about the Bible and Christianity; in these, Voltaire is busy pointing out faults or absurdities. With regard to these articles I can only stress what is my general view of Voltaire: He is mostly right about what he says, but not all of it is as entertaining today as it may have seemed to his contemporaries.The other half of the dicitonary consists of the truly philosophical entries; and these, too, are as different in form as could be: little stories, dialogues and fairly abstract and ordered expositions. Some of these are masterpieces and tell us a lot about philosophy in the 18th century. All in all, however, this book proves once again that Voltaire was more of a journalist and a writer than a truly original philosopher. (Comparing him to Nietzsche, that most original of philosophers, is hardly appropriate.)"},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"Voltaire can teach the dumb, eucate the masses and disabuse Richelieu, Due de.My own smiles and heartfelt laughter, emendations and marganilia only return me to the Mayor of Recrudesce, Voltaire.

If, like me, you were looking for a tongue-in-cheek take on philosophic discourse through the ages, then this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"I have kept this book by my bedside at many points in my life. I should first acknowldege that I also refer to the Bible occasionally, so I tend to draw strength and inspiration from dispirate sources. Voltaire was one of the true intellectual giants of his age, as well-read, erudite and witty as any personage in literary history. This book represents a distillation of all his writings, his &quot;encyclopedic&quot; entries, his treatises, his histories, etc. Reading these musings, you will well understand his occasional need to flee France for more liberal principalities (Prussia and Geneva, primarily).Voltaire (the pen-name for Francois-Marie Arouet (1694-1778), like Gibbon, is no champion of Christianity. As a case-in-point, the Emperor Julian, who attempted unsuccessfully to restore the ancient cults in early Byzantium, and opposed the newly state-sanctioned &quot;cult&quot; of Christ, was Voltaire's paragon. For those readers interested in an interesting account of Julian's rule and of this era, Gore Vidal's &quot;Julian&quot; is a very well-written, but slightly flawed (in terms of its scholarship) account of the 4th Century ruler.I particularly love Voltaire's take on &quot;enthusiasm,&quot;: &quot;Or was that word enthusiasm, from disturbance of the entrails, first given to that Pythia who, on the tripod at Delphi, received the spirit of Apollo through a part which seems made only to receive bodies?...It is the rarest of thing to unite reason with enthusiasm.&quot; No doubt the religious wars and persecutions that were a part and parcel of his era and French history for the preceeding two centuries no doubt had some bearing on his analysis.To me, Voltaire is the precursor of Nietsche. In fact, Nietsche, though he rarely acknowledges Voltaire, makes practically the identical points that Voltaire makes here in his &quot;The Anti Christ&quot; and &quot;The Twilight of the Idols.&quot; They were definitely on the same page in defining faith, vs. skepticism. There are term-papers and research papers galore out there waiting to be explored in this area. In response to my erudite German friend, Nietsche does in fact speak in glowing terms of Voltaire and even goes as far to say that he is his most admired French philosopher, so my comparison is not inappropriate.This is not the only area that Voltaire investigates in this wide-ranging book. Ever wonder about the account of Gog, Magog, of which you might be only vaguely familiar? Voltaire is here to explain it to you. World Religions, the &quot;Chinese Catechism,&quot; &quot;Miracles,&quot; &quot;Anthropophages,&quot; &quot;Liebniz,&quot; &quot;the souls of animals,&quot; &quot;the tower of Babel,&quot; &quot;Apis,&quot; &quot;The Great Flood,&quot; and &quot;The Spanish Inquisition;&quot; all are covered and much more. If you do not complete this book marvelling at how truly encyclopaedic a mind you are dealing with (who better, together with Diderot to compile the first truly meaningful one in the Western World?), then you might not be as open-minded as you think. Even though some of Voltaire's statements of fact are dubious in light of subsequent discoveries, one must still marvel at the range of his intellect and curiosity."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"This volume is the great culmination of Voltaire's beliefs. The humor, honesty, cynicism, and perspective that Voltaire is noted for comes shining through in this excellent work. It is a series of articles on subjects important to philosophers of Voltaire's time, such as religion, humanism, and ethics. This book is about 350 pages in Penguin's typical trade-paperback format. I treasure my copy of this book, and I think you will too if you at all like philosophical discussion."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"This book is about man's freedom: freedom of thought,freedom of worship, freedom of the mental encroachments that make a man think he has the right to despise, oppress, kill a fellow human being because he is different. This book is about the power of Reason,about the absurdity of racism, war, greed and violence. Voltaire was the father of modern man. His errors were the errors of his age: his wisdom is the wisdom of the better part of man."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"I have just finished reading Durant's history of Voltaire and decided that I wanted to read more of his actual writings. I have previously read Candide and some of his letters and really appreciated the biting satire.This version is actually a condensed version of over 300 pages. I found a copy of the original in 6 volumes at over 300 pages each. This work is a \`dictionary' arranged in alphabetical order. The subjects he chooses are seemingly random and include such things as \`beauty', \`corn', \`envy', \`Joan of Arc', and almost any other thing you can think of.I found many of the articles to be dated and not very \`philosophical', but many others were fascinating. I enjoyed his views on the soul, atheism, and free-will. They were clearly philosophical and were probably considered radical at the time. Many of his radical views are now considered mainstream, but some are still bound to offend. His satire was not as biting as some of his other works, but it still probably caused offence to many of his contemporaries.I was somewhat disappointed that this was a condensed version, but I still appreciated the opportunity to read more from Voltaire in a Kindle freebie."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"I'm not your typical philosophe reader, being a high school girl who usually prefers pop music to any sort of book, but there is something about voltaire's writings that appeals to me. Not also are there some great statements made in this book, but clues to what life was like back in his day. Even some of his inaccurate views are valuable because they show how people viewed concepts like Islam. His writing is witty, yet rational and even though sometimes difficult to interperet in modern language, if you read in serveral times and refer to a dictionary often you will understand what he is saying. Although some of the articles are irrelevent for today's world they are useful in historical context and there are many articles that are and always will be relwvent. Don't pass this book off as old fashioned, Voltaire never goes out of style."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"One of the best books I ever read.

Why such a different version might have been explained with your translator/transcriber notes in the Kindle version."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"It is humbling and therefore difficult to even think about rating a piece of work by Voltaire. Nevertheless, it was an amazing experience revisiting this book recently after reading it some 10 years ago. Much has changed over such a decade -- my own life, our surroundings, my beliefs, and, therefore, the ways I relate to literature. In that sense, it is not surprising THAT the same text would now take on rather different meanings. What fascinates me is HOW -- much of the text managed to touch me deeply both times, via totally different angles through the prism of life. It is interesting enough that the insights would evolve with one's personal development; what is even more amazing is that the ideology would also be applicable in an era nearly 300 years after the book was written -- a demonstration of what a classics is really all about."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"I expected this book to be a copy of the original version, not a shorten version of it (like a 1/4 of the original size!).Extremely disappointed."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY (TWO VOLUMES)","review":"I purchased this book because I wanted to know more about this great writer of the 18th century.

The main problem is the Devanagari script is so small that it is barely legible, especially for a beginner. Strangely, the current edition has hand-written corrections in the margins! This book must have been quite an improvement on Lanman and Whitney when it was first published in the 1940s (?), but there are many better Sanskrit introductions available now, for example Egenes.

It is a very simple introduction to a very complex language. It assumes no prior knowledge of any language but English and almost no knowledge of English grammar beyond the most elementary level. There is no better book for a beginner. One area of improvement: the printer should have used a larger point Devanagari font. For example, in an ancillary text that I use in the classroom, the 24-point font is all that I use for the Devanagari characters.

If the copious mystical spiritual treatises originally written in this ancient yet beautiful language inspired your interest in Sanskrit, then this book I'm sure will be a welcome addition to your library. Dr. Tyberg's companion book \\"The Language of the Gods\\" is especially useful in exploring the extensive spiritual terminology of Sanskrit.

She keeps it simple, and the exercises are fun--she makes you feel like you're already translating the Ramayana. At the same time you'll learn the basic principles of Sanskrit grammar and build up a good rudimentary vocabulary.I'd suggest beginning with this book first and then going on to other, more challenging Sanskrit primers.

Even when you can enlarge them, they are smudgy and indistinct. What this book deserves is to be re-typeset, although at the time I'm writing this (5/2012) I'm not sure the technology can yet manage all non-Roman scripts well.

I think one of the greatest disappointments I have ever had as a reader was the day I found out that he was dead. I realized that these stories were the sum total of the windows into that vast and awesome future of the human race that resided in his imagination.Other men have written of light sailed colony ships that span the stars, genetic engineering that turns animals into ersatz versions of men, planoforming ships that whisper between the stars, &quot;menschenjaggers&quot; that hunt forever, the ultimate abuses of power, and the things men will do to be immortal.But they have seldom touched the depths of nobleness and good that Linebarger could impart to his characters. D'Joan and the E'Tele'Keli are what I hope will someday be, and that by then the whole human race will someday be worthy of them. Then you realize that they are already here, and that most of us are worthy of them most of the time.

Yet she pitted her wits against them and she won.&quot; Who couldn't resist reading a story with an opening line like that (&quot;The Ballad of Lost C'Mell&quot;)? Smith is to S.F. as Tolkien is to Fantasy, in that you can immediately sense a huge but complete universe behind the stories, but one that is only revealed through the subtleties of his prose. He doesn't come out and explain it all to you in so many words, but rather leaves you to gain understanding as you make your way from story to story.Anyone who reads this book, and happens to fall in love with C'Mell along the way, should also read &quot;Norstrilia&quot; to find out more about her and other characters from the short stories."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"I encountered Cordwainer Smith many many years ago, in a Fantasy-Science Fiction magazine in my home country; by the way, with an introduction by a scholar of CS! Do you know of anyone in the US?. It was \\"Under Old Earth\\", which has haunted my soul ever since like no other piece of literature, haute or 'low-brow'. In contrast to my second-favorite SF writer, Phillip K. Dick, CS conveys a sense of poetry and subtlety absent in the rough-edge writing of PKD, while bringing about the unique strength of SF, that of exploring the inner and outer limits of the human experience.After all these years, I still wonder why CS remains such a hidden treasure. It is perhaps the built-in disdain of literary critics and scholars for SF, understandable but not less a prejudice.As I write my comments, Kafka keeps popping up in my mind: just change Samsa's bed and the castle for harvested organs and the Instrumentality. Or was the Old Man also a Fantasy writer?"},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Cordwainer Smith was a poet of sorts, and this collection is very like an epic. Mostly encompassed by the framework of Smith's far-future creation, the Instrumentality of Mankind, the stories sometimes recycle motifs and names, but each has a unique vision of what it is to be human--even when the characters he writes about are not, themselves, human at all. Smith's narratives transform the distant future into the dimly remembered past, thus giving his starfarers the feel of legendary, often tragic figures, rather than the idealized and flavorless travelers too often found in science fiction. A must-have collection by one of the twentieth-century's greatest imaginations."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Wow, what a mind. Kind of like the literary verson of Salvador Dali. Get past the first few stories and you're on a wild fantasy ride for 600+ pages. Some people will find his writing too weird but I loved it. Original, creative and like nothing else. I was totally drawn in. I love that kind of escape where you leave earth completely because anything remotely tying you to the world you know is completely gone and replaced with a completely new world.The stories are written as if Mr. Smith has an entire universe spanning thousands of years in his head and only a very small sampling of that universe finds its way to the stories. Not everything is explained and there are gaps but this doesn't take away from the world he creates, it only serves to add depth and mystery. Apparently he lost his notebook, leaving it in a restaurant, and then he died early so who knows what more he would/could have written."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"I read many of Cordwainer Smith's stories over fifty years ago. Some I have not reread since then, and yet they live in my mind. When I read the titles of some of the stories, \\"The Ballad of the Lost C'mell,\\" for example, the tears well up instantly, as if I do not even need to remember the stories via thoughts. Somehow my body remembers them on its own. The only writer I can find as a comparison is J. R. R. Tolkein, who wrote in a different genre. Both created sentient beings of mythic proportions, and both created worlds of imagination unlike anything before or since. Don't miss Cordwainer Smith. His work won't be what you expect, whatever you expect, but reading it will change you forever."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Cordwainer Smith is the pen name of Mr. Paul M. A. Linebarger, who lived a comparatively short (1913 - 1966) and difficult life.He was educated in China, Germany and USA. He loose one eye in an accident being a child. Had a PH degree in Political Sciences, was a university professor and worked undercover for CIA. At the same time he wrote fascinating sci-fi stories.My first contact with the author's stories was \\"Alpha Ralpha Boulevard\\". It was obvious for me that this was a fragment of a greater story, full of mysterious and provoking ideas as the Rediscovery of Man, the Eketeli and so on. I was captivated by the imagery and searched for more works from Cordwainer Smith. Little by little they were appearing in different sci-fi magazines and short stories collections.With this book you have the opportunity to read almost all the \\"fragments\\" constituting Cordwainer's universe, with consistent references to the underpeople, the Instrumentality, the Scanners and the rest of the interlaced icons of this particular Myth.Remarkable stories are: \\"Mark Elf\\", \\"The Game of Rat & Dragon\\", \\"Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons\\" and \\"Under Old Earth\\".A special mention must be done for \\"Ballad of Lost C'Mell\\" and \\"The Dead Lady of Clown Town\\" both dealing with the relationship of humans and underpeople. Mr. Smith had a very particular relation with cats and dogs. He loved them and his underpeople characters show this love.As final note I may point out that \\"The Dead Lady...\\" is a forceful recreation of Joan D'Arc martyrdom.This book contains a wonderful collection from an unjustly underrated author.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"I first encountered Cordwainer Smith thirty years ago. The book was &quot;You will never be the same&quot;, a collection of stories, all of which appear here &quot;The Rediscovery of Man&quot;. I have never read a more aptly-titled book. Smith's writing, while not &quot;hard&quot; science fiction, exemplifies the finest aspirations of the genre. Smith's stories are inventive, evocative and deeply moving. This is a great book to recommend to people who claim they hate science fiction. I would call it literature. Read it. It may not change you, but it may change the way you think about science fiction."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"I first read his works over 20 years ago, and the images haunt me to this day.

It now sits on my bedside bookshelf, and is regular reading. Not only is this a unique author and gloriously poetic style, we can be thankful to him for another. In writing of her own experiences coming to be an sf writer, Ursula leGuin cites Smith's stories as a part of what brought her (also very poetic) voice to the field. For all of us who grew beyond BEMs and intergallactic cabals, a hearty thanks to NESFA (who, I have discovered, have done it again with a Zenna Henderson collection!)"},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"When an author can arouse, and play within you, all your emotions-compassion, anger, love, lust, faith, despair and hope-and give them back to you in the form of a story that author has achieved a kind of miracle few writers achieve.

His stories, scattered like pearls amongst the genre magazines of his time, now come home to roost in one volume. If you don't know him, you probably won't buy this book but once you enter his world, nothing less will do. Go ahead and opt for a lesser volume of stories - the world is filled with great stuff we don't know about but I hope you don't pass Cordwainer by. You've missed a lot."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"My philosophy is that, if you are going to make the future up, you might as well pull out all the stops and just make it as crazy, mysterious, and as convoluted as possible. Cordwainer Smith's vision of the future is just that. He has an incredible ability to imagine really wild and unique settings, problems, and solutions. Even better, he writes in the tone of voice of his future, which gets him an extra plus from me. I dislike a lot of scifi because it is too realistic. That is not a problem with this book. Smith's visions are screwed-up, masterful, and so very compelling that you can't help but admire the guy for his ingenuity and creativity.

His entire output fills four volumes but in influcencing and inspiring other writers he has had far more effect than others who have written (sometimes literally) a hundred times as much. Why? Well, for one he deals with non - technological themes. Like Clarke and Stapeldon he asks questions about the human condition and what comes after it. Another reason might be the sheer quality of the prose, uniquely his own (although there have been imitators - see Micheal Coneys &quot;The Celestial Steam Locomotive&quot; or M.John Harrisons &quot;In Viriconcium&quot;). Titles like &quot;The Dead Lady Of Clown Town&quot;, &quot;Scanners Live In Vain&quot;, &quot;Think Blue, Count Two&quot; are at once whimsical and mysterious. One other reason might be the glimpes - and it is nothing more than a glimpse - of a vast history unfolding involving a romantic rebellion of the half human servant class called the &quot;Underpeople&quot; against a sultifying humanist regime known as The Instrumentality of Mankind. There are echoes of the rebellion of the Christian slaves against the might of Rome. The rebellion of the Underpeople comes to frutition in his best story - &quot;The Ballad of Lost C'Mell&quot;. If you read only one story of his, make it this one..&quot;Where is the which of what she did? Hid the bell with a blot she did... but she fell in love with a hominid. where is the which of the what she did?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Cordwainer Smith is one of the most unique and original authors to ever write science fiction, and is definitely among my favorites. These stories are the best of Cordwainer Smith, though he also wrote Nostrilia, a good book that nevertheless pales in comparison to the selections in The Rediscovery of Man. What I like about Smith is that he has a sense of the epic in science fiction, while still maintaining the focus of his writing: humans and near-humans (the underpeople). Many of his stories deal with love, something to be admired in a genre that often ignores this important concept. Especially in &quot;The Ballad of Lost C'Mell&quot;, &quot;Alpha Ralpha Boulevard&quot;, &quot;The Burning of the Brain&quot;, and &quot;Three to a Given Star&quot;, Smith shows his competency in this area, giving often heart-wrenching accounts of the survival of love in this far flung future. Other key stories include &quot;The Crime and Glory of Commander Suzdal&quot;, the horrifying &quot;A Planet Named Shayol&quot;, and &quot;The Dead Lady of Clown Town&quot;. Such stories show an incredible depth of imagination, though Smith never loses touch with his characters, imbuing them real emotion and intelligence. If I had one complaint it would be that Smith sometimes lets his imagination run wild, creating a story that is a little too abstract. This is shown in &quot;Under Old Earth&quot;, the only story I had trouble finishing. This, however, is a minor grievance, and the pure brilliance of the other stories occludes this one misstep. Give yourself a chance to appreciate this often overlooked genius."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Cordwainer Smith's (real name - Paul Linebarger) small but remarkable body of work had a disproportionate influence on modern science fiction. He was the first, and in my opinion still the most successful, writer to tap into the \\"grand sense of wonder\\" which is the true gift of science fiction to art. He did this by combining the great poet's gift of words which explode into indelible images in the mind with the religious awe of witnessing something greater than ourselves, the thought-provoking profundity of the Zen koan and intensely wonderful, tragic, silly characters who remind us of the best parts of ourselves.He is the science fiction writer which other writers respect - two of his stories were chosen in the top 10 for the Science Fiction Writers' of America Hall of Fame Anthologies (only one - Alpha Ralpha Boulevard could be included by the rules of the contest, however).Now you can get them all in one volume (except for the novel Norstrilia). You don't have to search every single used bookstore in every town you visit across the country to find a beat-up copy of \\"The Best of Cordwainer Smith\\" like I did (still haven't found \\"The Realms of the Instrumentality\\" except at a small college-town public library, where it remains despite all temptation to \\"lose\\" it and pay replacement costs).Just don't read all the stories at one sitting. Read one story, then put it down and let it percolate through your consciousness, and when you wake up in the middle of the night sobbing or laughing out loud for joy, you're ready to read another story."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"These are not just the best science fiction novelettes ever written, they may well be the best stories ever written. 'The Dead Lady of Clown Town' is the only object in print that has ever made me cry. These are true &quot;miracles of rare device,&quot; and if you do not fall in love with C'mell, you have no soul"},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Cordwainer Smith was actually the pseudonym for Dr. Phillip Linebarger, who was a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, if I remember right, but anyway, at one of the Ivy League colleges. He was a sometime advisor to the government and wrote a classic book on psychological warfare back in the 40's that I read was still in use by the CIA in the 60's. Perhaps it was this background that gives Smith's stories about the future such a darkly pessimistic tone. As someone observed here in another review, such a view was in stark contrast to the other authors of the Golden Age of Science Fiction (circa 1930 to 1960), during which it was still believed that science would solve all of society's ills. Wherever it came from, Smith's vision is certainly different, his writing style is like no other sci-fi author's, and even his titles are different--giving them names like &quot;The Game of Rat and Dragon, &quot;The Ballad of Lost C'Mell,&quot; and the sinister sounding (for a psychological warfare prof) &quot;The Burning of the Brain.&quot; If you've never encountered Smith's stories until now, you are in for a rare experience, because Smith is a great storyteller with a uniquely dark and disturbing vision of the future."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Readers of Cordwainer Smith's work will probably be instantly attracted by titles like &quot;Alpha Ralpha Boulevard&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Lost C'mell&quot;. The stories used to arrive on the desk of Frederik Pohl, who along with then wife Judith Merril were editors of any number of Science Fiction magazines. There were generally no titles on them, just instructions on where to send payment should the stories be accepted. Pohl and Merril actually invented the titles, and only years after publishing the seminal stories got to meet Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger, the real Cordwainer Smith, a career US Government official on an international book tour. You might also haunt the used book stores for two non-SF novels of his, Ria and Carolla, neither of which have seen the light of day in decades.I envy those new to Smith: they are in for a mind-expanding experience."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"When I read the short-story Scanners Live in Vain, I was bowled over. I could scarcely believe it was written over fifty years ago. By creating a future so divorced from our present time and so unique in it's voice and details, Smith had succeeded in writing a story that would retain it's startling freshness. But Smith's \\"Instrumentality of Mankind\\" stories have more than just staying power: they are very powerful and intimate reflections on the human condition. I also highly recommend Cordwainer Smith's novel \\"Norstrilla\\". Cordwainer Smith inspired Robert Silverberg to write science fiction. -nuff said."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"When I picked up this book (after getting it from a friend), I had some doubts, even if the person in question never had let me down before with book recommendations.After reading the introduction, about all the \\"unspoken and unwritten\\" clues and history events, I was even more sceptical.However, I was completely wrong in my premonition.Smith combines modern philosphy, avant-garde thinking and religion in what to me is one of the greatest dreams of our time.A Sci-Fi writer is often forced to grapple and come to terms with todays problems so that a future can be presented and Smith does that in a finely tuned, delicate and yet enchanting and engrossing way.His interest in religion and populatory control shine like a guiding light in darkness. What must happen with religion? How must a state operate in order to contain and control a potentially destructive (as humans often are) population when it is spread across the stars?What happens to love? Love - in sci-fi, where it often is just a bonus the hero picks up after the adventure, plays an important role in Smith's work. So does religion. And morality.After finishing the short stories and frantically reading my way through Norstrilia, my first feeling was a deep sadness. This was all you see. The two books are the only things that are easily available to the savvy or not-so-savvy reader today. I know that Smith wrote other things under other names, but the fiction left me tear-eyed, shaking, laughing and thinking.Smith sits on my Sci-Fi throne together with Herbert and Dick, not having Asimovs slow, almost stuffy style, but keeping it serious but playful, strange but enchanting.Read it. And read it again. And again. And again... and again."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Probably the single best book in my science fiction collection. Cordwainer Smith (a pen name) didn't write much science fiction - most of what he wrote is contained in this single anthology of his short stories.These stories are loosely bound together through a universe populated with genetically modified humans and animals, sub-races, strange computers, immortality, drugs and ancient, crumbled cities.If you are looking for something different in science fiction you should definitely try this one. I believe that a similar anthology is available in the form of an out-of-print paperback."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"I am extremely impressed by Cordwainer Smith's vision of Humanity's future, and I only regret he did not write more stories. His knowledge of the quest for Utopias and the inevitable boredom with perfection is so multi-faceted that his prose will remain relevant to the human condition for all time. The dreamlike quality of his descriptions, the feeling of the tremendous historical events in his future's past, and the mystery of the Human spirit presents a grandeur that speaks to each reader individually. If I were stranded on an island with only one book to read, The Rediscovery of Man would be that book. Smith's knowledge of Chinese culture led him to give us a vision of the Jwindz, based on what I think is a satire of the Chun Tzu, the Superior Man in Confucianism, who create a sterile culture, which is overthrown by the Instrumentality of Mankind, who become as sterile over millenia, until the imperfections are brought back to save the species...it's wonderful stuff!! From the hallucinogenic beauty of &quot;No, No, Not Rogov!&quot; to the mythic quality of &quot;Under Old Earth,&quot; there is something for everybody here. I love it. It ranks with Asimov's best works as the finest and most potentially immortal writing in Science Fiction."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Like everyone else who has commented here, I love Cordwainer Smith. I first started reading him when I was about 12 -- it was &quot;The Dead Lady of Clown Town&quot;. For the first time, I realised that it was possible to fuse poetry and prose and tell a great story. I eagerly read everything else of his I could lay my hands on, just for the sheer beauty of the writing. Later, when I got older, I discovered the philosophical ideas behind the stories, and grew to admire them even more.When I spotted &quot;The Rediscovery of Man&quot; in my local bookstore, I immediately snatched it off the shelf, afraid that some other fan of great writing would grab it first."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"I've read all his SF stories many times; this book contains &quot;The Queen of the Afternoon&quot;, so I have to buy this book just to get that one story.&quot;The Lady Who Sailed 'The Soul'&quot; always brings tears to my eyes. &quot;The Dead Lady of Clown Town&quot; inspires me. &quot;Alpha Ralpha Boulevard&quot;: I remember for reading it as a kid; the style stuck in my mind, even though I didn't understand the story.

Smith's vision is truly amazing. I often find myself thinking, as a writer, that I wish I'd had some of these ideas.Why only 4 stars? I find Smith's style a bit choppy in places.

The net seems to be filled with people who've never read any science fiction older then the 80's so it is pleasing people are keeping him alive. Well metaphorically speaking since he did die before I was even born."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Serious fans and historians of science fiction must obtain this compendium of all the known short stories by Cordwainer Smith, who deserves far greater fame than he got when he did most of his writing back in the 50s and 60s. At the time, Smith simply sold a few stories to a few SF mags, but it turns out that they were interconnected vignettes from a vast future universe and mythology that Smith was creating in his mind for decades. This vast fictitious universe covers the development of man over tens of thousands of years and across the galaxy, in an expansive style that is reminiscent of Frank Herbert. Meanwhile, Smith's method of creating narratives as if they were told by an old storyteller, even farther in the future, could be compared to J.R.R. Tolkien, who also created his own universe and history of tremendous proportions.Smith was a storyteller of remarkable literary ability, as he explored scientific advances without getting too technical, and introduced very heavy themes of humanity and morality without lapsing into preachy conclusions. Very few writers in any genre have this kind of ability for kicking off deep speculation and introspection in the reader. Just about all of the many stories here explore the re-emergence of real humanity after many millennia of human dispersal across the universe, with a few glimpses of mirth or action amidst general darkness and melancholy.A few stories of note include the disturbing \\"A Planet Named Shayol\\" in which humans are farmed for body parts on a deceptively tranquil prison planet; \\"Think Blue, Count Two\\" which describes what could really happen on a typical SF mothership transporting humans for hundreds of years to a new space colony; \\"When the People Fell\\" which very creepily explores how regular people will be used for space colonization; or \\"The Crime and the Glory of Commander Suzdal\\" in which Smith twists time travel and even history in remarkable humanistic ways. Of special note to SF historians is \\"War No. 81-Q\\" which lampoons the fallacy of war for profit and entertainment, a form of satire that's unbelievable for a story first written way back in the 1920s (and Smith was in high school at the time to boot). Those are just a few of the tremendous stories in this collection by an author who richly deserves to be treated as a grand master in his field. The sheer breadth and depth of Smith's literary universe is simply astonishing.

There aren't that many of them - but they are so wonderful they can be read and read and read again. And they never lose their freshness for me. I read 'The Game of Rat and Dragon' to my wife one night when she was having trouble getting to sleep. Perhaps it's not his greatest story, but it is so humane, so all-encompassing of the best of humankind and so wonderful to the animals that we share this world with - specifically cats in this case (and for anyone who has been fortunate enough to share at least part of their lives with cats it will probably raise so many memories).So I took down my favourite anthology - the 1970 Panther Books edition published under the title 'Under Old Earth' and started to refresh the Cordwainer Smith experience. As I read the wonderful 'A Planet Named Shayol' (there is nothing like this anywhere!) the tears rose in my eyes again. This involuntary response told me so much!!! Here's a quote:'It's unfair,' cried the half-man. 'They should be punished as we were!'The Lady Johanna Gnade looked down at him. 'Punishment is ended. We will give you anything you wish, but not the pain of another.'What a vision! The only comparable one I can think of is the words Gustav Mahler wrote about the day of judgement scene in his second symphony. After the trumpets sound and the dead are raised Mahler reasoned that there would be neither reward nor punishment - only God's heavenly love would remain.I cannot compromise the five star average rating for these stories. I agree with one and all! If you haven't read these stories you have a wonderful experience in store. If you, like me, know them already - just enjoy again and again as I do."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Cordwainer Smith is the pen name of Mr. Paul M. A. Linebarger, who lived a comparatively short (1913 - 1966) and difficult life. He was educated in China, Germany and USA. Loose one eye in an accident being a child. Had a PH degree in Political Sciences, was a university professor and worked undercover for CIA. At the same time he wrote fascinating sci-fi stories.My first contact with the author's stories was \\"Alpha Ralpha Boulevard\\". It was obvious for me that this was a fragment of a greater story, full of mysterious and provoking ideas as the Rediscovery of Man, the Eketeli and so on. I was captivated by the imagery and searched for more works from Cordwainer Smith. Little by little they were appearing in different sci-fi magazines and short stories collections.With this book you have the opportunity to read almost all the \\"fragments\\" constituting Cordwainer's universe, with consistent references to the underpeople, the Instrumentality, the Scanners and the rest of the interlaced icons of this particular Myth.Remarkable stories are: \\"Mark Elf\\", \\"The Game of Rat & Dragon\\", \\"Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons\\" and \\"Under Old Earth\\".A speciall mention must be done for \\"Ballad of Lost C'Mell\\" and \\"The Dead Lady of Clown Town\\" both dealing with the relationship of humans and underpeople. Mr. Smith had a very particular relation with cats and dogs. He loved them and his underpeople characters show this love.A final note \\"The Dead Lady...\\" is a forceful recreation of Joan D'Arc martyrdom.It is a wonderful collection from an unjustly underrated author.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"A few years ago I encountered, in an undistinguished anthology of Year's Best Something-Or-Other, a short science fiction story called &quot;The Ballad of Lost C'mell.&quot; Love at first sight. I ransacked used book stores, the crowded shelves and dusty boxes of my house, and even libraries to find more short stories written by this miraculous Cordwainer Smith. I managed to assemble eight or nine, all from various anthologies, before my parents took pity on me and gave me &quot;The Rediscovery of Man&quot; for my birthday. Smith's writing is so good, it's intoxicating: you put down his writing with your head full of fantastic images, from underpeople toiling away in the mysterious corridors of Downdeep-downdeep, to star sailors riding the interstellar winds, the indescribable poetry of Space-3 and the strange futile lives of the Scanners. In my eyes Cordwainer Smith has only one fault-he died too soon! How dare he leave such a colorful, complicated, weird and wild future universe unfinished? Fortunately he left these stories, and if you have not already read them, I suggest you waste no further time in discovering the Instrumentality of Mankind and the universe around it. And even if you've read the stories before, read them again. They're just as good the second time around . . . or the fifth . . .or the fortieth . . ."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"I first encountered Cordwainer Smith when I was in grade school, checking every book out of the library that I could find under Science Fiction. Some of my favorite stories were the often-anthologized &quot;Game of Rat and Dragon&quot; and &quot;Scanners Live in Vain.&quot; I began seeking out his stories anywhere I could find them, but aside from the wonderful novel Norstrilia, I could find few more.How exciting that the NESFA Press has brought all of these stories together in one book. It was such a joy rediscovering old favorites, and also finding real gems (such as &quot;The Dead Lady of Clown Town&quot;) I had never seen anywhere before.This volume is a must-have for anyone who cares about classic science fiction short stories. In it are some of the best examples of the genre. A short list of the stories in this volume that you MUST read would include: &quot;Alpha Ralpha Boulevard&quot;, &quot;The Game of Rat and Dragon&quot;, &quot;A Planet Called Shayol&quot;, &quot;Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons&quot;, and the aforementioned &quot;Dead Lady of Clown Town.&quot;The title of one of Smith's collections that originally contained many of these stories was You Will Never Be the Same. What a great title, and how accurate. You won't be."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Cordwainer Smith began publishing science fiction in the fifties when Amazing Stories and other science fiction fanzines primarily flew rockets to outer space and beyond. Smith, however, took the common themes of pulp science fiction and made them into something alien and new. Ships did travel through space, but they were hunted by beings of pure malevolence, and saved by cats chasing imaginary mice. People themselves become alien adjusting their physiology to fit worlds that otherwise could not support life. Animals and robots become more than human by acting with intelligence, compassion, and love often exceeding that of their masters.Smith's stories are not hard science; they read more like fairy tales or myths. However, The Rediscovery of Man is the myths of mankind's future, myths showing the potential for both dreams and nightmares to come true. These are stories for children thousands of years hence, and for adults today. Just like myths and fairy tales, Smith's stories have great truths in them that are often hidden by an entertaining story.This collection is a fascinating glimpse into the human mentality. Individually, a few of these stories stand out as his best writing, but the collection as a whole is a beautiful work that leads you through one of the most imaginative minds in science fiction."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Like Heinlein, Smith built a detailed future history of the human race as a backdrop for his writing. It starts at the end of WWII and continues tens of thousands of years into the future. Smith spent much of his childhood in Asia, as the son of a diplomat,and grew up to become an expert in Asian culture and affairs, as well as politics in general and psychology in particular. Many of Smith's stories are rewrites of Chinese myths and fables, with casts of characters out of his often dreamlike human universe, governed by the Instrumentality.Interestingly, even within this vast sweep of time, Smith's Instrumentality never chances upon a single alien race, despite the eventual development of various and increasingly efficient techniques of FTL travel. At a few points in \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\" Smith mentions various of the Instrumentality's preparations for possible alien encounters, but only modified and/or forgotten sub-species of humans are ever discovered.The word \\"dark\\" gets used a lot in describing Smith's work, deriving from such things as the subjugation of the Underpeople, the practice of memory-wiping and the pervasive,paternalistic and all-powerful Instrumentality.But most importantly, Smith's personal history is one of witnessing events from the viewpoint of those who are leading (or manipulating) the rest of us, and it is the appearance of this unique understanding in his writing that gives it it's edge, and that element of darkness. The Instrumentality is a shadow government- for the most part staying out of daily life for billions of people in far-flung planets and empires. But it does have altruistic agendas, that require adjustments to the large scale flow of human development, at times, which take the form of both guidance and retribution. At it's highest level, the arc of the story told by all the stories in \\"Rediscovery Of Man\\", taken together, is about the Instrumentality finally realizing that humans, as a species now spread out over thousands of light years, do best when controls are minimal, hence the title.But the wonderfully offbeat technology is pure imagination-such as the \\"laminated mouse brain\\" containing a guardian hologram for a young girl on an interstellar journey in the story \\"Think Blue, Count Two\\",or Old North Australia's strange and fearsome planetary defense system in \\"Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons\\"; a directed-telepathy weapon powered by the lethal hostility harvested from the minds of specially-bred psychotic weasels.One could actually hope that humanity turns out as exotic, abstract and imaginative (and as long-lasting!) as Smith envisioned. If you are a scifi buff but are unfamiliar with Smith's work, there is a gaping hole in your expertise that you can now remedy with a single, chronologically-ordered volume of stories. If scifi isn't your bag, I guarantee you still will be seduced and enchanted and transfixed by this relatively small body of work which, like the writing of Stanislaw Lem, raises speculative fiction to the level of literature."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"At the age of thirteen, I fell on a beat up copy of Norstrilia, and fell in love with Smith's works. I soon got a copy of &quot;The Best of Cordwainer Smith&quot; and it vanished on a summer camp trip. It took me years to replace it. Imagine my delight to have all those loved stories in one (heavy) volume, unlikely to go astray!As you probably know, Smith was actually Dr. Paul M.A. Linebarger, a Johns Hopkins professor and specialist in Asian affairs. He was a master of psychological warfare.His stories fit no easy category. They are not fantasy, they are not hard science fiction, they are not alternative history. They incorporate bits and pieces of Asian culture and myth. They are often troubling, haunting. &quot;The Dead Lady of Clown Town&quot; ends with most of its characters dead or with their minds wiped, yet it is a happy ending for all that, with Joan's views obviously spreading through the underpeople. &quot;Under Old Earth&quot; is a fascinating tale, filled with allusions that must be beyond the scope of this note. Even &quot;War No. 81-Q&quot;, the original version of which was written by Smith as a teenager, is an excellent story. &quot;Alpha Ralpha Boulevard&quot; is simply one of the great SF short stories of all time. I could go on, but . . .The volume also includes the Casher O'Neill trilogy, that I had read of, but not seen before.If you haven't read Smith before, this is how to buy his stories, so that you have them all.

Buy it."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Cordwainer Smith is one of the most amazing, lyrical writers of science fiction ever. It distresses me that he is so little known. He made a name for himself during the Korean war as a diplomat; he apparently devised a way for Chinese soldiers to surrender without losing face by chanting the words for &quot;peace, love, serenity&quot; (or some similar words...my memory of the anecdote is not perfect) which in English sounded like &quot;I Su-REN-Der&quot;. Genius. The man's intellect bursts forth in his short fiction, which has given me the chills, made me cry, and caused me to reflect back on images from the works on more occasions than I care to admit.PLEASE read this man's works. He is extremely literate and passionate in his writing, adopting an asian style of storytelling that is both different and comforting. The pathos of B'dikkat in &quot;The Planet Named Sheol&quot; is as touching as the story is horrifying.If you do not enjoy this book, I will be extremely surprized."},{"Title":"The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith","review":"Cordwainer Smith was unique. Although the contents of this volume represent more than half of his entire science-fictional output, what he lacked in quantity he made up for in superb and very different quality. His prose is colored by some very non-standard phrasing and imagery, at least some of which came from his close connections with Chinese culture (his god-father was Sun Yat-sen, and he was a close confidant of Chiang Kai-shek). There is a feeling, an ambience to his stories that I have never seen even approximated by any other author. But the themes he tackled in his stories are ones that everyone can relate to, covering prejudice, greed, lust for power, crime and appropriate punishment, and the seeming boundless desire to go where no man has gone before.Perhaps the main highlight of this collection is \\"The Dead Lady of Clown Town\\", which is a very forceful retelling of the Joan of Arc story. I ended up in tears at the end of this one when I first read it, and subsequent re-reads haven't lessened its impact. I've had this one in my top ten \`best of sf' short fiction list since my first encounter with it.\\"A Planet Named Shayol\\" will make you do some heavy thinking about just what can or should be done to punish a society's law (or custom) breakers, or if punishment is ever even really justifiable at all, and will give you a nightmare vision of just what hell on Earth (or any other planet) just might be like.\\"The Ballad of Lost C'Mell\\" may be the centerpiece of his entire envisioned future history, as the Instrumentality of Mankind, which for centuries has managed the human population to avoid disease, war, or hard labor (for which tasks the Underpeople were created), is driven to the conclusion that a viable civilization must have some dark elements, as championed by Lord Jestocost and girly-girl Cat-person C'Mell.Almost all of the stories here are part of Smith's envisioned universe governed by the Instrumentality, a vision that stretches from near-Earth future to a very distant far-future galaxy where humanity has spread almost everywhere. Smith clearly has some overriding messages: his fear of all-powerful ruling bodies, his attachment to all forms of life and the respect that each individual should have, and a basic belief in the power and utility of religion. All the details of this universe are not filled in, and it is sometimes the tantalizing glimpses of what he does not describe that will capture your imagination, and your wish that there were more stories about this unique world. His Underpeople are marvelous creations, showing not only those traits normally associated with the best of humanity, but also characteristics of their underlying animal heritage, whether it be cat, dog, or turtle.Not every story here is a gem, most especially those not set in his Instrumentality universe or those dealing with the very near future. But they are all very readable, and the overall level of quality here is absurdly high. Read this first. Then take on his only sf novel, Norstrilia. You won't regret it.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Discontent was required reading in high school and has lost nothing in the past 40 years. Ethan Hawley and his story was relevant in the fifties and is even more so today. I've never met a Steinbeck book I didn't like but this one has to be my favorite. Maybe it's because I know more than several Ethan Hawleys and Steinbeck's portrayal is dead on. Although I can't believe the Nobel committee waited until 1962 to award Discontent the prize for literature (what about Of Mice and Men and East of Eden)? this novel surely deserved it.This is a novel that bears rereading every five years or so. If ever an author chronicled the lessening of American standards and the downward spiral of a man's moral integrity, it was Steinbeck!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"A thoroughly decent and ethical man is influenced by but not swallowed up by the ubiquitous soft corruption in his hometown. Throughout, a novel about bedrock morals and the test that modern times gives them. A much slighter, smaller story than \\"East of Eden\\" or \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" this later novel probes some of the finer intellectual notions the others do not."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Reader seeking to identify fictional people and places here described would do better to inspect their own communities and search their own hearts, for this book is about a large part of America today--PrefaceWritten in 1961, these words are as pertinent today--perhaps even more so. A social protest novel like THE GRAPES OF WRATH, THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT tackles the moral corruption that Steinbeck perceived in America during the era of the quiz show scandals in the late 1950s. Reflecting on the recent corporate and plagiarism scandales, readers today will have no trouble relating to Steinbeck's setting. Just as importantly, however, readers will have no trouble identifying with the book's characters.Named for the famous speech of Richard III, WINTER takes place during a period of peace following a protracted conflict. Like Richard Gloucester, Steinbeck's protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, gets ahead by betraying a brother. Driven by the demands of his wife and children that he acquire more money and public prestige, Hawley cheats his closest boyhood friend out of land coveted by developers. As with Richard's attrocities, each bad deed leads to more (and worse) deeds.But whereas Shakespeare depicts evil as flowing from the depraved character of Richard, Steinbeck attributes his hero's shortcomings to society itself. As with his other books, Steinbeck portrays human beings as naturally good individuals corrupted by their economic and social surroundings. This idea is debatable to say the least, but there's no question that Steinbeck makes a good case. Reading Ethan's reflections on his own community and witnessing the consequences of all types of greed is like watching QUIZ SHOW, the Redford film depicting the same era.As with his other works, WINTER is full of characters respresenting various sides of socieity but having sppech and habits that defy any stereotype. Like GRAPES, Winter combines the best of literary naturalism and romanticism. But even more than GRAPES, the plot and characters of WINTER continue to be \\"about a large part of America today.\\""},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"i was amazed by this short steinbeck novel. it is simutaneously entertaining and thought-provoking. This story of the moral, emotional and psychological journey of Ethan Allen Hawley leaves the reader inspecting their own understanding of themself. The dialogue is at times witty and light and at the same time laden with meaning. I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This novel was one of Steinbeck's last, and delves heavily into themes of disillusionment with one's country and one's lot in life. While The Grapes of Wrath was arguably a more heartbreaking book, in that novel, at least the characters still cared and still maintained ideals. In this book, the character of Ethan Allen Hawley has lost hope for the future and lapsed into a great abyss of depression and despair. In this way, Steinbeck seemed much more Hemingway-esque than he had in his earlier, and in my opinion greater, works of fiction.While I did not enjoy this book as much as earlier works like The Grapes of Wrath, there is still much to appreciate in this tale about an American patriarch who has lost his way. Ethan lives in New Baytown, a fictional New England town, with his dissatisfied, materialistic wife, daughter and son. Both children are writing an essay regarding why they love America, though only the son is able to finish it--and he does so by plagiarizing speeches by Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln. Ethan's family was once well-to-do but lost their fortune with speculative investments after WWII, relegating Ethan to working as a grocery clerk at the store he once owned. His boss is an illegal Italian immigrant who encourages Ethan to be less generous with the customers.New Baytown itself is a major character in the novel. The entire town operates within a realm of corruption. Yet things have operated that way so long that no one remembers it is corrupt anymore. All of the major and minor characters are seriously flawed--Margie Young-Hunt, the town seductress and witch; Mr. Baker, the greedy banker; Joey Morphy, the bank clerk who describes the perfect way to rob a bank. Gradually Ethan realizes that the only way to be happy is to get money. The only way to get money is to bend his own moral standards. And once he bends his moral standards, he is more miserable than ever.This short novel is delightfully written, with superb dialogue and clever references to religion and American history. It is basically an indictment of America's materialistic lifestyle as it entered the 1960's. I enjoyed it very much on that level, but did not feel it withstood comparison to Steinbeck's earlier, more emotional novels. This story was more allegory than novel, which is fine--but which one should keep in mind while reading this little gem."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"When reading Steinbeck it is easy to understand his prominence as one of the great contemporary American writers. He takes a human or societal flaw and dissects it page by page and the reader cannot but help thinking how real and how commonplace Steinbeck's characters and situations are. In \\"Winter\\" the author centers on the greed and lust for material riches that was prevalent in America of the late1950s and early 1960s. Ethan Hawley, the protagonist, is a Harvard-educated man of once-prominent social standing who through the misfortunes of his whaling captain father is currently the clerk in a grocery store his father once owned. The present owner, an Italian immigrant, is the target of hostility for the simple reason that he is foreign.Ethan Hawley is a man pushed by the desires of his wife Mary and his two children, Ellen and Allen. This middle-class family yearns for a more upscale life than Ethan can provide. A television, new curtains and furniture are some of the material possessions they long for. Because Ethan cannot provide them he makes a decision that incorporates the worst elements of greed and avarice. He embarks on a well thought-out plot to illegally obtain the money necessary to give his family the luxuries they desire. And so in lies the crux of this story...what happens to a man that forsakes his morals for the happiness of his family?There are many supporting characters that flavor the book. Most notably Ethan's childhood friend Danny, now the town drunk, and his wife's best friend Margie who apparently is the town's most popular call girl. There is also the banker, a teller, and Mr. Marullo, the immigrant grocery store owner, whose tragedy becomes Ethan's triumph.When accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature for this novel, Steinbeck stated that a writer is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement. Readers will certainly see a generation's most obvious faults and failures and have Ethan Hawley's dark and dangerous dreams exposed. Interestingly enough, the materialistic greed exposed in this novel is still very real nearly fifty years later."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"&quot;The Winter Of Our Discontent&quot; is not Steinbeck's best, but it's really a good read and you can't go wrong spending a few hours reading the works of this master of American Lit!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This was my first Steinbeck novel. If this is not his best (as the critics say) then I can't imagine what the others will be like. This is easily the best book I've read this year. Excellent piece of writing.

They are all dire warnings of where, not just our lives, but our very souls are heading as we walk the grim path of increasing affluence and keeping up with the Joneses. Beautifully and sensitively drawn, this portrait of Ethan Hawley's conversion to guerrilla capitalism and its consequences is nothing less than a must-read for every American who has been tempted to trod the same path. Take a half star off, though, for Hawley's (and other characters') male chauvinism which really gets to be a drag along the way (and I'm no big feminist)."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck's early novels, particularly \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" are well known for packing a walloping emotional punch. Over time Steinbeck style and tone evolved. His move from California to Sag Harbor, Long Island probably had as much effect as age, experience and changing times. His last novel, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" shows Steinbeck continues to have strong views on America's social currents and his writing reflects the more subtle corruption of society that he sees around him.As the books are so different that had I not known ahead of time that this was a Steinbeck novel I would not have guessed it. Gone is the heavy use of vernacular and voice of the oppressed underclass unable to catch a break. In its place is Ethan Allen Hawley, the grocery clerk from the 11th generation of a once proud and wealthy family. Hawley is smart, glib, somewhat superficial growing cynical of his increasingly trapped middle age.Steinbeck sees Hawley's small town is perhaps a metaphor of the American society was so worrying to him. Businessmen are double dealing. Elected officials take a little bit on the side. And everywhere is the potential for a little shoplifting or infidelity. Through humor and wit much of this is glossed over but as the portraitures grew deeper it's more apparent that few in Steinbeck's world are capable of doing right. Their moral failings are central to his story.Overall the book was worthwhile, The characters are interesting and original and for social criticism this is ahead of its time. I found Hawley to be a strangely inconsistent character. He quotes latin, sites verse in Old English and in other ways is presented as potentially a deep and reflective person. But he is unaffected by his war years unnaturally detached from his wife and children using way too much humor. It contradicts with his later motives and actions which ultimately lead to a series of plot resolutions that seem to fall a bit short but I would say these are minor flaws for a story that illuminates its time with originality and freshness that remains for the modern reader.NOTE: Susan Shillinglaw's forward is quite helpful but I'd suggest it as an afterward as the plot giveaways were more than I would have liked."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I went on a binge about a month ago and started reading Steinbeck's books, finishing with The Winter of Our Discontent. It's not my favorite Steinbeck story, but it is a great story told well. Sorry it took me so long to get to it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"As I was reading The Winter of Our Discontent there was something about Ethan Hawley's character that reminded me of Willy Loman, Arthur Miller's tragic hero in his play Death of a Salesman. In Miller's work, Loman is a salesman who has lost touch with reality, and always is after what success is about, as he imagines talking to his dead brother Ben to try to get the answers to life. A man who was probably most successful in his daydreams than real life, Willy Loman might be considered an underachiever or loser by some, but there is a certain sympathy we carry for him. I bring up this character because Ethan, in The Winter of Our Discontent, has some of these same qualities, although he is not established like Loman (even in his own musings or dreams), and more glaringly, he is not as likeable or forgivable. Ethan also strives to gain a piece of the American dream, as he comes from strong family roots in New England, and works as a clerk in the town's local grocery store. Feeling the pressure from his wife and two kids, he wants to move upward in the world and be able to provide the wealth and comforts that make a father a success. He wants to carry on the family legacy with pride, and attain the status that makes him a success in his own mind. In this way, Ethan Hawley is a man with ambition; however, Macbeth was ambitious too. The crisis of conflict that Hawley ultimately experiences is that he gives in to moral standards to become \\"someone\\" in the world, which means setting aside morals, friends, and conscientiousness in hopes of attaining this status. Much like a Shakespeare tragic hero, or Willy Loman, he continues onward, attributing all things to fate, but ultimately has to come face to face with himself.Hawley makes several key decisions that ultimately affect those close to him negatively. He loans money to his childhood friend Danny, a town drunk, to supposedly help him get some help with his drinking, but knowing full-well that he will drink himself to death with the money. He also gets him to use his own property as collateral if he shouldn't pay it back. His boss, who once gives him the advise to \\"look after number one,\\" is deported after Ethan reports him to authorities; once this take place, the store becomes Ethan's, and he is no longer \\"just a clerk\\", but owner. Hawley also has plans of robbing a store in his mind, and is only stopped just short of doing this. One ironic aspect is when Ethan's son, Allen, plagiarizes on his \\"I Love America\\" essay and is scolded; just as Ethan has cheated the system to get ahead, his son has followed in his footsteps, yet only his son gets reprimanded for it. Ethan seems to legitimize his own actions: \\"Strength and success--they are above morality, above criticism...In effect no crime is committed unless a criminal is caught\\" (187).Unlike many of Steinbeck's novels, this one uses a good deal of inner character monologue to reveal the protagonist's train of thought. In that way, the writing style is not typical of the simplistic narration that Steinbeck often uses, and sometimes there is more to what Ethan is thinking or doing than it actually seems. Some have both praised and criticized Steinbeck for using characters to project aspects of human morality, and The Winter of Our Discontent, his last novel, is no exception. While I didn't enjoy this novel as much as some of his other stuff, there are flashes of exceptional writing. For any Steinbeck fans, this is a novel that is a bit different than the others in that we are taken away from the California setting, and into the character's point of view."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Winter of our discontent by John SteinbeckEthan runs the store and others approach him to take some cuts in the form of money.

Not all of a great author's books can be equally great . This book is very good but not as great as Cannery Row, East of Eden, Grapes of Wrath,. or Travels with Charlie."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book was smashed into a flat package that was extremely difficult to open. The cover and some inside pages are bent. The back cover is halfway ripped off."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Steinbeck really is my favourite writer. I'm glad all of his books are made available by Penguin for my Kindle Fire. Thank you, Penguin!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This is a sad, tragic story, about a man who losses his focus due to the expectations of others. In the end, he discovers that by meeting these expectations, he is unable to remain true to himself."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I read this book since it had been selected by my book club. It sounded interesting: the story of a man whose family background tells him he could have, should have been more than a grocery clerk and how a moral man reacts when presented with not-so-moral opportunity in a seemingly corrupt world.I was expecting a story that would grab and hold my attention. While the central conflict was eventually revealed, the various tangents the narration wandered off on became too distracting to really enjoy the central core of the story. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all was the ending. I won't give away any details, but suffice it to say that when I reached the last page on my Kindle I had to go back and see if I'd missed something. It was not only abrupt but Ethan's actions seemed out of character."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I will be anxious to hear what my book club has to say, it was a sad ending. The author did create a very interesting character."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This was John Steinbeck's last novel and the one that won him a Nobel Prize for Literature. Most people acknowledge that this was not his best work (in my mind not up to the standards of East of Eden or Of Mice and Men), but as with the Academy Awards, sometimes an Oscar for lifetime achievement is merited.The story is set in an old whaling village on the tip of Long Island (think Sag Harbor), where we find Ethan Allen Hawley, descended from an illustrious local family and recently suffering from financial reverses so severe that he has taken the menial job of grocery clerk. Day after day, Hawley is bombarded by reminders of his families prosperous past and the relative poverty in which he finds himself, most annoyingly by his wife, son and daughter.Throughout the novel, Hawley plays the nave, unambitious simpleton, while at the same time engineering his return to prosperity and riches through a series of cold blooded, calculating and ruthless maneuvers. Relatively entertaining and worthwhile, it nevertheless fails to measure up to some of Steinbeck's better work."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I love this book. I am only 16 and still in high school and my incredable english teacher made us read of mice and men and I loved it so much i went and read this it is stienbeck is now my favorite author his work is just amazing if you have more than 2 brain cell you can grasp the feelings he is trying to express. my only problem is that every book he writes ends with every one dead? what is that about?"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"We're not given a real protagonist. The author cares more -- much more -- about the sacred cows of his language and metaphor than about character. Ethan Allen Hawley is a Harvard graduate and a scion of old money who goes to work as a clerk in a grocery store because his father has squandered said old money. This is in 1948, and we meet him 12 years on, still in the same grocery store, still doing menial labor, in 1960. A college graduate was still a rather rare commodity in 1948, certainly a Harvard grad. Why on earth would such a man be willing to sweep floors and stock shelves for 12 years? We are never told. Why does he suddenly awaken and become ambitious in 1960? (this is the Easter metaphor -- the old Ethan dies and a new one arises) We are never told. Why does his ambition coincide with moral depravity? We are never told.He is not only a Harvard grad, he is impossibly witty, glib, and, all of a sudden, street smart. No such person would have sat still so long, any such person could have made money in 1948-1960 without cutting corners morally to a significant degree, and no such person would be surprised that cutting corners morally in pursuit of wealth would make him feel so bad that he might not be able to live with himself.Steinbeck wanted to make a statement about the sad state of morals in 1960 America, but immorality was not unique to that time, or our time, or the late '30s (Grapes of Wrath), or the Roman Empire or the Russian Steppes or anyplace or anytime else. Immorality is the oldest story in the book, so if you want to talk about it through characters, there is no reason for doing so other than simply as an excuse to write good characters, but Steinbeck fails to do that. Margie and Joey, friends of Ethan, are also like him: ambitious and impossibly perspicacious and witty, yet somehow stuck in dead-end lives year in and year out in a dead little town. It's a silly, tiresome book, micro-smart but macro dumb dumb dumb."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I liked The Grapes of Wrath, so I decided to give this Steinbeck novel a whirl. While the book did delve deep into the characters and their personalities, the characters are completely boring and the book was a snooze fest. In fact, several times I found myself reaching for this book when I was having trouble getting to sleep some nights. Worked like a charm.The subject matter is drab, and the characters are less than enchanting. You can tell from near the beginning of the book that this \\"moral man\\" (Ethan) is eventually going to decide that succeeding in the world is more important to him than his ethics. Surprise, surprise, another fool sells his soul in the pursuit of wealth.Steinbeck is known for being a master of the English language, and I won't argue with that. The use of words and phrases in this book are obviously brilliant, however, that is ALL this book has going for it. I agree with how one other reviewer described this book as \\"a silly, tiresome book that is micro-smart, and macro-dumb, dumb, dumb\\"."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Winter is another of those books more easily appreciated at the age of 20 than at 50. I loved it as a young person, care nothing for it as an older one. I was disappointed to discover that fact. As a Steinbeck lover I'm tempted to believe Winter of our Discontent was a book written at a time when the writer was in a state of abject depression. The book lacks the usual penetrating characterization, the solid plotting and the rapier wit found in his best works.Here, Steinbeck's character, an old 'founders' family descendant, finds himself in a moral turmoil. He struggles and comes up lacking in his own eyes. The struggle then evolves with a different type of challenge: to continue to live, or to choose death as an alternative to imperfection, of being a flawed human being."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"In an example of what great writing can be, Steinbeck has created a modern morality tale of sorts. In it their are no &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; guys, just people who are the victims of their own demons and desires. No one comes out a clear winner...but then does anyone in real life?"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"i found this to be a very disappointing book from an author of steinbeck's quality. the characters are paper thin. what drives the protagonist from good to evil is unclear at best. yes his family wants more from him, but who doesn't face that. the interesting point is that as he turns on the townspeople, many of them, as a result of recognizing his goodness, begin to reward him. this particularly true of the two characters he damages the most. then, even after he learns what they have done for him, he appears to feel no remorse. only after his son shows the same traits does he overreact and attempt something totally unexpected. what saves him is the integrity of his daughter.all of this seems contrived. i had no strong feelings for any of the characters. they are driven by greed with no regard for their fellow man. ethan hawley, who appears to be above the rest in the beginning, ends up the worst of the lot.bottomline, this is low quality steinbeck. why waste your time here when you can read \\"east of eden\\", \\"the wayward bus\\", \\"grapes of wrath\\", or many of his short novels."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Put me in mind of places and situations I've seen. Seemed to drag on though. Hard read with all the line chasing and pet names."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book is short, but it seems to plod along. It feels forced, as though Steinbeck was straining to write about normal people when possibly he couldn't relate to them anymore. The characters are O.K. But nothing like the characters in the other books I have read by him thus far: Grapes, Eden, Cannery and the Pearl. Basically I was disappointed. However, I will still seek out more Steinbeck to read since most of the other works I have mentioned were so monumental. Every writer is allowed a dud here and there, especially one who has such an amazing track record."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I marked off many passages to read to my 16 year old son. I was dazzled by many parragraphs. That said I would not recommend he read this book. I found the story confusing and drawn out and skimmed through much of it. Read Grapes of Wrath or Cannery Row instead."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I disagree with the opinion that this work should stand as Steinbeck's finest. I do not call this work a poor one; in some ways, it begs to be argued, it does stand out as a master-work. But it suffers fundamentally, that is, instinctively. In effect, Ethan Hawley has too many instincts that we find to be right (a heavy-handed, narrative utilitarianism not so insistent in Steinbeck's best work), but that are actually wrong (and morally wrong -- narrative epiphanies -- but, curiously, convictions of Ethan's long before his present woes in the novel). But some will say it is the point! That Ethan, to satisfy his worldly instincts, ignored his moral ones. If it is then the ending is appropriate but nothing more, the novel a long-going morality tale. I do not call it as simple as that. Yet, In the meantime, is Steinbeck-on-canvas reaching frantically for his old colors, finding them gone primary, and, as if by persistence alone, gamely imitating the best, life-colored attributes of his own far-previous writing -- his brilliant ability to create life-blood characters and a setting that a meaningful narrative, like seconds, can move carelessly through. I do not fault him! His book is thematically ambitious and thus rewarding -- untrustworthy dialogue and character devlopment/correspondence, notwithstanding. A person that I know and whose opinions are valid disagreed with me outright, so it could be that I am projecting here. But I urge you to read anything Steinbeck has written from say, mid thirties to mid-forties (b.1902), and compare it, in texture and tone of voice, to this, his late novel of the finance quandary. I really think you will note a difference."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I order many, many books from Amazon and this was the first time I was disappointed. I knew the book would not be in perfect shape, but I didn't expect it to fall apart from the first time I opened it. Each time I opened it to read, more pages fell out. Very disappointing. The book did come quickly and was packaged very well."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"There are NON-PENGUIN versions listed here; this specific listing is for a Penguin Classics version of \\"The Winter of our Discontent\\". You could have people asking for refunds from sellers who have errantly listed the non-Penguin version.If the sellers are listing non-Penguin versions then they're liable. Misrepresentation!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Steinbeck wrote this novel in the days when American Grocery stores were 94% independent single-owned stores. The hero isn't much of a hero, just a man struggling with the pressures of economic success in contrast to his moral beliefs.With over 90% of the grocery stores today being multi-store operations, we see in this book the beginnings of the Madison Avenue economy we live in today, and what has been lost in the process.At least Hawley struggled against the tide, where today it has become almost chic to lack morals, fool consumers, be the trickster guru, or market a ton of air in attractive colors and graphics.Steinbeck shows us it should be a struggle, and indeed it will be a difficult one in a cultural setting where rationalizations (&quot;It's only a crime against money - afterall!&quot;) eat away at the social requirements of honesty, decency, and respect for your fellow men and women.At the end, a symbolic clue leads the reader back to a previous chapter and obscure dialogue. Left to ponder what this really means."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"While The Winter of Our Discontent may not be the most well-known of Steinbeck's works, it certainly is one of the best. The easy, fluid style with which he writes makes the book an outstanding choice for casual reading."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"the Winter of Our Discontent is a very thought provoking, entertaining novel. Steinbeck comes through in a way much different than any of the California novels, but his message rings just as true. Ethan Allen Hawley's struggle within himself is a look into our own hearts as we strive for a better life and come to terms with our own morality. I recommend this book without reservation."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This was the first Steinbeck book I read and I'll have to read it again sometime as it is more complex than many of his earlier works. The basic dilemma that Ethan is faced with is one that all can identify with on a personal/professional level. I was surprised with the ending and the choice Ethan makes, although those who have read Steinbeck's earlier works prior to this book may not be. This book also contains the quote, &quot;The threshold of insult is intelligence and security.&quot;, which spoke volumes to me."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book is easily one of the best I've ever read, and I've read quite a few! It's captivating and it's different. It deals with middle class morality and a man's struggle with it, or is it for it? It is very profound and the style of the prose is pure 24-carat gold. This book scores very high both on subject matter and presentation. Vintage Steinbeck!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Without doubt, one of the finest in the Steinbeck pantheon. A wry, delicately written novel of intense moral conviction made all the more effective by not making a moral pronouncement. A haiku poem in novel form. Recognition at last by the Nobel committee of the greatness of Steinbeck as a writer."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I've read this book probably 20 times over the previous 20 years. I have never been disappointed in what Steinbeck has to say to me at each reading.
