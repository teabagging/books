Well researched and covers all aspects of the sad life of Howard Hughes: early life, aviation, Hollywood, etc. Such a sad life! Kudos to whoever designed the sleek book cover! It immediately caught my eye, and turned out to be the best book I've read on Howard Hughes, a most fascinating man."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I reccomend this book. As a lifelong Hughes enthusiast, I found this book to be very informative, believable and enlightening. Hughes' life was one-of-a-kind and the author seems to have done quite a bit of research. I am not disappointed, in fact, I am delighted to learn some of the things about Hughes that I always thought of as being myth and/or speculation are just that or are not."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"For those who are fans of the mystery man Hughes, this volume is consuming. Many more subjects investigated by the writers leaving behind many more unanswered questions. Volume two must be on the way."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"i couldnt put it down, it is SO interesting and they add so much information in such an interesting way, you dont feel like you're reading a biography it truly feels like a novel its beautifully written."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I watched Martin Scorsese's \\"The Aviator\\" and was immediately interested in learning about the \\"real\\" Howard Hughes. This book more than satisfied my curiosity. I wasn't aware of the non-aviation contributions made by Hughes; satellites, seek and destroy missles. All very important to our national security. I had never heard of Hughes' connection to the Watergate scandal until I read this book.This publication was a page turner about a man that we'll most likely never learn the full truth about. A great read!"},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I had read an earlier book on Hughes, Empire: The Life, Legend, and Madness of Howard Hughes, and remembered it as a fascinating book. I purchased recently this newer book on Hughes, Howard Hughes: The Untold Story.It, too, was fascinating in its own National Inquirer kind of way! This particular book dealt more with Hughes' womanizing more than with his business empire. We are treated with endless stories of Hughes' conquest of Hollywood actress beginning in the early 20's up until his final pursuit of women in the late 1950s.The stories are truly fascinating to read and Brown's and Broeske's writing style certaining kept me engaged. One just has to wonder how one would have acted in Howard's place as he pursued women on a daily basis while in Hollywood. Simply amazing!The one drawback about this book that I was not anticipating was what made it so interesting: its dedication to his lothario lifestyle. In other words, by the time the story of Jean Peters (his last wife) rolls around, along with his last attempted affair with the starlet Yvonne Shubert, one starts to tire of reading exclusively about his sexual conquests.I found myself wondering how all of this tied in with his businesses. The authors did throw in just enough about his businesses for it all to make sense, but I don't think there was enough. In other words, this book dealt almost entirely with his sex life than anything else. There were enough tidbits about his paranoia, his germophobia, his Hollywood movie making, and his aviation exploits to keep the book moving.I recommend this book to read about the personable side of Howard and the book, Empire, to read about the business side of Howard. Both are excellent."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I first picked up a copy of this book a few years ago. Since then, I have found it hard to put down. Broeske and Brown make an excellent pair of writers and their descriptions and depictions seem to flow off the page and into life once again. Though Howard Hughes first made his mark on history and then died long before I was born, I feel almost as if I am a bystander for each of his accomplishments simply by reading this book.My copy of the book is well-worn, dog-eared, and well-loved now. I still enjoy the book every time I read it. It is, truly, a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"It definitely covers his personal life, and mental illness, but comes up a little short on the business side of things. Chronologically it jumps around a bit, and can get a little confusing, but overall a well written book."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"After finally watching the Aviator, I wanted to know more about Howard Hughes' life but wasn't sure which book to get since there were so many out there to choose from. The Untold Story turned out to be one of the most moving books I've read. I previously only knew him according to the reputation he had in his final years: bizarre recluse, deranged, weirdo, bilionnaire.Howard Hughes was an ace pilot. The 200 ton Spruce Goose was his personal triumph. This books brings to light his outlandish reality and his extraordinary and adventurous personal life: the many movies he produced, and his amazing influence on Hollywood censorship, purchasing the most Las Vegas resorts owned by one person, the McCarthy era, even Watergate and the fall of Nixon. It covers the many famous actresses he discovered, his womanizing and dating nearly every leading glamor queen. Jean Harlow, Ava Gardner, Giner Rogers, and Katharine Hepburn all dated this handsome playboy. It explains his passion of aviation, perilous record breaking flights as well as his three plane crashes, and his development of commercial flights (TWA). Howard Hughes was a genius inventor and head of a giant corporation which produced oil drill tools (which he inherited from his father). The book reveals his emotionally incestuous ties to his mother. his addictions, breakdowns and recoveries, disappearing acts such as when he locked himself in a studio room, didn't bathe for months, and watched the same movies 30 times in a row, eating only Hershey bars. His now-famous but then unknown obsessive-compulsive disorder produced full blown food fetishes such as counting chocolate chips in each germ-free cookie and eating his peas with a small rake. Who knows what might have happened, and how history might have changed, if doctors knew about Prozac in those days?The circumstances of his death remain mysterious and puzzling - to this day, no one is sure about how he died. Like his life, it was covered in a wall of secrecy. A compelling, sympathetic, and well-researched story (nearly 400,000 pages of court documents, 2,000 pages of FBI reports, and 600 interviews were used) about one of the most controversial, intriguing and extraordinary people."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I first read this book to see what Howard Hughes was all about. I was not disappointed in the writing or information. It was well written and a page turner.I read bio books to learn more about the personal side of people - their lives & feelings/views on matters, how they handled personal situations more than just facts of their accomplishments. So therefore, this book was a great fit for me.A few reviews have said the book should have focused more on the specifics of how he handled his business affairs. This to me would be much more boring. There is just enough details of how and why he came up with his inventions, mechanics of flying, and drive to make profits without putting us to sleep.Enjoy a great read and learn about a fascinating person at the same time!"},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"The authors Brown and Broeske take on the task of illustrating the life of the complex Howard Hughes with zest and gusto. This work isn't something you read, but rather are strapped into and taken along for a jolting ride into Howard's aerial adventures and mishaps, his numerous romantic firestorms ranging from Jean Harlow to Jean Peters, the serpentine dealings within his private organization, and the genius of his business and industrial accomplishments in the face of disaster and financial bankruptcies. This is a book I honestly could not put down until it was completed, and then longingly wished for another chapter."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"This is a wonderful biography. The details of Howard Hughes' childhood days, love life with all of the major starlets of Hollywood, & his personal struggle with drugs, paints a terrible tragedy. You definately understand the man & the drama of his times much better. A book not to be put down easily."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I've been obsessed with Howard Hughes since I was little - yeah, I was a weird kid. I just couldn't imagine anyone living the way he did in later years. This is a big book, and goes into depth about Hughes personal & professional lives. Most of the time, you got enough detail, and the book moved along well, but a few times I would have liked to have known more (though the lack may have been due to the fact that so little is known about some details of Hughes life). It's such a sad story about an interesting character - I can't help but wish he was alive now, when medical knowledge could have helped him & improved his life dramatically & who knows what else he could have accomplished."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I am almost finished reading the book, \\"Howard Hughes: The Untold Story,\\" and I must say, this book (Howard's life) is certainly a page turner. It is clear that Howard Hughes was a lot of things: Manipulative, Egocentric, Playboy and Eccentric! He was also, after reading most of the book about his life, NEVER BORING. Not for one second. Every moment in his life is so meaty and juicy you would think it was a written Soap Opera, meant to stimulate the viewer at every moment and increase ratings, but it's not. It's just Howard being Howard.Howard Hughes spent most of his life in close proximity to his mother. The woman, who many believe, smothered and later caused his bizarre behavior in regards to germs and illnesses. She bathed him from head to toe and regularly inspected his body for any signs of infection or sickness. Howard Sr, realizing the dangerous bond between his son and wife, tried to seperate the son and mother pair by sending Howard away to school and camps. Howard didn't put up much of a fight. In fact, even though he was a recluse, he tried his best to fit in at the camp and the school he attended. He told his mom on many occassions, that he looked forward to the new skills he was learning at the camp. His mom, however, eventually pulled him out of the camp after writing many letters and warning Howard of the dangerous germs floating around in the camp. She had believed that scaring Howard in these letters would result in his return home, however, Howard very much wanted to stay. It was his mother who pulled him out eventually.From Howard Sr., Hughes learned many things which would cause him to be the talk of the town in Hollywood. Howard Sr. made it abundantly clear to his son that everything is for sale. In one case, Howard Sr. paid to enroll his son in a school that only accepted 60 students per year. 60 was the cut off and under no circumstances would the Directors of the school allow that to change. Senior cared less, he payed off all the right people and his son would join the only class to allow 61 students to attend. Howard Sr. didn't just teach Hughes to buy his way through life, Hughes also became a womanizer just like his father. Hughes was very well aware of the fact that his father cheated on his mother regularly and the his mother knew about it. He also knew the heartbreak it caused his mother after reading a letter from his mom to his father, asking that he stop. Hughes never stopped and his wife died in her 30's. Howard Sr. death soon followed.Howard was devastated. This devastation didn't stop him from fighting for the wealth that belonged to him. He fought family members, headed to court and convinced everyone around him that he was ready to inherit the family company even though he was just a kid. With his new wealth, Howard headed to Hollywood and aimed to become a Top Producer and Avaitor.Howard spent most of his life in the air, chasing beautiful starlets, creating movies and taking aviation to the next level. He was a daredevil in every aspect of his life.Too many, Howard seemed to have the world in the palm of his hands. However, Howard struggled with a terrible secret. He had what many didn't understand at the time and something that just wasn't discussed: OCD. His symptoms worsened with age and with the many car and plane crashes he had in his life. Also, one can not discount the amount of stress that poor Howard struggled with on a daily basis. It is clear to me that this stress pushed Howard's symptoms to uncontrollable levels! Also, the book makes clear, that the discovery that the FBI had been following his every move for the past 5 years increased his distrust of others.I haven't finished the book yet but I can't wait to finish reading about Howard's amazing life. Like I said before, this man is clearly far from boring. I would definetely enjoy living life in his shoes even if I had to deal with OCD. This man did it all and was clearly a genius. God rest his soul and thank you Howard for your many contributions to aviation!"},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I could not put it down.

I believe that it's the money that they all so fond of. Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money. Howard wasted enough money for everyone."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I came across this book shortly after seeing Scorsese's \`The Aviator', and I can't imagine a better source for those wanting to know more about Howard Hughes. Although the movie may seem fantastic, this book shows an even more outlandish reality. A small example: not only did Hughes restrict himself to a few standard meals, like the steak and peas seen in the movie, but he used a special rake-like utensil to separate out, and discard, any peas above a certain diameter. The film also tones down his womanizing: apparently he slept with almost every screen sex symbol of the 30s and 40s, as well maintaining a private harem of starlets. And there are whole aspects of his life I had no idea about, like his links with Nixon and Watergate. Despite his eccentric, sometimes cruel, behaviour, the authors maintain their - - and the reader's - - sympathy for Hughes. This sunk in when the book reached his infamous final years. Although I'd started out eager to know the truth about the mad hermit at the top of the Las Vegas hotel, by the time I reached that stage I felt sorry for him and was reluctant to read the sordid details. Here again the book gets the balance right; insightful without wallowing in freakishness.A compelling, well-researched and sympathetic story of an extraordinary subject: you can't ask for much more from a biography."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I read this book in hardcover years ago and loved it. It dispelled a lot of rumors about Hughes and gave this man's life the treatment he deserved, not to be defamed after death.It talks about his womanizing, OCD, and passions for aviation and film. It is a totally comprehensive book. No stone is left unturned. You will leave this book with a great respect and admiration for the man which I did and continue to have. A must read on HH!! A+++++"},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"Hughes was a man who accomplished most of what he did before my time, so I've only remembered him as a billionaire, eccentric, and recluse, before reading this book. During his time he was a go-getter who tried many adventurous things professionally and both personally and privately.This book brings to light the details of of the younger Hughes' extraordinary personal life, which I found more interesting than the business side of it. He spent notable time in Southern California and Los Angeles. Many tales bring Old Hollywood and Los Angeles to light. His involvement in the movie business producing films, influenced in part, as an avenue to get to the ladies of the screen. Details of his relationships with the stars of the day are illuminated. Taking dates to the mounted cross atop one of the Hollywood Hills, overlooking the flatlands and lights of LA. He even crashed a plane into 3 houses in Beverly Hills.His 3rd plane crash, occurred while performing a flying stunt during the shooting of a movie (the stunt pilots refused to do the stunt because they considered it too dangerous). As a result of that crash he was in the hospital with critical life-threatening injuries. This was when HH was introduced to Codeine for the severe pain, something he would become addicted to for most of the rest of his life.The book later progresses in the latter years of Hughes. Today, it is apparent to contemporary psychologists that Hughes was likely suffering from a form of the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Nowadays, OCD is more understood and highly treatable with medication. In HH's time, it was not thought of in biological and physiological terms.Hughes' first break came when he entered a screening room and stayed in it for 5 full months. He didn't bathe, watched the same movies 30 times over, and survived on a diet of candy bars. Hughes consciously and voluntarily turned over his business affairs to competent managers. These were employees, and were people who made prudent decisions and looked out for HH's best interests. During this time, other sharks started to gather. Such is the case when large amounts of money is involved. Bill Gay, one of Howard's chauffeur, made crafty and cunning political moves to ascend over the years. He got Howard's ear, and became more influential on him. Gay eventually took the reigns of control over Huges' wealth. He then deftly purged the other business managers who served Hughes with dedication and integrity. The former chauffeur and his fellow Mormon henchman took over Hughes and his affairs, isolated him, and squeezed out those who cared for Hughes and wanted the best for him.It's sad, for during the latter decades of Hughes life it seemed that no one was really there for him, if he had wanted anyone to to be there.In death, over one thousand--yes, 1000--people came out of the woodwork to lay claim to Howard Hughes wealth after his passing.To this day, We're still not sure if his death was natural, self-induced, or the intentional doings of others...."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"This bio gave me a pretty good picture of Hughes' life, good enough that I don't feel a strong need to read any other bios. However, the authors don't really deliver everything they promise in the introduction. Yes, you'll learn that he built one of the nation's greatest airlines, founded an industry-leading aircraft company, became a leading defense contractor, became a major player in Las Vegas, indirectly contributed to the Watergate scandal, had shady dealings with the FBI, CIA and DoD, and much more. But you won't learn how; I guess we're supposed to take the authors' word for it. If you're looking for an examination of HH the businessman, the aviator, the inventor, the financier, or the Las Vegas tycoon, this book is very short on detail. It's clear that what really interests the authors most are 1) his love and sex life and 2) his Hollywood career and his life among the rich and famous. For every paragraph discussing his business career--which, after all, made him one of the nation's wealthiest men, and which constitutes a unique and fascinating story all by itself--you'll find 3 paragraphs about which movie stars he was wooing in 1948, where he took them for dinner, who sat next to them at the restaurant, what kind of flowers he gave them, what lies he told to get them in the sack, how much jewelry he gave them, what their mothers thought of Hughes, and the contents of their love letters.Hughes' obsessive womanizing was an important part of his life, and makes an interesting story. However, there were a LOT of women, and with a few exceptions, he treated most of them essentially the same way. We see the same sad story of obsession, manipulation and heartbreak (for the women, not HH) over and over again. My eyes glazed over more than a few times while reading this. I think the book could have been much better with a little less detail about the lovers' quarrels, and a little more about the many other activities that made Hughes such a brilliant and controversial figure."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"This book provides a relatively sympathetic portrait of Hughes that heavily emphasizes his personal life versus his business dealings. The book appears to have been well researched and provides a startling new (at least for me) explanation of Hughes' mental breakdown during his middle and later years. I liked this book because it maintained its focus on the man rather than getting mired with his business transactions, the myriad of business associates, etc. You get a more 3-dimensional picture of his personality/character rather than the usual depictions of him just being a crazed, ruthless man."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"Howard Hughes died when I was only 12 so I knew next to nothing about him prior to the &quot;recluse&quot; years and I found this book extremely interesting. History has dealt somewhat harshly with HH but this book managed to shed some sympathetic light on the mysteries surrounding him. His strange relationship with his mother, his drive to control and collect, his grand scale successes and equally grand failures touched a chord with me. How sad to have so much but ultimately be so unfulfilled and lonely. Whether you find him an eccentric genius or a man tortured by mental illness, you must agree he left behind a significant legacy.The only minor complaint I have with this book is chronologically it was occasionally hard to follow since a chapter regarding business deals would then be followed by a chapter on personal affairs that were conducted during the same period of time. It was easy to get confused regarding timeframes."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I must admit I didn't know too much about Howard Hughes until my husband made me sit through the movie \\"The Aviator.\\" I personally found the movie to be quite boring; however, it piqued my interest to find out more about Howard Hughes. After reading all the reviews on the various books, I chose this one (Howard Hughes: The Untold Story). It was very difficult to put the book down; it tells a most fascinating life story. Hughes' life was unbelievable; he should have died several times before he even turned 30! Definitely an interesting and entertaining book."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"It's amazing how much living Howard Hughes packed into his life. He bedded just about every movie star and starlet of his era. He made gazilions of dollars from his tool company. This book also details the sad end to his life, which it attributes to his brain being scarred from syphilis, his obsessive compulsive disorder, his brain injuries from numerous plane crashes, and being hooked on pain killers. It seems business associates surrounded him, destroyed his will which probably left his money to his medical research charity, and hastened his death by keeping him dehydrated, hungry, and overdosed on liquid codeine. Read the book!"},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"\\"The Aviator\\" inspired me to take another look at Howard Hughes. The movie told a story only possible in America, the 20th Century in particular. Utterly amazing, I was on the lookout for a book on Hughes' life. I don't think I could have started with a better portrait of Hughes than the one painted here by Brown & Broeske. Wisely, they have told Hughes' story with a realism and attention to detail that allow the facts to speak for themselves. Hughes life was so extraordinary that any attempt to sensationalize it is redundant and suspect. I found such amazing scenes from the \\"Aviator\\" as the crash at Beverly Hills in 1946 to pale in comparison to the event as it is described in this book. As hard as it is to put down, I also found this easy to read in bursts as my schedule allows. So dramatic and fascinating at every turn, if it has to be put down, one never forgets where they left off.Who would ever want their personal lives investigated, picked over, revised and speculated upon, and then transformed into countless books and a movie or two? This American fascination with everyone's business but their own has made anyone considering a public life to factor in what such a wholesale invasion of their privacy is worth. Just because it is written or said is no guarantee it is true and once it starts there is no stopping it. This is a story of a man as he runs like hell to stay one step ahead of the forces that feed off but threaten to consume his uniqueness. Like many who seek fame, Hughes would pour gasoline on the fire and then run from it. For all the contradictions in Howard Hughes' life, it is hard to imagine how much more drama, danger, triumph and extraordinary achievement could be crammed into a just one. \\"HH, The Untold Story\\" could almost just as easily be about what Hughes was never able to accomplish in the second half of his life as a result of his own weaknesses compounded by the target fame and fortune paints on your back when you weren't looking. The authors are fair and compassionate in telling the good and bad in this life. The medical issues that complicated matters worse were not fairly represented in what I have read about Hughes in the past. I finally have a sense of Hughes as a human being and individual. For all the neurotic fear of germs, this was one tough customer. He had many lives and should have died and gone broke time and again if he didn't possess such a remarkable resilience and determination powered by a self confident, brilliant intellect. The 20th Century was his time and he didn't waste the opportunity. Hughes makes Bill Gates look like a wimp, coward and a crashing bore by comparison. With the uncertainty surrounding how the people around him took control of his life and affairs in his last years, the contrast between the deceit and greed driving Hughes' \\"caretakers\\" and what motivated Hughes to live such a dynamic life is startling. It would be too easy for this to be another book about a wild, eccentric madman. Instead it is a fascinating and true to life tale of ambition, genius, imagination and desire and everything that comes along with these things when someone believes that action speaks louder than words. As grand as his life was, Hughes still gave more than he took. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"It's a fascinating story as it traces the life of Howard Hughes from childhood to his death. But it's almost entirely about the women that he chased and almost nothing about the companies that he built and ran. After reading this and seeming to learn about every woman that he ever met, I am left wondering how he ever found time to actually do any work for the companies that he owned - TWA, Hughes Aircraft and the RKO movie studio. I'm sure that can't be quite right, so I'm left thinking that there is still an awful lot missing from this story."},{"Title":"Healing Miracles Great and Small: Living Proof of the Success of Alternative Medicine","review":"After reading this book I am inspired for two reasons.

Secondly, I have been a practicing Chiropractor for over twenty years, and these stories keep me inspired to continue practicing my profession. Though these stories are about real healing miracles they are easy and fun to read. Dr. Rude is a phenomenally talented healer yet very humble considering all the lives he has saved.

You'll love the real-life stories, too."},{"Title":"The Last Dinosaurs","review":"I had no idea what to expect based on the title of Ms. Calvani's book. Readers will discover its pertinence soon enough as they dive into the pages. Dark and quirky humor coupled with quixotic characters adds to the surprising mix found in The Last Dinosaurs.27 year old Daniella Carlier is a naieve architecture student living and working in Puerto Rico. Her ex-husband Ismael is a starving artist turned art critic turned hotel owner now married to a much older woman not-so-fondly known as Lady Dracula. Daniella and her new boyfriend Tony share a small studio apartment with her beloved Turkish cat. Despite his use of several illegal drugs, Tony is a gorgeous male animal, another starving artist who will soon become the new wunderkind of art connosieurs. Daniella often wonders how she got involved with such an unusual group of people, likening those around her to carnivores from the Mesozoic era - dinosaurs who gobble up everyone and everything in their wake.Several odd mysteries are threaded through Daniella's everyday life. Ismael's elderly rich wife looks more like vampire than woman as she struggles to regain her youth by unusual means. Someone dubbed El Zorro is terrorizing Puerto Rican women who wear mini skirts by carving Zs in their behinds. And strange happenings at Ismael's specialty hotel leave Daniella troubled. These mysteries and assorted plot twists are guaranteed to keep readers guessing until the last page.The Last Dinosaurs may well be one of a kind as stories go. I've never read a book remotely like it. Everything from the humorously weird to the acutely macabre can be found between these covers, and then some. It may not be fare for sensitive adolescents and adults, but there is no bad language or explicit sex. If you're tired of the same old genre fiction, consider giving this one a try."},{"Title":"The Last Dinosaurs","review":"Mayra Calvani, The Last Dinosaurs (Amber Quill Press, 2004)It's pretty hard to be an Internet-enabled, or even Internet-aware, book geek these days and not know the name of Mayra Calvani, a Puerto Rican author now residing in Belgium who's a regular contributor to Blogcritics. I knew she'd written a few books, but had never got round to reading one, so I decided to rectify that problem with The Last Dinosaurs. I found it enjoyable enough, though it did try to do too much in too confined a space for it to be as effective as it wanted to be.Plot: Daniella is an architecture student living with her boyfriend and her cat in a small apartment. The two of them are still friends with Daniella's much older ex, Ismail, now married to the predatory seductress nicknamed Lady Dracula and in the process of opening a hotel stocked with exotic animals he's having smuggled in from other countries. Daniella finds herself struggling to deal with Tony's increasing drug use, attempts by both Ismail and his wife to seduce her, weekly lunches with her mother and, to top it all off, a masked character stalking the streets at night and attacking women wearing miniskirts.All of which doesn't sound like a comedy, but that was Calvani's chosen genre here. Main genre, anyway. The book also tries to delve into mystery, supernatural horror, political satire, and thriller territory. A tall order for a book running three times the length of this one, an impossible task here. Still, what's here is amusing enough, if it feels more like an outline than a full novel, and Calvani's narrative voice is engaging and fun; this wasn't quite a success, but it shows enough potential to bring me back for more the next time I get a chance. **"},{"Title":"Madhouse -","review":"This book explores the inner workings of the Clinton White House, exposing the way in which the President works and handles his affairs. Through the stories of the people who helped him get to the presidency, this book has shown me a side of Mr. Clinton I never knew existed, and which frankly does not seem too likeable. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to learn more about the way in which this President goes about governing. It is also a good reference as far the White House regarding the way it works. Kudos to Mr. Birnbaum for writing such an interesting description of the current administration!"},{"Title":"Madhouse -","review":"Each of the White House staffers in this book are presented as having taken their position with the hopes of making a difference. it didn't take long for each and every one of them to realize that they were just pawns in the game. The book mentions that the average tenure of a staffer is only 12 - 18 months, and if all staffers are treated as poorly those in this book were treated, it is obvious as to why they choose to move on. The upside to the jobs? Each of them went on to a more lucrative position after leaving the White House. If you can put up with 12 - 18 months of misery, you can write your own ticket. They all had to be aware of that when they started, so it's had to feel too bad about what they had to go through in order to be able to add 'White House Staff' to their resume."},{"Title":"Madhouse -","review":"Perhaps a little disheartening to fans of the television show, the real executive staff at the White House have, unfortunately, a self-defeating position...for all the idealism and motivation to govern well, most administrations achieve very little of their agenda and what they do achieve is typically a bitter battle that leaves the scorned bodies in it's wake. Such is the overriding message with \\"Madhouse\\". In it Jeffrey Birnbaum extols the exacting frustration of six White House staffers of the Clinton presidency and by doing so disillusions those who think that the Executive branch is a seamless operation.\\"The upper level and mid-level staffers who are the subject of this book are, more than anyone else, responsible for translating the president's vision into action.\\" So states Birnbaum in the introduction, but we soon discover that this somewhat overarching task involves a lot more \\"skin\\" than most are willing to spend. \\"But in the end, the reality of their day-to-day existence is surprisingly different from their anticipation, and it is harsh. The White House turns out to be far less potent and immensely less forgiving than any outsider can conceive. A staffers' best effort never seems good enough. And that is a crushing blow to the many good people who go to work for the president.\\"We follow these six aides (Chief lobbyist Howard Paster, Media Affairs chief Jeff Eller, Policy advisers Gene Sperling and Bruce Reed, Press Secretary Dee Dee Meyers and political consultant Paul Begala) through the very beginning of their service following the Clinton inauguration in 1993. To a man (and woman) the common theme here is chaos. \\"Bill Clinton, a newcomer to Washington, had a radically impaired view of what he could actually accomplish. He severely underestimated the potency of the forces arrayed against him on several fronts.\\" Because of this, the staff quickly becomes aware of the grinding albatross that is the Federal government. Sixteen to eighteen hour days become the norm. They realize that they are not \\"striving warriors or visionary leaders\\" and soon maintain a posture \\"in a defensive crouch, waiting for the next crisis to erupt...\\". Some work against each other (Sperling and Reed) and others become disenchanted with issues like the age old problem of diversity (certainly self-proclaimed by any administration) whereby Dee Dee Meyers is led to resent the \\"man's club\\" that is prevalent throughout the White House. In the end, all six become disillusioned and burned out, eager to get back to life less strenuous.A telling testament to the crushing realities of the Federal government, Jeffrey Birnbaum manifests a remarkable \\"behind the scenes\\" story that's sure to be eye opening to those who think government and particularly the White House have a non ending glamour...this book shows how progress in government is agonizingly stagnant and how even seemingly brilliant people can't change it."},{"Title":"Madhouse -","review":"This book is an interesting look at 6 different mid level White House staff during the first two years of the Clinton administration. The book is not a review of the first two years, just a focus on what it is like for these six people. The first thing that I thought was just how much these people work, 7 days a week and 90 plus hours is the norm, it is no wonder they burn out after year or so. Other then that bit of info, for me there really was nothing all that new about the book. It basically described that fact that these jobs are very difficult, unforgiving and at times not very fun.One gets a kind of hopeless feeling at times reading this book as many of the people covered seam to at times. This is probably the best part of the authors work in that he was able to convey just how hard it was working under so much stress in a very unorganized situation and constantly being attacked. I think I have a better appreciation for the people that do the work that goes unnoticed in all White Houses. The book is somewhat interesting and not badly written, it just does not give the reader that much new info and it is limited to only the view of these six people."},{"Title":"The Golden Book of Colonial Crafts (#31139)","review":"70 great crafts and projects for the inventive person.

One set does a good job of portraying a bullying wayward youth and his aimless follower, while the other very high-end, hitting banks and armored cars, and is rooted in Resnick's past. Harvey effectively cuts back and forth between the present and 1981 in order to show the past events and characters. As usual, the private lives of the police squad is further developed."},{"Title":"Wasted Years","review":"This book is so much better written than 99% of the genre that it seems a pity to criticize it. However... there is a problem. The author uses characters' consumer choices as little labels. One person eats a Linda McCartney meal, another listens to Lionel Ritchie. You can't help but feel that he is laughing at them. Not so Resnick who has impeccable taste. Near the end a bad character hops into bed with a Jeffrey Archer novel.

This book has more information about the mythology of religion than any source I have ever heard of. The only possible drawback is whether all of the information is authentic.Fascinating book!"},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"The author presents a well detailed, comprehensive overview over the fact of ancient religions and beliefs influencing modern ones. He also speaks on how \\"God\\" used to be goddesses and how man changed the preference to a male deity. It is amazing how most individuals have no idea how their beliefs have been shaped by prior ones. Get this book and you'll be amazed."},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"Harwood's book presents an interesting yet somewhat flawed overview of the historical roots of both the Judaic and Christian biblical religious tradition. Indeed, the author introduces extra-biblical precedents for myths that parallel many of the stories and legends central to belief in modern contemporary Judaism and Christianity.On the one hand, the book succeeds in reducing Christianity to nothing more than another in a long list of pagan mystery religions. Only the ethnicity of the deity has undergone revolutionary change; \\"god\\" is no longer of Babylonian, Egyptian, Persian or Greek descent. Rather, in Christianity, the savior-god is Jewish. The author shows that in no other aspect can Jesus or the religion founded in his name be considered unique.On the other hand, the book is not so successful in its attempt to discredit the essence of Judaic belief. While creation, flood myths, etc. are shown to have their precedent in earlier pagan traditions, the radical departure of the concept of god from the pagan to the Jewish tradition is never addressed. The author fails to show that in all too many aspects the God of the Jews was essentially unprecedented. Evolving over time, Yahweh became and remained unique.Nevertheless, despite its flaws and oversights, the book serves, in part, as an adequate introduction to the historical background of the biblical world.A note of caution: The anti-Christian and anti-Jewish literary tone of the book might well be offensive to some readers. It is quite apparent that the author harbors intense anger perhaps as a result of his own research which he admits culminated in the shattering of his religious faith."},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"I read this book as a freshman in college in '98. I worked in a library on campus and thought it would be an interesting read. It was, and thought provoking. But with that said this book is not \\"great\\" nor important. I believe the author believes his own theories a little too much. He also comes across as very angry which dimenishes the enjoyment of readimg this book, but over all it does has some interesting views. The Bible has a lot of codes ands is open to interpretation. Lets also remember how lots of people have added there own spins and omissions to the Bible for whatever reason. 2 stars"},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"Its an interesting read, but far from scholarly, and I certainly would never use it as a reference in a scholarly discussion. However, the humor makes it worth the price. But back to criticism...One of the frequent quotes cited from Harwood is on the physical appearance of a historical Jesus. He paraphrases an impossible to verify 'work' of Josephus. But even the Testimonium Flavianum, which is another Josephus passage of far more credibility has proven itself an unlikely source of extra-biblical Christian evidence, and probably a pious interpolation. Yet in Harwood's mind this and far less compelling conjecture is good as gold. I'd recommend the interested reader find a decent translation of the meagre texts drawn upon by scholars and would-be scholars and make their own judgement. Still, unless some great archaeological discovery is made in the future, there's very little to be added to Abrahamic scholarship that isn't composed as simple polemic."},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"This is a FANTASTIC book!"},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"Harwood brings to the fore very valuable information about the name Yahweh that Yahwist hail as the sacred name extracted from theories about YHWH. His information that Yahweh was a female goddess would be more acceptable if the overall focus of his book was not anti-god and anti-Jesus. Scholars know that Yahweh was a borrowed name and confess that Ehyeh (pronounced &quot;I-AH&quot;) was the original saced name now in the KJV as LORD. Now, scholars and Bible researchers cannot quote Harwood's work unless at the same time they give credence to his hate-mongering about Jesus. With one stroke of the pen Harwood wipes both Yahweh and Jesus into the trash, which is his purpose. For those of us looking for historical facts on God and Jesus his book is not a resource. Atheist will dance and the Agnostics will swoon, Harwood has destroyed the Gods at least in his mind. Perhaps he could have accomplished his goal (converting people to anti-god), if his book was a bit more scholarly. Now, even those with brains will read, grin, and then thow it away with other novels."},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"William Harwood is refreshingly candid in this historical treatment of the bible as mythology and propaganda. It will shock and offend those not ready to deal with stark historical realities and frank observations. This book is free of the euphemisms and niceties usually superimposed on biblical material. As a student of history myself, I put 'Mythology's Last Gods' on my must-read list for anybody with serious intrest in biblical history and literary criticism. This book lays bare closely-guarded facts that various clericalist heirarchies have hidden from the view of their flocks for centuries in place of dogma and articles of faith. Harwood has undertaken a monumental task - necessarily an uphill battle - but with this book, at least done much groundwork. Love it or loathe it, you will not look at the bible the same again after reading 'Mythology's Last Gods.'"},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"I have read this book twice and keep returning to it for reference; however, something about it bothers me each time. I am fascinated by Harwood's \\"methodology of history\\" applied to Biblical texts normally evaluated with inductive theological methods. Unfortunately, the author approaches his subject with undisguised anger for the perceived frauds perpetrated on him by the religion itself. I am sympathetic to Harwood's goals of opening out the study of Biblical texts to honest historical analysis, but his venom may have marred his objectivity. MAY HAVE... I simply don't know. I will keep returning to this book and I am glad to own it, but I would grade it higher if it was not so emotionally-charged. Perhaps Harwood's promised \\"Fully-Translated\\" Bible will be less angry."},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"If there were six stars I'd give it that.Note: It is not for the faint of heart. Fundamentalists will hate it.Mr. Harwood is neither sparing nor delicate in his presentation of the facts. But he is witty. I laughed out loud many times.Very very educational."},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"The definitive book on the history of the Bible that explores the true authors, cultures, politics and settings of both the new and old testaments. Harwood sheds light on the sources and revisions that led to the modern Bible. The depth of detail is impressive and his scholarly treatment is overwhelming and convincing. I found out everything I wanted to know and more in this one book; more than any number of others that I read. However, the validity of Harwood's findings is severely threatened by his barely hidden opinions. Apparently he was a solid Catholic until he began his thesis on mythologies contemporary to writers of the Bible. In discovering how derivative the authors were, he apparently lost his faith and takes no pains to hide it. This guy is angry at Christianity in general and Catholicism specifically. I don't blame him, but the material would have been even more convincing if his subjective viewpoint had been even slightly veiled. Still, I wish everyone would read this book; it could change the Christian world"},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"The first publisher to whom this book was submitted was convinced that it would \\"wipe out religion.\\" If it ever reaches the unlearned masses, it will assuredly do just that. It demolishes religion as totally and definitevely as the first photographs of the Martian surface demolished the \\"canals myth.\\" Nothing of comparable importance has been published in over a decade."},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"The online synopsis describes this text as &quot;utterly scholarly,&quot; yet it is the non-scholarly approach that disappoints me most about this book. While Harwood presents many interesting historical perspectives and facts about the Bible and its authors, he has several habits which make the book nearly unbearable. First, he often presents his own historical theories as fact, with little more than a footnote to let the reader know that what they're reading isn't widely accepted as the truth. Second, he often paraphrases translations of Bibilical/mythological passages to further his own arguments, making certain texts seem much more similar than they otherwise might through his chosen wording (a practice which he acknowledges in the foreward). Finally, he uses completely unscholarly language at many points, littering the text with slang, such as &quot;tupping&quot; for sexual relations. In summary, I'm very interested in the material that Harwood is trying to present -- but I was very disappointed with his approach"},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"This may be one of the most important books I've read concerning the development of the bible, Judaism, and Christianity. Starting with the origins of religious beliefs and the describing the religious culture of the ancient environment that birthed the bible, and proceeding thru to Christianity, Harwood shows how the biblical God was created and shaped thru centuries by different authors with different agendas. His information is scholarly, well researched, and generally reflective of commonly held positions within academia. The two exceptions to that would be 1) if he occasionally advances a theory, which he does indicate he is doing, and explains and defends it - in such cases he also presents the prevailing opinion so as not to misinform. 2) Obviously, scholars who hold to a fundamentalist/evangelical perspective concerning the bible will never be willing to allow themselves to acknowledge scholarly findings contrary to their beliefs. As such, they, no doubt, would disagree with much that we've learned about the origins of their sacred texts and faith.Harwood pulls no punches. I personally find that refreshing. Everyone writing about matters such as this is going to have a natural bias. My approach to trying to ascertain the truth is to be aware of any writer's bias - and the fact that Harwood himself doesn't hide his is refreshing. Further, while he clearly has a perspective, what matters ultimately is whether the case he is presenting is based on solid evidence, and is reasonable. Thus far, my review of his book and much of the material in the bibliography leads me to think that he is on very solid ground overall.Concerning recommending this book to a Christian, I think it would depend on the individual. A Christian who cares more about the truth and being honest, than their faith, who would be willing to admit that their faith has been misplaced if such is clearly demonstrated, would see that such is the case conclusively from this book.On the other hand, for most Christians, fact has little or nothing to do with it anyway. They believe that there is enough evidence to believe in things like the resurrection or the authenticity and infallibility of the bible. They believe there are no contradictions in the bible even though they've read thru it thousands of times. It is an emotional decision and a state of denial they are in, and as such, they would probably only find this book offensive.For those interested in the net summary of the origins of Christianity and the bible, and Judaism thru the centuries, this book may be the single best 1 volume overview available."},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"I myself am an atheist and strongly endorse naturalism and evolutionary biology. I'm specifically writing this review for people who share these values. Mr. Harwood's training in writing this book is purely mythology, not archeology or sociobiology or evotionary biology. The problem is he links his mythology to an outdated form of social sciences and assumes, (without evidence, as very little is referenced) that this is history. I won't bore anyone with details but I do want to give 3 main components of his outdated social sciences.1) Animals have instincts, humans don't2) Genetic causality is deterministic, environmental causality is free will3) Behavior (e.g. sexual identity) is caused by environment. Girls act like girls because that's how we raise themAll of these have since been refuted and replaced with Evolutionary psychology and sociobiology.So what bothered me about this book in particular? It's reference to social life being dominated entirely by women before 3500 BCE. All aspects of society from wars to religion to political organization were run by and developed by women. This in turn is what fueled the beginnings of religion. Everything traces back to this and it becomes a constant theme that reoccurs well past half the book. (I have to confess I but it down about half way through)For whatever reason, after 3500 BCE there was a mutiny by the men (he doesn't know why and evidence has yet to surface) and men have ruled since.This raised serious questions, which societies had role reversals? Was it as far as Greece or was it primarily in Mesopotamia? If in the animal world sexual dimorphism determines which sex dominates, what caused this reversal in Homo Sapiens? What evidence led archeologists to this sexual reversal in society?Not only do these questions go unanswered, they don't even get addressed. We are required, like religion, to accept his interpretation on a by faith bases. The books credibility was shot and it was just too difficult to weed out the good from the bad. I had to put the book down.I won't go on a rant here but I do want to summarize two other points. If I'm wrong and he's right, I'd like to check his references, however, this book is very poorly referenced. (This was noticed by another reviewer but needs to be stated again) Almost no evidence is listed and is more about the mythology (which is fine, it's what the book claims). What I don't like is hypothetical mythology dressed up as historical truths.The second point is how he addresses his theories. Matriarchies are highly controversial theories and there are much more credible, reliable theories which complement the evidence much better. At the very minimum, he needs to at least state there are other competing theories and state why he believes this one. He does no such thing. TREAT THIS PURELY AS MYTHOLOGY, NOT HISTORY!!!!!I have read some really excellent historical books and would like to suggest, The Bible Unearthed, David and Solomon, (Both by the same authors) and Who wrote the Bible? All three of these books paint a very realistic, empirical, and objective portrait that provided more insight to ancient life than this book did."},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"This book is good but could have been excellent. The author frequently makes bold assertions with no or little support, though he does support minor points very well, and has obviously researched the subject matter. I would like to see a second revised edition. Also I would like to see his translation of the Old Testament. He does not try to hide his biases, which is good but could be more scholarly."},{"Title":"Mythology's Last Gods","review":"This is an incredibly well written and more importantly, well researched book. It starts slowly with the beginning of religion, then shows how it encompasses simple themes and needs, like crop harvests and spring and winter. At times it can be stuffy and seem like the author is drifting, but he soon ties it back into religion, and ultimately leads back to Judaism and Christianity. What really sets this book apart from others is the research. Harwood constantly is tutoring the reader with research on almost every subject, for example, how a social customs of a certain period changed from an earlier custom or belief, and how it was then re-written into a biblical text, which can be shown with period writings and different versions of religous texts.A highly recommended book for anyone interested in religion."},{"Title":"Myths & Facts About Ovarian Cancer : What You Need to Know, 2nd Edition","review":"This is a well needed reference.

Artists are sellers in market. They earn their bread by selling their products, artworks.Art is a language shared by social actors. Artworks can't be read without shared code to interpret the meaning of the text. They call it as convention. Convention is established through the power relationship in the market among producer (artists), intermediary (critics) and consumer (audience).In this regard, art is just another medium like mass media. The author questions when the mass media dominates the culture, what is the status of pure art? In this vein, following questions, which have haunted the field of artistic production since the 19th century, gains renewed significance. Could art secure its autonomy as modernists dreamt of? What is the social role of art?To answer those questions, the author probes into the language and market of visual art from pop art to postmodernism. Various avant-garde movements since pop art has borrowed and exploited material, subject and strategy of mass media. In turn, mass culture has utilized the art as high culture. But the position of pure art is still restricted to institutionalized sanctuary like museum, university. It's no more than high culture protected from below. It's utilized to distinguish from others by high society. It's not clear whether artwork is different from luxury goods in its utility. Adorno's word still reverberates in the circle of artists: \\"Today, it goes without saying that nothing concerning art goes without saying, not much without thinking. Everything about art has become problematic: its inner life, its relation to society, even its right to exist\\"."},{"Title":"The Art of Paper Collage","review":"Although this book does have some good ideas, it was disappointing. It might be called &quot;The Art Of Paper Collage,&quot; but clearly the author comes from the world of scrapbooking and rubber stamping, not from the world of collage as a fine art. The examples she includes of her own work tend either toward Biblical themes or toward family memorabilia (ex: one collage is called &quot;My Dad&quot;).The writing style is oddly stilted. For example, instead of saying &quot;You will find...&quot; she chooses &quot;It will be found that...&quot; That kind of writing gets old very quickly, and should have been edited out.Explanations tend to be sparse. In the section about doing an acrylic underpainting,for example, there is very little information about how to do one, or about how to mesh the underpainting with the collage elements. There is also a strange lack of information about some tried-and-true elements of collage art, such as archival tissue and the many types of acrylic medium and acrylic modeling paste, and only a cursory look at Oriental papers, while an entire section is devoted to some new products that are of dubious value, such as glitter spray. I was dismayed, furthermore, to find that most of the products featured in that section just happen to be sold by a company the author is associated with. I ended up feeling like I had just spent a lot of money on an elaborate ad. Not only that, there is some misinformation: she claims that water-soluble polymer glues are considered archival &quot;because they are reversible.&quot; That is NOT what makes a product archival--if that were the case, kindergarten paste would be considered archival.There are other, much better, books about the art of collage out there, if you are serious about the artistic aspects of it. Look for the ones by Nita Leland and Virginia Williams, and Gerald Brommer. Both are far better written, represent a much broader range of styles, and are not nearly as commercially self-serving."},{"Title":"The Art of Paper Collage","review":"I was so inspired by the beautiful art in The Art of Paper Collage that I not only read Susan Pickering Rothamel's book cover-to-cover twice but I studied her stunning work and technique and then used them as guides to do my very first paper collage. The result was spectacular and I give Ms. Rothamel all the credit. She gave just enough direction and instruction so that I could actually construct my collage but more than that she gave me plenty of samples so that I could take a little from here and there and create something I am proud to own. I've had her book now for some months and it still sits on my artwork table so that I can wander through it when I need ideas and inspiration. I was really pleased that she included other artist's work - it gave me the opportunity to see a wide variety of styles and techniques. This book stands alone but now that I've also seen her terrific video on collage I'm even more confident of what I'm doing and am ready to tackle a more intricate piece. Wonderful book. Just wonderful."},{"Title":"The Art of Paper Collage","review":"I bought this book last Saturday on my way to a housewarming party. I was very rude and spent the whole evening holed up reading this wonderful book. I hardly talked to anyone at the party! It is a wonderful collection of collage. As a beginning collage artist, the first section about materials will really help me correct some of the mistakes I've made. The examples of Rothamel's collages sparked my creative juices so much I spent the next day (at work!) brainstorming and sketching out ideas for future collages. I loved this book; not just for the great information and the beautiful photos, but because it reinforced my desire to create beautiful collages. The gallery section was great, all the different artists with all their different styles are great examples of the diversity of art and collage. Gotta go...need to start tearing up paper....."},{"Title":"The Art of Paper Collage","review":"This book reminds me very much of Somerset Studio, a magazinewith which Ms. Rothamel has been associated - slick, beautifulpictures with very little explanation. Some sections have the mostbasic of descriptions, aimed at a collage newbie, while other areas lack almost any instruction at all and assume that you know some advanced art techniques. Who is her target market? I also found that many of the techniques lacked appropriate pictures, leaving you wondering exactly how the pictured piece was really put together.There are many of us who are not interested in the recurring Bible themes and the poor punctuation should have been immediately caught by the editor.I was not disappointed to find it a crafts book, rather than an art book, as I knew of Ms. Rothamel and her area of expertise, so was not expecting anything else.There are far better books on the market for somebody who wants to venture into the area of collage. Try Collage Art by Jennifer Atkinson, Creative Collage Techniques by Nita Leland or Collage Techniques by Gerald Brommer.

I anxiously awaited the release of her book, The Art of Paper Collage and I was not disappointed. The book is filled with page after page of full-color, glorious collage images of various types and styles. Every page made my artist's mind spin off in wild directions and it whet my appetite to try all the various techniques presented.I am not a newbie to collage but there are ideas and creations here that I've never tried before. There is even an Artists' Gallery at the back of the book that is totally delightful and if there is only one thing bad to say about this book it is that the few pages given to each artist were not enough to satisfy my longing to see more of their work.If you are a collage artist, beginner or advanced, this book will have something to teach you, to show and to tempt you.P.S.

Under unique collage making materials she covers webbing spray, mica flakes and granules, crackle medium, mica-based dry powdered pigments, glitter spray, crystal gel, and mica tiles.

I have read a lot of older collage books and they didn't help me at all, I am glad I got them at the library. This book helped me look at papers in a different way and I appreciate that. I wish she did show more step-by-step pictures. Especially when she is assembling collages. That is what is truly missing. Maybe she put too much in the book with out enough instructions.

The pictures and explanations were SUPERB, and written for both beginners and the experienced. Susan did a wonderful job, and the artists gallery was especially beautiful. This book is a great addition to anyone interested in art, collage and great writing. Highly recommeded!"},{"Title":"The Art of Paper Collage","review":"Collaging is a soothing form of self-expression. It doesn't have to be a perfect work of art, because as with any craft or art you create, it's meaning is personal. If you are interested in finding out about collage, this book is a good place to start. Though the instructions are vague in places, the general intent is clear enough to allow anyone to express themselves through this art-form.Susan Pickering Rothamel's personal style leans toward the biblical, but that doesn't mean it's something that you must incorporate in to your work. Her collages are beautiful to look at and hold meaning for her! As a bonus, there is a gallery of other collage artists at the end of the book so that you can see for yourself the difference in styles.The photographs are great and the supplies are things that you can pick up in any art supply store, even Michael's or Hobby Lobby. Don't pass up this book as a novice guide to collaging. The art presented here will inspire and delight you."},{"Title":"The Art of Paper Collage","review":"Since I first saw Susan's work in Somerset Studio I have been a fan of her amazing work!! This book was far beyond my expectations! Not only is it tremendously inspirational, but she covers so very many areas of arting! Then to top it off she is so ever generous to have a gallery of fine artists works that are so diverse &amp; charming. I will be up late tonight pouring over all the information contained in this book that is sooo remarkable! Thanks,Susan for this gift!!"},{"Title":"The Art of Paper Collage","review":"Even though I am an accomplished collage artist, I still found new techniques and suggestions in this book inspiring and accessible. The themes, although Biblical by title, conveyed the author's knowledge of techniques and material usage without dumbing-down and catering to a beginner. Chapters showing the vast variety of collage styles including montage, assemblage, non-objective and figurative collage, as well as how to do/use techniques and materials such as pochoir, paste paper, and photo transfer make this one of the invaluable books to add to any artist's library."},{"Title":"The Art of Paper Collage","review":"I had high hopes for this book from the reviews I've seen here.

It did lack some details in certain areas which was a bit frustrating but for me it was a great stepping stone to better things. The biblical themes are only Susan's interpritation of things - it allows you to do your own thing with a gentle push in the right direction.It does have a marketing angle but its not over the top like some I could mention.I will certainly refer to the Art of Paper Collage for a long time yet.

Since I already have other books by this author, I decided to try something new with my students and purchased it. Once again, I took away lessons from this book and used them with my students to create their own collages in class! They turned out so much better than we thought they would! We used some of the ideas in this book and the students produced work that so worth keeping instead of the basic cut and paste type things parents are used to seeing. The students even began using the collage \\"language\\" when discussing what they were doing! Very impressed with this book and so were my students."},{"Title":"The Art of Paper Collage","review":"I bought this book because I have been working with collages for about 5 years now and I am finally going to send my work in for publication. The book has many Biblical themes, which may turn some people off, but the work in it is beautiful. The author is very concise on what she shows you and I came away with many ideas that I wouldn't have thought of. She shows several techiques and many paper ideas to use. If you are a beginning collage artist, you will learn many things. If you are an intermediate collage artist, like me, you will get much inspiration from the techiniques and the collages themselves. A definate must have in any collage artist's library."},{"Title":"The Art of Paper Collage","review":"A great introduction to the world of collage for beginners, and an inspiration for professionals.

I do wish she would have mentioned the products by name or manufacturer. The artist gallery was very good but small. Susan Pickering Rothamel's art was very eye catching, and I was glad to know that artists do not call their works of art by &quot;Apple&quot; just because they reproduced an apple on canvas. I have seen her major works of art in museums, and am very glad to be able to have a picture of them myself, if only in a book."},{"Title":"Frank and I","review":"Frank And I was repetitive, boring and poorly written. For example, the only word used for intercourse was 'poke'. The whole book could easily be summarized as: \\"Whip her butt and poke it in.

It is wildly erotic and yet still tender. It is above all things a love story that finds virtue triumphal. It has a wonderful plot twist that prevents me from giving much information about character development. It incorporates all the elements of a good erotic tale of the period. The poor young lady is duped into taking work in a brothel and then after she makes good her escape the real story begins. If you enjoy very mild discipline, this story has one of the most arousing over the knee spanking sessions I have ever read.If you want a well written, intelligent look at the erotic writings of Victorian England, look no further than this book.

Beautifully written in the flowery language of the time, this novel captures many of the morals and values of that period, at least from the point of view of one wealthy English gentleman. Although it is not at all what one would consider a \\"transnovel,\\" it does contain a non-sexualized aspect of female-to-male cross-dressing that resolves itself about one fourth of the way in, and sadly, is never glimpsed again. However, what replaces it is more than enough to engage most any reader, even if the original \\"gender variant\\" topic was the reader's primary interest and not the \\"gender role differences,\\" \\"sexuality\\" and \\"discipline techniques\\" of a bygone era, which the story eventually and elegantly morphs into.This is a novel that speaks of a very different time, \\"the olden days where even a hint of stocking was looked on as something shocking.\\" Yet it goes well beyond that, into rich and elegant characterizations of a select group of the men and women of that time, addressing authentic feelings and attitudes in a post-Victorian culture. One might find themselves at first shocked to glimpse how children and sometimes adults of that era were disciplined through the use of corporal punishment delivered by a switch. Perhaps one might even be more taken aback by the salacious and prurient manner in which the main characters observed or even participated in what, by today's standards, would certainly be considered child abuse (or even pedophilia) delivered in a most sadomasochistic manner. However, one must realize that this is just a work of fiction, and a good one at that, and because these things did exist, one needn't feel too guilty for one's interest in such matters, even by today's much tougher standards!"},{"Title":"Catching Big Fish on Light Fly Tackle","review":"A good, solid work on the excitement of trout fishing.

This is the setting for Douglas Reeman's fourth book, as a special Royal Navy team is detailed into the Adriatic to destroy a Nazi floating drydock.The pressures and tensions of undersea warfare make this book more of a psychological thriller than some of Reeman's other titles. Nevertheless, naval warfare is still Reeman's specialty, and this book doesn't lack for exciting scenes.

One of my faves was the follow-up Magic Moscow story, \`Attila the Pun'. I loved the playful use of words, the weird culinary combinations, and the wonderful sense of fun that this new story shared with its predecessor. Throw in a goofy supernatural element- a wisecracking, really-bad-joke-reciting Hun ghost summoned from the great beyond- and you've got... well, something pretty weird and wonderful.Even though this particular book is twenty years old, I still believe it'll make for good reading for today's elementary school-age child. Fair warning, though: this book has a few things that'd be considered un-PC nowadays, including smoking (the \`Hungarian Boy Scout Lunch' chapter). It also features a bit of magical conjurings & sorcery, which has gotten the more contemporary \`Harry Potter' books emboiled in controversy with some folks. But, aside from these things, I think the book will be quite an enjoyable read for the kiddies-and for adults who like a nice, light, whimsical adventure every now and then.\`Late!"},{"Title":"Attila the Pun: A Magic Moscow story","review":"Bongo Larry for the youngest readers.

You have a ya to teen lifetime of reading pleasure.This one fits more or less in the middle, and except for the appearance of the Magic Moscow, it's one of the overall weaker entries in the canon. Probably because of the emphasis on the Attila the Pun character, rather than on a teen Pinkwater hero.So, certainly a good entry, and essential for Pinkwater completists, but not the best introduction and not the best example of the Pinkwater genius."},{"Title":"How to Buy a House in California, 10th Edition","review":"This book is the only book you will need if buying a home in California.

I was five years old when Apollo 11 landed, and, like many of that age, caught a feverish interest in space travel and the people who actually did what I dreamed of doing.I'm not saying that to claim a special expertise on the topic, but to confess that I'm far from impartial when reviewing a book like this. The fact is, I'd probably find Frank Borman's grocery list or John Young's dog's veterinary records intensely fascinating.More's the pity, since I can't say the same for Moon Shot. Other reviewers have noted that the authors seem to have been unable to make up their minds whether they were writing a history of the space program, or a joint autobiography. Because of this, it fails at both. The coverage of the space program is haphazard, focusing on the authors' accomplishments while ignoring many other significant people and events. As a biography, Moon Shot leaves much to be desired, giving little information on Shepard's or Slayton's backgrounds, reasons for becoming astronauts, etc. If you're looking for an astronaut autobiography and a detailed account of part of Project Apollo, Jim Lovell's book, Lost Moon, does a much better job of putting both in one package.Moon Shot does not go in depth into what it does cover. Instead, the major parts of each event are duly recited, and the narrative goes no further. Worse, the book breaks no new ground, either. When I bought Moon Shot, I expected that, since I would be reading recollections of people who directly participated in Project Apollo, I would be treated to unusual viewpoints and to information not readily available elsewhere. But, at no time while reading the book was I surprised. There was nothing in Moon Shot which made me say to myself, &quot;Wow, I didn't know that.&quot;Moon Shot suffers from having been published at about the same time as Andrew Chaikin's masterpiece, A Man On The Moon. At first glance, Moon Shot looks weak and inept by comparison to Chaikin's thorough historical account. This is unfortunate and unfair. While it may not be clear what the authors intended Moon Shot to be, it seems obvious that Shepard and Slayton never planned to write something on the scale of A Man On The Moon.But, even if one accepts Moon Shot for what it is - light coverage of selected parts of the authors' experiences in the space program - the book still falls short. In the world of Moon Shot, there are no serious rivalries, no harsh animosities among the astronauts, and everyone happily performs above and beyond the call of duty every day. Shepard's well-known hostile managerial style as head of the astronaut office is represented here as little more than occasional grumpiness. John Glenn's behind-the-scenes efforts to knock Shepard out of the first manned Mercury flight after the selection had been made are barely mentioned.Don't get me wrong - I have no desire to bash legends. But neither do I want to read saccharine and be told it is history. And the fact is, Moon Shot often reads more like a NASA press release than like a well-balanced account of the facts.In summary, the only positive thing I can say about Moon Shot is that it has two heroes' names on the cover. Sadly, both men passed away soon after Moon Shot was published. Too bad they didn't write a better, well deserved epitath for themselves."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"Deke Slayton and Al Shepard's book is a fine, well-written overview of the American space program. It unfortunately misses in several ways.First, the book can't decide if it's an autobiography or not. It's &quot;the inside story,&quot; but it concentrates on Shepard's two flights and Slayton's overrated Apollo-Soyuz mission. The plot is skewed towards the authors, which doesn't make sense considering it's written in the third person.I found this third-person narrative approach irritating. I almost felt as if the ghostwriters chose to describe the events in this manner so they could feed the astronauts' egos further. Apollo books often come face-to-face with the astronauts' infamous cockiness, but this book makes no attempt to hide it. Shepard described himself as a &quot;leading test pilot, astronaut, explorer, adventurer, master of wings and rocket fire, and hero to millions.&quot; All this may be true but you're not supposed to say it about yourself.It also needs more character development. It doesn't go beyond saying that Slayton and Shepard were friends. I got tired of being told outright of the friendship. I wanted to be told about it, not of it. I felt like I wanted to know the authors better, especially since they were the focus. On top of that, several crucial people such as Ed Mitchell (Shepard's lunar module pilot) are just names here- they are not given any substance.It also concocts stupid commentary for narrative purposes. For example, to get across a point the book may recount a &quot;conversation&quot; between Slayton and Shepard that is so corny as to be all but useless. This is a subtle, but unfortunate problem with this book.The final downfall of this book is its unwillingness to discuss the other Apollo missions. Apollos 15 and 16 are passed over in a paragraph-- and Apollo 17 got a whole page because the future of the program needed to be stressed to segway into Slayton's Apollo-Soyuz mission.Most importantly, this book fails to convey the magic and wonder of spaceflight. It fell victim to poor writing-- the descriptions of being on the moon were too often reduced to cliche.Here's what's good about this book. It does tell the &quot;inside story&quot; of the Apollo missions-- and does faithfully describe the missions. It serves as a decent, quick-read overview of Apollo.For the complete, longer story read Andrew Chaikin's &quot;A Man on the Moon.&quot; For a more specific, personal, and readable story of a specific mission, read Gene Cernan's &quot;Last Man on the Moon.&quot; But don't read &quot;Moon Shot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"I re-visited this book, which I read (and got autographed by Shepard) when it was new, after watching the great \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" series again. The book has its four-star moments, but I settled for three.The content is not particularly sophisticated, and to be honest, the competition among the Apollo books is strong. For example, books by Lovell and Cernan are both better than this one. Even so, it's worth reading by students of the space program for the additional perspective and occasion detail.Perhaps a root problem is that the book is a mixture of autobiography and story of the space program, with the perspective of the two astronauts not given very often. When that happened effectively, the book was at its best. I liked stories such as NASA's attempt to keep secret who had gotten the first flight, Deke's grounding, Shepard's return to flight status, Apollo 14, and Deke's reaction to the Apollo 1 fire. There are several scenes like that, enough to make the book worthwhile.In contrast, some other incidents had superfluous reference to the authors. I didn't really care that Deke and Al sort-of high-fived each other when Apollo 11 landed. Their thoughts on the end of the Apollo program or what the program really meant to them aren't really captured. Few insightful comments about the other astronauts were made (unlike Cernan's book). Many opportunities were lost.The Apollo-Soyuz mission is presented as a relatively big deal, which it was to Deke, obviously. In reality, it was pretty meaningless, other than as an exercise in international cooperation.Deke comes across pretty well in other books and in the \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" series. His character shines at times here, too. Maybe some remarks by other people about Deke, besides from Shepard, would have helped convey that image. How did others feel about how Deke ran the astronaut office, which was his core contribution to the space program? You won't find that in this book."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"This review is based on the original (1994) hardback edition. This book is much more than a history of the space program from about 1957 to 1975. It includes the inspirational determination for Shepard to fly again and for Slayton to fly even once. I had the pleasure of meeting Alan Shepard and getting his autograph on this book.The book captures the intensity of the space race. When Shepard saw Sputnik 1 (or, more probably, the upper-level rocket stage also in orbit), he chagrined at the fact that it didn't have \\"Made in the USA\\" written on it. Later, the Soviets were sad that the men circling the moon on Christmas Eve 1968 didn't have Russian names.Some seldom-discussed information is provided in this book. For instance, the US could have orbited a satellite over a year before Sputnik (p. 45). Were it not for an overcautious NASA, Shepard could have beat Gagarin into space by a month (p. 89, 91). The dog, Laika, is said to have lived for several days in space (p. 44). We now know that she died several hours after launch--from an overheated cabin.The authors discuss the politics behind the space program. For instance, the grounding of Deke Slayton had been for political and not medical reasons, as there was no evidence that Deke's heart irregularity would interfere with space flight. Rather, the fear was that, were Slayton's flight to end in disaster for any reason, his heart condition would automatically be suspected, and those who cleared him for flight would face automatic recrimination. The authors also allege that politics was behind the choice of Houston as the site for the Space Center. Both astronauts also had to contend with politics in the wake of the Apollo 13 near-disaster, notably the call, by some politicians, to cancel all remaining Apollo moon flights. Shepard also realized that, were his Apollo 14 to fail to land on the moon, there most probably would be no further Apollo flights.One is thrilled by Alan Shepard finding a surgical treatment for his Meniere's syndrome, and getting restored to flight status.

I was more than annoyed that the authors describe themselves in the third person. It just a bit childish. After reading this book, we might have the impression that Shepard and Slayton were the big heroes in the space program. Well, if you read more about space exploration history, it might be true for Slayton but Shepard has been extremely critized in the past for, among other things, his attitude toward scientists during the moon exploration.So, if you want a good overview of the space program in general, this book is probably ok. However, like some others, I would rather recommend &quot;A man on the moon&quot; or Aldrin's &quot;Men from Earth&quot; for a more extensive and accurate coverage."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"This is review is based on the Kindle edition of the 2011 revised edition.I agree with criticism from other reviewers: The book is suspended between history and autobiography, neither being achieved. Yes, there are some historical details that are interesting, but way too little of them. The autobiographical writing is so grandiloquent at times that it is virtually unreadable. But the most disquieting for me was the ad hominem criticism of those who had the temerity to express doubts about the wisdom of the manned space program. Jerome Wiesner, an eminent scientist and engineer, and JFK's science advisor, is portrayed as having \\"mumbled and fumbled\\" that the Russians were too far ahead, and, along with his \\"cronies\\" \\"wanted to gut the whole national space program.\\" Actually, Wiesner supported a space program, but of unmanned probes -- hardly the view of a reactionary. Those not endorsing full speed ahead for manned space flight are all \\"naysayers.\\" The revision adds President Obama to its ad hominem targets. Thus, the reader might start off with the intention of learning some inside scoop -- and the book does, indeed, start off that way. But by the end -- if one gets that far -- the reader knows that, in total, the book is an unabashed NASA PR piece."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"Moon Shot is a great book. An easy read with good pictures. I've already read Deke about Deke Slayton and Light This Candle about Alan Shepard. I liked those books too. I've read many of the astronaut books...check my reviews.Moon Shot gives a little run down about each of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo flights. Also Moon Shot goes a little into the Astronauts and some of the Cosmonauts lives too.We see both Deke Slayton (Air Force pilot) and Alan Shepard (Navy aviator) are super hot shot fliers and become jet test pilots. Both get secret orders to report to the new NASA. Both pass the mustard, are the best of the best and become Mercury 7 astronauts.The two themes of the book are the race between the US and Russia for space dominance and both astronauts getting grounded and their fights to get back into space. Deke had a heart fibrillation and Alan had an inner ear loss of balance disease.Alan becomes America's first man in space with his Mercury flight but then is grounded for years. He later gets an operation and is flight cleared. Deke as the head astronaut helps Alan get A moon shot. Alan trains and trains and is the commander for Apollo 14 and is the 5th man on the moon.Poor Deke never gets to go up until after he is over 50 with the last Apollo mission. By going on a vitamin regiment his heart fibrillation goes away and he is cleared by top cardiologists for space fight. He enjoys himself in weightlessness in space with the other 2 Apollo astronauts and 2 Cosmonauts in the Apollo-Soyuz docking mission.Sadly so many of my boyhood heros have passed away. Deke Slayton, Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, Ed White, Roger Chaffee, Wally Shirra, Gordon Cooper, Pete Conrad and other astronauts and cosmonauts... All heroes that gave much for the exploration of space.I'm an amateur astronomer of over 40 years who looks into the vastness of space with my telescope and agrees 100% with the ending of the book. We should populate many regions of space to ensure our species survival if our planet gets destroyed. Both Deke and Alan see from space how small and fragile our Earth is and how we should cherish and protect it but also as a human race expand into the Cosmos for our lasting survival.Deke says in the largeness of time about us going forward into space, the little he did for space exploration may be just be a blink of the eye.More detailed information can be found with individual biographies of the astronauts but Moon Shot is great for getting a little info on many of the astronauts. 5 star"},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"Moon Shot: The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon - You would just know that Al Shepard's book would be the best yet by the astronauts. This book tells the inside story of the original seven astronauts, but tells it up to and including the Apollo-Soyuz rendezvous and docking of 1975. I don't know if the great narration was due to Al, Deke or the two writers who assisted them, but this book was the best written of all the astro books I have read. The stories, as written, capture all the excitment of both good sci-fi and space history!"},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"This was an excellent book for anyone who is interested in the efforts to be the first to reach the moon. I have been a space junkie from the times my Mom would keep us home from school to watch the Mercury and Gemini launches. I was reminded of many things I observed and realized that my memories of the flights were from the perspective of a child. Hearing about the same events from the perspective of those who participated was very rewarding."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"This book is much more than a history of the space program from about 1957 to 1975. It includes the inspirational determination for Shepard to fly again and for Slayton to fly even once. I had the pleasure of meeting Alan Shepard and getting his autograph on this book.The book captures the intensity of the space race. When Shepard saw Sputnik 1 (or, more probably, the upper-level rocket stage also in orbit), he chagrined at the fact that it didn't have \\"Made in the USA\\" written on it. Later, the Soviets were sad that the men circling the moon on Christmas Eve 1968 didn't have Russian names.Some seldom-discussed information is provided in this book. For instance, the US could have orbited a satellite over a year before Sputnik (p. 45). Were it not for an overcautious NASA, Shepard could have beat Gagarin into space by a month (p. 89, 91). The dog, Laika, is said to have lived for several days in space (p. 44). We now know that she died several hours after launch--from an overheated cabin.The authors discuss the politics behind the space program. For instance, the grounding of Deke Slayton had been for political and not medical reasons, as there was no evidence that Deke's heart irregularity would interfere with space flight. Rather, the fear was that, were Slayton's flight to end in disaster for any reason, his heart condition would automatically be suspected, and those who cleared him for flight would face automatic recrimination. The authors also allege that politics was behind the choice of Houston as the site for the Space Center. Both astronauts also had to contend with politics in the wake of the Apollo 13 near-disaster, notably the call, by some politicians, to cancel all remaining Apollo moon flights. Shepard also realized that, were his Apollo 14 to fail to land on the moon, there most probably would be no further Apollo flights.One is thrilled by Alan Shepard finding a surgical treatment for his Meniere's syndrome, and getting restored to flight status. Up to that time, he had considered himself an eagle whose wings had been clipped and who had been forced to be a turkey--in more ways than one.Then, over ten years after his grounding, Deke Slayton got his chance...in a joint US-Soviet flight that would have been equally unimaginable at the time of his grounding."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"This is a very enjoyable and moving book. It has great background information and anecdotes about the U.S. space program and astronauts, and also interesting parts about Soviet cosmonauts. It is a good introduction for general readers, and is not intended to be a scholarly overview of the space program. There are many exciting stories included which had me reading &quot;at the edge of my seat,&quot; and a lot of very funny anecdotes. The contributions of Shepard and Slayton to the writing show their good common sense."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"This is a terrible book about the space program. If you are interested in the moon program, read Andrew Chaiken's book. If you're interested in Deke Slayton, read his book.

I have read many books about the space program, and I heartily recommend passing this one up."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"The book is well presented and the photo cuality is very good.

At times, Al Shepard (one of four authors and original Mercury astronaut) seems to take the word processor away from the others and begins to change the story into, &quot;Moon Shot: The Al Shepard Story.&quot; If you saw the adaption of this book into a documentary on TBS, you will understand. Page after page is devoted to Shepard's Apollo 14 flight but hardly anything for many of the Gemini missions. Hmmm, Shepard wasn't flying during that program...connection? All together, through, Slayton's views on the events he helped run are the real jewel. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"The 1969 moon landing is the only incident ofthe Apollo program that a reader recalls.

Shepard's &quot;great friendship&quot; with Deke Slayton that is gone into in almost sickening detail here is re-buked in &quot;Deke!&quot;, a book written by Slayton alone and published at almost the same time!

Co-written by Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton two of the original Mercury astronauts it tells the story from the beginning. The book shares not only what they said and what they did,but also what they thought. It's candid and straightforward. From the tragedy of Apollo 1 to the triumph of Apollo 11 you'll read about how it was to be inside the pressure cooker of the space program from the astronauts themselves. Shepard was the first American in space and ultimately walked on the moon. Slayton flew on the historic Apollo-Soyuz mission that closed out the Apollo program. Their story is the one that you need to read if you want to know how we got to the moon. Don't miss this book!!"},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"&quot;Moon Shot&quot; is a great book for children interested in NASA and the Space Program, and yet it's written by two of the greatest astronauts in America. I am a sixth-grade student who is writing a research paper on Apollo 13, the fatal moon mission, and I received a lot of easy-to-understand, comprehensible information from this source. Not only do Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton capture every important moment in space with accuracy, but they write in a way that keeps people interested in the topic without boring them with tons of facts."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"I'm a typical space nut, and to me, any space book is a good space book.

Read it!"},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"Alan Shepard has virtually novelized the account of the Apollo program and his role in it, to the point of including inaccuracies and situations that never happened. One example that comes to mind, is the photograph of Alan Shepard hitting his golf ball on the surface of the moon; it is actually a montage of several photos, but this is not told to the reader. Also, the landing portion of the Apollo 14 includes made-up dialogue that never occurred, possibly an attempt to portray the excitement and dramatize the tension of problems that developed. I was so disgusted with the book that I sold my hardcover back to a used bookstore for $2(and I pride myself on having a great collection of hardcover 1st edition space program books)"},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"This is a very poor book. The worst of about a dozen books on the American space program that I have read. It is full of exaggerations, inaccuracies, made up dialogue, and oft repeated very cheesy metaphors."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"There are some events in the history of mankind which can never be duplicated. Only one person could be the first to orbit the earth in a spacecraft, or drift outside its confines, or walk on the face of our moon. The 1950s through the 1970s were a special time in the great, epic story of our race. A few dozen men with skill, nerve, and willingness to put their lives on the line to experience the impossible, for themselves and their fellow human beings, stepped up for perhaps the greatest endeavor in earth's history. To land a man on the face of the moon and return him safely home. Aided by the sharpest minds in rocket science, aerospace engineering, and computer and communications systems, these men of courage expanded our frontier, some at the expense of their lives.The four hundred pages of this book flew by for me. Beginning with the choice, in the waning days of World War II, of a group of German rocket scientists, led by Wernher von Braun, to surrender to the Americans, which became the genesis of the United States' rocket program, the initial printing of this book ended with the Apollo-Soyuz mission (a joining, in 1975, of a U.S. and a Soviet spacecraft while they orbited the earth). Both astronauts involved in the writing, Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton, have passed away since the original printing in 1994. Journalist Jay Barbree wrote an update for the latter version, which I read, which has been rereleased in 2011 for the 50th anniversary of the advent of the space program. His update felt rushed and gave very little specific information about the space program since the last Apollo flight; I would have appreciated a less political stance and one which gave more concrete information.If you are looking for a fast ride through the history of the U.S., and to a very minimal extent, the Soviet, race to the moon, this is a solid place to start. It is also a good book to read if you want to believe that there was very little tension and competition among the astronauts themselves and the various engineers-something that other writings lead me to know is patently untrue. While I can appreciate the desire of the authors to produce an account free from mudslinging, the book does have a \\"nicey-nice\\" ring to it that got a bit too saccharine at times. However, the passion of those involved in the early space programs, the spirit of the unknown that drove them, and their sheer love of what they were doing, comes through clearly in the exciting flow of the narrative. This book made me laugh, cry, and cheer, despite prose that verged on melodramatic at times.Moon Shot focuses on the United States' side of the space race, but if you are interested in a balanced account which includes the parallel history of the Soviet side (albeit with much less information from the U.S. viewpoint than Moon Shot), I would like to suggest Two Sides of the Moon: Our Story of the Cold War Space Race. This book was written by U.S. astronaut David Scott-Apollo 15 commander, and Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov-the first man to walk in space, and tells their simultaneous stories from opposing sides of the Iron Curtain. These two men also worked together on joint U.S. and Soviet projects later in their careers. As someone who grew up during the Cold War, I found this collaboration absolutely engrossing, although, like Moon Shot, it is not the most well-written of books."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"I own and have read the biographies and autobiographies of each of the Mercury-Gemini-Apollo astronauts and enjoy reading about NASA during its golden age. Many are frank and give clear pictures of what was going on, some even reveal information that was not very flattering to the author, this book does neither. If you want to read about the world according to Al Sheppard (and the two actual authors) then read this one. I found Mike Collins book much more frank, open, clear, and well written. If you want to know what it was like to run the astronaut office from someone known for their integrity and candor then read Deke! I wanted to like this book, but this one disappointed on many levels."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"Well written, shows the human side of the space race, the good and the bad decisions and how man adapted and reached for the stars to begin a journey, I hope continues."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned, this book doesn't fill any particular niche satisfactorily. It gives only the most superficial information about the two authors' backgrounds, emotions, and thoughts, but on the other hand it fails to address the space program in a comprehensive manner. The last three Apollo flights merit only about a paragraph each! Essentially all of the information found in this book can be found in other, more carefully written narratives (e.g., Andrew Chaikin's A Man in the Moon). The principal exception is the information on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.What hasn't received as much comment is the exceptionally poor writing style of this book. Even for someone with a good understanding of the moon program, the text is at times confusing because of imprecise wording. Mixed metaphors, cliches, and sentence fragments abound. Worst of all, the writing is so florid that it becomes distracting. Everything is described in hyperbole, which makes it difficult to differentiate episodes of true drama from other events. Of course, the history of the moon program has plenty of inherent drama; there is no need to resort to overblown prose to convey this.For example, here's a passage describing the launch of Freedom Seven. The event itself was momentous; the writing style is typical of the entire book.\\"In Cocoa Beach, people left their homes to stand outside and look toward the Cape. They went to balconies and front lawns and back lawns. They stood atop cars and trucks and rooftops. They left their morning coffee and bacon and eggs in restaurants to walk outside on the street or on the sands of the beach. They left beauty parlors and barber shops with sheets around their bodies. Policemen stopped their cars and stood outside, the better to see and hear. Along the water, the surfers ceased their pursuits of the waves and stood, transfixed, swept up in the fleeting moments.\\"It was a moment in a town when time stood still.\\"Fire was born, the dragon howled, and the Redstone levitated with its precious human cargo.\\"That was but the beginning. When the bright flame came into view, even before the deep pure sound washed across the town, something happened.\\"Something...wonderful.\\"Men and women sank slowly to their knees. Praying.\\"Other stood praying.\\"Crying.\\"There was no holding back.\\"All that moved in Cocoa Beach were beating hearts and falling tears.\\"(pp. 113-114)Apart from the text, there are some interesting photographs in the book - especially some showing astronaut training. Unfortunately, many of the events depicted are never addressed in the text. One photo, which purports to show Alan Shepard's famous lunar golf drive, is a fake."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely when I first read it back in 1994. It was the first book I had ever read about the space race. It sparked enough of an interest that I continued to read other books about the space explorers of the 60s and 70s. Of all those books the best one by far is &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot; by Andrew Chaikin. Moon Shot is of course skewed towards the authors Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton. I was not surprised by this, afterall they were telling the story based on how they experienced it. Yes there are discrepancies regarding different events when compared with descriptions told in other books. This again is not unexpected. If you have 10 people watch something happen and then ask each of them what happened you will end up with 10 different versions. I particularily enjoyed the parts of the book that dealt with Deke's experiences. I had never heard of him until I read this book and I found his story to be very interesting and inspiring. He's proof that determination can overcome any obstacle.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for another perspective on the space race. Yes it is slanted towards Shepard and Slayton, but that doesn't keep it from being interesting."},{"Title":"Moon Shot - The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon","review":"There was a time when astronauts didn't have to be pointy headed scientists or politically correct public relations diplomats. Moonshot captures the rough and tumble, fiercely competitive early days of the Cold War space program better than most.The real space business was much more rugged and and cruel than the public relations machine of NASA told us. The &quot;perfect specimens&quot; selected for the Original Seven astronaut corps were far more human than they would have wanted to admit. This account of the struggles and accomplishments of America's early astronauts tells us as much about how we have changed as a people, as it does about orbital rendezvous, astronaut training, and landing on the moon.The technical aspects of spaceflight are in the book, but so is human drama and intrigue.

You get the point of view of two who were on the inside (Shepherd and Slayton) and two reporters who help make the story flow.

You'll swear you are beside Alan Shepherd as the Apollo 14 LEM descends toward the moons surface as the computer and radar problems amount.

It's packed into every page, every line. Tillich is concerned with how the question of finding the courage to face up to existential doubts about death, meaninglessness, and guilt are tied to the ontological questions of being versus nonbeing. How can we affirm our existence when it seems so temporary, meaningless and full of moral failure? Tillich explores with incredible freshness and insight age old strategies, from Spinoza to the Stoics (his discussion of the Stoics alone is worth the price of the book). He gives a brilliant account of how people find the courage to overcome existential anxiety through particpation in groups and through individual strategies like existentialism. Finally, he explores the theological implications in a way that may challenge anyone who has stereotyped Tillich as a mouthpiece for Christianity. The book is excellently written, never dumbed down but always graspable. He also litters the book with brilliant asides on subjects like the history of existential angst and its relations to social relations and a great exploration of existential art. Don't pass this one up."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"Tillich's ultimate concern is what determines our being or non-being. The &quot;shock of nonbeing&quot; and the ensuing anxiety allows Tillich to categorize three types of anxiety (fate and death, emptiness, and guilt). I thought his history of anxiety, starting with the Stoics (&quot;the only real alternative to Christianity in the Western world&quot;) was remarkable (though at times a rough read). Influenced by Heidegger and Kierkegaard(&quot;to confront his existence alone&quot;) he drives on to the inevitable search for God. For Tillich, the &quot;Courage to Be\\" is partly the courage to despair, and avoid the &quot;Neurosis is a away of avoiding non-being by avoiding being&quot;. He is also influenced by Freud and psychoanalysis (called &quot;depth psychology&quot; in the book), which in our day of Prozac and behavioral psychology is refreshing.The nature of the discussions, being, nonbeing, subjectivity, objectivity make for difficult reading with double negatives (eg. &quot;Nonbeing is no threat because finite being is, in the last analysis, nonbeing&quot;). If one can wade through the language, there a lot of insight."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"I checked this book out of the library becuase I like to read books on psychology, philosophy, religion and existentialism. But all-in-all, this book was too deep for me. It's a challenge to read; very thick; very esoteric; not light reading. You need a degree in philosophy or theology to get through it. I did however like Tillich's theory of existential anxiety. I'll give this book three stars for that; but much of it went over my head. Perhaps, if you are smarter than me, you might be able to grasp it better and enjoy it more than I did."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"&quot;It takes tremendous courage to resist the lure of appearances. The power of being which is manifest in such courage is so great that the gods tremble in fear of it.&quot; Paul Tillich, The Courage to Be.Paul Tillich's ideas are a response to existentialism, German philosphy, modern physics &amp; the success of totalitarian movements in Germany, Russia &amp; Italy. He is a bridge between the 19th Century &amp; the growth of new theological thought in latter part of the Twentieth.Tillich is not all that difficult to understand in The Courage to Be. However, it's unfortunate that his three wonderful collections of sermons (The Shaking of the Foundations; The New Being; The Eternal Now) are out-of-print, as these are his best introductions.Readers coming to Tillich will have to grapple with the common metaphors of Christian faith. For Tillich, the concepts of Heaven &amp; even an afterlife are not terribly important, as they imply a continuation of life in time that he is not able to accept scientifically or on faith. So one meets those lovely semi-metaphors of &quot;being itself,&quot; &quot;non-being&quot; &amp; &quot;ground of being&quot; that, for me at least, were a more clear explanation of how I experience the world than God the &quot;Father&quot; or Holy Ghost.This makes Tillich a crucial step into Feminist &amp; Language theology, although he couldn't quite make the big leap himself.Basically, Tillich says we're stuck in an undefinable present that moves creatively into an unknown future in which nothing is a given but the fact that we are alive right now, so what do we intend to do about it? This is &quot;being&quot; &amp; being, above all else, requires courage; the courage of early Christians facing the axe or the fire. As for Tillich's &quot;Ground of Being,&quot; one might compare it - inadequately - to a tree as a reflection of its roots - a metaphor I copped from another Paul ...artist Paul Klee. Tillich says that we cannot speak unsymbolically about being.In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, Paul Tillich's theology gains even greater relevance. He witnessed in Germany the acquiescence of the established churches to National Socialism &amp; the failure of Democratic Christian Socialism. I do not believe he would have many kind words for contemporary Islam, a religious system so bound to orthodoxy as to make it incapable of relevant reform. On the other hand, Tillich would have immediately recognized those manifestations of the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; which began appearing even before the Twin Towers had collapsed. Our estrangement from God in the Eternal Now (which invites demonic energy as a tall tree invites lightning) is overcome only in the present moment. Evil may be defeated with violent retaliation, but it is conquered with love.Paul Tillich is especially liberating for artists. Stopping just short of Buddhism, Tillich makes the world look shimmeringly alive &amp; filled with possibilities, yet so transient - a world of appearances.&quot;The courage to be is rooted in the God who appears when God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.&quot; Paul Tillich, The Courage to BeBob RixonAlso recommended&quot; Henri Bergson, An Introduction to Metaphysics"},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"I first read this book in high school, then in seminary, in graduate psychology classes, and several times since then. Each time I read it I gain insight and growth. Tillich will challenge your intellect and force you to think. He defines courage in a way that will change you if you take it to heart. This is a book that you will need to read several times to apperciate it's depth, but it is well worth it. I often feel I obtain a higher leval of consciousness and often I feel in an altered state after reading and pondering Tillich's writting. Tillich outlines fundemental concepts for existentialist and modern theology. Starting with Tillich's books of sermon is a good work up to this book."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"Tillich is one of the most creative and influential theologians and philosophers of the twentieth century. He is particuluarly influential here in America. When this book was first issue it was recognized as one of the great books of popular philosophy/theology yet written. In it, Tillich takes the reader through the different ways a person can be (essentially different ways of living). The reader will find this book not only useful in terms of their own self evaluation and helping others, but they will find it a book that, when properly understood, changes peoples lives. A word to the wise: Many people have complained that this book is a little difficult to read at first. This is because Tillich uses terminology which he has invented. He is not always good about telling the reader know what he means. However, after you read more and more of the book you get a good grasp of what he means. Stick with it. You wont be sorry."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"Professor Tillich has written a marvelous book that provokes insight, incites thought, and instigates courage.\\"The courage to be\\" makes a great and stimulating reading for theintellect, and will teach the reader about the history of the concept and the process of courage.The courage to be is the greatest achievement that any human can ever reach. As we tackle our daily lives, and wrestle with our socialization and acculturation processes and familial demands, we lose our courage and ourselves in the process; Then we go on for the rest of our lives looking for that piece of the puzzle which we might never find. Losing your courage is losing your heart and becoming dead while you're alive. Reading this book might get you back in touch with your pulsating heart and might awaken your courage that was once decimated by the clamorous world of socialization and survival. Finding the courage to be who we were meant to be at birth is the essence of our spirituality!"},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"It seemed at the beginning that it would be too abstract. Too involved in a history of philosophy in its discussion of the Stoics. That Tillich was asserting too much, as if \\"ex cathedra\\". But even in the early chapters, I sensed something special and by the time I reached Chapter 4 (\\"Courage and Participation: The Courage to Be as a Part\\"), I began to feel the my current situation was being directly and wisely addressed. That feeling only grew stronger from that point on.There's so much value in this book that I feel somehow unworthy of reviewing it. It doesn't seem that any amount of time I spent preparing a review could do justice to \\"The Courage to Be\\". I had heard so much of Tillich but this is the first time I have read him. I have missed a lot and I am grateful I finally turned to him. I had been concerned about religious myths and whether Christianity retained any value for me. Gnostic Christian myths seems fascinating and they made me wonder if Christianity might offer more to me than I had suspected. That concern with myths and Christianity led me to read several books by the progressive Christian Bishop John Shelby Spong (e.g.Jesus for the Non-Religious)). Spong mentioned in at least one of his books that he had been a student of Tillich's. Tillich had challenged Spong with the concept of nontheism, a position that Spong has moved to. That has been my own understanding since my teens but I had turned to nontheistic Eastern religions and to unorthodox, nondogmatic Western religions. Only recently had I been open to reconsidering liberal Christianity. To some extent I had already done that with such postmodern thinkers as Thomas Altizer (The Gospel of Christian AtheismandLiving the Death of God: A Theological Memoir) and recently Spong. Following up with Tillich and this book has been literally a godsend.In much of \\"The Courage to Be\\", Tillich applies his knowledge of Western Existentialism. This meant all the more to me as in my teens I had devoured such existentialists as Sartre, Camus and to a lesser extent even Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. But it was difficult to apply it to my situation. Altizer had helped by tracing developments from Christianity into postmodern movements including atheism but he was difficult to follow.Here now is Tillich who ties together Western Existentialist topics such as anxiety and meaninglessness and a postmodern concern to rediscover the relevance of the Christian tradition. Is one's self in danger today of being a thing, or as he writes \\"a matter of calculation and management\\"? As Tillich points out, the Existentialist Revolt strongly opposed such objectification. But by transcending the theistic way of understanding the sacred ,by turning to \\"the God above God\\", Tillich shares a hope ( at least in finding courage) that speak to those Existentialism addressed but recovers something from Christian roots. It is a project that seems to take better advantage of Western history and Christianity's role in it as it was than Spong's dependence on speculations to salvage an acceptable image of Jesus.This is not a book for a single reading. I've started already on my second reading and I am also reading more of Tillich, alreadyThe socialist decisionand am planning to read soonA HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN THOUGHT Edited By Carl E. Braaten. I somehow overlooked Tillich all these years and I am eager to make up for lost time. The timing is good because, as Spong has described, I seem to be \\"a believer in exile\\", raised a Christian and, although having questioned much about it, still influenced by my Protestant upbringing and by the many writings such as those of the Existentialists, that proceeded directly from or in reaction to Christianity.Finding \\"A Courage to Be\\" and Tillich may be a way for me to accept my background without rejecting what I have learned and felt since."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"Tillich gathers strands from stoicism, theistic existentialism, dialectical thought and fideism in an attempt to weave a unifying belief-system. I don't think he completely succeeds in doing that. However, he does manage to express some spiritual insights. And it is in the mining these spiritual gems that makes the book a worthwhile read.Many reviewers have voiced the opinion that Tillich's writing style is very difficult to read. I do not necessarily agree with this assessment. Tillich employs paradoxical language in an attempt to explain that which is beyond all words. At times, his writing is dry. But it is not terribly difficult to follow.Here are some of the insights that I have gathered from the reading of this book:- The human predicament is the estrangement of one's existence from one's essential being. This estrangement is sin.- God is understood as \\"being\\" itself. And \\"being\\" is a \\"creative process.\\"- There's a dialectical tension between being and nonbeing. And \\"the courage to be\\" is the power of being to will itself, to overcome the threat of nonbeing.- \\"Courage needs the power of being, a power transcending the nonbeing\\" pg. 155- Existential angst takes on three distinct forms: 1) the anxiety of fate and death, 2) the anxiety of emptiness and meaninglessness and 3) the anxiety of guilt and condemnation.Tillich discusses at length the sociological implications of these three forms of \\"anxieties\\" as they played out in history.At the heart of Tillich's discussion is the dialectical tension that exists between the individual and the group of which the individual is a part. Both the individual and the group are affirmed and denied. By affirming the self, the individual denies the group; by affirming the group, the individual denies himself. How does one overcome this conflict? By \\"the courage to be,\\" and the \\"courage to be\\" is none other than faith itself.\\"The 'courage to be' is the courage to accept oneself as accepted in spite of being unacceptable.\\" pg. 164 This is Tillich's interpretation of the doctrine of \\"justification by faith.\\"I found Tillich's discussion of death to be very interesting:\\"The courage to die is also the test of the courage to be. A self-affirmation which omits taking the affirmation of one's death into itself tries to escape the test of courage, the facing of nonbeing in the most radical way.\\" pg. 169We must learn to embrace death by taking death into ourselves. And it is with this acceptance that we affirm the \\"courage to be.\\" It is only by dying, by dying to the self, that we are reborn to eternal life. Faith defined as the \\"courage to be\\" is where we derive the power of God, who is being itself.Here are some examples of Tillich's paradoxical statements or aphorisms:- \\"He who participates in God participates in eternity. But in order to participate in him you must be accepted by him and you must have accepted his acceptance of you.\\" pg. 170- \\"The courage to be is an expression of faith and what \\"faith\\" means must be understood through the courage to be.\\" pg. 172- \\"Faith is not an opinion but a state. It is the state of being grasped by the power of being, which transcends everything that is, and in which everything that is, participates.\\" pg. 173The major criticism that I have of Tillich's thought as represented in this book is that he failed to link the \\"courage to be\\" or faith with love. Ultimately love is the power of being. And God is not only being itself but also love. They are inseparable."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"One of the greatest contemporary accounts of existentialism from the theological perspective. Tillich writes with extreme precision and emphasizes the need for faith in an age when meaninglessness animates the quest for self-understanding. Existentialism has been dominated by secular sentiment, and Tillich brings it back into its theological context by offering an ontological account of faith which is disguised as &quot;courage.&quot; Important points include: the God beyond god, and the three categories of the fear-anxiety correlation in respect to both their historical and philosophical manifestations. I believe this book originally went through seven editions within a two year period, an unprecedented accomplishment for an author."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"labutler@texinet.net I first read this book in 1954 while enrolled in Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.

Tillich is a well known mid-twentieth century German-American liberal theologian. The following comments pertain to the 2000 re-release by Yale University PressThe lectures discuss the issue of courage and, are largely a response to some of the bleak existentialist philosophy prevalent at the time. I found the aspects of the text discussing existentialism to be the most interesting. To the appropriate liberal academic audience in the early 1950's these lectures might have sounded majestic. Tillich weaves a broad story touching on a range of philosophical, political, historic and scientific themes. Fifty years later it feels dated and superficial; some of the themes e.g. existentialism, Freudism and Marxism are now somewhat pass&eacute; and may be of limited interest to many modern readers.This is not to say that the work is without value, I find that Tillich is always effective at conveying the majesty of God. Tillich was by all accounts a capable intellect, however, his ability as a communicator is limited; his use of language while occasionally poetic is often wordy and vacuous, while his argumentation can be sublime, it is frequently speculative and specious.The Courage to Be is probably only of interest to Tillich fans."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"My husband has wanted this book and mentioned it.

This book is a literary Prozac that depends on the slowly released drug of honest, clear and non-pretentious writing about the history of high thought."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"Tillich believes that modern man's predominant anxiety is a sense of meaninglessness leading to despair. This is the Existentialist's plight. Tillich states that meaninglessness has not always been the predominant concern. In prior ages it had been death and later guilt.In order to resolve the angst of modern man, Tillich imposes upon himself that \\"The answer must accept, as its precondition, the state of meaninglessness.\\" This precondition creates the cul-de-sac for his rational argument.Tillich himself, offers the nave solution of \\"The faith which creates the courage to take [meaninglessness/anxiety] into itself has no special content. It is simply faith, undirected, absolute. It is undefinable, since everything defined is dissolved by doubt and meaninglessness.\\"In other words, Tillich suggests that to resolve meaninglessness and despair one should resort to having faith without subject matter.Tillich further explains himself by stating the requisite courage/faith is not without subject matter but rather is in \\"pure being\\" or \\"the God above God\\". This is nonsense. The God of the Bible is the great \\"I AM\\", pure being. There is no God above God.By giving the proposition \\"God above God\\" Tillich is either:a) making a substitution identical to that which is being substituted, making the proposition gibberishb) removing God from the equation, replacing Him with the power of being within ourselves as the basis for our courage (what an ersatz this exchange would be, a finite force within ourselves, leading to certain death, rather than a personal God who could be implored that held the power to gift eternity).orc) replacing the definition of God handed down through the ages and substituting it for one, more amenable to his existentialist philosophy. In so doing he is falling into the trap of creating god in his own image. One also would have to ask the question why he feels he should be trusted with elucidating to mankind who God is, using his reason alone? The credentials of Jesus and Moses are likely more qualified for this which is likely why their assertions are believed more than those of Tillich.If you were not certain before reading this book that Existentialist philosophy has no real legitimate answers for meaning in life this book should provide another nail in the coffin towards that conclusion."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"....of faith, fortitude, and integrity. Tillich's gift for combining the theological and the philosophical works in full force here, where he demonstrates the ontology of what other thinkers have called being-toward-oneself."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"Tillich's book makes a number of points very clearly, but theprincipal point of the book is obscured by round-about language.In the last chaper Tillich speaks of the &quot;God above God&quot;. He writes concerning the God who is not above God: &quot;He deprives me of my subjectivity . . . God appears as an invincible tyrant, the being in contrast with whom all other beings are without freedom and subjectivity. . . . This is the god Nietzsche said had to be killed because nobody can tolerate being made into the mere object of absolute power. This is the deepest root of atheism.&quot; The God not above God is the Jewish image of God divorced from anthropomorphic aspects. He does not state this, but it is clear it is what he means. He speaks of Bergson's fight against the tyranny of spacial relationships. He states elsewhere in the chapter that: &quot; The God above God is present, although hidden, in every devine-human encounter. Biblical religion, as well as Protestant theology are aware of the paradoxical character of this encounter.&quot; If one removes the anthropomorphic elements from the Old Testament God the result is how Albert Einstein describes the Jewish God: &quot;The Jewish God is nothing more than the negation of superstition.&quot; This would of course be the combination of natural law and spacial relationships. Einstein goes on to say that the rest of God is imagination. Therefore, the God Tillich rejects is the physical laws and spacial relationships before which subjectivity is absurd in that it is simply a form of self-deception to be unaware of the laws which will, aware or un-aware, be obeyed. Therefore the individual as a subjectivity-having being is of necessity based upon ignorance. Keat's line &quot;A thing of beauty is a joy forever&quot; would be impossible were the God as natural law and spacial relationships embraced in a pure form. The &quot;thing&quot; would simply be a mass of some specific gravity, ofa particular set of dimensions, a given distance from the observer and so forth. Much of current Jewish theological argument is about this same point, rationalism (man is a part of a giant machine and everything else is self-deception) as opposed to the combination of the rationalst view with one of the universe of possible self-deceptions the view personified by Abraham's argument with God concerning the destruction of Sodom and the selecter of the Jewish people as chosen. The implication of Tillich's argument is also that visualization of God such as the One who argues with Abraham or selects a people is simply a form of self deception, one of the universe of forms of self deception which needs be employed or some other form substituted. Abraham argues with God, and it seems to make sense in the Bible. It would make no sense if anyone argued with gravity or that gravity selected one group over another. The Jews would be, as implied by the quote from Einstein, be more vulnerable to this need for self deception simply because persons of other groups would be more removed from the God of natural law and spacial relationships. It is part of the human condition, not at all unique to Judaism, but it would be subject to amplification among Jews because Judaism is a more mechanistic and therefore more efficient view of the universe. Being more efficient and therefore potentially more powerful, there would be greater opportunity for Jews to engage in behaviors which might create ill-feeling among others than would groups with less effieient mentalities. Tillich does not in any way say or imply that this is the only cause of self deception of course. Obviously, a realization of the true nature of the universe is necessary if great vulnerability is to be avoided. The acquiring of this realization without the need to find harmful self-deception is perhaps the greatest challange the world faces. Judaism has much to teach the world; it is time the world listened. Tillich points at least in the general direction of where the world needs to go, but he himself says that the correct balance between the subjective and the mechanistic is &quot;Under the Cross.&quot;Therefore, he, himself, points to the need for realization of combining a mechanistic core with a modifying but useful as opposed to harmful form of self deception, but does not embrace it. Tillish says that the purpose of the Christian clergy is to keep people from realizing the true, without self deception, relationship between man and the universe. He points to the road, but he will go no further."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"TILLICH'S BASIC IDEAS OF GOD AND THE GOD-ABOVE-GOD ARE NOT CLEAR IN THE COURAGE TO BE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE HE STATES AS THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTION OF CHRISTIAN CLERGY KEEPING PEOPLE FROM REALIZING THE NATURE OF \\"GOD\\" FOR WHICH PURPOSE HE IDENTIFIES THE \\"GOD-ABOVE-GOD\\" THE NATURE OF \\"GOD\\" ISTHE GREAT MACHINE WHICH IN ALBERT EINSTEIN'S VIEW FOR EXAMPLE OBVIATES HUMAN FREEDOM.

Paul Tillich should not be considered to have been a theologian.I know that some will object to my position by saying something along the lines of: &quot;How can someone who has written a systematic theology not be a theologian?&quot; Go ahead and ask. I know of no sane person who has read his systematic all the way through without having been compelled by someone higher up in the power structure of academia.This leads me to the thesis of my review. Tillich was not a theologian or as some would no doubt suggest, a philosopher. I cannot put my finger on exactly what he was. The most honest and least vitriolic (though this book simply begs for vitriol) description I can provide of this book is that it is vague. Tillich seems to want to make some universalist and yet subjective statement about courage and anxiety, but he never pulls the trigger on it. He dances round and round the subject, leaving the reader both tired and queasy.This leads me back to the question of Tillich. Is this book the work of Tillich the theologian, Tillich the existentialist philosopher, or an undefined, wholly other Tillich? I don't know. However I do believe I know who Tillich was writing for; and I believe this is the key to our question about Tillich, meaningful as part of understanding the book, and of the utmost importance to you as you consider whether or not to buy and read this book. It is my sincere belief that this book was written for that all too common half-breed that is found in our universities: the Liberal Academic (those who are too lacking in honesty to be true scholars and yet still fearful enough to admit their own atheism).Tillich is still widely read by captive audiences under the tutelage of these academics. This ensures why this book is still read and discussed.

I am an avid reader, but was glad to have my professor's guidance and class discussions to help me see and understand things I might not have otherwise. I don't think Tillich has to be lumped into any kind of category in order to be worth reading-- his ideas transcend any one category.

Fear is different from anxiety in that fear is directed at a specific object whereas anxiety is not. Anxiety is not directed at a specific object because it comes from the thereat of nonbeing. Our nonbeing exists at three levels the ontic, spiritual and moral. Ontic anxiety is experienced as anxiety of fate and ultimately of death. Spiritual anxiety is experienced as emptiness and ultimately as meaninglessness. Moral anxiety is experienced as rejection and ultimately as condemnation. He makes a distinction between normal anxiety and pathological anxiety. The neurotic may be more aware of his own non being and more creative. Normal anxiety is sometimes replaced by fear of a specific object which can be handled better by the individual.He next examines Existentialisms. Existentialisms as a point of view started with Plato and the distinction between the essential forms and actual existence. Classical Christianity continued in the Existential point of view with man being created good in essence but due to sin and the fall became estranged from this essence. The Existentialisms of the 20th century was driven by the anxiety of meaninglessness. The main event that caused this sift in the 20th century was the loss of God."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"Technically, this book is difficult to read and often hard to understand.

The arguments are well made and are very fun to wrestle with.

Tillich attempts to give an existential turn to Christian Theology in order to make sense out of the modern (and possibly post-modern) experience of the existential crisis that disturbs the mind of the 20th century. Tillich's central thesis is that life consists in the ontological tension between Being and Non-Being within a person who struggles to find meaning in the infinite abyss of meaninglessness and acceptance in the incorrigible guilt. To find that kind of reconciliation is impossible by man alone (and here is the Lutheran element to Tillich's Theology) but found only through the Power of Being or Being-Itself which provides the Courage To Be, that is the Courage to exist and live meaningfully in spite of meaninglessness and despair; There is this sense of romanticism in which the existential man strives to live meaningfully in spite of the possibility of meaninglessness, and Tillich has expressed it beautifully.Tillich's criticism on supernatural theism or the anthropomorphic conception of theism, in favor of his conception of God as \\"Ground of Being\\", has been one of the most significant experiences in my reading. This very bold move, that is almost prohibited and forbidden in theological circles, is violated by Tillich who is driven with the desire to present another understanding of God. While Tillich has shown that the classical theistic God is no longer a tolerable being, and merely a byproduct of our Anthropomorphic Bias, his new conception of God has left people wanting. Even though I admit that Tillich's conception of God as Ground of Being is as profound as it can get, one cannot help but ask what exactly this being is. Tillich refuses to answer this directly since he sincerely believes that to do so is to only misunderstand Ground of Being. Perhaps it is not meant to be understood anymore, but despite this theological issue I really appreciated this work."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"Paul Tillich (1886-1965) was a German-American theologian and Christian existentialist philosopher. He wrote many books, such asSystematic Theology, vol. 1,A History of Christian Thought (Touchstone Books),The Shaking Of The Foundations,The New Being,Eternal Now (scm classics).He wrote in the first chapter of this 1962 book, \\"The title of this book... unites both meanings of the concept of courage, the ethical and the ontological. Courage as a human act, as a matter of valuation, is an ethical concept. Courage as the universal and essential self-affirmation of one's being is an ontological concept. The courage to be is the ethical act in which man affirms his own being in spite of those elements of his existence which conflict with his essential self-affirmation.\\" (Pg. 3)He defines \\"anxiety\\" as the state in which being is aware of its possible nonbeing, or the existential awareness of nonbeing. (Pg. 35) Anxiety turns us toward courage, because the other alternative is despair. \\"Courage resists despair by taking anxiety into itself.\\" (Pg. 66) He later states that the courage to be is \\"the self-affirmation of being in spite of nonbeing.\\" (Pg. 172)He summarizes, \\"One could say that the courage to be is the courage to accept oneself in spite of being unacceptable.\\" He suggests that this is the \\"genuine meaning\\" of the doctrine of justification by faith.

In his book,The Courage to Be, Tillich discusses the origin of anxiety as coming from the loss of meaning in life. Here he is referring to the underlying but nagging realization most of us suffer briefly, or for a lifetime, that existence has no purpose. We come into being at birth then learn through daily life experience that death, nothingness, non-being awaits us.Arguments for the immortality of the soul are futile when we visit a funeral home. In spite of all logic, biological extinction causes anxiety. The corpse reminds us that it is our fate too, to be thrown out of existence at any moment. Is it any wonder then that it takes courage to accept this unacceptable fact?Most people push aside this anxiety of non-being by adopting a religion and following its precepts sometimes to the point of fanaticism. They find comfort in accepting what their church insists is the true meaning of life and an afterlife. But there are also the religious fanatics who insist their beliefs must be imposed on others. Mankind is well aware of the horrors these extremists cause today and have caused in the righteous past.Then there are those who push the anxiety of non-being into an unconscious mental recess and lose themselves in a work ethic. They identify with their job, their position, their status in life. Quite often, they fail to examine their own existence until faced with loss of it through disease or a life threatening illness.Sadly, there are those so overwhelmed by the anxiety of non-being that, in despair, they turn to alcohol, drugs, or suicide.What does Tillich mean by courage? InThe Courage to Be, he states that courage is the strength to continue to live on in a meaningful way in spite of the fact that our existence appears to have no purpose. We do not wallow in doubt, self-derision or despair. We have come into being in this time, in this place, in spite of the ever-present threat of non-being.This courage comes from a fundamental person-to-person acceptance of God, a belief in a being that infinitely transcends one's self. We do not believe because religious dogma demands it. We believe because as limited human beings we simply accept a loving, intelligent, understanding and forgiving God.Theologian Tillich readily admits there are no valid arguments for God's existence. What does exist is the courage to believe in spite of all doubt. Our life's purpose lies within a personal encounter with God.The Courage to Becannot be read without much reflection. But it is worth the effort. I would highly recommend Tillich's book to all practicing psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, and any person interested in a more meaningful existence devoid of organized religion.Other meaningful books:Dynamics of Faith (Perennial Classic.)Love, Power, and Justice: Ontological Analyses and Ethical Applications (Galaxy Books)The Kusum&iexcl;njali, Or, Hindu Proof of the Existence of a Supreme Being"},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"I bought the Kindle edition, which formatted well and comes with active table of contents for easy navigation. This book, of course, is old, having been pubished in the 1950s. It also reflective of existentialist ideas and terms in vogue at the time. But the issues raised by Tillich are good ones. As a Christian, I liked the last half better than the first half, since that is when he began to hold up Christian faith as the source of \\"the courage to be\\" and the answer to fate, meaningless, and condemnation."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"I first read this book in 1967 when I was 17 years old. It clarified my doubts, enlightened and challenged me.I would say it made me largely the man I am today.I reread it just recently, and found it as wonderful and insightful as I did all those years ago.I recommend it to anyone who is curious about their spiritual journey."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"Cons: boring, pointless, pages of discussion with no practical value; author does not offer his concepts, just criticism of othersPros: helps to fall asleep,"},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"This is not a feel-good self help book. It is a serious, dense, inquiry into what is required to be and the ways in which being can express itself. It is a book which defines and categorizes in order to lead the reader to the understanding of how \\"being\\" lies, ultimately, beyond both definition and categories."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"This is the best book I've ever read pertaining to the existential viewpoint. A viewpoint which I regard as very relevant. This book is about the existence of the individual and how the concepts of &quot;being&quot;, &quot;anxiety&quot;, and &quot;courage&quot; (to name a few) define that existence. It can be a bit difficult to read at first, especially if you're not familiar with the subject matter or the writings of some of the existentialist thinkers throughout history. A good prerequisite to reading this book would be &quot;Irrational Man&quot; by William Barrett. Get both."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"I first read this book when I had to write an existential paper for one of my counseling classes. It was difficult for me to understand at first, but I read it again, and it changed my life in ways. So many times, we look at God and box him/her into compartments. When we do this, we think we have a good handle on who and what God is. Then as time goes on, and we evolve, our thoughts on God no longer relate or apply to our lives. Through the struggle to know, seek and experience God, we many times are disappointed when God and ourselves do not connect. Paul Tillich tells us that through the struggle, we must have absolute faith, and the god who is really God appears in Grace."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"This book looks at the reality of life and faith.It faces the suffering and doubt of life, yet offers a deepconviction that faith if still possible and enableing."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"I've been searching for the meaning of life since I was a teenager. I thought this book would answer my question. It certainly did not.Tillich spent the first 90% of the book over-complicating the issues: the angst we feel (related to death, guilt and meaninglessness), how and why, He researched historical views and progresses. Nothing wrong with that. But I don't think it's complete. So to me, the problems he posted are overly complicated yet incomplete.Then He over-simplified the answer by creating a \\"God above God\\", in the last few pages of the book. The concept could potentially take away the anxiety related to death and guilt, but not meaninglessness. God is all powerful and almighty. He does not need to create me for His purpose. So \\"why am I here\\" is still a question to answer."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"Let me admit at the outset I'm not a philosophy person. But I was interested in the author because of his reputation as a great, influential theologian. I found this book a very boring, difficult read with tons of repetition, not just in concepts but even within sentences and paragraphs. It was written several decades ago and perhaps for those who are interested in the history of existentialism there are pluses to the book. The best chapter, in my opinion, was the last chapter (6) where Tillich explores \\"Courage and Transcendence\\". More specifically, I liked the last subchapter on \\"Theism Transcended\\". This section contained timeless concepts of what theism means and doesn't mean, and an astute observation that one definition of theism is an empty one used by politicians who throw out the word \\"God\\" in speeches to impress their audiences with their moral trustworthiness. In that respect, the book was \\"current\\" and certainly applicable to the recently concluded Republican presidential candidate primary race. But in the end, I didn't feel my time slogging through this book was time well spent."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"True to his theological method, Tillich approaches his task by taking up the relevant questions of modern culture, and giving Christian answers to those questions. His analysis of the questions of &quot;despair and meaninglessness&quot; is quite intense and certainly very thorough, and for this he deserves recognition. However, one cannot help but ask if Tillich is allowing the questions of culture to control his theology, rather than the Christian message. Is Christianity really the answer to whatever questions we happen to present it? Or does Christianity challenge us to ask the right questions?"},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"This is a book of the mind. An intellectual foray into philosophy. I know it is a well regarded text but it certainly was not where I wanted to explore in finding a more heartful understanding of faith. I admit I didn't get terribly far into it before I gave up and moved on. There is so much more out there that calls to a heart centered seeker."},{"Title":"The Courage to be","review":"I purchased two books written by Paul Tillich for one dollar a piece at Half-Price books. One is this book particular title. I have heard of the author because RC Sproul has often argued his thoughts as a mischaracterization of Christianity and the relationship possible between God and man. Paul Tillich's philosophy is clearly contradictory to Christianity. The author clearly states his thoughts are not biblical; he plainly does not believe in a greater being nor does he like the Being described in the Bible. This book is about man's relationship to the universe absent God. It is an argument that one needs to have courage absent the security of traditional religion; there is no God in his philosophy describing right and wrong; there is no higher Being protecting you. His perspective is part pantheism. Man does not die to be part of a conscience state, but pure dust and part of the whole of creation. One may have a social conscience but there are no arbiters to determine what one think is correct. This book is about the implications of this Worldview and the implications of grasping this \`truth\\".I believe the author could have made a more organized and clearer argument. The language is clear and easy to understand, but the thoughts could have been more organized."},{"Title":"L S Lowry","review":"L.S Lowry by Michael Leber &amp; Judith Sadling is a fantastic book on the artist. Its 144 pages are full of interesting detail, giving a full insight to the life of Lowry. Plus there are interviews with Lowry by Edwin Mullins a former critic of the Sunday Telegraph. The book is packed full of pictures of Lowrys work, some in colour, postcard and A4 size. Plus a catalogue of works in public collections, giving title, date, size, and type of painting(oil, pencil etc), over 440 listed works, most with a black and white picture.

I won't say which one because this note is about the book and especially the author, Katie Van Luchene. While her knowledge and research is impressive (who knew about some of this stuff?), her writing style really makes this book work. The individual write-ups are fantastic. My book is already dogeared, with clipped pages and highlighter everywhere. We have frequent house guests from outside the area and I will soon be experiencing some new things right along with my guests.

Lawrence Short Stories (Longman Literature)","review":"When I was young, I went through a serious phase of discovering D.H. Lawrence. By young, I mean 12 or 13. I bought all the books at a second hand store close to our local SUNY. At that age, his novels were... I guess affecting is the right word.I tried to come back to Lady Chatterly's Lover in my twenties, and was so put off that I couldn't read further. I wrote Lawrence off as a writer I was glad I had read, but had no desire to read again.Lately, I was discussing Lawrence with a friend. He said I should give Lawrence another chance, but this time should focus on his short stories, not on his novels.This is possibly true. But not on the strength of this particular collection. I'm really racking my brain to find something positive to say about this book, but I'm failing. These stories veered for me between unfinished and offensive-- generally offensive in the way he discusses gender issues, although he branches out into being racially offensive from time to time. The usual \\"real women are in touch with the earth and their sexuality\\" crap.I think I may just give up on Lawrence.This book contains:The Wilful WomanThe PrincessThe OvertoneThe Flying FishSunMercuryThe Man Who Was Through with the WorldA Dream of LifeThe Undying ManThe Blue MoccasinsThingsMother and Daughter"},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"This book is aimed at the business executive and small business owner with no current knowledge of broadband, and assumes no technical background in Internet technology. The book focuses on explaining the terminology of broadband, the trends involved, their business communications and product implications, and how Web-based businesses may be affected.If you know what broadband is or have seen it in action with multimedia sites, you are beyond this book.Broadband is simply a way of describing the ability to rapidly move screenfuls of data to and from an electronic device (such as your personal computer) more rapidly than you can blink. The result is to create something that can be a combination of interactive television, video phone, and multimedia experience rolled into new directions by using information to customize it for you. In essence, broadband eliminates many of the remaining limits to information technology coming into its full flowering for the average person.If you work for a large company and are dealing with another large company in a computer application, the information is almost certainly traveling at broadband speeds. If you are at home on a dial-up connection, you are operating in the old mode. By 2002, it is estimated that 16 million consumer users will have broadband connections. The authors believe that telephone and power companies will be the winners over cable companies in creating this connection at home.The main implication for businesses is that products and services for consumers will have to be greatly upgraded in content, interactivity, and use of information to match the potential of the technology in the next 5 to 10 years as the broadband connections become widely available at home. Since this process will be difficult to implement, many companies should begin now to make the transition. Your first experiments will probably not succeed.The book is a light, easy read. The best parts are the wild-blue-yonder, what's-coming-next speculations. The authors seem to have a Stan Davis-type ability to conceptualize what does not yet exist in an interesting way. I especially enjoyed the humor in the list of 10 reasons to dread &quot;smart&quot; electronic appliances. For example, the one attached to your pillow may allow your boss to find out that you are late because you overslept.If this is a new subject for you, be sure to read this book. If it is not, be sure to work on getting a lead on your competitors in preparing for broadband technology.When you are done doing those things, then ask what other technologies are about to disrupt your business and find out more about them as well. For example, how will holography affect you?May lots of health, happiness, peace and prosperity be yours!"},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"Though initially apprehensive about reading this book, I needed to for work and I am so happy I did. I was expecting the typically wordy, overly-technical writing that so many similar books suffer from, but THE LAST MILE was written in a language I could not only understand, but learn from. Broadband will soon be taking businesses by storm and I am now one step closer to taking part in all that it has to offer. By demystifying the unknown, I feel better equipped to move forward. This is a terrific book for anyone who wants to expand their realm of understanding and not get left behind in our new economy."},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"The Last Mile was written by two former Shockwave employees, now with March First's interactive division. Let me start by stating that I consider March First one of the few interactive agencies that truly \\"get it.\\" However, after reading The Last Mile, its obvious that someone at March First should start reviewing books before they go to press with their name attached. For starters, the writing in this book is extremely poor. For example, this excerpt regarding the complications involved with DSL installations; &quot;The next day a real service guy showed up, wearing an open shirt with the gold chains and a serious leather tool belt that the customer said looked like the one he had bought because he just loved his job so much (huh?). The customer thought to himself &quot;this is the man.&quot; He looked as if he was ready to start a fight with anyone that talked bad about DSL. This guy came in like Mr. Spock in the original Star Trek movie and rewired the warp drive engine. He rewired the setup and told the customer that he was ready to make the jump to light speed.&quot; The passage rambles on (including run on sentences, and grammatical errors) and concludes with; &quot;He thought of some technical reason as to why this might be normal and forgot about it, until he asked his wife if she ever tried using both her DSL and Powerbook modem. &quot;Yup, all the time,&quot; she said. For the love of God, he thought&quot;PLEASE - who is the target audience of this book? CEO's interested in understanding broadband capabilities and positioning their business for the broadband revolution don't want to read writing in the style of &quot;Spot goes to the Park&quot;.The Last Mile also (conveniently) features a case study on Shockwave.com - although I find the site entertaining, how this fits into helping CEOs to understand business applications based on broadband is beyond me. (It's also nice to see that the book gets kudos from the creative officer of Shockwave.com)The book continuously repeats itself (obviously written by two different writers with no editor) and jumps around; confusing the reader as to what is the message of each chapter.The Last Mile is mainly geared towards justifying the need for interactive designers (coincidentally the writers' are interactive designers) and using interactive elements such as video and flash animation because the bandwidth will be available.When developing strategies around positioning businesses online, interactive elements should be only used if they make sense to the target audience and are necessary to help solve business problems; not simply because the technology is available. This is never mentioned in the book.I was extremely disappointed with the unprofessional approach taken in writing (and editing) this book. The Last Mile book was painful to get through. I hope someone at March First is reading this. I want my money back."},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"What did this book tell me:1.

The language and diagrams are easy to read and understand, proving invaluable to me and will help anyone who is technically challenged."},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"\`The Last Mile' is a colloquial, gushing, superficial and repetitive introduction to US broadband presenting basic \\"e-life\\" brainstorms (i.e. work and play).In three parts, the unreferenced and poorly structured chapters span:+ Part one: the broadband revolution- building the foundation for broadband; what is broadband; the last mile deployment studies; and Palm case study.+ Part two: the impact of broadband- the world economy with Kodak case study; changing culture with TBWA/Chiat/Day case study; and the changing culture with shockwave.com case study.+ Part three the changing landscape- new business networks with Columbia Tristar Interactive case study; the changing technologies with ReplayTV case study; and final thoughts on reaching the last mile.Unfortunately, the strengths are limited to the enthusiasm of tone, and brevity of the book. Non-techies can do much better than reading this.Weaknesses include: the extreme repetition between sections (perhaps 40% of a short book!); a very shallow treatment of subject; textual \\"slips\\" always representing US significantly more favorably than the case (compared with actual figures given in book itself) as well as mostly US focus; the scrappy illustrations, typos, missing illustration &amp; inconsistencies; a seemingly Macromedia-advert focus; a lack of analysis or justification for \\"broadband will come\\" beyond assumption that everyone wants latest technology (but what about the business benefit?); little concern for the global business environment &amp; wider society (and those non-wired countries where broadband will be irrelevant for foreseeable future); little evidence of understanding of any \\"real\\" office work processes and technologies; and an \\"interactivity\\" focus seemingly of \\"flaming car graphics\\" kind satirized in old IBM e-business adverts, rather than anything of benefit to user or company.Better alternatives include: Siegel's Futurize Your Enterprize (for e-life mindset and enthusiasm primer), and Mitchells' E-topia for a more rigorous view of wired technology impacts including broadband on the built environment.Overall, a quick web-search reveals more than this disappointing \\"throwaway\\" book- so perhaps only of use to those not yet using the Internet (who yet may be put off by the \\"tech-nerd-appeal\\" bookcover)."},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"The internet is here and everywhere, in television ads, in print ads on billboards.

This is a book for everyone - from a technology side it is well researched, and written so that anyone can understand what is happening and where it is all going. I highly recommend this book, and I think it appeals to a wide range of readers - those who are in the field, to any business big or small who already uses internet and wants a leading advantage, and even to those who are just learning the concept of the cyber-age and all it's implications. It's a great read!"},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"This is a great book for those people who tend to lead businesses from an MBA perspective, rather than the technically savvy geek who may sit in his or her server room for hours. It is the perfect book to use to explain the the changing culture of Broadband to a diverse group. It can help consumers like myself, to CEOs, to an individual who may not even know how to program his or her VCR. Fabulous read and the case studies are perfect. Prepare yourselves for the future with this book.

It did a poor job of going into detail (I wasn't looking for too much detail) of broadband technologies in use today. It also barely even touched wireless broaband to the home or to enterprises. Furthermore, the information was dated even though the hardcopy version I bought had a copyright date of 2001. Clearly, the book must've been written in late 1999 or early 2000. In this rapidly changing industry, that's too long ago. I also have to agree with another reader that I can't tell who this book was intended for?

It has only grown more useful and informative. I cannot understand the other reviews I've seen here claiming that it's too superficial or only for novices. Let us not forget that this book is out to fulfill a specific mission which, in my opinion, involves making the idea of Broadband more accessible to non-tech heads like myself. In this respect, it is an unbelievable tool for me. To knit-pick about the way the two authors spell &quot;Kozmo&quot; differently seems to miss the point - one typo does not invalidate an entire book. To those who remain interested in Broadband and want to read something more fresh and enjoyable than your typical internet tome, this is still one of the best choices out there. Give it a try."},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"The Last Mile is one of the books I keep multiple copies of at the office to give out, this book helps our clients understand the what broadband means to their business model, the technologies used, and to gain a better impression on where broadband is heading.The authors clearly have their fingers on the pulse of an industry that's on the threshold of changing the internet as much as the internet has changed communications."},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"Five years from now, your refrigerator should be talking to you. Your television set won't just offer you the usual slew of cable channels, but thousands of streaming Internet channels that will fill every conceivable market niche, need or want. Transmission paths will include DSL modems, cable modems, possible fiber optic links to the home and even transmission through power lines. Executives should start thinking now about how broadband will change the way their businesses work, the authors explain. So, if you're trying to figure out how your business can benefit from the inevitable expansion of fat pipes, we from getAbstract recommend this book to you. Read it quickly, before the fridge asks for something to drink."},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"Anybody who works in the IT industry or who has their own PC with access to the internet for the last four years will probably have the technical background of the new broadband techologies. Things like cable modems and ADSL have been featured in technology magazines. This book is really a beginners introduction into the new broadband world of high speed access to the internet. Anybody with ADSL or cable access will find the material in the book boring because they will be carrying out all the functions that the book talks about like: watching quicktime movies, downloads at high speed, listening to radio stations and listening to music in real time. If on the other hand you are interested in broadband connectivity and in deciding whether to join up with ADSL or cable then this book is worth reading to get an idea of the worlds that open up to you with high speed internet connectivity. Again this book is really for beginners and not for the technically minded who want detail and who work with the technology daily."},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"I can honestly say that this book really helped me in my understanding of the web and the new revolution in technology.

AOL who has built its business on catering to teenieboppers at $20 bucks a pop, and has apparently found it to be in its strategic interest to continue the slooooo unreliable access, contributed to the long delay in broadband access to residential customers. We all know that it's happening, and even AOL with it's lash-up with TW can not stop it.This book adds little to one's knowledge of broadband. I feel certain that given their background, the authors must know a lot about their subject, but it's difficult to perceive a more superficial treatment of the subject. If the best you can do is explain broadband in terms of plumbing, skip it altogether. My advice concerning this book: skip it altogether."},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"Actually,this book provided me with helpful information regarding the information superhighway and broadband. I found that its clear, simple and concise information it provided was fresh and innovative compared to those over-technical books out on the market. I believe that this book was written for people like me to really understand the next wave in technology. I am by no means a technological savvy person, and that is why I loved this book so much. This book is an overview of broadband for non-technical people and I believe that is all that it is intended to be. Yes, it does have a typo, but if that is all you notice about it, then you really aren't reading the book at all."},{"Title":"The Last Mile: Broadband and the Next Internet Revolution","review":"I was quite surprised how much of a dry, uninformative, redundant book this was. I realize that there were two authors, I don't believe they communicated with each other as many subjects were absolutely repeated several times. In fact the first author referred to Kosmo and the second author referred to Kozmo (both referring to the same company). I brought very little new knowledge from reading this book and would recommend something written by people informed a little more about the subject.Authors were obviously very excited about the subject (and their old company macromedia) however they veered off into subjects that basically repeated any other internet related business book that exists. We get it, the internet is changing the world, you're a little late to the dance! I have to say that they didn't use the book to tout their organization and try to win business (if they did mean to do that, they did a very poor job), which is admirable."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"If you understand academia you will probably get a lot of in jokes. The funniest of the trilogy. I laughed until it hurt. You buy the three in one volume - The 2 1/2 Pillars of Wisdom. It is more cost effective. The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs is off the wall at times, slightly insane, but totally enjoyable.Completely different from his No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"In his never ending quest to maintain his rightful position as the foremost scholar in the Philology Department Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld has been forced to seek an invitation to speak at an American University. It was not going nearly as badly as he had feared, at least it hadn't until he discovered that his hosts were under the impression that he was the other Professor von Ingelfeld, the one who was a veterinarian, an expert on dachshunds, a breed of dogs that this Dr. von Igelfeld, found particularly annoying. It is also a breed that will continue to plague the good professor throughout this volume.Fans of McCall Smith's other series (44 SCOTLAND STREET, NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY etc) will possibly be disappointed in this one. This is an earlier body of work and lacks the overall story arc that even his more episodic series (44 SCOTLAND STREET, CORDUROY STREET) show but are rather more like a group of short stories featuring the same main character.This series, at least in this reader's opinion, is not up to the same level as McCall Smith's other works. I felt that the main character lacks the charm characters, no matter how otherwise flawed, from his other series display. Most of the other characters McCall Smith writes about are people that I would like to know, some more than others but none that I would actively avoid. Dr. Igelfeld though does not show much in the way of redeeming traits. I particularly found his callous treatment of an innocent animal to be totally reprehensible. Yes, I realize that this is a work of fiction but I do not find anything amusing about mutilating an animal in order to avoid embarrassment. I am glad that this is not the first McCall Smith series I have read because if it had been I would have missed his other, much, much better series."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"This book is absolutely ridiculous, and it's dangerous to read. I tried reading it aloud to my dad, who was trying to recover from a stroke, and was warned of what happened to other heart patients. The tale has a timeless quality of vintage idiocy. The license McCall Smith takes in ridiculing other people's cultural and professional quirks goes way beyond any genial ribbing allowed in the Prairie Home Companion. This is a casual wickedness that annihilates the separation between mutually ludicrous souls."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"I have to echo the statement by another reviewer here that this book, and the other two in the series, are not for everyone. I say this because it would seem that the major objection to this work is that it is not another addition to The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency (a wonderful series), nor another addition to the 44 Scotland Street series (another gathering of great reads). No, here the author has offered up something quite different in the person of Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Egelefeld, the author of the much acclaimed \\"Portuguese Irregular Verbs,\\" and his nemesis, Dr. Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer another professor of lesser ability in the field of German philology.Through a grave error, Professor goes to American (Arkansas) to deliver a lecture and finds that he is go address a group of experts and dog breeders at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, not in his field of Romantic languages, but rather on \\"sausage dogs.\\" And so the Doctors troubles begin....To appreciate this work you MUST have an appreciation for understated and very, very dry humor. This work takes to into the rarified world of German academe. The brilliant but stumbling, bumbling, egotistical professor encounters one disaster after another, all of his own making, throughout this short work. At first glance the situations the good doctor puts himself in may sound rather ridiculous but for anyone who is familiar with the workings of higher education will instantly be able to relate and indeed, remember situations which parallel the ones here almost perfectly.The author takes us into a world of pomposity and ego driven characters, many of who spend hours fussing over slight nuances is the wording of professional papers, perceived social insults, and manic competition over matters that the rest of the world; the world of normal people, could care less about.This is not a slap your knee hoot and laugh out loud book, but it is one that will bring a constant smile to your face, a shaking of your head and more than one snicker to your lips.The author's sense of humor is that of a very eccentric Englishman, something I have a feeling is indeed probably is or he could not have thought of some of the things be placed on these pages. You have to have just a bit of a quirky outlook on life to truly appreciate what the author has done here.This is a short book and a rather quick read. The author has written two other short novels in this series and each of them are absolute gems. They include:Portuguese Irregular Verbs: A Professor Dr von Igelfeld Entertainment Novel (1)andAt the Villa of Reduced Circumstancesand do not have to be read in order to appreciate.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"This series continues to grow on me, with this volume providing even more guffaws.

For days I could not listen to a German accent without smiling :-)The book is short, but deliciously comic. McCall Smith's pedantic but very likable protagonists find themselves in all kinds of existential crises. Their very human struggles, set within the minutiae of of day-to-day life, will resonate with anyone who has ever had a benign but annoying co-worker, a seemingly harmless social misunderstanding. The existential crises of modern life, it seems, comes not in overwhelming tidal waves but in small everyday challenges. Nothing dramatic ever happens, yet each moment is filled with drama. Bravo, McCall Smith - well done!"},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"This is a good author. I've read most of his series.

It is not until moments before the speech that he realizes the mistake that has been made and valiantly gives a speech anyway.This is just the beginning.

Will wait anxiously for more in the #1 Ladies series."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"The unlikely adventures of Professor Dr Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld continue in this collection of five stories by Alexander McCall Smith. The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs finds our hero--the renowned author of that philological masterwork Portuguese Irregular Verbs--lecturing on the subject of veterinary medicine at the University of Arkansas (\\"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs\\"), evading man-hungry widows on board a cruise ship (\\"The Perfect Imperfect\\"), and hobnobbing with Vatican bigwigs while vacationing in Italy (\\"The Bones of Father Christmas\\"). His relationship with his nemesis, Dr Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer (the author of a study on the Portuguese imperfect subjunctive, which is not, however, as fine a piece of scholarship as Igelfeld's own monograph), deepens in the course of these stories, despite Igelfeld's unwonted involvement with sausage dogs and as a direct result of the aforementioned widows.The situations into which von Igelfeld stumbles in his life can be inherently amusing: McCall Smith's account of Igelfeld's initial encounter with the Pope in the Vatican Library and the fallout from that meeting are well worth the read. But what makes the series so successful is the character of von Igelfeld. He is both oblivious to the perceptions of those around him and imperturbably convinced of his own self worth. His ego and his personal and academic jealousies inform his actions to a great degree. But at the same time there is a redeeming decency to Igelfeld, a sentimentality, that makes him likeable despite his many character flaws.McCall Smith's von Igelfeld series makes for a good, quietly comic read. Academics in particular will enjoy the author's wry mockery of their world--in which, as Kissinger's famous quip has it, the battles are vicious and the stakes so very small.Debra Hamel -- author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)"},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"If Alexander McCall Smith had stopped with Mma Romotswe's series, he would have gone far to prove he's a great writer with insight into human nature and a fabulous sense of humor.This series, however, shows just how great the depth and diversity of his writing is.These books are absolutely hilarious. While most of the characters are caricatures, the situations, the humor, and the obvious intelligence that went into writing this series just comes shining through.A lot of dry humor, but you will find yourself chuckling out loud."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"Very, very few books make me laugh out loud. This book did. Professor von Igelfield is a great character who isn't above misrepresenting himself in tight situations.Through one such situation he ends up operating on a colleague's Dachsund sausage dog. Tragically, through a series of errors, three of the poor dog's legs end up amputated: \\"An elaborate harness was secured round the dog's body and attached to this were three small wheels. By using its remaining leg as a paddle, the dog could propel itself on its wheels and get anywhere it wished to get. Only very occasionally did the system not work, as had happened once or twice on a hill, when the dog had got out of control and careered down the pavement on its tiny wheels, unable to stop itself, and had ended up on a lawn or in a bush.\\" Thus a feud starts between Dr. von Igelfield and his colleague over the unfortunate state of the dog. A great and fun book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"If you've read the reviews for the printed edition, you have some idea what this book is about. What they don't mention is that the humor is so dry that many (of us Americans, at least) may not laugh too often. It makes Bill Nighy seem like Rip Taylor.That's why I really think the audio book is so great. The reader catches the accents of the characters perfectly, and while his wry tone does not soften the dryness of the humor, it does help to make it come alive."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"This is a brilliant book - and for more than just academics!

I also recommend that you read Portuguese Irregular Verbs first. Without that background, the humor here won't work as well.Professor Doctor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld (as in \\"hedge hog field\\") is a very self-important expert on Portuguese irregular verbs at the Institute of Romance Philology at Regensburg, Germany. We learned in the prior book that he's also a bit insecure about his position within this field. At the end of that book, we discovered that he also harbors a disdain for dachshunds (\\"sausage dogs\\") as being insufficiently noble (he is a \\"von\\" after all). This dislike only reinforces his low opinion of his colleague, Unterholzer, who owns such a creature.As this book opens, the good professor finds himself feeling out of sorts because his colleague and friend, Professor Doctor Doctor Florianus Prinzel, will be making a lecture in the United States before von Igelfeld. Such a blow to his pride is unsupportable, and our professor takes some short cuts to regain precedence in this arena. That decision leads to some unexpected opportunities to meet new people that may leave you laughing aloud as I was did when I read the first story.The second story builds on that humor nicely as the professor receives his American host for a visit to Regensburg. There is a slapstick sequence in this story that had me howling on the floor.The humor levels of the final three stories are lower and take more time to develop, but they are excellent character studies about how someone who has a superiority complex deals with the mundane bumps in the road.In On the Couch, our professor deals with a feud between Unterholzer and him . . . while trying to maintain his commitment to truth.The Bones of Father Christmas is a lengthy story with a delayed punch line that takes the professor back to Italy for an extended visit that puts him in the middle of a Christian controversy that has an unexpected conclusion.The Perfect Imperfect explores how philology becomes a popular subject aboard a cruise ship when our professor takes over.Don't take these stories too literally. They are very exaggerated . . . almost like cartoons in their humor. If you don't like such broad humor, avoid this book . . . especially if you are a dachshund lover.I could see this book, however, being made into a pretty hilarious movie starring Steve Martin."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"Any author who can make me laugh out loud deserves a medal -- give Alexander McCall Smith at least two!

The remainder was not as clever (hence 4 stars, not 5), but eminently entertaining nonetheless. FPSD is a very quick, very light read -- even when read by someone else. Oh, and major kudos to the recorded book reader, whose accents and intonations were hysterical.

However, I immediately went and ordered The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs. The best part about these books is that they are amusing and intelligent. The worst part is there's not a strong story line that runs through them, the books seem more like three or four short stories than one (albeit quite short) book.

His other works can sport dry humor and irony, but this series is off the Richter scale when it comes to dry humor and absurd coincidence.. I loved it and had to share the stories.

The main reason is that McCall Smith's humor is very dry. The delivery is so subtle as to border on the sublime. This sort of absurdist humor about academic life is not for everyone. If you like your humor direct and to the point, this is not the series for you. If you like your humor really dry, this series is a delight.

He causes mayhem on farms in Arkansas, where he is inadvertently confused with the author of \\"Further Studies of Canine Pulmonary Efficiency,\\" Professor Martin Igelfold of the University of Munster. Before his saga is at an end he ends up practicing veterinary medicine without a license, an ill-fated venture that ultimately costs Dr. Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer's dachshund three legs, which are conveniently replaced by wheels. By the end of the book, Walter the sausage dog becomes sanctified by the Coptic church after a misadventure with extreme Christmas implications.Von Igelfeld also undergoes psychotherapy, which is characteristically unproductive, and lectures to elderly vacationers on a cruise ship on such captivating subjects as \\"Portuguese, a Deviant Spanish?,\\" and \\"The Perfect Imperfect.\\" He even manages to insult the Pope in the Vatican library, which leads to a fracas of Papal proportions.Wherever he goes, peculiar mayhem results with hilarious and frequently unpredictable consequences.

Later, this error in identification, which von Igelfeld does not correct, results in disaster (A Leg to Stand on). Next, von Igelfeld becomes quite distressed when his colleague, Dr Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer, writes an unfavorable critique about von Igelfeld's precious book, Portuguese Irregular Verbs. He goes to extremes (how surprising) to undermine his critic and, as usual, makes matters worse for a time (On the Couch). Then there's the trip to Italy for the month of August with friends Professor Dr Dr Florianus Prinzel and his wife, Ophelia. During his travels, he meets some interesting characters and takes on a monumental responsibility which, of course, he handles badly (The Bones of Father Christmas). Finally, he decides to go on a lecture cruise, not because he likes them or is honored to have been invited to lecture (actually, he hates cruises), but because both Unterholzer and Prinzel declare how delighted each would be to take his place. What transpires is true von Igelfeld! (The Perfect Imperfect)If you expect the von Igelfeld series to be the same as The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, you are in error.

He highlights the pomposity, arrogance and constant quest for self-recognition that characterizes the avocation. With tremendous aplomb, McCall Smith relates the misadventures of Herr Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, a professor of \\"Romance Philology.\\" His great work of academic achievement in his lifetime is a respected book called \\"Portuguese Irregular Verbs.\\"While his specialty and achievement are surely somewhat esoteric and of interest mostly to academicians, rather than regular people, the book presents multiple situations in which Dr. von Igelfeld presents his specialty to regular people. As per the title of the book; the good \`Doktor' presents a lecture on \\"Sausage Dogs\\" or as we know them better, \\"Dachshunds,\\" in an attempt to get American recognition. Interestingly, he thought he was to speak on \\"Portuguese Irregular Verbs\\" but with a little last minute adjustment, the Professor does in fact give a lecture on \\"Sausage Dogs.\\"In the book, it is the interrelation of this \\"Ivory Tower\\" mindset and the more mundane mindset of people outside this environment that McCall Smith concentrates on illustrating. He keenly shows the reader the almost \`back-biting' environment internal to academic life, and then, more specifically and graphically, shows us the way in which one of these academics relates, or fails to relate, to normal people in a world outside of academia. As can be expected, this combination results in some extremely amusing outcomes.Smith is in good form in this book, although it is not one of his best. Nonetheless, devotees of the Alexander McCall Smith multiple scenarios and other works, will find this book quite in line with the McCall Smith they have grown to know and love."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs picks up where Portuguese Irregular Verbs leaves off.

Hilarious stories about our protagonist, the Romance philologist Professor Dr Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, his colleagues, and their adventures in the arcane world of Romance philology.Dr von Igelfeld finagles a visit to the US as a guest lecturer, as always, in search of the recognition he so ardently desires. Unfortunately, the exchange program he worked with got him mixed up with a Dr Igelfold, who is in quite a different field of study. Von Igelfeld bluffs his way through his lecture, but is then forced to operate on a sausage dog, with pretty gruesome results. The dog becomes a main player in another story, this one of shadow and intrigue in the Coptic Church under the watchful \\"ten thousand eyes\\" of Rome.And so it goes as we follow Dr von Igelfeld around the globe on misadventure after misadventure, as he tries to handle each sticky situation with Teutonic aplomb.I laughed out loud, and I wasn't even feeling like laughing when I picked the book up. Like the other books in this series (At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances is the third), \\"Sausage Dogs\\" is very short and light to read. Make sure you read all three!"},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs by Alexander McCall Smith is part of a trilogy of books about von Inglefeld, the obscure professor of philology (study of word origins) and author of the ultimate work, Portugese Irregular Verbs. (This also happens to be the title of another of the books in the series.) While the latter is an amusing book, The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs had me laughing out loud so often and so long that my stomach muscles actually began to hurt! It is a series of short tales, so I really can't even give you a taste of what is in store for you wihtout giving the fun away. I'm currently working on the last book of the series, At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances, and finding it nearly as funny. You don't need to read these stories in order but they are all fun and very short (about 120 pages) so go ahead. DO NOT read these books if you love Precious and the #1 Ladies Detective Agancy and are looking for more of the same. They are completely different."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"I have read these books. I really enjoyed them. Then I listened to Paul Hecht reading the books. Extremely entertaining. Tripled my fun. This is my first review. I felt compelled to share my enthusiasm for the audio-books."},{"Title":"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs","review":"This book is the second in a trilogy about the unexpected misadventures of Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld of the Institute of Romance Philology. Prof. von Igelfeld has been ensconced in the sheltered walls of academia a bit too long for his own good. Whenever he interacts with the world outside, amusingly horrifying things happen. But the professor manages to blunder through in Mr. McGoo-like fashion, avoiding any serious pitfalls and mishaps.Von Igelfeld initially gets himself into trouble because he feels that he must get a public speaking job in order to compete with a rival colleague. As luck would have it, due to a similarity in names, von Igelfeld, a romance languages philologist, is mistaken for a deceased veterinarian named Professor Igelfold, an authority on the Sausage Dog. It apparently never occurs to von Igelfeld to admit to any mistake, even one that was obviously someone else's, so he decides to go ahead with the charade. This leads to a rather gruesome mistake that has repercussions later in the story.I thought that this was a delightful little book. McCall Smith nicely and humorously skewers the worlds of academia, the upper class and organized religion. This book works as a stand-alone volume; it is not necessary to read the trilogy in order."},{"Title":"The Digital Darkroom: Black and White Techniques Using Photoshop","review":"I was completely disappointed in this work. It contains only a general discussion at the very most basic level. It has no techniques, no helpful illustrations, and no description relating the digital process to the chemical process. There was nothing in this book that I could use to improve my scans, to correct contrast, to pull the most out of poor negatives, or to fix problem shots."},{"Title":"The Digital Darkroom: Black and White Techniques Using Photoshop","review":"I read some of the other reviews, mainly negative but bought this book anyway as it is one of the few books dealing with digital BW photography.I found this book to be quite instructional. I agree that there is a lack of detailed instructions. However, I believe that training people how to use photoshop was not a goal of Mr. Schaub. One should have a good grasp of how to &quot;fix&quot; and manipulate photos in photoshop before using this book. A good photoshop book or class is in order before this text.That said, I found the brief but concise directions for each technique very helpful when planning manipulation for my own BW photos. There are many examples shown with precise descriptions of what was done to achieve the noted results. Before and after photos are shown in each instance.I give this book a big but conditional thumbs up. If your are serious about digital BW photography and have a working knowledge digital photography and photoshop in particular, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Digital Darkroom: Black and White Techniques Using Photoshop","review":"Despite the somewhat lowest common denominator intro, this book is not for Photoshop beginners. It lacks the step by step hand holding which beginners often feel they need (and the other reviewers seem to be looking for -- there are lots of other books on Photoshop to fill that niche). Instead, this book is about looking at your black and white negatives/scans and helping you envision what you can be done with your images. Photoshop gives the black &amp; white printer much more power and control over the image then is available in a wet darkroom but it takes more then a skills tutorial to help you reach that point. I like that The Digital Darkroom suggests what can be done rather then marching you lock step through a fixed set of procedures. Your understanding of Photoshop and the quality of your images will be rewarded by the extra work and thought that this approach requires."},{"Title":"The Digital Darkroom: Black and White Techniques Using Photoshop","review":"If you know very few of Photoshop,this is a good book for you.If you are an advanced user,trying to aquire new skills on BW processing,forget it.

Many years ago, Wallace MacCaffrey, teaching Modern European History at Haverford College, said this about the intellectual revolution of the 17th century: \\"Medieval life rested on two bases: religious authority, which rested on ultimate revelation, to which was added the authority of the church.....By the late Middle Ages the intellectual tradition had broadened. There was no organized attempt on the part of the church to check this movement....Differences between Christian thought and Greek thought were not too well pointed up. By the end of the 15th century there was a psychological contempt for the institution of the church, although no explosion as such had taken place. Rather, a loss of confidence gradually set in.....\\"After the Reformation, there was an opportunity for new ideas. Also there were many new ideas about religion itself.....not limiting the discussion to Christianity... Instead of revelation there came to be a body of knowledge that squared with human experience. By the end of the 17th century a new recovery of confidence had set in....Newtonian physics became the Gospel of the Enlightenment.....There even became a science of man....\\"This introductory statement by Wallace MacCaffrey might put Basil Willey's magnificent book in perspective. Willey writes in great detail about the upsetting of the concept of the ancient and medieval three-story universe, replacing it with a new confidence in nature and a new confidence in religion and literature to express realities beyond nature. Surprisingly, the 17th century worked out a synthesis, so that religion and science were not really antagonistic, sparring enemies, but partners in discovering, and discussing, Truth in its many manifestations. John Milton, \\"Paradise Lost\\" is perhaps the epitome of what had happened. It was even considered to have surpassed ancient literature in splendor and insight. Also, Willey discusses the philosophies of Thomas Hobbes, Rene Descartes, John Locke, and others as he enables the reader to come to grips with the revolutions occurring in Western thought.This is an extremely helpful read.....I bought another copy from Amazon to replace my original copy ---by now battered and worn from all its use in the past 58 years....

I enjoyed his clear style of writing so well that I bought and cannot wait to read his The Eighteenth Century Background."},{"Title":"Semantics, Tense, and Time: An Essay in the Metaphysics of Natural Language","review":"In this book, Ludlow develops a semantic argument for presentism, the austere version of the A-theory according to which nothing but the present exists. He claims that neither physical theory nor a priori metaphysics can settle the question of whether pastness, presentness, and futurity are objective features of the world, and so turns to the semantics of tense to settle the issue. Ludlow's thesis is that, since natural language is irreducibly tensed, time must be tensed, too.Ludlow argues that only presentism can handle the indexical character of temporal discourse. He offers versions Smith's, Craig's, and Prior's arguments against the token-reflexive semantics, which was defended by most B-theorists until the 1980's. He also defends presentism against the objection that it cannot account for reference to past and future, by developing a theory of E-type temporal anaphora. He treats past statements as evidentials and future statements as modals, thus committing himself only to presently existing things.Ludlow's theory is highly original and his book is worth reading for anyone interested in tense and time. However, it has several major shortcomings. The most glaring problem is that he never bothers to argue for the crucial premise that the world tracks semantics, nor even specify how semantics can provide information unavailable from other domains. Second, he engages in vague hand-waving at many crucial points, for instance, in the section arguing against the new theory of time. Third, his linguistic evidence is often dubious. Finally, the book is full of stylistic infelicities and typographical and factual errors. For instance, he assumes that presentism is the same thing as the A-theory, when in fact it is only one version of the A-theory. The book's many errors make it unnecessarily confusing.Despite these criticisms, the book is a valuable contribution to the philosophy of language and the metaphysics of time. In particular, Ludlow's theory of E-type temporal anaphora and his unique version of presentism deserve serious consideration."},{"Title":"Semantics, Tense, and Time: An Essay in the Metaphysics of Natural Language","review":"For a reader with philosophical interests, Ludlow's _Semantics, Tense, and Time_ should be one of the most interesting works in natural language semantics to have come out in recent years. It develops a semantics of tense, temporal anaphora and a few other things within the framework of a Davidsonian &quot;absolute&quot; truth theory, with an eye toward the nature of time. (Quite frankly, I didn't know exactly what McTaggart's &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B series&quot; were before I read this book.) It incorporates many acute observations along the way, not related to tense or time -- remarks about proper names, for example, that I found agreeable and wished had been pursued further. Perhaps in another book. The formal theory of the book is familiar from Larson and Segal's formidable texbook _Knowledge of Meaning_. The syntax is generative grammar."},{"Title":"How Much Is That Couple In The Window? (Silhouette Yours Truly)","review":"Mr. & Mrs. for a week.

Kantor assures readers that this stage of disillusionment is inevitable and that it's how we use our disillusionment that makes the difference. I like his case histories. They're very detailed and I can relate to the people. I alo liked the couple of short stories at the end. What a neat way to show how his technique works from beginning to end."},{"Title":"My Lover, Myself","review":"&quot;The couples to whom I have recommended this book all had a similar response after reading it: they identified with the couples and the issues described in the book, went through an initial crisis, and as a result of that crisis had a major breakthrough in their relationship leading to a much deeper understanding of each other's myths, more compassion for each other, a renewed commitment to their relationship and a more satisfying, passionate sex life.

Others have wisdom but little savvy. MY LOVER, MYSELF has both savvy and wisdom. I'm testing the word &quot;brilliant&quot;, but must qualify it--some brilliant books are bright on the surface, like a flash bulb, but yours is a lighthouse. It illuminates Stygian darkness, as you are fond of saying, not only the Stygian opacity of bewildered couples grappling in the dark, but also the Cimmerian gloom of our culture, which guarantees ignorance in the pursuit of bliss. Durable relationships are enormously complex, you demonstrate, and you proceed to make them intelligible. The tone of the book is perfect- cheerful and optimistic, tempting the reader to believe the daunting task of loving mindfully might be a pleasure. You are one of the most confident and successful people I know, and that spirit pervades the writing. It's an important book David, and I think it will be studied and talked about for a long time. Your way of being a bystander is not as a passive observer. You are an active member in hundreds of struggles, actively feeling their yearnings, participating with love and confidence. I found many of the cases moving, and more than once they brought me to tears. This is a generous book, a gift to the reader. You speak from abundance, and in these pages your wealth of experience is a treasure. The book is lucid and eloquent, well paced and a pleasure to read. -Vic Walter"},{"Title":"My Lover, Myself","review":"You know as well as I do, that every author in this field has the magic &quot;phrase&quot;, &quot;touch&quot;, or &quot;plan&quot;, even to the point of describing men and women as coming from different planets. And in these works, a lot of blame is foisted on environment, upbringing, etc.What is refreshing about Kantor's explanation and experiences, is that the truth seems nothing more than what YOU feel and what YOU expect to feel about YOUR life and the relations YOU make within it. Face it, you've been betrayed as a child, you have expectations on how to recover from that betrayal, and you want your partner to represent that Hero who will rescue you from that situation so it never happens again. Unlike other works, he doesn't dwell on the mysticism of it all. He gives his diagnoses in frank, straightforward prose. I appreciated this approach.I really liked Kantors questions on how to start to reveal your betrayals and your expectations to yourself. To get you thinking about your distant past, your relationship with your parents, he has you remember not only what your parents did or said to you, but how you remember them smelling. Wow, this is powerful stuff.Having written that, I believe you have to be in the right frame of mind to get anything out of this book. I mean, a closed mind is closed and reading this work won't open it.For those suspecting that they can do better with their partners or even the people around them, and needing a new path to explore, dive in to this pool.

The discussion about our &quot;shadows&quot; was so important because for the first time in my life I understood my own behavior and what kinds of things trigger shadow behavior for me. The only thing that seemed unrealistic is that of all the examples Dr. Kantor used regarding relationships with couples he had worked with, the results were almost always positive if the couple was married; rarely did the couple actually split up and I remember one of the only couples who did split up were only engaged, not married. That's great if that's how this has really worked, but I suspect he left out stories about couples who ended up deciding not to stay together."},{"Title":"My Lover, Myself","review":"This book is a must buy for anyone who is, or wants to be, married.

This is NOT a Rick Steves' \\"what to see, where to stay and where to eat\\" book. From a starting point (moving West to East across N. Italy), it gives a series of drives and lists towns and \\"sights\\" on those routes. For us this was great - we drove many of the routes, adding to and leaving out based on the weather and what we wanted to do and see - and we had a great time. For us, this book was a super helpful starting point.So why not 5 stars?! - well, even with a GPS (and you will want a GPS in Italy - and it is cheaper to purchase one or buy a chip for Italy rather than rent one if you are there for 2 weeks!) let's just say that it is a fairly thin book and you have to have a bit of a sense of adventure as some of the descriptions/directions are also a bit \\"thin\\".

The author takes you on a journey through several different delusions and gives very good background information and, at times, links this background to the present.

As a psychiatric nurse, it gave me a deeper understanding as to what my patients are going through."},{"Title":"WHISPERS: The Voices of Paranoia","review":"&quot;Whispers: The Voices of Paranoia&quot; is hands-down one of the best books that I have ever read. Dr. Ronald Siegel, Ph.D., a forensic psychopharmacologist, is an incredible writer and an even better story-teller. His journey into the paranoid mind is enlightening, vivid, and dangerous. As Dr. Siegel unfolds each case study, the reader is thrown into the suspense, analyzing and foreshadowing the devious behavioral manifestations of the paranoid mind. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in psychiatry, clinical neuropsychology, forensic psychology, or simply a good, non-fiction suspense trip.You will finish this book in less than a week. I simply could not put it down and have since gone on to order all of Dr. Siegel's books."},{"Title":"WHISPERS: The Voices of Paranoia","review":"I bought the book whispers while casually shopping in a local bookstore earlier this year. I was at that time, in a class taught by a recent graduate in psychiatry. She made the concepts of basic human behavior interesting and challenging. As most would suspect, the mental state and motivation of people is important in law. Dr. Siegel, in his analysis of criminally insane patients, is fascinating reading for anyone. His status as a resreach scientist allowed him to closely examine patients with mental abnormalities. I could not put the book down until it was completely finished. Dr. siegel presents his cases in terms that laymen can understand. The book is concise, contains some adventure, and is somewhat humorous at times. I will read it again undoubtedly. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has a friend or relative suffering from mental disorders or substance abuse issues.

However, it doesn't take the most critical of thinkers to realize that Siegel may be embellishing the facts a little.Don't take my word for it read the book, and you may find some of his stories to be a little far fetched. Like the last story of the book (Paranoid Express) in which Siegel locks himself in a train cart, snorts cocaine, pisses in his pants, and suffers blistering heat, for three days, just to experience what Mario N. goes through in his final days before being arrested. The unbelievable part, is that the police go along with Siegel's little experiment. They bring him food, change audio tapes, and deliver messages in the same way they did with Mario N. for three days. I don't think there is a federal government alive who would go to such great lengths to accommodate a professor who wanted to get coked up to prove that a murderer was paranoid at the time.Don't get me wrong \\"Whispers\\" is an interesting read and a page turner, but they way Siegel ties his cases together like the game \\"six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon\\", is a little worrisome. You have this little nagging feeling in the back of your brain that says \\"if he went to such great lengths to embellish how the 12 paranoids were connected or what he did to understand their pain\\", then maybe he embellished their cases as well.If that doesn't bother you, then by all means get the book."},{"Title":"WHISPERS: The Voices of Paranoia","review":"This book is so exciting that it is hard to believe it is non-fiction at times.

When one after anotherasserts that his thoughts are besieged from the outside, and when we,without giving it much thought, let these thousands, one after theother, go the way of the lunatic asylum solely because of the madnessof their assertion, then possibly we, who are unable to see thepartial truth in the remarkable repetition of a phenomenon, standaccused of a rigid psyche as veil.\\".......... from the book INTROGENESIS by Immanuel Velikovsky (1936), aRussian psychiatrist"},{"Title":"WHISPERS: The Voices of Paranoia","review":"The basis of a good researcher is neutrality and reserve, keeping a distance between themselves and the subjects whose lives they are studying.

This novel would have been fantastic as just a love story between the chaperone and earl - but the subplot with the ghosts really took down the overall quality of the story and seems like it was only included so the author could show off her knowledge of British history in the appendix. The saving grace was that at least the ghost scenes were not particularly frequent. If they'd been eliminated all together, I definitely would have given this 5 stars!!!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Bride","review":"A good plot. A quick easy read if you like Regency romances, which I do.

Twice I ready to forget about it but I hate to leave things undone. It seemed to drag, making it seemed too long. It starts out a man puting on a disguise to go undercover to find out which young lady would be his wife. The ghosts make theirselves known, Queen Isabella, Mortimer her lover, and later King Edward her husband. Still under disguise he (Simon) decides on Felicity Biddle then throw in her father and mother's problems with their marriage into the mix. While at the castle Amanda starts to have feelings for him and he is confused but all this time he ignores his bride to be. She in turns spends too much time in library with Steven and let us not forget Julian LeFevre who shows up to look for papers concerning his birth. The ghosts trying to have possess any of the people at the castle who are making love. Too much!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Bride","review":"The perfect bride.... Is a must read absolutely brilliant love story.... u will get ur moneys worth from the read...Eileen Putnam's. Writing style is absolutely. Refreshing. A must read.."},{"Title":"The Perfect Bride","review":"I really enjoyed The Perfect Bride. Although I must admit that I have a particular fondness for the 'on the shelf' historical romance novels. The heroine of these stories, like Amanda, are genuinely stronger than the bobble-head society women who are more sought after. My favorite part has to be the different disguises worn by the Earl, it was a bit of a nod to the palm reader in Jane Eyre.The one downside I found, however, was the ghost subplot. While I understand that it (somewhat)helped to set the scene for the castle's background, I found that it kind of took me away from the mood building up in the story itself. It's the only reason I didn't give this book 5 full stars. However for a free book, I was very pleased."},{"Title":"Sketches in Holland and Scandinavia,","review":"\\"You see but you do not observe. The distinction is clear,\\" Sherlock Holmes once complained to Watson. And never more so, he might have added, than in travel writing. The powers of observation and description set travel literature apart from the mere tourist guide. That sums up why people still read Holmes' contemporary Augustus Hare 100 years after his death: his literary quality. In this volume, he takes us to the Netherlands and Scandinavia -- then as now somewhat down the list of major tourist destinations, but picturesque and (best of all for Hare) full of stories. You don't need to be familiar with these lands yourself to enjoy Hare's impressions. This slim, readable book would be right at home on a nightstand or in a guest room for pleasant browsing."},{"Title":"Cycling For Profit: How to make a living with your bicycle (Cycling Resources Series)","review":"The delivery of small packages by bicycle - the courier or messenger business - has a continuous history as old as the bicycle itself. In the twentieth century the role played by bicycles in delivering larger cargoes has been eroded by motor vehicles. As motor traffic finally limits its own speed in the city to that of the machines it replaced, the specialist load-carrying bicycle has made a comeback.This book is the first how-to manual to emerge from the contemporary 'workbike' phenomenon. There are some pamphlets aimed at prospective bicycle delivery operators published by Detour, but this is an attempt to produce a more comprehensive reference.The author of this book runs a bicycle delivery firm in Iowa, USA. Consequently, much of the advice is US-centric, such as details of tax law and insurance. However, the advice is still useful to people outside the USA because it gives the reader an idea of the kind of things they should be considering before starting in business.The author covers the obvious areas such as selection of equipment and marketing your prospective service, but also offers the benefit of his experience on keeping a business viable and the recruitment and retention of staff, two areas where most workbike business failures occur.A large proportion of the book is dedicated to real-life examples of workbikes in use that have proved successful. It begins with the kind of jobs that you can do without much special equipment, such as inner-city pizza, airline ticket and pharmaceutical deliveries, where speed - and therefore the lack of need to find a place to park a motor vehicle - are critical.The book goes on to detail the ins and outs of grocery, printed matter and furniture delivery. Recyclable material collection is well covered, and mobile bike repair, lawn mowing and window cleaning get a mention too. Ice cream vending, that traditional British use for a workbike, is mentioned in passing - the Canadian operator interviewed for the book has a fleet of twelve hundred trikes.Pedicabs - bicycle taxis - are covered, including the critical information about local laws that often forbid their use, or make them unviable. There is a view, concurrent with the idea of 'motor vehicle as liberation', that the workbike is backward and a form of exploitation, and must therefore be eliminated. Unfortunately, this aspect of anti-bike legislation is something we've recently exported globally, threatening the literal survival of thousands of becak operators in Indonesia alone. It's especially ironic that pedicabs are now seen every night in London, just as the authorities are clamping down on them in Jakarta.The author admits to his interest as a manufacturer of trailers in the trike or quad bike versus trailer controversy. Three or four wheel bike advocates point to the greater stability and braking performance of their vehicles, while trailer fans boast how they can quickly detach the extra wheels when a small delivery is called for. It's a debate which is unlikely to be resolved.The book contains a few typos, but as the only book of its' kind so far, it is required reading for anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Cycling For Profit: How to make a living with your bicycle (Cycling Resources Series)","review":"...then this is the book for you.

Mr. Aslett covered weekly cleaning, spring cleaning, painting, carpet cleaning, window cleaning, stain removal and many other cleaning topics too numerous to mention.

The author owns a cleaning business and shares tips on how to very efficiently and effectively both clean and de-clutter your home. He also discusses ways to keep the house from getting dirty to start with. I've used his tips for years now and have just re-read my copy of this and refreshed my memory [and got even more ideas!].The author also writes very humorously, so it is an easy and fun book to read.

This book would be a great gift for newlyweds."},{"Title":"Is There Life After Housework?","review":"I always enjoy reading Don Aslett books. He is an excellent writer with a keen ability to keep the reader interested while imparting cleaning and organization wisdom. Having owned and managed businesses I thought I knew quite a few professional secrets, but Don was able to teach me even more secrets and give me the little push I needed to step things up a notch. One thing I find quite funny is that he only mentions wearing shoes while cleaning once in the book, which is so important, even at home. It can save you from slips, plus your feet will not be tired at the end of the day if you wear proper shoes. However he mentions time and time again to use a lambswool duster to remove cobwebs. I found that to be enduring and cute as obviously cobwebs are a pet peeve of his.This book is ideal for people wishing to do a better job cleaning their house in less time, semi-professional and professional cleaners, as well as those looking to enter the cleaning business. The final chapter is so eloquent and from the heart it made the book worth so much more than just a cleaning book. Filled with humor, wisdom, and tried and true cleaning methods, this book is sure to delight all readers who care about a clean environment.One thing I should add is that there is a newer edition of this book. For the few extra dollars, I would recommend the newer version for more up to date information."},{"Title":"Is There Life After Housework?","review":"If you've ever wondered how to remove a stain, clean your carpet, or de-lime your shower, it's because you don't have this book.

His recommendations on getting the house to clean itself have saved me hours of housework."},{"Title":"Is There Life After Housework?","review":"I bought the Kindle edition, and this material is exactly what I was looking for.

I've bought several of Don's products on QVC and have been extremely satisfied with every single one, so I expected no less from his written cleaning guides.But the Kindle conversion is AWFUL. Charts do not appear anywhere near what they should look like, so snippets of info aren't really associated with any particular item. Entire sentences are run together without a single space between words. So far every place where there's been a word in italics, there is no space between it and the following word. Pictures are repeated. The first letter of a paragraph might show up above a picture with the rest of the word below the picture, or the first letter might be on one page and the rest of the word on another page. Changing font sizes or line lengths on the Kindle doesn't help. This appears to be a very very bad conversion. Of the dozens and dozens and dozens of Kindle books I have, I've only encountered one other one where the conversion was so bad it was next to impossible to read. Now I'll have to pay to buy a second printed copy I guess.I highly recommend the PRINTED version of this book so far, but avoid the Kindle version."},{"Title":"Is There Life After Housework?","review":"i bought this book about ten years ago and really learned a lot of what most would consider basic skills! my mom kept our home perfectly clean. and as a kid my chores where do the dinner dishes, unload the drier and dust the living room furniture. and whenever i got in trouble, to clean my room. (which always consisted of shoving anything under the bed or in the closet!) she died when i was 15 and i was on my own. so i never really learned how to keep house. later in life i couldn't figure out how to keep my places in order. luckily my best friend and i lived together for several years and she knew how to orgainize and clean so she did most of it if we didn't have a cleaner come in. but, after she married and moved out i was again on my own. thankfully i had the money then to hire cleaners.. but, later when i couldn't afford to hire anyone i realized i didn't know what to do. I REALLY didn't know how to clean! i didn't know how to mop properly etc...just so many things. but this book taught me exactly how to do it! step by step. i especially remember how it said to mop the edges first and to let the product do the cleaning. eventually i lost this book and i went online and bought the updated one. but, i didn't like it as much as the first one. one example is the newer one doesn't have the same step by step on mopping. also in this older version, there is more info on the very few (I THINK 3) differnt cleansers and how to get them. i think the newer one is more focused on selling the products he sells on his website. so it isn't as clear about the purpose of the products and how ingredients in products work. and so, that's why i'm back to get this older one agian. this book is so informative for someone that wants thier home cleaned properly and quickly!"},{"Title":"Is There Life After Housework?","review":"I bought the Kindle edition of this book, and it was absolutely worthless.

Maybe Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream, but that's about it. For me, a book that reads well to large screaming hoards of five-year-olds is worth its weight in gold. I don't know how I missed the publication of \\"Old Cricket\\" back in 2003, but I give you my solemn word of honor that it will rarely find itself anywhere but in my finest storytime collection from now on.On a fine clear morning Old Cricket wakes up on the wrong side of bed. He's feeling particularly cantankerous and his missus tells him in no uncertain terms to fix the roof. \\"You don't get to be an old cricket by being a dumb bug\\" the text informs us, so Cricket makes up an imaginary creak in his knee to get out of the job. While en route to the doctor (or so his wife thinks) he meets up with his cousin, Katydid. She asks him to help pick some berries off the bush, but Old Cricket adds a fake crick in his neck to accompany the supposed creak in his knee. You see where this is going. Ants ask him to help them bring in the last of the corn and a crack in his back is the additional malady. It's only when he meets up with Old Crow who wants to eat him that his tricks no longer work (\\"You don't get to be an old crow by being a birdbrain\\") and he develops every physical ailment that he invented in the process of running away. In the end, Cricket does visit Doc Hopper (who's name will remind certain members of my generation of the villain in \\"The Muppet Movie\\", I'm sure) and is cured. So it's homeward to fix the roof and a happy ending for one and all.The text reads aloud beautifully with lots of different voices, plenty of \\"cricks\\" \\"creaks\\" and \\"cracks\\" to sound out the text, and a fast-paced chase sequence for those who weren't paying attention at the beginning. Author Lisa Wheeler has slowly been making a name for herself and I look forward to reading other titles of hers like \\"Sailor Moo\\". The repetition in this book works beautifully for younger readers and I daresay this would make an excellent storytelling tale sans book if it came to that.Not that you should forget about the gorgeous pictures accompanying the text. Rendered in acrylic paints, artist Ponder Goembel (who's first name I may well steal for my own child someday) throws her back into this book. Every animal here is rendered realistically with a kind of gently shaded sheen. Leaves sport natural holes and bites, and though every animal (with the exception of the nudist ants) wears clothing in this tale, it never looks unnatural or out of place. Old Cricket, for example, doffs a worn red cap and what looks to be a fisherman's vest when he goes out into the world. I especially enjoyed the little details that appeared here and there. Old Cricket has only one antennae, a fact that becomes crystal clear when he and the missus (also lacking that particular protuberance) pose in a final touching shot. Even if your child is not reading on their own yet, they'll be delightedly poring through this book for hours and hours on end.I certainly hope that \\"Old Cricket\\" won itself a fair share of awards the year it came out. This book needs to be on every reading list in the country for kids below the age of... oh say.... 72. Funny, fine, and frantic, it is the kind of book every author of folktales hopes to write and so few actually do."},{"Title":"Old Cricket","review":"This book was absolutely great.

They can be frustrating at times, but force you to think in ways that are new and very helpful, even at times exciting. However, it is true that, especially if the reader has never met or taken a class with Napoli, there are certain learning styles that will have trouble with this book. It's all inductive reasoning, and Napoli does not always follow a linear organization, so if the reader is the type of learner who likes to have things laid out in a very clear, systematic manner, or who is easily distracted and frustrated by tangents, they will have difficulty with this book. For the rest of us, the tangents can be fascinating. Finally, it should be noted that there are no &quot;answers&quot; provided for the problem sets; they are exercises in reasoning, but if you get stuck there's nothing to peek at. There are, however, references cited for the problem sets in the bibliography.The best thing about Donna Jo in my opinion is that, unlike other syntacticians, she doesn't tell you things. She makes you come up with your own ideas, and discard them if they turn out to be invalid. I bought the book and inted to keep it."},{"Title":"Syntax: Theory and Problems","review":"It's been more than a decade since I had to buy this book for a graduate syntax class. I had already read all three of Andrew Radford's Cambridge books on the subject, so this was a real let down. In fact, the instructor of the class noted how there were, in 1994, more used copies than new ones of this relatively new, at the time, book: \\"as if no one's keeping it for a reference.\\" She changed to a different text the next time she taught the course.I have spent the intervening years teaching myself, and this book still wins the award for the worst linguistics book I've ever owned. SRVAUTP means Same Relative Value As Used Toilet Paper (post-anal application).

Focusing on General Binding Theory, Napoli leads us to conclusions through inductive learning methods. This gets very frustrating at times for students because it seems that she never actually tells the reader anything; merely waits for them to discover everything without too much help. She also has some very unorthodox views of basic syntactic categories (such as Indirect Objects) that can be very disconcerting to the innocent Linguistics student. Many students find this book frustrating and annoying, but do learn an awful lot by the end, if they can make it that far."},{"Title":"Syntax: Theory and Problems","review":"Habt ihr meine grune gurke gesehen?

However, nobody can deny that he is smarter than everyone around him, as he proves in this, the second Charlie Chan mystery. The murder mystery revolves around a mysterious millionaire, a valuable necklace, and a parrot who speaks of murder before being killed. Chan is confined to supporting character status for the most of the book, as Bob Eden, the jeweler's son who tags along for the ride, takes the lead; while Chan disguises himself as a servent in the millionaire's house, Eden is out romancing, discovering clues and making friends. This leads for an EXTREMELY leisurely mystery - since Eden, not Chan is the main character here. Still, the book is charming, full of pleasant characters, witty lines (&quot;Golf has ruined more good men than whiskey.&quot;) and an endearing, smoking-room atmosphere. And the ending is a doozy. A fully competent mystery."},{"Title":"The Chinese parrot (Pocket books)","review":"In recent years it has become fashionable to decry Charlie Chan as distastefully stereotypical. In truth, at the time the character was a marked departure from Asian characters as typically depicted in both fiction and film, which tended toward a \\"Fu Manchu\\" point of view. And it may startle detractors to learn that Chan was loosely based on an actual person: the legendary Chang Apana (1887-1933), a Hawaiian police officer of Chinese heritage who preferred a bullwhip to a gun and was noted for his fearlessness in dealing with criminals engaged in the opium trade.In the hands of Biggers, the character emerges as a considerably more thoughtful, more formal personality--and one capable of unraveling elaborate crimes. Originally published in 1926, THE CHINESE PARROT is the second of Bigger's Chan novels, and it finds Chan employed by aging and impoverished socialite Sally Phillimore Jordan to transport her last valuble possession from Hawaii to San Francisco: a string of remarkable pearls. When the Phillimore pearls are sold to the wealthy and powerful P.J. Madden, Chan agrees to deliver them personally... but upon arriving at Madden's desert home he finds the circumstances unexpectedly suspicious.THE CHINESE PARROT pairs Chan with Bob Eden, son of the jeweler who has brokered the sale, and the result is more of a romantic adventure than a mystery per se--and modern readers will smile a bit over such impossibilities as a parrot that learns an entire string of words after hearing a single repetition. Even so, it has a considerable charm, Biggers writes with a light touch, and while some of the author's attitudes are clearly a bit naive, he never treats Chan with anything less than complete respect. An entertaining and generally enjoyable cultural artifact from a more innocent era; recommended to Chan fans everywhere.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Chinese parrot (Pocket books)","review":"Sally Jordan is a Honolulu heiress who is forced to sell a valuable set of pearls. The pearls are sold to Wall Street financier P.J. Madden through a local jeweler named Alexander Eden. The plan is to deliver the pearls to Madden in New York City.

Charlie and Bob learn en route that there has been a change of plans and the pearls will now be taken to Madden's ranch in the California desert. Charlie is suspicious and decides to send Bob ahead to the ranch without the pearls while he arrives later disguised as a Chinese cook. The Chinese Parrot was produced as a silent film by Universal in 1926 with the role of Chan played by Kamiyama Sojin, a Japanese actor."},{"Title":"The Chinese parrot (Pocket books)","review":"This was the second Charlie Chan book I read. I thought it was interesting. Easy and quick reading.I like Biggers style of narrating the story. He seems to focus on a main character other than Charlie Chan. Charlie is kind of a supporting character who helps the leading character solve the mystery."},{"Title":"The Chinese parrot (Pocket books)","review":"In this, the second of the six Charlie Chan books that the author wrote, the enigmatic Detective Chan of the Honolulu police, undertakes a special mission for Honolulu heiress, Sally Jordan, now down on her luck. Ms. Jordan has just sold a string of valuable heirloom pearls through the venerable firm of an old friend, Alexander Eden. She entrusts Detective Chan, along with Mr. Eden's son, Bob, to deliver the pearls to its new owner, millionaire businessman, P. J. Madden, who has bought the pearls for his daughter, Evelyn. Along the way, things do not appear to be what they seem, so delivery is delayed and another mystery is thrust upon Detective Chan.This is not one of the best of the Charlie Chan mysteries, but it is, nonetheless, still enjoyable. The problem with the book is simply that those hungry for Charlie Chan will find that in this book he plays more of a secondary role. The focus tends to be more on Bob Eden, who is busy doing some investigating himself, as well as falling in love with the lovely Paula Wendell, a location finder for the film industry. There is also a murder to be solved, but the question is whose?This book was written in 1926, so the reader should keep in mind the historical context out of which it arose. Some of it is a little anachronistic, as well as politically incorrect, reflecting the social mores and customs of a bygone era. While fans of Charlie Chan may be disappointed at his somewhat secondary role in this book, they will still find it worth reading, as Charlie Chan is one of the best fictional detectives ever created."},{"Title":"Goth's Dark Empire","review":"I have to take some issue with Anja Flower's review of Goth's Dark Empire. I read Carol Siegel's book very much from a British experience of Goth and Gothic culture (and that limited), and so I do have issues with (as Anja says) Carol's strong linkage of that culture with resistance to mainstream American identification and representation of sex and sexual identity. That certainly isn't what I find in Britain - here Goths seem to be fairly representative of the rest of the population, and even, if anything, rather conservative in their sexual habits. Nor do I know much about Deleuze-Guattari psychological analysis, and I don't think very highly of such theories anyway. But that aside, I was pleasantly surprised to find 'Goth's Dark Empire' very readable, and, so far as it goes, insightful in its discussion of the various products of the Goth culture it deals with. Carol Siegel clearly has her own point of view, which one may or may not have issues with, but she doesn't claim her treatment of the sexuality of contemporary Stateside Goth-dom is all that can be said about the matter; provided you remember that, and don't approach this specialised academic book as the 'guide to Goth' it makes no pretence to be, it makes a helpful contribution to the debate. At least it shows an academic taking Goth and Gothic seriously, which is always welcome! And even better that she's done a good deal of her work by talking to real Goths rather than simply sitting in a university study.As to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails - the ultimately sterile and futile 'Is it Goth?' debate may amuse teenage Goths in web-based discussion groups, and provide fun for the Goth style police who have always been with us. But, in the first place, Goth/Gothic is a multifoiled and multifaceted beast, has no (or virtually no) abiding identity, and its ability to absorb and process almost any form of entertainment, art or history and turn it out figured Gothically is part of what makes it so exciting and interesting. Secondly, Messrs Manson & Reznor have helped to process, represent, and popularise Goth imagery to the American public - and arguably debase it, but that's a matter of personal taste rather than anything more concrete. Check Catherine Spooner's fine 'Contemporary Gothic' (Reaktion Books, 2006) if you don't believe me! Try and tie Gothic down to anything in particular - or rule anything out of the ring - and you'll find it rising up to bite you in the neck."},{"Title":"Goth's Dark Empire","review":"This is a fanciful, wildly innacurate book. Marylin Manson, goth music? Whether he is a quality musician is widely debated, but no music lover in their right mind thinks he makes goth music. For that matter, Nine Inch Nails is industrial rock, not goth; many rivitheads and industrial lovers would have a fit hearing him called goth. The emphasis on sexuality in goth culture is massively overstated, as well, and many seminal musical groups and literary and artistic influences entirely ignored. The importance of 19th century gothic fiction is glossed over, as is the separate nature of various subcultures related to, but not one with, goth, such as BDSM, rivit/industrial, cyber, deathrock, and vampire culture.Take it from a goth: Carol Siegel, while correct in some of her conclusions on the nature of our culture, hasn't really got an inkling what she's pontificating about. Don't read this book.Please, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Goth's Dark Empire","review":"Gloom shrouded me by sentence three of this academic treatise. \\"And just as [Linda] Williams set out to examine the Foucauldian 'knowledge-pleasure' produced as 'the frenzy of the visible' through the convergence of 'a variety of discourses of sexuality' within pornography (36), I set out to examine the Deleuzoguattarian becomings [1] that are produced within the discourses of sexuality that converge within Goth.\\" (1) Siegel, a professor of English, studies Goth culture within fiction, music, film, and sexual mores. This is an admirable goal, but I wonder if those who'd benefit most from these contextual chapters can even decipher much of this prose.I started this hoping that Siegel, given her \\"sex radical\\" hippie-era formation and her interviews with Goths in the Northwest U.S., would incorporate a wide-ranging survey of how sexuality and fashion, music and aesthetics, morals and subversion all intertwine in the American manifestations of this often caricatured subculture. Glimpses of this persist, but much of her 2005 academic work, three of its six topical chapters published previously (often a sign that a book's cobbled together from past research rather than conceived as an organic project), struggles to arrive at the goal that her introduction promises.Professor Siegel tends to wander around her subject. Digressions about our destructive automotive reliance, abstinence programs in schools, and Chandra Levy (remember her pre-9/11?) may distract readers wishing for a focused analysis. Her insights reminded me of a passionate lecturer, eager to pursue tangents, and then bringing the discussion back a few minutes later to the main point. This may please some of her audience but may annoy others.The audience needs lots of background in critical theory. I found two of my grad school classmates cited in the text, and while I admit less patience for extended forays into jargon than they indeed possessed, the theoretical tone of much of this work does distance itself from those readers likely to take it off the shelf for information. I found in teaching students needing reference works on Goth culture (the reason I sought Siegel's book out), that undergrads lacked solid, thoughtful explanations. Siegel does bring sympathy to her project, but her reading level's elevated so high that few outside of, yes, grad school seminars in post-modern cultural criticism will be able to understand her own analyses.That being said, patient readers will come away with some value. Within the text, phrases pop up that sum up her perspective well. \\"In place of the denial of the future that characterizes mainstream American life, Goth offers a very special kind of masochistic delight in knowing the worst.\\" (25) Chapter One tries to contrast Goth culture with \\"abstinence programs.\\" It veers all over the place in doing so.Chapter Two takes on Angela Carter's fiction. Siegel spends much of this section lamenting the passing of 1960s celebrations of free love but while she advocates similar freedom for today's teens, she seems to gloss over the American reality that has followed this shift. She decries sexual restraint, while she blames the dearth of \\"useful information about sex\\" that results in an \\"appalling rate of unwanted pregnancies and venereal diseases.\\" She then states how \\"young people form radical countercultures around their musical tastes,\\" to resist a custodial, infantilizing social schooling routine. (25) Siegel packs so much into so small a space that this left me puzzled as to how sexual rebellion could bring freedom-- given the dismal track record (pregnancies, STDs) of radical alterations in how sex was brought into teenaged American culture by the late 20th century.And how does Goth relate? Siegel promotes casual sex and feminist-positive play. She wants to resurrect sexual expression from those who demonize it among the young. But within the \\"Dark Empire\\" of Goth, how these aberrant revolutionaries will manage sex better than their cowed if somewhat perkier peers appears uncertain. Siegel left me befuddled as to how this transformation will occur.Chapter Three dives into Poppy Z. Brite's novels, which celebrate male masochism and female dominance. Yet, given the cannibalism of \\"Exquisite Corpse,\\" even Siegel appears to shrink back at the extremes of such liberties. She's on surer ground when navigating the gender fluidity and male self-discovery and female empowerment within such fiction. \\"In Brite's fiction, as in much of Goth, the gendering of classic Gothic iconography may seem reversed, for she presents her female readers with breaking and b broken male bodies that fill the spaces of her prose as if it were the last act of 'Hamlet.'\\" (84)Comparing a documentary on Brandon Teena vs. the \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" film treatment of his fate, Siegel favors the former portrayal, for it does not \\"erase\\" the boys and their brutalization of Teena. (Brandon, as she notes if gingerly, was no icon.) She earlier, if tangentially given her convoluted approach, juxtaposes Punk with Goth. Punk's \\"destructive fury\\" followed the loving hippies. After Punk's rage subsided, youth faced scorched, haunted landscapes. Punks posed in bondage gear but twisted free of its signifiers; Goths \\"express their rejection through a defiantly eroticized passive resistance.\\" (97) They wrench punishment into victory.Chapter Five surveys \\"male femme homosexualities\\" in film, but without a thorough knowledge of her examples (as with the literature earlier discussed), readers will be challenged to grasp theoretical formulations. The sixth chapter winds up her pursuit of masculinity with Asian American Goths. She settles on a satisfying take on Keanu Reeves as Neo in the \\"Matrix\\" series. \\"Man enough to save humanity, gentle and nonmacho enough to be himself and saved by a woman, and easily sexually attractive enough to inspire her devotion, Neo models the new masculinity\\" that these new models engender. (151-2)One ends this work with little of a broader appreciation of the sexual subcultures as lived by Goths today; one does learn more about how Goths are dramatized in films, literature, and music. Siegel strives to expand Paul Hodgkinson's \\"Goth\\" thesis (see my review and also that for Jillian Venters' \\"Gothic Charm School\\") farther from fashion into sexual behavior. Still, you get little sense of how actual Goths, as opposed to aestheticized ones, express such devotion to the alternative models she so longs to see replace those of the typical high school campus. Musically, as with Hodkinson's monograph, Siegel leaves us without the depth this aspect merits, but Don Anderson's appended discography's very helpful.She concludes spiritedly. \\"Goths escape the willed stupidity of the American dream to find in the nightmare of fallen knowledge a becoming that is also a coming to knowledge with no goal beyond intimacy with life's dark side. They refuse end goals, remaining, instead, fascinated with natural decay and the falling apart of all things that current mainstream values formed. By valorizing perversion and artifice for its own sake, they express their desire for a regime of endless desire.\\" (166)Again, I'm unsure how this manifesto plays out given this decade's downturn in Goth's fanbase. I also wondered how Goth may endure among older devotees. Those readers who could gain the most will find this work far too dense to unpack its meanings easily. (As an aside, from my observation, Siegel overlooks a delayed generational identification of some Latino and inner-city youths with a Goth-rave-darkwave-death metal assortment of styles.) Still, she tries to extend the direction of cultural studies towards Goth, and while the background's foreshortened and the examples as digressive as often as targeted, Siegel's empathy assists her and her sympathizers."},{"Title":"Goth's Dark Empire","review":"...it would be \\"Goth's Dark Empire.\\" This book first caught my attention due to its application of Deleuze and Guattari to gothic youth culture. Having spent a great deal of time with both Deleuze and Guattari's work, I was interested in how Professor Siegel was applying these radical philosophical concepts to a genre of music and culture that I also possessed something of an interest in. Needless to say, this book illustrates what is so Deleuzoguattarian about goth culture and does this in a very original and charmingly idiosyncratic way.Regarding the table of contents, I was surprised to see what at first seemed like disparate topics. How exactly was a Deleuzian book on Goth going to weave through criticism on abstinence programs, the work of Angela Carter (a British author who is only now being appreciated for her transgressive and amazing body of work), and the Brandon Teena tragedy? The fact that the book brilliantly juxtaposes discussions of Virginia Woolf with Fields of the Nephilim lyrics, and passes from Carter to Poppy Z. Brite (thus seeming to suggest Brite as a kind of successor to Carter's throne while also making the argument that both authors represent a \\"minor literature\\") is the book's ultimate triumph.Further, what makes this book so important is that it challenges the flawed academic conception that goth culture is unworthy of study by showing its movement across women's and feminst studies and its direct connection to the anti-capitalist philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari's \\"Anti-Oedipus. For example, Siegel argues early on (upon the heels of Foucault's intro to \\"Anti-Oedipus\\"), in what may be the thesis of her book that \\"The look of Goth, its style-as-substance, can thus be understood as a potentially very powerful force of resistance, a way of generating affects that can stand against State institutions of control and the discourses of power they authorize. Goth cannot tell us how to live both darkly and against fascism, but it can show us\\" (25). By functioning as a minor culture that works beneath the normalcy of the mainstream, Goth culture redefines an era where the sexual revolution didn't fail, but has instead been reconfigured to account for the threat of AIDS; thus explaining Goth's romanticizing of death. Goth is also a deterritorialized cultural resistance to the zombie-bourgeoisie whose lives are plagued with denial of both their bodies and sexuality, as well as the sources of their own unmaking-a concept that grounds the anti-Oedipal argument that capitalism possesses covert ways of turning one's desire back on one's self.Again, it is the bridges that Siegel constructs that facilitate movements and gateways between goth culture and standard academic fare such as Asian-American literature, British literature (both Joyce and Lawrence strongly figure in during the conclusion) and of course Deleuze and Guattari. An example of such bridging is Siegel's excellent chapter on the Japanese animated film \\"Vampire Hunter D.\\" Throughout her analysis of the film she expertly historicizes its revision of Asian male masculinity. She places the film in recent debates concerned with representations of Asian-American males. She regularly cites authors like Frank Chin, Maxine Hong Kinston, and Chang-rae Lee when observing the ways the film responds to constructions of masculinity in Asian-American literature. After reading this chapter it seems only natural that \\"Vampire Hunter D\\" as well as other gothic portrayals of Asian-American masculinities should be taught alongside the above authors.Professor Siegel also fills a crucial gap in studies on goth cultures by showing the strong connections the movement shares with BDSM. While critics such as Paul Hodkinson claim there are no direct links between goth culture and BDSM, Siegel suggests otherwise by relaying how nearly all the participants in her ethnographic research were able to successfully point out and name the fetish gear adorned by artists such as NIN. In fact, it is the connections with BDSM that allows goth to experiment with radical sexuality in a way that embraces the darkness of living in a post-AIDS world, while also disrupting the strict binary of the sexes that perpetuates the tired and \\"dead\\" capitalist mainstream. In this way, Goth is surprisingly quite life-affirming.Siegel's rhetoric is also enjoyable. Her love for Deleuze and Guattari is immediately evident in her writing. At her most polemical, Siegel composes some of her most inspired and calculated prose. In her conclusion she writes that \\"Goths escape the willed stupidity of the American Dream to find in the nightmare of fallen knowledge a becoming that is also a coming to knowledge with no goal beyond intimacy with life's dark side. They refuse end goals, remaining, instead, fascinated with natural decay and the falling apart of all things that current mainstream values formed. By valorizing perversion and artifice for its own sake, they express their desire for a regime of endless desire\\" (166). Siegel's reading of goth culture through an anti-oedipal, schizoanalytical lens seems so natural and even common-sensical that it is truly a wonder other Deleuzians haven't noticed goth as a cultural reflection and manifestation of the basic arguments of \\"Anti-Oedipus.\\""},{"Title":"Goth's Dark Empire","review":"Carol Siegel's Goth's Dark Empire is an insightful exploration of Goth and its creepings into popular culture. From a clear, straightforward definition of Goth and its historical place in American culture to a discussion of misidentification and vilification of Goth and what drives the subculture, Siegel clarifies and demonstrates the importance of this changing subculture and its growing influence on art, literature, and music. Siegel uses her obvious expertise and deftness in cultural studies and academic theory to untangle the complexities of this topic.Drawing from sources that range from Trent Reznor to Angela Carter and Thomas Ligotti, Goth's Dark Empire is an interesting, in-depth discussion of Goth's delightful darkness and its impact on American culture."},{"Title":"Motoring in France,","review":"I just love this title.

Skye is so beautiful that almost any man near her will fall in love or be so in lust that he will kidnap, rape, or whatever it takes to have her. She has guts and intelligence, but most of the things that happen are due to her beauty rather than skills. I would have liked more interesting actions on her part. Bad things happen \\"due to the worst luck\\" - over and over again. She has a series of men in her life: lovers, husbands, close friends, and rapists - over a ten-year period and in different locations. This book tells the story of each one. I was frustrated because although she truly loved some of these men, I wanted her to be with her first love Niall. Unfortunate circumstances (fate) took her away and kept her away from Niall more than once. It was strangely unsatisfying in that way. I didn't like the way she hated Niall for a period of time. It wasn't justified. Most of the men in the story have flaws or do undesirable things which are bothersome, but it makes a good story.The best part was Skye's conflict with Queen Elizabeth. This was toward the end of the book. The Queen did something terrible to Skye, and Skye wanted revenge. I liked that story, but it was secondary to the stories of the men in Skye's life. Although Skye is a fictional character, the author tried to be historically accurate regarding the Queen's actions. The author states \\"I remain utterly intrigued by the court of Elizabeth, especially by Lord Burghley, who was so very clever and masterful at leading his royal mistress away from her destructive emotions, and by Robert Dudley, who was in my opinion a proper villain with kingly ambitions of his own. Like most historians, I have put my own particular spin on the time period. The places and the people in this book are based upon my own thorough research, and my hope was to breathe life into this fascinating era.\\" I was frightened to see the Queen's power over people and her actions based on whims. She could negate a will, force or prevent a marriage, and imprison someone without charges.Some readers may have an issue with the purple prose, but it didn't bother me. I consider it another style of writing. This book was published in 1980 when it was more common than it is today.SEX SCENES:This book has many sex scenes, all very short. There are several rape scenes. One rape scene has men attempting to force sex between a girl and an animal. There are group sex scenes, prostitution, incest, and sodomy.STORY BRIEF:Skye's father is the O'Malley, head of a wealthy shipping business in Ireland. He arranges a marriage for Skye against her wishes to an evil man. Skye meets Niall and falls in love at first sight, but her father won't listen to her and forces the other marriage. Later when the O'Malley dies, Skye must take over running the shipping business until her younger brothers are old enough. She is kidnapped by pirates. Amnesia also comes into play.DATA:Story length: 482 pages. Swearing language: moderate, including religious swear words. Sexual language: strong. Number of sex scenes: 36. Approximate number of sex scene pages: 32. Setting: About a ten year period starting in 1555, mostly Ireland, Algiers, and England. Copyright: 1980. Genre: historical romance."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Truly a woman ahead of her time(1500's), Skye O'Malley makes us proud to be a woman. Never taking less, she strives for more and gets it. Even with her beauty, she never stoops low to use it to her advantage. She gets what she wants with her brains.A very different spin on romance, this isn't for the faint of heart. Skye isn't your typical heroine with one man or one love. Bertrice Small is known for her sweeping tales of adventure and unconventional loves. This is a classic in its own right.I still don't know why people refer to it as a 'trashy romance'. There is nothing 'trashy' about it. It's filled with history and greed, passion and bravery that I haven't seen in many romances. Not a 'lovey-dovey' romance by far, but it is a page-turner none the less.With black hair and blue eyes, Skye O'Malley is the most beautiful woman in Ireland. Tall and extremely intelligent, she can outwit most men. Men are willing to die to possess her, but she can't be owned.We are taken on a wild adventure that spans almost ten years. From the lush hills of Ireland, to the exotic Algerian hideaway and on to the fast-paced London scene. The adventure never lets up and Skye never lets us down. A seafaring captain who is rumored to be a notorious pirate who has angered the Queen herself, Skye is too wise to let anyone win a war of wits with her.An eternal love that she must face and two loves that she must remember, Skye O'Malley never forgets what is most important.The information on the Virgin Queen was so unbelievable, I was amazed. The things that Skye gets away with is frightening. Brave should be her first name. Definately a heroine to look up to. The only complaint? The men. Simply put. I don't want to reveal anything, but I was unimpressed with her men. Only one I liked alot and he was too far near the end of the tale. One was okay, another was pretty good, and another was downright disgusting and I could not fathom what she saw in him and the good one was too late in the story. But I hear the second book, 'All the Sweet Tomorrows' has him as the main character....hmmm, can't wait now to read!The common complaints in this book were mostly mine also.

I read this book several time and then went on to read the entire Skye O'Malley series. The third time I reread this book it still brought me to tears. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I purchased this book so that I could essentially re-read it. When I was about 9-10, I had read all of my books to the point of memorization, and began reading my mother's books. This was one of them, but a good deal of pages were missing, so I missed everything between the beginning of Skye's training in Algiers and the duel in England.Being that it had been a minimum of 12 years since I originally read the book, my memory was a bit foggy, and I didn't remember some parts while other parts I remember having happened differently. It was nice to be able to read the full story, as I missed a large chunk my first read due to the missing pages.One theme that I've noticed in several of Small's books that I don't quite agree with is that \\"proper\\" sex is only man-on-top, penis-in-vagina penetration, and that if the encounter proceeds any other way, it's \\"wrong\\", as indicated by lines like \\"The stallion should mount the mare, not the mare mount the stallion\\" (may not be an exact quote, but close) and descriptions of orgasm by manual or oral stimulation not being \\"satisfying\\" enough. Such opinions bother my fairly-feminist mind, and tend to kill the mood just a bit when they come about, though others may not have an issue.I tend to describe Small's books as \\"not smut, but porn - the plot between the sex is often about as bad as the acting between the sex in films\\". Some parts seem absolutely stilted, and a product of trying to fight through writer's block - understandable, but it could have been revised later so it would flow better. There are a few parts of this book that are almost painful between-the-sex filler, while other parts flow nicely and don't feel forced.Then there's the \\"food-porn\\". The descriptions of meals tend to be down to details that even the characters probably wouldn't be aware of. If done in moderation it's not bad, letting the reader know \\"this is what the food is like in this area\\", but when meals are described in such detail that almost an entire page is taken up describing the food, it's a bit boring and feels like overkill.I've seen other reviews complaining that the sex is \\"too graphic\\". That's almost the entire reason that I read Small's work - I like a good descriptive sex scene. I've come across far too many romance novels that gloss over the sex, barely giving detail, or even worse, just say something like \\"they spent a restless night\\". Come on, that's not erotic at all! We're mature adults (I hope) I think we can handle some sex in a romance novel.I will admit that there is a lot of drama in this book, to the point of feeling as if I'm in the Castle Anthrax scene in Holy Grail - \\"Get on with it!!!\\" There are points where it does feel as if there's just too damn much drama - whose life is THAT intense? - however, it does lead to (some) character development - wait, that's my husband's reason for watching Yu-Gi-Oh.Overall, my main reason for reading this book as an adult is for the sex, and if I put aside any issues I have with the book, it's fairly interesting. I would recommend it to anyone fond of period romance novels and who enjoys some detail in their sex scenes. If you prefer the romance side over the sex side, this may not be the book, or author, for you."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Skye O'Malley is one of the BEST books I've read!!

In fact, I revisit this book every 3-4 years and I always enjoy it like it's the first time!Bertrice Small's moniker in the world of romance novels is \\"Lust's Leading Lady.\\" That should give you a clue. For those of you who like your romance sanitized, this book is NOT for you! If you like a good dose of spicy sex with your romance, this book is FOR you!Ms. Small's attention to detail, her character development and her ability to intertwine fiction with history is superb. Sure some of the storylines may be a bit over the top, but that's what makes this such a good, fun read!And if you enjoy this, make sure you read the rest of the \\"O'Malley Saga\\"!!"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Could not put this book down! was a real page turner full of suspense. Definately not like some of the romance books that are very predictable. Now, i am reading the series and so far everyone is great."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This was my second Beatrice Small book and by far the best. The story just kept evolving from one situation to another. You certainly couldn't get bored. Small certainly has a way with bringing the characters to life. You love them and hate some. I would highly recommend this book if you like excitement, a good story line and alot of sex! I hope I can find another story that will keep me as interested as this one."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This is by far the best &quot;trashy romance&quot; novel. It is the first I ever read in the genre, and none have compared since. It is fast paced, full of rich and colourfull detail, and has some of the best &quot;juicy bits&quot;. I and all of my girlfriends whole heartedly recommend this wonderful escape."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This is the best book I have ever read, and I have read many. I keep coming back to it to where it is falling apart. Skye is corageous and intelligent. You will never forget her. You will not want the book to end."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"How this (or any of the other books in this series) ever got to be considered a classic is beyond me. I got the title for my review for the number of times I uttered that phrase while I was reading the book. Like a lot of Ms. Small's novels, the plot seems to be &quot;in how many weird sexual situations can I embroil my heroine?&quot; To paraphrase a great saying, this book is sexually interesting, otherwise useless."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"No novel exists in a literary vacuum. To render a review of Skye O'Malley within the confines of the romance genre is nothing but a farce. This book exists for anyone to pick up and suffer through--not just those familiar with the hackneyed romance genre. Therefore, I judge Sky O'Malley first on its merits as an individual piece of literature--or what little merit the book has. Purple prose is a horrendous excuse for writing, and Ms. Small has the most purple touch of any author I have encountered. Her depictions of female slave trading and the like are highly insulting to women. I also find her marked bias against female homosexual acts to be reprehensible. To be fair, let me consider Skye O'Malley as part of the genre in which it is lodged. It doesn't belong there. The book is one endless sexual fantasy played out with multiple partners on multiple levels. The main character, Skye, is &quot;too sensuous&quot; a woman to deny herself the dubitable pleasures of sex at the hands of her abusive first husband. In brief, I do not believe there is an ounce of emotion in Skye's perfect body. That is what makes this porn, not romance."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"How true, how true! I think it must have been a Jedi mind trick that made me BUY this book in the first place. Oh, it was detailed and dashing and all of that rot. I didn't care. Buyer, beware"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This is the book that started my 20 year guilty pleasure. I was 20 years old and a lifelong reader when an old married lady handed me SKYE O'MALLEY. I thought \\"Boy, how bad will this be?!\\". Wow, was I in for a, um, thrill! I'm now 40 years old and married myself and this book still lives in my memory as an absolutely enthralling work of romance fiction.Of course it's romance, and total escapism, but it was also total FUN!I don't recommend this book to anyone under 21. You have to be aware of enough to understand that romance fiction is 99% pure fantasy."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Very well written but never have I laid eyes on such terrifying written work. RAPE, INCEST, PROSTITUTION !!!!!!!!!! I'm no preacher's daughter but, by god!, this book left me trembling with fear. I was so frighten by all that happened to Skye I couldn't force myself to complete the novel. I regret, to this day, ever setting eyes on this book. I serious suggest the publisher[s] place a warning label or at least give the readers a better warning of the novel's content than &quot;... Queen Elizabeth's friend and eney&quot;"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I guess I'm old-fashioned, but I like it when the heroine only has sex with the hero. That is most certainly not the case in this horrid book. I couldn't even finish it. I should have read *all* of the reviews here first."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Are women cursed to go for Mr. Wrong?The heroine loses her memory and is carried away to the babary coast to be sold into white slavery. The hero, the whoremaster of algeria, purchases her to add to his stable of whores only to decide after her training in the 'erotic arts' to keep her for his own personal use rather than send her to one of his brothels."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I agree entirely with the reviewer [not the idiot who commented about blondes] about the anti-woman, misogynisitic claptrap that is this novel. And all of the work of Beatrice Small - much of which I read during the 80's to early 90's.Small's has been passing off as \\"heroines\\" women who in fact are often very narcissistic parasites with singularly selfish motives as their most defining character trait. This novel is no different; the title character is used like a call girl for most of her life, but this is portrayed by the author as \\"strength\\". The title character primarily becomes a schemer on par with a Medici. This character gives birth to something like 8 or 9 children from the time she's a teenager to middle aged, and yet manages to retain her figure - this in a time when women of her class weren't doing much besides getting dressed, attending parties, and perhaps directing the servants, activities that modern women know wouldn't keep one's figure in the same shape as it was when was 18 yrs old! Without a modern day BallyFitness membership, I find it incredibly ludicrous this title character wouldn't look exactly like other women who give birth every few years for most of their adult lives!This novel, and all of Small's works, feature prominently men who use women as toilet paper, and women who literally can't give two hoots less about their own children [Skye treats her children like the pawns they are as they get a little older, as she herself wasn't there to raise them for the most part]. These people aren't admirable in the least in Small's novels.The depiction of this character as a willing & unwilling exploited sex object did nothing but inform me about the author's own ideas about sexual relationships - that women are nothing if not Playboy fantasies & as such, should appreciate being used like prostitutes. But only if the women are as gorgeous as modern-day super models, and the men are rich as kings [gee, isn't this the same ideal that the media portrays for young women to aspire to nowadays?]. Women of lesser beauty - eh - they're not worthy of Small's attentions in these novels.I think Small as an author is as obsessed with the false female ideal of 'beauty' as is Madison Ave. & many deluded women today. It's really pitiful actually, that women in Small's novels, as well women in real life, all believe that beauty is the only real key to love & Happiness. {and I don't write that as a homely woman - I was born lucky and very very pretty} These novels have a strong stench of misogyny in them that only someone with brain damage would fail to detect.The messages of most historical romances is very much anti-feminism [and if you look at the author's themselves, this makes sense as many are from the Bible Belt & live very \\"traditional\\" lifestyles themselves]. I'd actually burn these books if I had a daughter who wanted to read them. From personal experience, I wasted many hours reading this garbage as a young woman, believing the not so subtle messages in these stupid woman hating novels, and as a result, tried to conform my own life to ideals portrayed in these silly useless books. I should've been spending my time going to law school or getting the graduate degree instead. Only later did I wake up and realize what utter trash these historical novels truly are, and how dangerous to the minds of young women. These novels all have a form of really punitive patriarchy in them that should scare women who can think for themselves."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I found out about Skye O'Malley from my mother. After telling me of how awful her books were, I felt inclined to read them myself.I read the first couple of pages and was marveled at how materialistic O'Malley seemed. Half of the book is spent describing jewels and clothes; i suspect Small thought it would insert a sense of grandure, but I just felt amazed at how superficial O'Malley seemed.The other half of the book is spent describing sex. I suspect she imagined it was sensual and passionate- it was perverted. Imagine every type of sex possible, repeat it several times and you might have something close to a Beatrice Small novel.The heroine is a ridiculous, beautiful and petty little girl. If she was my friend I would soon tell her where to go. Thinking of Skye O'Malley immediatley brings a sickening and dirty feeling to me.And finally I must stress that Elizabeth and Robert Dudley are NOT two scheming lovers! They were two people who deeply loved each other, and my fates cruel wrath were destined never to be together. Elizabeth had Lettice beaten up for marrying Dudley and her mother imprisoned in the Tower, therefore I hardly think she would of ordered Dudley to rape Skye. Elizabeth was a great,powerful,wise and noble queen. The most beautiful queen in Europe, and, arguably, the most beautiful female also.Small tries to create a tale of two people who love each other deeply, but instead she writes a story of a whore who has no morales. Please, do not waste your money on this story of meaningless sex."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"....I don't generally enjoy historical romance novels because they are so insulting to women's intelligence, but on a lark, I bought this one to see what the fuss was all about. What a load of anti-woman crap this one turned out to be! I got through almost half and then did myself a favour and threw it away in boredom and disgust. And I totally agree with those discerning readers who find the men to be even worse, starting with her father: this is not a man, but a pig posing as one! The first thing that turned me off was the way her own mother was treated, even by the supposed \\"heroine\\" herself...that did not bode well for the rest of the novel. I expect a heroine to be just that, someone who, besides being gutsy and full of moxy, has a heart and some moral convictions, not just a perfect body and killer looks. Also, I have noticed the author's bias against lesbians, and also any lady who is fair-haired. It almost seems as if once upon a time, a blonde bombshell stole the author's man.(As if brunettes are typically the world's most beautiful, sexy, etc.In point of fact, the more exotic peoples on this planet ARE those who are blondes and red-headed, as there are much less of them compared to brunettes..another newsflash, people: most of the eastern \\"exotic\\" men I know, openly prefer blondes!) Asides from that, the plot is so ridiculous and full of asinine and incorrect supposed \\"historical\\" data, especially with concerns to islamic mores.(I should know, I married a pakistani man). But this novel especially deserves excoriation for its horrid and debasing treatment of women in general and even children(child prostitution, etc.) The sex I found boring and one-dimensional, uninspiring and laughable. And Skye herself? Again, the only readers here with any accurate understanding of her personality got it right: she's an immoral spoiled brat, selfish and self-involved, hung up on her materialistic nature, shallow and silly. An insult to intelligent readers to call her a heroine! But then again, romance novels arent known for attracting intellectuals. Save your money!"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Am I the only woman in the world who doesn't like Skye O'Malley? I've read the whole series, and I keep coming back to the same conclusion--I just don't like the woman. Why? She's more superheroine than woman! I go back over this one and try counting the things she can't do, and gosh darn, it seems like she can master everything. Okay, granted, maybe this isn't a bad ideal for a character. But the one thing I always look for in a character and I found lacking in Skye is the human element. Sure, she goes through a lot, but it always seems to get patched up by her fabulous jewels or her wealth or her off-the-scale beauty. Sorry, but Skye O'Malley makes me a little sick to my stomach."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Perhaps you'll be surprised I didn't care for the book after reading this. This is my second Beatrice Small book. There's a definite theme brewing, and I think it's that her heroines are smart, strong and have the worst luck, over and over again, of any person alive.Somehow during discovering -- make that rediscovering -- her true mate, she manages to have sensual and loving and learning situations along the way (over and over again) without losing her intelligence or independence.The bad luck -- or amnesia -- is frustrating and beyond even romance novel beleivable bounds. I actually stopped reading this book --o.k. the writing (not the storyline) was good enough that I picked it back up two weeks later.All the characters, heros and heroines as well, appear to live in self gratification. It's apropos for a heroine to leave young children to travel to London and furnish a new home or travel the seas in the name of the family business or for a hero to &quot;spread bastards across the countryside&quot; or something to that effect.Finally, Beatrice Small is undoutedly a talented writer and her books are awesomely sensual, this romance is a little depressing to consider all the lost time, although some might say it's realistic. I found it frustrating. Regardless, you won't be bored."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This story is classic Bertrice Small. Set in Ireland, Algiers and London in the mid 16th century, it is the first in the O'Malley series, and tells of the Irish noble families and the loves of an amazing heroine. Though her wealthy Irish sea captain father, famous for his merchant piracy, had 6 daughters, the O'Malley had only one like himself: strong and intelligent in business--and in her case, also beautiful. When she is 15, though betrothed to another man (a man she hates), Skye O'Malley falls in love with the dashing Niall Burke, heir to the MacWilliam, the O'Malley's overlord. But their families deny them the marriage they want. Instead, Skye is wed to the brutal, lecherous man she was betrothed to, and Niall is wed to a highborn woman who would prefer to be a nun. It will be years before they can get together.You know, if you've read Bertrice Small before, her romances are...well, let's just say, unusual. Perhaps they are more realistic of life in the times, but one should be aware. Typically, there is not just one couple nor is the heroine with just one \\"hero.\\" So, be prepared if you pick up this one. To be sure it's a good story and will hold you captive as the scene moves from Ireland to Algiers and then to England; but what happens can be disconcerting at times. For example, using the vehicle of amnesia, at one point Small has the heroine forgetting who she is and adopting a lifestyle that is inconsistent with who she is and her life in Ireland. There were other instances where I lost my admiration for the heroine, but in the end she triumphs and so does Niall, though for a long while, he had one piece of bad luck after another. The whole thing was a bit farfetched, but it was well done. Small's descriptions of people, places and even dress and food really put you in the scene and make you feel like you are there. And the real life characters of young Queen Elizabeth's court, including Elizabeth, were very believable.Should you want to read more in the series, here's the list:The O'Malley Saga:SKYE O'MALLEYALL THE SWEET TOMORROWSA LOVE FOR ALL TIMETHIS HEART OF MINELOST LOVE FOUNDWILD JASMINESkye's Legacy:DARLING JASMINEBEDAZZLEDBESIEGEDINTRIGUEDJUST BEYOND TOMORROWVIXENS"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I first read this book when I turned eighteen. Lets just say I was confused about the feelings this book inspired. About a year later I was going through my books and reread it... I LOVED IT! I have read every single book in this series at least five times.Skye is a very strong person to go through the harsh life fate has dealt her.There are so many men who touch her life. The husband chosen for her is a sadistic and perverted jerk. Just thinking about him makes me mad. But, Skye got the best of him. And was a real lady about it. Read it and you'll understand. Anyway, Syke ends up being abducted and loses her fiance and her memory. ( typical, but doesn't hurt the story) She is sold only to find friendships and love. So not giving more away.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"My tattered, original copy of Skye O'Malley is barely holding up. First read in 1980, it certainly did not conform to the romance novel template of the time. As another reviewer states, Bertrice Small's characters have multiple lovers and loves. Skye breaks the 'mold\\" in other ways, too. She is a powerful, intelligent and strong woman; fully capable of taking on the men and even the queen who threaten or challenge her. Her only fault might be that her thirst for revenge outweighs her good judgement. Skye is loosely modeled on the real-life, historical character, Grace O'Malley. By far, the best historical romance I have ever read.This book established the characters for future sequels...all of them \\"readable\\", but other Small books deserving of praise areLove Wild and FairandThe Kadin."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This is the girl version of readable porn aka a dirty book. Wonderful. As always Ms. Small doesn't disappoint. I'd read this book before and love it and wanted to get it for my own personal stash of Adult reading material. All of the characters mesh really well together. Still the only thing I must say is that I do wish that Ms. Small would branch out and write this same steaminess in a novel where her characters were more mature/older in age. I'm 30 and I love steamy scenes I just want the character to at LEAST be my age or its just not worth it."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I Absolutely LOVE this book and all the books in the series!! I read this for the first time when I was 16, I am now 37 and I still read this book. I do read other books sometimes, but I have to have a yearly dose of Skye.Whenever I face hard challenges in my own life and need a pick me up, I pick up my Skye O'Malley series and am empowered by her strength and determination to roll with the punches and make the best of it. Her pure loyalty and integrity for her family and loved ones and even the ones she doesn't like much, is inspiring! When life get's hard and I need an escape, Skye O'Malley is always there for me. Even though she is a fictional character, Skye is my inspiration that get's me through life's challenges.Skye O'Malley Will Never Die!!!"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This book is exactly all that I expected. A wonderful romp into romance novels filled with a number of different tropes that give the reader of that day exactly what they wanted. A strong, forceful, unconventional, bueatiful, firey, intellegent woman who is thrown into a billion situations that she cannot control and has to adapt to. The hero, who you're never sure is half the time, is, by turns, smart, handsome, controlling, angry, in love, in lust, demanding, charming, violent, soft, and (above all) Alpha.These tow are surrounded, most of the time, by loving, loyal, understanding, and entertaining family, servants, and friends.The turns that happen in this novel may seem harsh, but I can't help but feel that it's realistic (to an extent) to the times. Obviously blown out of proportion with it all pertaining to one person, but still believable nontheless.What you really have is a stong, independant woman who comes through amazing events against the odds and, though she grows and changes throught the novel, she is still the same core person you met when she was born.If you can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen, but if you're willing to wade though the deep and dark waters to come out shining on the other side, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I thought this book was well written. But, it was repetitive. I know Skye was beautiful, but every guy she comes across falls hopelessly in love with her. Not realistic. I got especially confused when Robert Small is smitten with her, even though he views her as a daughter.Niall Burke. What a WIMP! Niall is such a flake! He didn't even go look for the \\"love of his life\\" when she disppeared in Algiers! If Niall was seriously in love with Skye, he would have searched high and low for her! But of course, he settles for a beautiful Spainish gal. My favorite guy was Adam De Marsico, what a sweety! I was found of Khalid as well.The sex scenes. Whew! Some of them are extremely rated XXX, while the others are so- so. I got bored when she was married to the \\"Angel Earl\\", in fact, I scanned the words and moved on quickly. Usaully, I like to read these parts and savor them!However, I will give credit to Ms. Small's excellent research for this novel. She is a great story teller, and writes so the reader will stay engaged."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This book I first read when I was much younger. I am 31 now.I have re-read it so many times, and it is still a great read.

I think that every woman secretly wants to be her and I'm sure no exception to that rule! &quot;Purple&quot; prose it may be - but it's a RICH, WONDERFUL shade of purple! The book is well written, no details are spared, and the characters are wonderfully believable. The only thing that I take exception to with this book (and I don't think it was on purpose) is that the descriptions of some of the parties go on waaay too long. It's enough that we can see Queen Elizabeth's hall, and know that the buffet was plentiful. There isn't really a need to go on and on and on about what the food looked like! :-)Still, a very well-written book. A great place for new Small fans to start with."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I am not usually a Historical Romance reader but a friend of mine said to me, &quot;You HAVE to read this book&quot;.

The plot of this book has so many twists and turns that there is never a dull moment. I was amazed at all this woman went through but she survived it all. I also learned alot about history from this book. I knew who Elizabeth I was, but this book told me things I never learned in any history class. And that made the book all the better.

Well, let me tell you something, Skye has been passed around quite a bit by now and I myself have bought every other book in the series (except &quot;A love for all time, cant' find it&quot;). I find them extremely interesting reading from the historical people and places to her beautiful descriptions of fashion and decor. I can picture it so vividly in my mind. Of course the SEX is very imaginative and makes me wonder what Bertrice's research consisted of. I was particularly amazed when I ran across an actual picture of the real Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. I have taken an interest in this period of time and would like to see for myself who actually existed in these novels. When I finished one book I couldn't wait to start the next.

I love to read romance novels not only for the wonderful characters but for the history as well and in Skye O'Malley, the history is very detailed and gives the writer a good idea of what life was like in that era.

This entire saga is not to be missed. It is not for someone who likes the typical cookie cutter tale. i.e. Girl meets Boy, Girl/Boy hates the other, Girl wins Boy. It is closer to real life. Skye's life endures many twists and turns, many loves and losses. A real treat for the reader."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Ms. Small introduces us to the reality of how women were treated in the Elizabeth Age. Skye is strong and intelligent which allows her to live beyond what society dictated to their women. Rape, incest, and prostitutions are realities and certainly were back then. Ms. Small shows us how this strong, intelligent woman rose up above all that and became a woman in her own right. Much as Elizabeth I did herself."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"My mother introduced me to this book when I was 16. It made me wish that I was there enjoying all the adventures with Madame Skye (as she is called in later books). It made me believe that a woman could do anything she sets her mind to."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"If you are looking for lusty romance, then here it is. I cut my eye teeth on this book. It was the first romance book I ever picked up. And at 13, my mother didn't want me to read it. I couldn't get enough of Skye O'Malley, and had to go out and buy the others in the series that were available. There was only the next book out (All the Sweet Tomorrows), so you can guess how long ago that was. It has held up over time. Has my stamp of 100% approval."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Skye O'Malley was the first romance I ever read. The characters were wonderful. This story was so incredibly vivid I felt like I was there with her in London. In fact it made me wish I was.....Thank You Beatrice Small for such an amazing book, if it hadn't been for Skye I probably would never have cracked a book...Once again, THANKS..."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I began reading Skye O'Malley last April. It was the most amazing romance I have ever read. It was a story full of twists and turns and I couldn't put it down! After finishing Skye O'Malley I then had to go out and buy the rest of the saga. I cried and cried at the end of the last book saying goodbye to Skye...then I realized I didn't have to let her go, I ended up reading the entire saga all over again! I've never read any romance books over again, but Skye O'Malley changed all that. I won't be letting my Skye O'Malley books go."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I got a copy from a friend of Skye O'malley...I could not put this book down! I must say Skye does have one of the most interesting lives! I also like the way Bertrice Small has put so much truth of the past, it really makes you feel like your there! Very good Ms. Small........ Keep them coming :)"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"BEATRICE SMALL has done it again with SKYE O'MALLEY! An adventured filled romance that blows formula romances away. Ms. Small has created a tremendously strong heroine with Skye. You can't help but wish you could be in her shoes as she is loved and loves throughout her wild adventures. You will definately enjoy this novel, SKYE O'MALLEY, and will rush to read the sequels!"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I was rather disappointed with the audio cassette form of this book. There are key points of the book that are conspicuously missing from the audio and it does no justice to a magnificent romance. The author's attention to detail cannot be appreciated without reading the book and her superb grasp of history is left out when listening. Do yourself a favor, read the book and use the audio cassette as an enjoyable passtime when driving."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This is the best Historical Romance I have ever read. It is also the first Historical Romance I ever read. It was about 15 years ago and I have read quite a few since then. Skye O'Malley is a Beautifully written, Hot, Sexy, Steamy, Passionate, and sad novel. I have read it numerous times and cannot get enough. I love the entire series but am sad to say that all the other historical romances I have read pale in comparison, and that is saying alot because I have read some good books. Any of you out there that like hot romance. Skye O' Malley is a must! Pick this one up if you have not already. Your in for a real treat. PS. Not for the wimpy, simpy, sappy, drippy types. This stuff is HOT!"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"...but I didn't like it at all. I chose Skye O'Malley as a novel to read for my women's study group. Yes, she's a remarkable character, but I just couldn't identify with her (or with any other character in the book). It seemed to me that the author was using this book to get out some of her own sexual frustrations and hang-ups. Phrases like &quot;anal orifice&quot; just made me laugh out loud--how purple the pen can be! This book will sell another million copies regardless of what I say, but I just had to come clean. I thought Skye O'Malley stunk, although it was so awful, I laughed all the way through it. Maybe that's the appeal"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Want to enter a world of strong willed beautiful women and fascinating men? Start reading the O'Malley series right now!! Full of wonderful heroines, nasty villians (both male and female), and romantic hereos, you will love this series!

Treat yourself to all of the O'Malley books!!"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Ms. Small missed the part where Skye is contacted by Obi-Wan Kenobi and sent to the Dagobah system, so that she can complete her Jedi training. Why not? Skye can do everything else, why not tangle with the Force? I hear the Dark Side quaking.."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I am an avid reader of the romance genre (the kind of reader that finishes a 600 page book in a sitting). My conclusion about this book -- this is where romance novels get their bad reputation. The creation of the main character Skye is dependent on two things: her actions and her words. Ms. Small's story is interesting -- but to listen to the character's interact was most painful. No natural discourse would sound like this -- and her imagination when it comes to speaking &quot;in the heat of the moment&quot; is seriously lacking. Furthermore, the novel has some extremely perverse sexuality that could be disturbing to some readers."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This was a good book. Talk about some hot sex scenes. If that's what you like they are in here. The isn't just about this though. The main character is very stong and independent. Only someone like this could endure all the trials that she went through. I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This is a great book, and if you have not read it you need to. This book has all the romance and heartaches one woman should ever have to endure.The entire saga of skye o'malley seems so real that you want to go back in time and help her win her battles."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Did not like this book...had to put it down after the first chapter. the story was all over the place that I still don't know what was the plot to this book. I also did not like the heroin, she annoyed the hell out of me which is the reason why I put it down. I felt bad cause this was a gift from a friend but i really could not finish this book"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Skye is the most exciting woman ever. She has lived a life full of adventure that would rival any mans. I love the way the author allows your senses to operate at full speed ahead.

That was about 15 years ago and I've been reading them ever since. I think I've read Skye O'Malley 4 or 5 times! I cried like a baby when Niall died. When the book ended, it was like part of my life was over."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I first read Ms Small's book Skye O'mally about 15 years age and have been hooked ever since.

This was the first book of hers that I had read.

You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Bertrice Small is the BEST romance writer I have ever read. I have read the entire O'Malley Saga, (except the one about Conn and Aidan. I can't find it anywhere!) Skye O'Malley is the most enduring character in all of romance."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Ten years ago, I received an old, tattered copy of Skye O'Malley. Until then my romance reading consisted of Mills &amp; Boon and Harlequin Romance Novels. It took me 2 weeks to finish that book and I haven't looked back since. When I find a Beatrice Small novel it is finished within 2 days. Say what you will, her novels are the most interesting, sensual and escapist reading material in my library. My fiancee and I enjoy her novels and will read whatever she offers in the future."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I got Skye O'Malley from a friend who couldn't put it down. I asked if I could borrow it since she said it was a good book. When I read it, it took the jaws of life to get that thing out of my hands. Not only does this book have a good story to it, it has lots of sex to go with it! (It makes me wonder what kind of life Ms. Small has.)I give this 5 stars cause of it's acurate sex content and good story.

These books aren't only for the bored housewife, I am a college student and would love to meet Bertrice Small."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I first discovered Bertrice Small in my grandfather's library. Yes, my grandfather read her books. At first I thought her books were a little too perverted. And then I realized that what they are is REALISTIC!The first thing anyone wishing to read ANY Bertrice Small books needs to know is THEY ARE NOT TYPICAL ROMANCES! In almost all of her books, the heroine has multiple lovers. Sex scenes are ALWAYS graphic! There are rapes, incest, more than just missionary style, etc. She does not edit. Her characters live lives common for the time period. Her stories do not always have happy endings, just like in real life. There is death (of characters you will like). That is just how her books are.If you want a regular romance where, no matter where you are in the book, you know that the hero and the heroine will be together by the end, Bertrice Small is NOT the writer for you!The women in her lives always have hard lives, hard choices. They love many times, lose children and spouses, are set upon by the world around them. Depending on the setting of the story (year and place) each story is different.In a typical woman's life anytime between 1100 and 1900, she could expect to have any of these things happen. She was born, grew up, parents or siblings may be killed, she may be raped (a woman's sex was her weakness), she may fall in love, may give herself willingly in marriage or not, may spend her entire life with a husband she hated or one she loved. She would probably have children, some who may die at birth. She may have miscarriages, or lose children to disease. She may even die in childbirth. If she was lucky, she would live to be over 60. The world was ruled by greedy, powerhungry men.That is how reality was. And that is how Bertrice Small writes."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I read this book when it was first released, nearly 20 years ago. It made me a fan of romantic erotica for life. I have every book Bertrice Small has written, and few if any have disappointed. She tells a grand tale, and never teases, always delivers. Her characters are three-dimensional and you become emotionally invested in them: for years, in the case of the O'Malley dynasty. Skye is a marvelous heroine, and her family saga is fascinating, rich, and wonderfully written. I'm still in love with the Duke of Southwood. You can't go wrong with this book or this author!Some reviewers have called the erotica in this book \\"trashy.\\" I respectfully beg to differ! Descriptions of sexual enjoyment in a romance novel aren't trash, they're beautiful! Do we consider our own sex lives garbage? I don't. So why relegate wonderfully written depictions of sexual activity to the garbage can? It's a real pity that the enjoyment of erotica is still so taboo.Bravo to Bertrice Small for writing the best of this genre.I wish more books that are advertised as \\"sexy\\" and \\"romantic\\" were as honest as this. I've just finished a well-known vampire series that, given the reviews, I expected to be along the lines of this book, and to my regret the only explicit depictions were of violence and death; the romance was non-existant, the eroticism teased but never delivered. I kept reading each book, hoping some aspect of the character's love life would be resolved, to no avail. What a disappointment!If you want real romance, real passion, real eroticism, read Bertrice Small's works. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Skye O'Malley is not your average heroine. She has the responsibility of heading her family thrust upon her at an early age, yet holds that responsibility with grace and determination. Skye is a reflection of Elizabeth I of England who must rise above the men who would fight her for her throne. Skye's life although more adventurous and sexually exciting, mirrors much of Elizabeth's life and the common threads of their lives are frequently commented upon. With great historical accuracy, Bertrice Small shows us many different cultures during this time period by giving us a strong, central character who triumphs not despite being a woman, but because she is a woman. In real life, very few women love just one man in their lifetime. Neither does Skye. This book is not your average happily-ever-after. Bertrice Small goes beyond the average romance formula and creates her own. I have yet to find an author like her and continously read and reread all of her books."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"On the verge of marrying a man she loathes (the betrothal had been made when they were children), Skye O'Malley meets Niall Burke and it's love at first sight - but the betrothal can't be broken and Niall must make a better match than Skye. On her wedding night, Niall claims the right of droit du seigneur and gets first shot at the young virgin, enraging her husband Dom. Skye suffers mightily at the hands of her abusive husband, but by the time she's free Niall is married (unhappily) and what then follows are plentiful ups and downs from capture by pirates on the high seas, being sold into slavery (don't you worry, our heroine can charm anyone even the \\"whoremaster of Algiers\\"), and eventually ending in England in a marriage that brings her to the court of Elizabeth Tudor, but a twist in fate makes the two women enemies in the end. Can Skye win her battle of wits with the formidable Queen of England? Will she and Niall ever have a happy ending?Somehow I missed reading Small's books back in the 80's and when I spotted this at a free-book sale I decided to give her a whirl. Yes, I was warned that the purple prose was plentiful, rapes abounded and that the sex was OTT and I was prepared for it, but still -\\"As his seed thundered into her hidden valley he shook fiercely with the intensity of his passion.\\"\\"Ahh...Skye, your little honey-oven is made for me.\\"Remember that honey-oven bit. Three (count 'em) three different men use this very same term when referring to Skye.\\"Let me play the great desert stallion tonight, my Skye. Roll over, and be my little wild mare.\\"Forgot to mention, Small seems to have a horse fixation...\\"A moment before his climax, he touched one hand beneath her to tweak at the little button of her sensuality and they shuddered their satisfaction in union.\\"*rolls eyes*\\"Your little honey-oven burns my lance with the fiery flow of the passion you would like to deny me, but can't.\\"There's that honey-oven again. Add all this up, toss in some very abrupt POV switches from one paragraph to the next, mix with some annoying info dumps containing waaaaay more background information on secondary characters than necessary (I really didn't need to know about Geoffrey's family history all the way back to the Norman Conquest) and what is left was just not the book for me. As for the rapes? Yes, they are pretty much standard for these older books and I can live with a forced seduction or two, but what I can't live with is when the heroine is raped by the meanest, baddest, most irredeemable man on earth and we get this,\\"And though she hated him, her body treacherously yielded itself.\\"I won't spoil, but the reader should also be warned that there is a scene towards the end involving a twelve-year-old girl and an aroused dog. If you're a die-hard fan of the old school bodice rippers with a strong stomach this might be the book for you - and it's a series so you can keep on readin' more. Any one else, I'd recommend steering clear - this is my first and last Bertrice Small book."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This was the third romance novel I had ever read, about 6 years ago. Just getting into the genre, I really thought it was filled with books like this. It's not. Most are rambling dissappointments and you know how they will end by the second chapter, and can guess everything in between. This is a novel. Truly full of everything any other romance claims: suspense, desire, strength, humanity, and love. I've since read many novels, and this is one I still remember and one of the few I've chased back down and reread."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Although many have trashed this book, I believe they take it, and themselves, way to seriously and should lighten up. Bertrice Small writes for ENTEERTAINMENT, and the research she puts into her books is astounding! Ms. Small's characters are strong, and insead of weeping pitiously in the face of adversity, make the best of the situations they find themselves in. Unlike mass market authors who put out 5 books a year, she keeps her fans breathlessly awaiting her next tale of love, adventure, and lets not forget...sex"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This book came highly recommended to me b/c I was looking for a romance novel that would knock my socks off. That is what I got. Yes, there were some areas in the novel that were a little disturbing (the incest), but they did not last, and they were not glorified. I enjoyed riding the rollercoaster with Skye through her troubles, loves, and adventures. I found the romance aspect of the novel unpredictable. There were times when I was so disappointed, I wasn't sure if I would be happy to see Skye with another lover, but then Small surprises you. Small has a gift for creating very likeable characters (especially men!)I was extremely pleased with the way things turned out for Skye. The ending was perfect and it had been a long time since I was satisfied with the ending of a novel.I am new to the genre, therefore I cannot compare this to other romances, but if you have not read any yet, here is the place to start! I have already started the next book in the series, All The Sweet Tomorrows..I'm psyched!"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"First I must identify myself as an Avid Bertrice Small fan, as well as a history buff. I would also like to state that I truly believe there are two major categories of romance readers; The escapists who read romance for neat and tidy love stories with just enough tension and drama to have a story line, but nothing to reality filled, as reality is often a bit of a bummer to deal with, especially in our leisure time. Now, with no judgment on this first group it's a bit formulaic for me, kind of like horror flicks, you know sweet but strong willed virgin meets highly skilled and sexed, hard to reach emotionally, hero. Just add a little drama and difficulty and a few chapters later and we all live happily ever after. Now don't get me wrong I would have never found Ms. Small's work had I not been a standard romance fan but when I read my first Small book \\"The love slave\\" ten years ago I was changed consumer of romance.So onto the second category if you enjoy History and I do mean detailed and some times gritty side of history. As well as rich scenery and slightly fantastical events, that may or may not have realistically befallen fictional characters, as well as a strong interest in sexuality and some erotica and the many different roles and aspects it plays in life and politics. Than welcome to this second category; for while no author is infallible this is the genre that Ms. Small has mastered and I recommend you start with the Skye O'Malley's saga.I hate giving to much away in these reviews: but I will say that Skye is a character who deserves the two immediate books and the ten that followed her Offspring, Even if the amount of contact with the Middle East and the bondages that ensue do become a little tedious at times. The first one hundred pages are a non-stop rollercoaster you can't put down. As the story moves forward you will be pulled into the court of Queen Elizabeth its politics and Intrigue as well as the ongoing tail of Skye, her love life and the ruling of her family and the building of an empire. I would recommend this read strongly, if you like this please continue to explore Bertrice Small's body of work which I have found fascinating. Once you've read this you'll know which kind of romance you are into. As a side note there are two books I consider prequels to the saga as a whole \\"The Kadin\\" and \\"Love Wild and Fair\\" if you already have read her work before please consider these titles first."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I read this book years ago. This is the beginning of a saga that spans the life of its heroine, Skye O'Malley. This is not your typical romance novel. Most authors write romances concerning the overused one true love topic. Bertrice Small looks at it another way. She is using a realistic approach. You can have many loves, there is no one true love. I would suggest you read Skye O'Malley, and if you think it is unfinished, thats because it is. Skye's story continues in All the Sweet Tomorrow's and the stories of her children continue after that. I have seen some people review saying that the characters are too young. They are young because in that time, people were young when they married. I was reading the excerpt for Bertrice Small's &quot;The Love Slave&quot; and Regan's mother died and the midwife noted that at 28, the woman was too old for childbearing. People had a much shorter life expectancy too. Skye lived a long time. She finally left the earth at the end of Darling Jasmine, a scene I will never forget. I would suggest read this book and all the others by her. Remember that these books ARE historically accurate, but they are also FICTION. Have a good read!"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"...but I don't. I think this is the worst incidence of purple prose I have ever come across.

It is like a little white dove.&quot;&quot;His legs were long, shapely, and covered with a fine pale golden down. His feet were slender, high-arched, the nails neatly pared. Her eyes wandered upward again to his sex, limp now and settled cozily in its nest of soft blond hair. It looked so sweet and harmless now, yet a short while ago it had been a great, blue-veined beast driving her to pleasures she hadn't known existed.&quot;I could go on. I really could. I suppose this book could get a higher rating on merit of my uproarious laughter at its content. If you like it purple, then you'll LOVE Bertrice Small."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I am an adult so sex between two people who love each other does not make me feel uncomfortable. However, numerous bed partners and Skye's lack of.... EVERYTHING except too much guts does. I had no idea there was such a fine line between romance and erotica but this novel is not a romance. I was very disappointed with the way Skye was treated...heck, the way EVERYONE was treated!I like sex but I like romance to go with it. That is, romance between the 2 meant to be lovers. There was more sex between Skye and other men than she had with Niall! I need to be emotionally drawn to the book and this book just did not do it. I'm sticking to Susan Johnson and Lisa Kleypas where I get sex and ever lasting love.This book talked of love and even when Skye spoke of love, it still left me cold. And I don't look for realism in my romances but PHULEEEESE, the situations she gets into, the things that happen to her, the misunderstandings, sheesh! I've read romances for many years and I've swallowed much but this book was too much of everything except loving devotion and emotion."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"It seemed to me that every guy she was paired with was scum. Obviously that Dom guy was supposed to be evil but even the men we were supposed to like i found awful. Look at Geoffery Southwood- First he blames his wife for only having daughters. As a result he refuses to let any of them get married because naturally they will only have daughters as well and then he beats his wife when she gets upset because he tells her he will have several men lie about having had slept with her in order to divorce her. Gee, I wonder why that would upset her? And then when she and four of his daughters die he dosn't even care and gives them lousy barias. Then there's Niall who is also very unlikable. He treats his first two wives like crap and then wonders why his marragies are so unhappy. During these marragies he sleeps with every women in sight having numerous bastards and then he actually acusses Skye of being a slut.Couldn't Skye have ended up with at least one decent guy? One that was more than just rich and maybe closer to her own age? I found this book to be interesting but unromantic."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"In general I HATE the historical romance genre. But I really do like Beatrice Small. Her plots and characters are complicated enough to be fairly believable and keep me interested, while still making the book light reading.

She is A wonderful AuthorAnd you will have a hard time putting down any of her books."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Plot does move along and see how heroine could appeal to some, but most characters are shallow and one-dimensional. Story itself has more than its share of bitter cruelty and depravity. This is supposed to be a romance novel?"},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"Obviously this book is not for me. I like books where the heroine doesn't sleep with half a dozen men, and where lovers don't call their women b*tch as a precursor to sex. As far as the sex scenes, I found them boring and just there for shock value. Like I said, this book/author is definitely not for me."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This was the first book of Bertrice Small's that I read, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the book, except for one thing:Skye is totally spoiled, and acts like a selfish brat half the time instead of a grown woman. Being informed of two of her marriages in the book (yes, two) sends her into fits of shrieking and vase throwing. The vast majority of the women of her time had all of their marriages arrainged for them, what made her think she was so overwhealmingly special? At least she stayed in charge of her money and her family's business.Other than that, I loved the book, and the 'naughty bits' will be sure to thrill."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"I am an African American Woman, and I honestly don't know how I begin reading Bertrice Small - but I have not stopped. Skye O Malley and the entire legacy is a must read for those who enjoy historical romances and a little erotical to spice it up.You never know how her books will end, and that keeps you going. She is my favorite author in the Historical Romance era.Keep them coming - and don't listen to those that blast your work, your loyal readers will remain that - and keep on buying and reading your books. Let them have their kicks.Keep up the awesome work, I also love to write, but you made me realize that it takes an unbelievable talent - dedication and research - so now I am just an avid romance reader."},{"Title":"Skye O'Malley","review":"This book is the handbook for all women's survival.

Why? Physicians learn comparatively little about the body's essential minerals in medical college and only recently has an ACCURATE test for measuring body magnesium been made available. Most physicians depend on the serum test for magnesium, not dependable for measuring the ACTIVE form of magnesium. Dr. Dean explains that mineral testing has evolved from taking whole blood measurements to testing for cell minerals to testing for mineral ions, the active component of minerals working at the tissue level. She writes: \\"Every year for the past forty years\\" the two dedicated scientists who developed this test \\"have produced on average a dozen peer-reviewed journal articles on magnesium and ionic magnesium testing. Their research convinces even die-hard skeptics...of the clear need for magnesium supplementation and the absolute requirement for ACCURATE testing.\\"Health problems Dr. Dean lists as having been successfully treated with magnesium therapy include HEART ARRHYTHMIA, SEIZURES, HYPOGLYCEMIA, COLITIS, HEAVY METAL TOXICITY, ASTHMA, MIGRAINES and NERVE PROBLEMS. I have been diagnosed with each of them -- most before it was known they can be magnesium-deficiency symptoms.Two years ago I was stricken with periods of rapid heartbeat - a form of HEART ARRHYTHMIA. At first I thought possibly my new anticonvulsant might be causing me to lose potassium since taking extra potassium slowed my fast pulse and when I no longer took potassium my frightening sieges of rapid pulse would periodically reoccur. So I asked my nutritionally-oriented physician if he could test for potassium \\"leakage\\". Luckily he knew that for potassium to function it needs sufficient magnesium, and he ordered a 24 hour urine test for potassium, magnesium and other minerals. The test indicated I was excreting excessive amounts of BOTH potassium and magnesium. Follow-up tests showed that while the magnesium in my white blood cells was LOW that the potassium in my red blood cells was NORMAL. Obviously not enough magnesium was reaching my cells. At that point my physician prescribed INTRAVENOUS magnesium, and the night following my first shot I slept better than I had in a long time!Several months later, following publication of her book, I noticed that Dr. Dean had written: \\"....magnesium is responsible for maintaining normal potassium and sodium concentrations INSIDE HEART MUSCLE CELLS.\\" She also said that a magnesium deficiency can result in one's having not only arrhythmia, seizures and convulsions but also muscle weakness. MUSCLE WEAKNESS! I recalled that muscle weakness is one of the four major side effects known to be caused by my new anticonvulsant -the anticonvulsant I started taking shortly before I was stricken with rapid-pulse arrhythmia! At the time, I only related muscular weakness to leg and arm muscles. But after reading what Dr. Dean wrote I wondered, \\"COULD LOW MAGNESIUM BE WEAKENING MY HEART MUSCLES?\\" It seemed to me that a heart muscle that was too weak to produce a strong beat might beat much more rapidly, trying to pump more blood.Elsewhere in the book I read, \\"Magnesium expert Mildred Seelig tells us that the side effects of many drugs may be associated with magnesium deficiency because MAGNESIUM BECOMES DEPLETED WHILE THE BODY IS TRYING TO DETOXIFY DRUGS.\\"My physician had told me the anticonvulsant I had previously taken - marketed for many years and, therefore, better evaluated - depleted magnesium. Upon reading Dr. Seelig's statement I began to suspect that my new anticonvulsant might be causing my low magnesium level and the low magnesium, in turn, might be weakening my heart muscles and triggering periods of rapid pulse arrhythmia.In addition to receiving magnesium IVs and taking oral supplements I have paid close attention to Dr. Dean's suggestions for maintaining a healthy magnesium level. For example, she lists which foods and which brands of bottled waters have the highest levels of magnesium, which foods can block its absorption and which foods require extra magnesium for digestion and metabolism.Just a year ago, following a 24 hour Holter test that recorded my periods of arrhythmia, my cardiologist recommended Digoxin for treating it. Because my arrhythmia had responded to taking potassium, I asked if - before trying any prescription drugs -- he would consider my first trying nutritional supplements that have been successfully used to treat arrhythmia. Unlike three other cardiologists I had consulted, he was enthused about exploring this comparatively new field with me.His trust in me and my faith in what Dr. Dean had written were rewarded. Following my recent treadmill test, my cardiologist wrote:: \\"On the standard Bruce treadmill she has an excellent aerobic capacity of 10.1 METS. She completes 53 seconds of stage 3 with a maximum heart rate 158 and no arrhythmia...Recovery is rapid to heart rate 83 within six minutes and her examination and treadmill test electrocardiographically are normal before, during and after exercise.\\"Jerri Spalding Fredin, 78 years youngSeptember 2003"},{"Title":"The Miracle of Magnesium","review":"As a nurse I am required to have 24hrs of CE credits, to renew my license.

It explains how magnesium deficiencies cause or contribute to certain conditions that we all have experienced, such as: fatigue, muscle cramps, heart palpitations, headaches, sleeping problems and so much more. Then it gives you directions on how you can prevent or solve it before it gets worse. It also shows how magnesium has an important role in heart disease, strokes, Alzheimers, and more.Dr. Carolyn Dean's book is a very inexpensive investment in your health and will save you not only your money in the long run!"},{"Title":"The Miracle of Magnesium","review":"For far too many years the mineral magnesium has been largely overlooked as a nutrient which is essential for good health. Most doctors and laboratories don't even include magnesium status in routine blood tests. Thus, most doctors don't know when their patients are deficient in magnesium, even though the majority of Americans are deficient in magnesium. And magnesium deficiency is very important. In fact, magnesium deficiency is a significant factor -- often the major factor -- in many severe illnesses including heart attacks and other forms of heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, anxiety and panic attacks, depression, fatigue, diabetes, migraines and other headaches, osteoporosis, insomnia, and most cases of muscular problems. Because magnesium deficiency is largely overlooked, millions of Americans suffer needlessly from the foregoing ailments or are having their symptoms treated with expensive drugs (which often have unpleasant or dangerous side effects) when they could be cured with magnesium supplementation. This excellent and easily-readable new book by Dr. Dean discusses these and other important aspects of the essential mineral magnesium in detail. Everyone who is concerned about his or her health should acquire and read this very important book. So should their doctors."},{"Title":"The Miracle of Magnesium","review":"What would you say about wildly-broad claims for a nutrient, magnesium, that sounds like a \\"cure-all\\" for disease? Haven't you been taught that there is no such thing as a \\"magic bullet\\"? No such thing as a \\"miracle\\"? On the other hand, what if you bought a car and found that about 1/4 of its bolts and nuts were missing. Would it run? Yes, it would likely run, but it would have problems. It would require service, frequent service, and often expensive service. Dr. Dean identifies a critical weakness in American nutrition and medicine essentially identical to those missing bolts and nuts, that being chronic magnesium deficiency. Think of magnesium as bolts and nuts that hold our bodies together and keep us well. Just like missing bolts and nuts makes a car unreliable, magnesium deficiency causes more illness than anyone can imagine. Well, you can imagine it by using the missing bolt and nut analogy. Lets start thinking health with the serious stuff first. You will see that Dr. Dean shows by review of many peer-reviewed medical journal articles that nearly all of the serious/lethal heart conditions such as arrhythmias, tachycardia, EKG & ECG abnormalities, arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure, angina, heart attacks (including sudden death heart attacks), high bad cholesterol, blood clots, mitral valve prolapse, type II diabetes, inability to handle \\"stress\\" are really nothing more than SYMPTOMS of severe magnesium deficiency. Our hearts and cardiovascular system needs more bolts and nuts to keep it properly working! How much more simple can cardiology get? Supply the correct parts and the body should run like a Swiss clock. Many other \\"diseases\\" such as constipation, kidney stones, menstrual cramps, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, PMS, spontaneous abortion, miscarriage, carbohydrate intolerance, ravenous appetite, obesity, low serum calcium and potassium (not correctable with supplements), elevated serum phosphorus, vitamin D resistance, muscle cramps, muscle soreness, backaches, neck pain, headaches, TMJ, muscle tension and twitches, convulsions, headaches, cluster headaches, migraine headaches, hearing loss, ringing in ears, hyperactivity, reduced (lost) intelligence, poor attention span, poor memory, stress disorders, ADHD in children (and adults), insomnia, numbness, tingling, agoraphobia, anxiety, depression, suicidal depression, irritability, panic attacks, addictive behavior (craving for cocaine, tobacco, alcohol other illegal drugs) all - each and every one - are SYMPTOMS of inadequate dietary magnesium. The diseases that are treatable, curable and preventable with magnesium supplementation represent the bulk of \\"diseases\\" currently treated with expensive pharmaceutical drugs and hospital treatments. Magnesium deficiency is a pharmaceutical company's treasure! And our worst nightmare! If all Americans supplemented their diets with sufficient magnesium (600 mg magnesium supplemental) per day, there would result a great reduction in the need for pharmaceuticals, physician and hospital services nation-wide. Why should we pay our doctors if they can't get us well by using drugs as a substitute for magnesium? Can you imagine paying a mechanic to fix your car with non-standard parts (drugs)? It should run perfectly, and so should our bodies. The main source of magnesium in the American diet 100 years ago when there was much magnesium in our food was whole wheat, dark green leafy vegetables and nuts. Due to refining wheat, there is little magnesium remaining and people tend to avoid nuts due to their oil content. Most people do not eat enough vegetables. This is why doctors that really care about our health, like Dr. Dean, say that the diets that avoid sugar and refined grain are right for us. Avoid the pitfalls of near zero magnesium-content foods and at least you have some chance of having better health. Water used to have large amounts of magnesium dissolved in it, but modern technology purifies water of its precious nutrients as well as its harmful impurities. Consequently, we have a serious culturally-induced magnesium deficiency that adversely affects all of our lives on a daily basis, and costs this country about 15% of its gross domestic product in un-necessary health costs. What to do? Don't spend money on expensive medical treatments until you have replaced your missing parts (magnesium). Dr. Dean tells you how much to use, why to supplement magnesium, where to get magnesium and when you need magnesium supplementation."},{"Title":"The Miracle of Magnesium","review":"My husband was rushed to the hospital with all of the symptoms of a heart attack.

I came across Dr. Deans new book, THE MIRACLE OF MAGNESIUM. I figured that my husband was having arterial spasms and when my husband took this information to his doctor, the doctor agreed that yes, most likely this was the problem. My husband is now on magnesium therapy and has not had anymore spasms to date. Thank God for this book, as it is a wealth of information!

Actually I was given a great deal of charcoal to remove harmful toxins from my body. Shortly after I began having panic attacks. In the midst of one attack I was taken to the emergency room where an unknown intern administered a course of magnesium. However, magnesium was never discussed in any follow-up treatment given by my regular doctor.About a half a year later I began to experience cramping in my legs at night. Eventually I was introduced to a company which offered a highly absorbable calcium mineral formula. Taking this product on a nightly basis eliminated the leg cramping completely.The company aired a daily (Monday through Friday) one hour radio program in which it educated its customers regarding \\"The Truth about Nutrition\\". After five years of listening to the program regularly I learned a great deal about maintinaing my health and became encouraged to learn as much as possible about alternativehealth solutions. Eventually magnesium came to the foreground in my thoughts. I knew I was already taking the proper ratio of magnesium to calicum, but began to realize in some cases certain individuals actually require slightly higher amounts of magnesium.Eventually I began reassessing my own situation. Many years prior to the application of charcoal to remove toxins from my system I knew charcoal tablets could be taken for a limited time onlyas they tended to deplete magnesium in the body. Ah ha, I thought, had the administering of excessive amounts of charcoal set me up to be so deficient in magnesium as to eventually bring on the panic attacks? Intimations of the panic attacks persisted from time to time (mind over matter and deep breathing got me through these occurences) so as to cause me to experiment with additional amounts of magnesium in my diet. Eventually I discovered that with increased amounts of magnesium the panic attacks (or rather intimations of) became less and less an occurence. As well my sleep improved along with increased speed in completing my daily weight lifting exercises, i.e. I had increased energy.Years prior to all events described above I experienced a series of unexplainable nocturnal seizures. Over the course of time that followed I had on and off periods where going to sleep at night was a scary undertaking as my right arm would jerk and begin to cramp up, this the general aura I had before going into a seizure. Sleeping on my right side with my arm tucked in was the only way I could allay this feeling of impending danger. Since experimenting with magnesium I very seldom experience these occurences.In the very early eighties I spent a couple years in the Mediterranean, and was particularly drawn to an Aegean Coastal Village, Datca, in Turkey because of its 1/8 mile mineral lake in which I would swim up to eight miles a day. I gave no thought to the fact that my skin was obviously absorbing whatever minerals this lake contained and that through my bloodstream these were being transported to all the cells in my body. I was aware, however, as is evidenced in several photos taken at this time, that I had a heightened radience; a well above average glow of health. This lasted for about a year after I returned to the United States. If I am not taking things too far, I might add that my singing voice improved remarkably for the experience.I am quite aware that our soils no longer contain necessary vitamins and minerals and that vegetation grown in these soils is as well deficient in both vitamins and minerals. Therefore, in today's world supplementation is a must. As well I am quite aware that there are many attempts afoot designed to blindside consumers in our attempts to stay healthy, which is why I have developed a keen since of discerning good information from bad to assist me in being an advocate for my own health.Doctor Dean's \\"The Miracle of Magnesium\\" appealed to me because I knew it would reaffirm my knowledge about this wonderful mineral as well as provide additional insights. In a very generous and easy-to-read manner the book did both these things. Recently my nephew revealed to me his concern about panic attacks. I wrote him a lengthy letter explaining the function of minerals in the human body, the proper ratio of magnesium to calcium, etc. I then ordered Doctor Dean's book and had it shipped directly to his home address. I will continue to encourage my nephew more and more to become an advocate for his own health and well being. It is through books such a Doctor Dean's that the average person has such options at all.

The sources include sex education publications, women&iexcl;s magazines, medical pamphlets, newspaper, official and popular press, women&iexcl;s magazines, sex manuals. Unlike other books about sexuality on China, Evans has done thorough study on almost all the materials available and has used them more critically than many others. Although I have reservations about her analysis, I am very impressed by her collection of sources and her sincere engagement.Evans argues against the view that sex has &iexcl;taken off&iexcl; in China in the last decade and that there is stark contrast between the liberalization of the 1980s on sexuality and the Maoist decades. She stresses the continuity from the 1949s to the present by drawing references to the sex related materials published in the 1950s as a result of the Marriage law and argues that the rhetoric and ideology between the now and then are similar. Similar to Frank Dikotter, she believes that medical experts were the authority and they controlled the discourse of sexuality: &iexcl;Medical experts claimed the authority of modern science to expound the view that biological differences in reproductive and sexual development determined all major distinctions between women and men in sexual and social behavior.&iexcl; (3) Her main argument is that even though there are differences between the 1950s and the 1980s, the 1980s still &iexcl;echoed many of the concerns of the former discourse.&iexcl; (3) Also, one of her main concerns is the state&iexcl;s use of science to enforce the hierarchical gender relationships and tie women&iexcl;s gender characteristics with reproductive function. She wants to show that women&iexcl;s sexuality has always been controlled and appropriated for other purposes of the state that serve for the &iexcl;well-being&iexcl; of the society, such as socialist cause and population control.Evans emphasizes how the theory of biological naturalism was used to define men and women. It stresses the natural characteristics of active and passive. Nevertheless, in the 50s, in promoting the socialist female image, female gender characteristics were deemphasized and a style of &iexcl;socialist androgyny&iexcl; was presented and the signs of feminine beauty was suppressed: &iexcl;Images of female body suggestive of sexual interest and removed from associations with utilitarian practicality became a metaphor for subject positions with which women could identify only at their peril.&iexcl; (136) Evans argues that the official critique on conventional signs of feminine beauty &iexcl;signifies an attempt to revise gender constructs associated with female appearance so as to correspond with the ideological shift toward the public sphere matters associated with sexual and bodily management.&iexcl; (136) I think here is one of the places where Evans can further analyze the contradictions and contestations in meanings of the ideological change. It seems that she could not elaborate freely as she could about the refeminization of female appearance in the mid 1950s. (Or did I overlook her deeper analysis?)Since the late 1970s, there is a rise of popular discourses, however, Evans argues that the objectification of women for male pleasure and use is reinforced. Even though the discourse is not dominated by the state, it perpetuates the inequality. Nevertheless, Evans also shows that challenges exist and there are some alternative female voices. Despite this new contesting scene, Evans argues that the use of eroticized female image is more prominent. It is interesting that Evans observes the difference in state perception of urban and rural population on the issue of commercialization of women. It seems that the official discourse is arguing that ignorance and poverty the sale of women in the rural society. &iexcl;The condemnation of prostitution, pornography, and sexual crime is part of an official discourse that is moulded more by moralistic assumptions about sexual propriety, women&iexcl;s in particular, than by an understanding of gender hierarchy.&iexcl; (188) Here Evans contends that it is &iexcl;gender hierarchies of power&iexcl; that is underlying the discourse. Her criticism seems too vague and moralistic. She seems to have taken the efforts and ideology of the official discourse seriously. Is her portrayal and criticism too simplistic? It seems like she is criticizing out of political and social contexts. Moreover, it seems to me that Evans tries to justify some of her arguments by assuming the responses of the readers. There are points that she uses the views of some Chinese women she encountered to generalize as attitudes of &iexcl;many women&iexcl;. (18) Sometimes, the responses and behaviors of the common people are just assumed: &iexcl;ordinary men and women did not conduct their sexual lives according to these texts any more than they necessarily supported or believed in the subject positions they offered.&iexcl; (16) How does she know? From what she says, Evans is aware of the constitutive power of the texts and claims that gender and sexuality are culturally constructed: &iexcl;The sense of being a woman or man is formed within the context of dominant discourses and categorizations, regardless of how individual women and men consciously articulate their responses to them.&iexcl; (15) &iexcl;Whether or not individual persons consciously acknowledge the dominant gender categories of these discourses, they also participate in reproducing them by making representations and self-representations &iexcl;V both consciously and unconsciously &iexcl;V with reference to them.&iexcl; (19) (See discussion on p.18-20) Does she demonstrate her argument well throughout her book? Or is it just a statement made in the introduction?I am not quite convinced by Evans&iexcl; overall argument. She seems to be reinforcing the narrative that women is objectified and oppressed. I think representations of women sexuality can be a subversive force, but her interpretation does not seem to tell us alternative interpretations of power. It seems that women&iexcl;s agency is dismissed in her picture. Even though that she suggests some optimistic alternative discourse arising in the 1980s challenging the dominant views on women&iexcl;s sexual pleasure, the heterosexist discourse of conjugal responsibilities and category of &iexcl;woman,&iexcl; she still believes that the active-male/passive-female model is still intact. Evans seems to be trying too hard to push her point and dismisses the alternative discourses too quickly. I think it is a waste of materials if all she merely wants to argue that women are still under the hierarchical sexist order. I think she could have complicated the picture more by look deeper into the texts and set them in social contexts.I am not so clear why she wants to bridge the gap between the 1950s and 1980s. Because of this agenda, I think she tries to fit everything into a neat narrative. It seems paradoxical, if one of her goals is to demystify what is assumed about the sexual liberation in the 1980s. Also, although she marks the years of the publications in most cases, her analyses are sometimes confusing and out of historical contexts. It is not clear what time period and whose voice she is talking about. I also don&iexcl;t find much analysis on the Cultural Revolution years. I suspect that one of her problems is that she tries to avoid socio-economic or political issues. She carries assumptions about Chinese society even though she tries to avoid it. It seems to me that she does not go inside the society and only attempts to analyze from without.She seems to be suggesting that the hierarchical natural normative model was a creation of the state or part of the dominant discourse, but the connection between the discourse and the state is elusive. For the sections on the recent period, she argues that the public sexual discourse is not in the control of the state but it in many ways still upholds the old ideology and guards sexual behaviors, yet I am not satisfied with her picture about the tension and contrast between official, semi-official and the popular discourses. ........................."},{"Title":"Women and Sexuality in China","review":"i am happy that this book pays attention to homosexuality in china. finally! it is something worthy respect. however, i also find that the section on homosexuality in the book is not reliable enough (PP. 206-15). especially, P. 208 is too simplified. maybe it is because that the writer relies on Bret Hinsch's book (published in 1990). however, since Hinsch's book is a bit old now and not accurate enough, any scholarship easily dependent on Hinsch will end up problematic. i also find the writer, i mean evans, has to be more critical of the documents from the chinese officials."},{"Title":"Chemical Engineering Design, Fourth Edition: Chemical Engineering Volume 6 (Coulson & Richardson's Chemical Engineering)","review":"This book is an excellent book for a Chemical Engineer final year student or Chemical/Process Engineer professional.

We often do this--pick up something that looks like a great old pulpy novel and give it a chance. I had no idea that I was picking up a massively creative, intensely realized work of science fiction literature when we did.Foster is not a name that I knew, and I am pretty well read in Science Fiction--I've been actively reading the genre for the last 25 years or so. The fact that this man is not talked about frequently is a bizarre piece of nonsense to me. This book pulls together all three novels about the Ler--the race of people that comes after humans in the evolutionary tree. He presents them in one of the most interesting of formats--living side by side with humankind, both revering us as their creators, and yet full of fear for us and our wild actions. The entire experience is a thoughtful exploration of what it means to be human, and what makes one human, and what pieces of ourselves should be given to those who come after us.Pick this up. It is a rare find."},{"Title":"The Book of the Ler","review":"I ahve always wondered why Mr Foster has completely dropped off the radar--aside, of course, from the fact he hasn't published anything in 20+ years--but then, of course, neither has Robert A Heinlein and look at the attention HE gets. At any rate, in these books Mr Foster sets up a fascinating future society of \\"new humans\\" (matahomo novalis, as he calls them) and their interactions with \\"old\\" humans (that's us). Within this framework, \\"Warriors of Dawn\\" is straight space opera with a love interest, \\"The Gameplayers of Zan\\" a suspense novel and \\"Day of the Klesh\\" (my least favorite of the three) a winding-up. Mr Foster is a writer who seems to have been deeply influenced by Jack Vance both in style and in theme: \\"Day of the Klesh\\" will remined discerning readers of Vance's \\"Big Planet\\". While Mr Foster on occasion will get (in my opinion) too deeply immersed in the intracies of his creations (this, to my mind, is the major flaw of \\"The Gameplayers of Zan\\")readers who persist through these longeurs will find themselves amply rewarded with arichly detailed and internally believable world."},{"Title":"The Book of the Ler","review":"It's not perfect- but no book is, and I can be pretty judgmental. Although he's not the best writer in the world, he definitely has a great style, grace, and flow. The first half of the first book in the trilogy was hard for me to get through. You must keep in mind that 'The Warriors of Dawn' was written first, and then Foster wrote 'The Gameplayers of Zan' afterwords, as a prequel, so a LOT of the beginning of that book seems to simply explain and develop this entire, deep Ler community; benefiting to someone who had read Warriors, but wanted to learn more about how it all started. So for some it can seem to dredge on when reading 'The Gameplayers of Zan' first, but I still suggest reading it in that order- it made it more enjoyable for me in the long run. Once the story starts going I got extremely sucked into it. I had been looking for a great Sci-Fi book to read for a long time, and was always dissatisfied because the stories may be cool and such, but never 'deep' enough, never had enough thought out meaning and depth. This story is great, and makes statements about humanity, and it can make you think, but I wouldn't consider it one of those amazingly mind-blowing stories I've experienced. But fantastic in it's own right, definitely deserving five stars."},{"Title":"The Book of the Ler","review":"I picked up a copy of \\"The Warriors of Dawn\\" a couple of years ago and loved it enough that M.A. Foster got onto my short list.

The photos of Stanley in his garden celebrate the beauty of his garden and of living life to the fullest in old age. My favorite is a picture of Stanley's gnarled hands behind his back with dirt on the tips of his fingers.I am new to Kunitz's poetry so the poems sprinkled throughout the book were wonderful to read. More than the poems though, I was fascinated by his thoughts about the process of writing poetry and what constitutes a meaningful poem.\\"Almost anything you do in the garden, for example weeding, is an effort to create some sort of order out of nature's tendency to run wild. There has to be a certain degree of domestication in a garden. The danger is that you can so tame your garden that it becomes a THING. It bcomes landscaping.In a poem, the danger is obvious; there is natural idiom and then there is domesticated language. The difference is apparent immediately when you sense everything has been subjugated, that the poet has tamed the language and the thought process that flows into a poem until it maintains a principle of order but nothing remains to give the poem its tang, its liberty, its force. Once the poem starts flowing, the poet must not try to dictate every syllable.\\"Thanks to my dear friend who recommended this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Wild Braid: A Poet Reflects on a Century in the Garden [SIGNED LIMITED EDITION]","review":"This book by Stanley Kunitz and his collaborator is a powerful testament to the power of the garden.

I just recently read this book straight through. I enjoyed hearing Kunitz's thoughtful voice that was captured so clearly in these transcription, and after viewing all the photos, I only wished I had been close enough to Kunitz to see his garden. The down side of the book are the juvenile and intrusive dialogues with his assistant. She seems more concerned with exhibiting her undergraduate inquisitiveness about death. Kunitz is so far beyond that as I would imagine most readers would be. If the reader is still at the stage where she or he feels that death is the ultimate question and there are logical approaches to it, maybe those sections will seem interesting.

First of all, I found reading this book to be an arduous task. I feel the same way that Joseph Conrad did, namely, I saw no emotion in it. Let me take just one sentence out to illustrate: \\"...in order to distinguish in...Gilberte an indefinable quality analogous in the world of the emotions to what in the world of colours is called infra-red, my parents would have needed that supplementary sense with which love had temporarily endowed me.\\" I imagine that if I were to write this sentence, my writing instructor's red ink comments would be \\"Wordy, awkward, over intellectual\\". Compare Proust's sentence with how John Steinbeck expressed the same sentiment: \\"Once, when I raptured in a violet glow given off by the Queen of the World, my father asked me why, and I thought he was crazy not to see. Of course I know now she was a mouse-haired, freckle-nosed, scabby-kneed little girl with a voice like a bat and the loving kindness of a gila monster, but then she lighted up the landscape and me\\".This pretty much sums up my reaction to this book. I cannot recommend it to anyone, no matter how famous the book is and no matter if it won the Prix Goncourt, and no matter how intelligent Proust was, and no matter how many people say they wouldn't have wanted to go to their grave without having read it.

Makes your mind feel rich and comfortable."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"This book is a failure in its two major attempts: to entertain and to capture human thinking. Swann's Way is generally said to be written in the stream-of-consciousness technique. Having thus said that, I daresay it is a psychoanalytic error. Both important characters in this story (Swann and the narrator himself) think in a way that is entirely incredible. They take every little aspect of their uneventful lives and seem to put it under a microscope, leaving not a single detail of that aspect, that facet, undetected. They break it down to its indivisible remains. They're relentless; they peal away until there is nothing left. That is mainly why the book drags on so much. It seems as if Swann and the narrator (both of whom, it should forthwith be established, are boring...) are not average in any way. They are two psychologists who'd make Freud and Jung quiver to their very skeletons.Give me a break, I say. No one in real-life thinks the way they do, taking pages upon endless pages in analyzing the minutiae, the most diminutive stuff that happens in their lives - stuff that in real-life goes totally ignored. Not being anything near a psychologist, I can easily tell that the characters in this story are faker than a toupee. At least Joyce, who is worlds more tedious than Proust at his worst, succeeded with near-perfect accuracy at transmitting man's consciousness from the brain to the paper. Proust, with his microscoped slides tightly clasped at the nucleus of his characters' brains, made a bad claim to the selfsame place Joyce later reached. Swann's Way, in this respect, is a dud; an exaggeration wrought by meticulosity.And then, of course, it must be remembered that it is also a work of fiction. But a deceptive work of fiction at that, for the first sentence promises a story that would never melt away into one's oblivion: &quot;For a long time I would go to bed early.&quot; A simple sentence, so simple that it promises the reader that the story is filled with all possibilities. Anything may happen. But the reader soon learns that there are no possibilities, that the sense instilled into his mind by the first sentence is a false one. For in the end, nothing happens. Not that nothing is resolved, because that really doesn't matter - just that nothing happens. It's a long, boring cab-drive home.And those long sentences and long paragraphs that seem to make the pages cry, filled with those tremendous blocks of text - they are of no positive effect to the overall story, or any portion of it, for that matter. That is not to say that extensive writing like this is bad in literature, keeping in mind those few writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez who made such wonderful use of his long stretches of paragraphs. Proust merely needed to trim his up, needed to remove all that bogus stream-of-consciousness. The story of M. Swann and his liaison with Mme Odette is so simple that any other writer would have taken up two hundred pages or less to tell it.But of course, now, there are the positives. To say that Swann's Way had no wonderful passages would be a perjury. A book of such longevity would as sure as fire have a couple of things one would delight in reading. Early on in the story, for instance, the narrator describes the church towers, steeples, and belfries he sees overhead one day whilst walking home. The words he uses in conveying these sublime images into the reader's mind are so delicious the reader thereafter finds himself quickly turning the pages back to reread the passages in their entireties. Sometimes, Proust's words are like a Turkish Delight for the eyes. If the Moncrieff translation is this grand, one can only imagine how good the book is in its original language. Thus, for the tender sake of language, Swann's Way is a good book. There is a practice, an exercise into language in this book that, while not unprecedented, you seldom see in others. But all the rest is nothing more than a boring prose poem that serves as the overture to an epic that must surely be painstaking to finish."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"So he may not have been the best author.

Try Joyce instead"},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"How can any work be so dreary and unpoetic and at once so imprecise and unanalytical? The answer: Read Proust! While failing in describing the sensory world with hallucinatory clarity and beauty, Proust simultaneously presents his characters (all quite forgettable) as if under a broken microscope, not revealing in any luminous detail the complex interplay of memory, desire, conscience and habit in their divided hearts. The narrator (a young and bitter Proust, more or less) divides the work roughly between a nostalgic portrait of childhood summers at his family's country home, and a morbidly funny record of an older friend's humiliating courtship of a notorious prostitute and subsequent crucifixion by jealousy. Proust does not have a cruel wit, supernatural eye for paradox,taste for the most delicious ironies or above all an all-encompassing wisdom that borders on the mystical - forgiving nothing, forgetting all."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"I'm glad that this book has generated so much controversy, even if most of it has been the brilliant comments of one or two people who are amazingly capable of expressing original views. For most of us, repeating someone's comments but replacing positives with negatives was something funny and something that lightened up the mood; something especially needed when discussing such dreary literature. It definately qualifies as valid criticism. Swann's Way is undoubtedly a work of perversion.

Nonetheless, the work is ultimately a failure because it offers no rewards.One can imagine the asthmatic Proust lying in bed for days on end writing his work in place of an occupation. The reader is not so lucky as to have so much time to spend in pursuit of Proust's point. Reading Proust feels like a tedious full-time job, instead of a diversion or glimpse of great art.Even worse is that so much of Proust's novel is empty of plot. The characterizations, however clever, do not redeem the novel's 600-page thesis on simple memory. There does exist literature that functions autobiographically and deserves praise in spite of the lack of plot, such as Anthony Powell's A DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME or even Raymond Schwartz's KIEL AKVO DE L' RIVERO, but those works are much more compact and offer a wealth of fascinating setting and characters along the way. SWANN'S WAY is simply void.For those who have the energy to tackle this work, and the five novels after it which continue &quot;In Search of Lost Time,&quot; SWANN'S WAY might present an attractive challenge. But for those of us who cannot spend whole days reading, SWANN'S WAY is a frustrating work."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"The opening sixty pages of Swann's Way (entitled &quot;Overture&quot;) is among the most beautiful passages of world literature. In symphonic language, Proust sets the stage for his entire Remembrance of Things Past. If you've never read Proust before, but know that you should, just try &quot;Overture.&quot; Read it in one sitting and you will become hypnotized by a writer in a class by himself.The Modern Library edition features the 1980s revision of the earlier Random House edition. It's a stunning translation."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"All of us have self-talk, which is quite different from the way we converse with each other or write. Proust has captured self-talk in a delightful display of stream-of-consciousness writing that is unequaled in literature. You will find yourself remembering many of the same thoughts in your own self-talk. By focusing inward, Proust succeeds in portraying much of what is universal about all of humanity.Unlike Joyce, who employed the same technique, Proust is easy and delightful to follow. You will sense beauty in thought that will make you glad to be alive. It will also stimulate you to notice more about the world around you and your reactions to it.Do be aware that an internally-focused book does not have a lot of action and drama in it. On the other hand, neither does most of life. I think Proust has captured the essence of human life in a very valuable way. But if you like Dirk Pitt novels and little else, you would do well to avoid Swann's Way.The main drawback of self-talk is that we often build hurdles where there are none. We often talk ourselves out of things that we should pursue. As a result, our thinking stalls our ability to act. You will find lots of delicious examples of this in the hypochondria explored in this book.Although this book is rarely assigned in literature classes, almost everyone would benefit from reading it. You can best use it as a mirror to see yourself better. That should make for a tasty dish that is irresistible once tasted. Bon appetit!"},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"I approached this book with some trepidation. Did I really want to start a 6-volume project? Was it as inaccessible as some have said it is? Was I just being pretentious in wanting to read them? And which edition to read? So many to choose from. After much research, I decided to go for the Modern Library 6-volume paperback edition, translated by Moncrieff and Kilmartin with revisions by Enright. This is what the experts recommended, and the beautiful cover art is a bonus.I started reading and immediately was captivated by the book. I enjoyed every bit of minutiae and every beautiful sentence. The scenes from Combray were wonderful, but I especially loved the love story between M. Swann and Odette. I could feel Swann's anguish, confusion, suspicioun, and obsession.Do yourself a favor, make time for Proust."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"This book is like a great kaleidoscope where the characters are the cristals of the myriad scenes depicted page after page.Proust creates a delighful new world from every little thing that surrounds him. His childhood is a mean to give birth to a gallery of charming characters and strong sensations that flow in a continuous stream. His exquisite and delicate prose transports us to our own childhood. He lets us perceive the beauty of simple things stimulating all our senses.(It is strange how a simple translation can give a book's title more than its original sense. &quot;Du cot&eacute; de chez Swann&quot; or &quot;Por el camino de Swann&quot; -the former being the original title and the later the spanish translation- tell us simply that we are going to introduce ourselves in a beautiful promenade along a little ville called Combray. However, the english tittle &quot;Swann's way&quot; creates in the reader's mind an expectation about the main character that does not come up even in the original tittle.)"},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"A &quot;reader from London&quot; is right: this book could only be enjoyed by pretentious people. The millions of people who have read In Search of Lost Time and loved it, as well as the great writers - Woolf, Nabokov, Joyce and many others - who have admired it, are clearly wrong. The reader from London who found it pretentious is obviously more perceptive than any of these people. Any statement that someone actually enjoyed this book must therefore be insincere, and is designed only to show how clever that person is."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"This is 600 pages. And it's only the first 1/8 or so of the truly monumental IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME. And the plot, such as it is, could be summarized in 4 or 5 sentences. There are about 3 analogies per page. Yet, somehow, I'm not bored . . . and have just, in fact, ordered the 2nd (of the 6) books that comprise the novel in this edition. That's because I was virtually never bored. I've found the writing to be rather remarkable: elegant and sure. And Proust's exegesis and application of memory and of consciousness are truly, TRULY stupendous, immaculate, intellectually compelling. A caveat: Proust is not for everyone, for his writing is very difficult to read because his language is so dense and exact(ing). But if you think you have the ability and perseverence, give it a go."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"In search of Lost Time is regarded by many as a key work of modern literature, bridging ideas from the 19th and 20th centuries. Proust is often compared to Joyce and Kafka.This is revised translation of the early Moncrieff translation. That was the primary translation for the first 50 years after the first publication in French. The present work includes the later changes to the original French manuscripts made in 1954. These additions and changes were excluded in the first manuscript from Proust. The manuscript was revised in the Pleiade edit of 1954 to include all of Proust's final edits. Those edits, additions, and changes are now translated and revised by Enright.There are three parts to Volume I:- Combray (the town)- Swann in Love (Swann is the family name of the narrator)- Place-Names-The NameHere is a question for the average reader: is this a novel? What is it? The present Volume I is 600 pages, and if you continue on after Volume I, you face another 5000 pages or so. It is not a novel and it is not a play or drama as one sees with Shakespeare; instead, it is a seemingly endless narrative. Should we be concerned with what it is? The answer is yes, because some will find Proust to be a tedious challenge while others will love him.For example, Madam Bovary is a novel. It has a beginning, an end, clear characters who are good, evil, and indifferent. It takes place in 19th century French countryside as does Proust, and unlike Proust it is a gripping tale. The writing by Flaubert is flawless. The structure is perfect. That is a novel. I read all 500 pages of Madame Bovary in one day and was very entertained and impressed.Proust's Volume I, by contrast, has taken me 12 months to read. Again, as with Flaubert, the prose is faultless and the details described are done exquisitely, but there is no plot, and it is not gripping. It is a series of memories or short sections. Almost by definition, these short pieces do not carry the drama of a well balanced novel. They are weakly linked together plus the writing is complicated by many characters, often relatives of the narrator. If you put the book down and start again you are momentarily lost. Some readers, and that includes myself, wonder why we continue.Proust is part of our literary education and one can appreciate the interwoven snapshots of life, the beautiful descriptions of rural Combray, the characters of France, and the relatives in his family. It is an endless narrative about a man's life and those pieces of his life. It is a collection of memories. Here in Volume I we see three broad snapshots of one man's life; we escape to 19th century France, and we become part of a seemingly endless tale about the fine details of that life. If that interests you, then you will love Proust.Only the most patient should read Proust. Be prepared for beautiful prose and French 19th century life."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Personally, I don't see how it can get any better than this. In Search of Lost Time is to literature as Wagner's Ring is to music--pure genius. This is a 4000 page, hallucinagenic, dream-inducing masterpiece. Amazon would need more stars than a night sky to adequately rate this novel."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"*Swann's Way* is a difficult novel to recommend unreservedly. Not because it isn't a beautiful and affecting masterpiece, but because it's inevitably the sort of novel that--by its very nature--is not everyone's cup of tea. A novel that begins with a 60+ page riff on a man falling asleep and recalling the drama surrounding his mother's goodnight kiss may be enough to turn off even your most enthusiastic fan of one of Flaubert's potboilers. On the other hand, for anyone who appreciates the sensual, visual, and musical possibilities of language and the infinite psychological subtleties revealed in the gimlet-eyed scrutiny of self and others there are few--if any--novelists that top Proust or novels more spellbindingly beautiful than *Swann's Way.*The first of Proust's legendary six-volume epic, *In Search of Lost Time,* *Swann's Way* actually consists of three distinctly separate but closely linked stories--the narrator's famous recollection of his childhood; the tortured and scandalous love affair between Charles Swann and the courtesan Odette de Crecy; and the narrator's later schoolboy crush on Swann and Odette's willful daughter, Gilberte. In each section, Proust's analysis of the foibles, passions, and disappointments of his dramatis personae is so exact, so incisive there hardly seems anything left worth saying about the topics he turns his surgical eye and sets his pen to dissect. His observation of people in society--their vanity, snobbishness, and petty cruelty--are wickedly amusing, devastatingly accurate, and, on rarer occasions, touching. No better account of the vicissitudes, illusions, and degradations of love exists in all of literature than the section entitled *Swann in Love.* Anyone who's ever been in love will instantly recognize himself with wry amusement and cringing embarrassment in Swann's agonizing travails.The ability to \\"fool\\" ourselves into thinking that what we love--whether a person, place, or time--lies somewhere \\"out there\\" as opposed to within ourselves is the main theme of the final section, *Place-Names. The Name* but it's also one that permeates the entire book. \\"The memory of a particular image is but the regret for a particular moment.\\" In a series of novels that goes under the general title *In Search of Lost Time* this epigram is indicative of the bittersweet and paradoxical nature of Proust's project--the attempt to find in memory and to recapture in literature what is gone forever even if it never existed apart from our consciousness in the first place."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"This is the opening novel of Proust's seven- volume masterpiece \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\". It famously begins with the narrator describing himself in childhood as he lies in bed thinking about his own sleeping. In the course of this will come the tasting of the madelaine the cake which will evoke worlds of memories, and indicate the path of exploration and reconstruction of the Past which the Novel as a whole will consist in. In this opening scene the narrator too describes his relation to his mother, his longing for her kiss, his sense of weakness and deprivation when without it, his relation to his father, his relation to his grandmother. In the course of this too will be discussed Swann the neighbor and family friend whose life - story will be one central element in this first book. Swann's relationship with his wife the former courtesan Odette Crecy will in some sense foreshadow the future relations of the narrator to his own love- interests.Proust is perhaps the greatest of all novelists in the fineness of psychological perceptions, and in the intricate aesthetic insights he provides. His similes and metaphors are rare creative explorations which while difficult to comprehend have a kind of magical and wondrous effect.This work is thus one of the most difficult of the great classics to read , and paradoxically one of the easiest to get lost in. There is a fascinating challenging quality to the writing which lead the reader to read and reread.It is as I have said not easy writing. It is also often not pleasant as one side of Proust is his obsession with human weakness , with jealousy, social snobbery and betrayal in love."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Proust is not brief but I shall be. This is one of the most stunning, sustained performances imaginable. It is unabridged, so you get all of SWANN'S WAY. I have some of the NAXOS abridged versions read by Neville Jason, and they are too are excellent. But this is all of the book. Like Mahler, his near contemporary, Proust is full of contradictions: dramatic, gripping, often overwhelming; as well as silly, long-winded, a little too precious and snobbish. Often his insights are breathtaking, sometimes they are trivial.If you don't want to read, and just want to listen, do this first. In the abridged versions, it is all genius. Here the writer/narrator is a sloppy human being, but one who often rises to the level of genius. That's the real Proust. Get Proust whole."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Proust wrote about the mystery of human existence. His gift was in finding the most ordinary occurrences of everyday life - walking, talking, breathing - magically textured and beautiful. That's why so many people read his books and complain, &quot;Nothing happens.&quot; or &quot;This is boring.&quot; These people would be better off reading a storyteller like Dickens, but don't put others down because they appreciate what Proust did and tried to convey."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Not only is this the greatest book ever written (and I mean it), but this is the finest translation of it into English.There's no point in attempting to describe its pleasures, or the depth of them.Please, if you haven't read Swann's way (and the entire In Search Of/Remembrance) do so. If you have, read it again.Thank God for the printing press, if only for this book; it's one of the few things that makes me think 'human civilization is worth it, after all'.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Proust plunges the reader into the world of his vivid imagination, traversing between memory, image and objective reality. His work is truly a reflection or refraction of perception, to then be reconstructed in descriptive prose that conjures enchanting visuals of paradisaical landscapes, childhood wishes and dreams, and a time forgotten or lost as the modern age came crashing in with the arrival of the twentieth century. In the last pages of ~Swann's Way~, one cannot help but feel his lament of times passed, when women dressed with unconscious elegance, the French countryside remained pure, and the sheer simplicity and sophistication of the horse drawn carriage. These times are truly lost, however the narrator speculates, '...remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a particular moment...held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life.' When the narrator remembers, he realises that what he has known no longer exists, or possibly never existed, but they most certainly exist in his memories.This constant play between perception through the senses, the idealized image, and their interaction, and the character's responses to this constant flux of the real and the imagined, is the central theme of this text. The central character of the second chapter, Swann in Love, is hopelessly seduced by the coquettish, Odette. She draws Swann into her world and, over time, her indifference and listlessness, her unpredictable irritability and at times chilly manner towards him, causes Swann to suffer. But the reader gets the impression that Swann tends towards masochism, and in a perverse way, enjoys the pain. Swann's taste in women has always tended towards those below his social station - the shopgirl, the worker's daughter or the prostitute. These liaisons are always carried out in secret for the obvious reasons. However, in spite of Odette's lack of education and birthright, the aristocratic male finds her extremely attractive. She is a mistress with natural class and possesses that necessary skill of discretion. But is Swann actually in love with Odette, or the idealized image? When the actual woman and the idealized one do not meet, his expectations are dashed and he continues to suffer. Swann's friends anonymously attempt to tell him about Odette's seedy past, but this action only further embeds him into his reserve to somehow return to the pure love they once shared. And so the tale continues...This is the first book of Proust's seven-volume magnum opus, A la recherch&eacute; du temps perdu. To my mind, the second section, 'Combray', is the most sensitive and beautiful description of early youth in modern literature. The last chapter is a kind of poetic lament of that innocent time period before the ravages of the Great War, which irrevocably changed the world forever. One cannot sing the praises of this novel enough."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"This is the first of the seven volumes of the widely known but not always read \\"A la recherche du temps perdu\\". I particularly like that in this edition the translator chose the term: In search, and not remembrance. The novel is not about remembering, it is about searching the truth in the past. The past was a time in which Marcel was not able to understand what rested underneath the social conventions, personal passions and random emotions. What Marcel does when he writes is to explore those depths of human behavior and worldly condition.In this first volume of \\"In search of Lost time\\" we get to see three parts. In the first one, Marcel shows us how he came to remember the time he spent in Combray with his parents, grandparents and aunts. We get to see here for the first time a very important character: Charles Swann, in whom Marcel sees an obstacle between him and the good night kiss of his mother. Vinteul appears as well. In the events surrounding his death Marcel finds for the first time the perversions of love and the human disposition towards evil and cruelty.The second part revolvs around Swann and how he falls in love with Odette, a cocotte. A dark secret eventaully tortures Swann: Has Odette had unholy relations with other women? What is it that she does while he is not with her? Is she with other men?The third part is a reflection on how names, things, experience of things themselves and the remembrance of them are separated by an abyss, which is only surpassed by the idea of the subject.What is the best way to give unity to all these things? Through writing and art, seems to be final answer of \\"In Search of Lost time\\". But \\"Swann's way\\" leaves us with the sense of having lost something in the act of remembering.This is one of the novels everyone should read."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Writers are always wipping out their sentences, seeing whose is longer, in some type of testosterone-induced competition. This being said Proust (for all his flowery prose and sentimental yearnings) has to be the most virile and manly author; the man is capable of one long sentence, raising the awe and eyebrows of other writers.Are you looking for plot? Let's just say that the muffin the narrator begins eating in volume 1 doesn't get finished off until volume 2.... the rest is tangential, reminiscent, nostalgic. At times I had an allergic reaction to the syrupy prose that left me with a howling headache, but nevertheless the sublime achievments of this book outweigh such moments. However the Swann in Love section I found tedious and misplaced. I found myself editing and revising chunks of it. Although i think Proust is phenomenal at writing of the &quot;ebb and tide of memory&quot;, i can only handle him in small doses, say have a volume every 10 years. Therefore, provided I live until the age of 174, I should be able to finish the whole of In Search of Lost Time."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"...and i have not even finished even the first volume of this dauntingly sprawling work known as a la recherche du temps perdu, but i know what i like and i have just fallen in love with swann's way. yes, it would be silly to deny that proust does like to go on and on quite prodigiously but what a sumptuous journey! i feel almost wicked indulging in proust - and what is his writing if not supremely self-indulgent - but i find myself continually redeemed by his carefully and extensively detailed insights which unfold and arise so naturally, almost indiscernibly, from the complex interplay of memory, sensation and emotion. as i read, often i find myself either smiling with joy or on the verge of tears, moved by the beauty with which proust reveals simple, almost mundane, truths, which are all the more profound by virtue of their mundanity. in any case, i don't think it's fair to banish so bitterly all those for whom this book is a thing of joy and pleasure to the realm of the pretentious. besides, i prefer to think of myself as voluptuous, not pretentious (sniff, sniff) here's a tip: forget profundity if you must and just revel in the gorgeous details of his recollections, his attempts to recapture the past through memory. this is not a book to rush, you must let it's luxuriant and gauzy veil envelop you."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"So i finally made the commitment to reading Proust's In Search of Lost Time. I've been contemplating this for years, and this spring i have the time so i've excitedly decided to forge what will be a memorable relationship with the author and the text.But geez, am i DISAPPOINTED with the first \\"installment\\"!!! I'm usually an avid reader of European classics, and although i wasn't expecting Proust to be thrilling, i guess i didn't realize that the work was completely plotless.I have to stop and remind myself (lest i give up?) that i am reading for the full experience rather than instant gratification, so i'm going to doggedly push on, and read something \\"fun\\" like Waugh or Vonnegut between each of the 6 books of I.S.O.L.T...On a postive note, Proust's unique style allows the reader's mind to wander with the narrator, so i honestly can't say that i was \\"bored\\". It is also interesting that Proust is so often right on target about the human psyche and about society, when he, an invalid, was himself removed from it for much of his life.Finally, Swann's Way is, let's face it, a moderately thick book. Without plot, you'd think that it would be a slow and dragging read. However, his long sentences somehow propel the reader forward to the next interesting speculation or to the next social event, and once again, his style is such that we become involved in the character's life....what will be the next step in Swann and Odette's relationship?Although i have mixed feelings about the start of my Proustian journey, I console myself with his notions of time. The way we feel and think about something while we are in the midst of it may differ greatly from the way we feel and think about it once we are removed from it. Perspective is altered by distance (and memory, imagine that...). Perhaps once i finish the work in its entirety the pieces will all come together and there will be a cumulative gain. If nothing else, there will be a sense of accomplishment!"},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"I kept expecting more to happen, and some of the metaphors were a little too detailed. I can certainly appreciate Proust's writing style, but perhaps it is easier to read in French! If you enjoy stream-of-consciousness writing, complex metaphors, and little to no plot, this is the book for you! Perhaps reading the whole series makes it more meaningful."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Less than a year ago I began Swann's Way and tossed it aside after less than a hundred pages, disgusted at young Marcel's mewing dependence on his mother's goodnight kiss. For some reason I picked the book up again a few months later and started back at the beginning. This time I overcame my disgust and proceeded to finish the book. And then I was hooked. Three months ago I finished all six, and two weeks ago I began Swann's Way again. This time I had different insights and different likes and dislikes. At random times I will have a Proustian insight. It is easy to loathe the writer and his affectations and neuroses, but having read his work, one cannot dismiss the depth of language and feeling."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Fortunately, I was never assigned Proust in school and, prior to picking up Swann's Way, knew of Proust mainly through a Monty Python sketch. I thus came to the book with almost no preconceptions. It was, without exaggerration, one of the best reading experiences I have ever had. Proust is unlike any other novelist, somehow looking at life with both incredible analytical detachment and, at the same time, a neurotic coloring that is all his own. But, to fully appreciate this work, you have to take it at the right time. That time, for me at least, is middle age, when you begin to accept your own neuroses, when your own life consists of 50% memories, and when you can appreciate the relentless dissecting of the immortal &quot;types&quot; who inhabit every society. I have gone on to read the next two novels in Proust's series and now have to force myself not to consume the remainder too hastily. Even if Proust turns you off the first time around, wait ten years and try again."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"We apply &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;masterpiece&quot; too liberally, but regardless of how loosely or strictly we deploy the terms, Marcel's Proust's extraordinary novel belongs to the shortest of short lists deserving such description. At the risk of hyperbole (though I do not thing it is hyperbolic), Proust is the one writer of the 20th century who perhaps belongs to the ages more than to his own time, who belongs with Shakespeare and Dante and Homer.Many are put off Proust by not understanding the structure of his work and his writing strategy. The book, to many, seems to have no point and no plot. The novel actually does have a plot, albeit a simple and not easy to discern one: Will the narrator (usually termed &quot;Marcel&quot;) become a writer? Through seven long volumes, we watch Marcel variously resolve to write and then forsake his resolve, we see him even forget for enormous lengths of time his intent to write. Through love affairs, through events with his friends, through reflections on all matter of subjects and experiences of every kind, Marcel finally comes in the final volume to rediscover his vocation and the subject of his work.This first volume in the series contains many of the most famous episodes in all of Proust. The famous passage in which the Narrator tells of his not being able to fall asleep as a child is found in the first pages. The most famous section in all of Proust, that of his eating as an adult a madeleine that first creates an inexplicable sense of joy and then engenders a plethora of involuntary memories of his childhood, is also found in this volume. The second half is the remarkable story of &quot;Swann in Love,&quot; in which family friend Charles Swann falls in love, much to his surprise, with the courtesan Odette.This first volume glitters for the same reason that subsequent volumes do: Proust's remarkable sentences, in which he heaps phrase upon apt phrase on top of a carefully concealed central idea; Proust's extraordinarily complex, interesting, believable, and brilliant characters (I personally think he handles character better than any other author); and the wonderful passion and sensibility that permeates every page.I will end with a piece of advice: Proust, more than any writer I know, gives back as much as you point into him. If you expend a great deal of effort in working through his masterpiece, you will be comparably rewarded. If, on the other hand, you pick up SWANN'S WAY casually, expecting a relaxed, entertaining read, you will be profoundly disappointed. But if you approach him with an open mind, a great deal of patience, and a willingness to work your way carefully through each sentence, you just might believe this to be the most remarkable thing you have ever read."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Amazon has really confused things here. I am reviewing this Kindle e-book:In Search of Lost Time or Remembrance of Things Past, Volume 1: Swann's Way by Marcel Proust. This is nothing more than the old, public-domain translation from the 1920s, yet it dishonestly appropriates the cover of the recent Penguin-Viking translation and links to another fairly recent updating of the 1920s translation, copyrighted by Random House / Modern Library. Stay away from this cheating publisher!If you want the public-domain translation in Kindle format, you can get it here without cost:Swann's Way.

Blue skies! -- Dan Ford"},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Swann's Way is the gateway to the most beautifully written novel there is, that is, the whole of the &quot;Search for Lost Time&quot;. Contrary to reputation, it is not &quot;difficult&quot; (in the way, say, Joyce or Faulkner can be) but it is not for people who prefer to skim across novels rather than immerse themselves in them. There is no use in my pulling out the superlatives; to do so would just invite redundancy to the books that have been written on him. But for anyone who loves reading (and who checking out this review does not) I would consider it a great loss to have gone through life, loving books as you do, and having missed out on Proust. It is an experience that will remind you of why you love to read and stay with you throughout your life."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"One of the most fascinating and beautiful books I've ever read, Proust had a knack for taking the smallest detail and making it meaningful and beautiful. His sentence structure is very different from anything I've ever read before and his writing style is very dense(somebody once told me that it was like swimming through mayonaise) He is one of most original writers of this century and certainly one of the most poetic. Reading Swanns Way has made me hungry to read more of Proust. I've looked everywhere for the whole set of In Search of Lost Time(or Rememberence of Things Past) luckily Amazon has the whole set. Everybody should at least try to read Swanns Way."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Obviously, Swann's Way is a classic piece of literature, one of the most vital works of fiction of the 20th Century. The prose, whether in the original French or in the beautifully translated English, is lush, evocative and deliriously prolix--from the moment the narrator takes a bite of that famous pastry, the reader is swept up into a world so tangibly realized and, at the same time, so hallucinatory in its lushness that he or she cannot fail to be drawn in, quite despite the fact that there's not much of a &quot;plot&quot; to carry the thing along. Instead, we are given intimate access to the minds of Swann, Odette and Proust himself and they are unbelievably fascinating people--so complex, so &quot;real&quot; that one is actually quite sorry when the book ends. Which brings me to my main point: Don't stop here. If Swann's Way is the most famous volume in the monumental &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; series, it is not necessarily the best. It is, in fact, something of an extended prologue to the later books, gracefully and movingly setting the scene for the far more dramatic twists and turns that will culminate in the mind-blowing final volume &quot;Time Regained.&quot; While Swann's Way is a most compelling and satisfying read on its own, you'll miss out on so much beauty, drama and passion if you don't follow up and read through the full series, rich as it is with intrigue, consuming love, staggering insights into the human mind and outright entertainment value. So, Swann's Way is a must read, but one has to come to it realizing that the end of the novel is only the beginning of Proust's enormous, all-consuming magnum opus. No one will tell you that committing to Proust's fictional world is a slight undertaking, but it is a deeply rewarding one and a required one for all serious readers."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Everyone, from time to time, experiences the strangeness of having some momentary sensation recall something from the distant past. For example, the scent of a window screen after rain can still recall to me a moment from, probably, 1956, the year I was five. I stood at the back window of my grandmother's bedroom, arms on the sill--looking across her backyard, the alley, and the neighbor's back yard to the cars rolling along Midlothian Turnpike. It was a gloomy fall day. I can feel my forearms resting on the cool wood. I can see the white sill and the screen and the landscape in some detail, so that I know it was a real moment from my life, not something snatched from a dream.But the effect is fleeting. It's like a piece of film that runs for a few seconds and then disappears. I can't attach anything to it, before or behind, that would explain why this particular moment comes back to me, except the scent of wet screen. There are a few other such bits of my life that sometimes come back to me, but I have no connections between them.Now imagine that a similar experience happens to you, but one that is vastly larger. A sensation of taste or smell, not encountered for many years, brings back, not a single momentary impression, but the entire history of your childhood and of all the years since, so that you are finally able to contemplate your life in its completeness--so that you know fully who you are and how you came to be who you are. And imagine that you are an aspiring writer, that you've sought all your life for the right subject, the right thing to share with the world--and now you have finally found it. And you are gifted with a kindhearted nature, high intelligence, psychological insight, irony and humor, along with the power of precise description, so that you can convey in words anything you think or feel. And this sudden discovery, which brings you all of your life and all of your gifts, comes with such force that you devote nearly all your energy, for the remaining years of your life, to sharing the fullness of your remembered and re-imagined experience with those who will read your work--so that you and your life, to an extent that reaches the edge of human possibility, are delivered from the limitations of time and language and death. And the resulting work brings readers so deeply into your head and heart, and they find your humanity and understanding so rich, that it is read with delight and gratitude by millions throughout the world.This fortunate person, of course, is Marcel Proust, whose novel In Search of Lost Time (of which this is the first volume) is one of the greatest achievements in the history of creativity."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"I've read many a great novel, both classic and contemporary, but until I read Swann's Way, I had never before been tempted to take a highlighter to a book. Never has an author been able to squeeze so much out of so little. Like Shakespeare's, much of Proust's genius lies in observing and explaining complex human emotion. Unlike Shakespeare, though, Proust believes in using everyday events for this purpose. And rather than explaining thoughts and emotions through action on a stage, Proust takes the reader directly into his characters' thoughts. While the plot may not take you away, his insights are genius. Yes, sometimes he describes scenery in too much detail for my tastes (don't get him started on flowers, music or architecture), but his understanding of the human heart is peerless. This is all the more astounding when you consider how much of his life Proust spent bedridden. Swann's Way is an absolute miracle of literature, but having said that, I must also admit that it's not for most readers. Most people will not have the patience to decipher Proust's excessively long and complex sentences before they simply throw the book into the fireplace. Most people will not be impressed by how much detail Proust uses to describe something as seemingly simple, on the surface at least, as neighborhood gossip, dipping cake into a cup of tea or the architecture of a church steeple. I'll give it five stars, but most people won't get past the first 50 pages. I also struggled with some of the lengthy descriptions, and had to set it aside or force myself through parts of it. So when I say most people won't enjoy it, that's not to congratulate myself, it's just being honest. I can't imagine the millions who enjoy watching \\"Survivor\\" or WWE wrestling or who subscribe to \\"People Magazine\\" ever even hearing about Proust, let alone buying Swann's Way. And how many of those that do dare to buy it on this or any other recommendation, will get past the Combray section and continue reading? Very few indeed. That's really a shame, because this is one of the greatest works of literature ever published anywhere."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Proust is one of my very favortite authors. &quot;Swann's Way,&quot; the first book of A la recherche du temps perdu, is perhaps the most accessible and lyrical of the seven. Written in a hypnotic and mesmerizing style, &quot;Swann's Way&quot; begins by recreating life in a fictionalized 19th century French village, complete with gossipy aunts, church festivals and priests who &quot;know too much.&quot;&quot;Swann's Way&quot; is also the volume in which Proust tastes the divine madeleine then goes on to link memory to memory to memory. Even the smallest detail is not overlooked: sights, sounds, smells, textures, the interplay of light and shadow; everything was a source of joy and connection for Proust and he records those connections in this fascinating book. While Joyce lived in the world of the present, Proust lived in the world of the past.So many people complain about the lack of plot in this book. But do we really need a plot in every book we read? Aren't some works of art beautiful enough to be read, or listened to or gazed upon for their beauty alone? Is anything truly &quot;art for art's sake?&quot; If your answer to this question is &quot;Yes,&quot; then &quot;Swann's Way&quot; might be a book you'll come to treasure. Yes, it is dense and yes, it does take quite a bit of time to read, but it is time well spent and time that will never be forgotten.&quot;Swann's Way&quot; sets the tone for all the volumes that follow. Indeed, the final section of the final book is but an echo of the first section of &quot;Swann's Way.&quot; Although Proust may have seemed to be wandering, he was not; A la recherche du temps perdu is one of the most structured works in any language. The fact that this structure is not immediately discernable is only further proof of the genius of Proust.The section, Swann in Love, is typical of Proust's obsession with repetition. Each time the tortured Swann meets Odette, he must re-enact the very first ritual of the cattleyas. They even come to speak of this as &quot;doing a cattleya.&quot; The Swann in Love section also showcases Proust's wicked sense of humor, for Swann is both a character of high comedy and high tragedy, and Proust dissects French society in a most deliciously scathing manner.While it may be Proust's reputation that causes us to pick up this book, it is his prose that keeps us reading. Almost indescribable, it is luminous, poetic, magical, fascinating, ephemeral, gossamer, mesmerizing, elegant and, of course, sublime.I realize that &quot;Swann's Way&quot; is definitely not going to be a book for everyone. But those who love and appreciate fine literature and beautiful, crystalline prose, may find that &quot;Swann's Way&quot; will become nothing less than a lifetime treasure."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Proust's eye for the everyday events of life remains unmatched by any other writer this century.

There are so many passages that I have marked that are amazing but then you get to 100 page stretches that are so detailed, repetitious and boring about characters I don't even like. I only have 100 pages to go so maybe I should have waited before writing this review, but I have read over 500 pages and am about to burst. I find the enormously long sentences to be comprehensible. As a mental exercise it is not to be beat! I like that aspect. There are sentences that are so exquisite that I want to remember how to find them for the rest of my life. I suppose the translators have to be thanked also. But the narrator starts out as infantile about his love for his mother then describes Swann's love, that is at best adolescent and excruciatingly immature. Maybe when I was in my 20's I was that messed up but I don't like to remember it and surely I know I did not put up with what Swann did. Where is his sense of pride!? But there must be some reason that I keep reading. I suppose as a detailed description of psychological truth it is unflinching, or at least the truth that this squirt of an over-intellectual, over-wrought little Frenchman could understand it. He sure has a negative understanding of what love is. Maybe it hurts to discover that I often agree with him. Reading Proust is like goldmining. It takes a lot of work but there are observations about life, love, aesthetics and intellectual matters that make the hard work worth while."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"What a remarkable book! The characters are pathetic; their society is pathetic; their attitudes, motivations, interactions and miriad self-deceptions are hopelessly pathetic. Considering this, how can I possibly like the book? There are two reasons. First, the writing is often exquisite: the writer is clearly a master of this chaotic pathos. Second, in some undeniable way, this same pathos resonates with my personal experience. Readers who do not experience this resonance are not necessarily lacking. Rather, they may have had the good fortune of a more civilized society than the one Proust caricatures. For them, it is unlikely that the beauty of the language is sufficient to elevate the content beyond the pitiful fare that it is."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"The product and the narration is very well done.

Some translators are a bit overwrought and purple as any reader of translated works can recall, I should think.Thanks."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"This book is a failure in its two major attempts: to entertain and to capture human thinking. Swann's Way is generally said to be written in the stream-of-consciousness technique. Having thus said that, I daresay it is a psychoanalytic error. Both important characters in this story (Swann and the narrator himself) think in a way that is entirely incredible. They take every little aspect of their uneventful lives and seem to put it under a microscope, leaving not a single detail of that aspect, that facet, undetected. They break it down to its indivisible remains. They're relentless; they peal away until there is nothing left. That is mainly why the book drags on so much. It seems as if Swann and the narrator (both of whom, it should forthwith be established, are boring as hell) are not average in any way. They are two psychologists who'd make Freud and Jung quiver to their very skeletons.Give me a break, I say. No one in real life thinks the way they do, taking pages upon endless pages in analyzing the minutiae, the most diminutive stuff that happens in their lives - stuff that in real-life goes totally ignored. Not being anything near a psychologist, I can easily tell that the characters in this story are faker than a toupee. At least Joyce, who is worlds more tedious than Proust at his worst, succeeded with near-perfect accuracy at transmitting man's consciousness from the brain to the paper. Proust, with his microscoped slides tightly clasped at the nucleus of his characters' brains, made a bad claim to the selfsame place Joyce later reached. Swann's Way, in this respect, is a dud; an exaggeration wrought by meticulosity.And then, of course, it must be remembered that it is also a work of fiction. But a deceptive work of fiction at that, for the first sentence promises a story that would never melt away into one's oblivion: &quot;For a long time I would go to bed early.&quot; A simple sentence, so simple that it promises the reader that the story is filled with all possibilities. Anything may happen. But the reader soon learns that there are no possibilities, that the sense instilled into his mind by the first sentence is a false one. For in the end, nothing happens. Not that nothing is resolved, because that really doesn't matter - just that nothing happens. It's a long, boring cab-drive home.And those long sentences and long paragraphs that seem to make the pages cry, filled with those tremendous blocks of text - they are of no positive effect to the overall story, or any portion of it, for that matter. That is not to say that extensive writing like this is bad in literature, keeping in mind those few writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez who made such wonderful use of his long stretches of paragraphs. Proust merely needed to trim his up, needed to remove all that bogus stream-of-consciousness. The story of M. Swann and his liaison with Mme Odette is so simple that any other writer would have taken up two hundred pages or less to tell it.But of course, now, there are the positives. To say that Swann's Way - with all its barren poetry - had no wonderful passages would be a perjury. A book of such longevity would as sure as hell-fire have a couple of things one would delight in reading. Early on in the story, for instance, the narrator describes the church towers, steeples, and belfries he sees overhead one day whilst walking home. The words he uses in conveying these sublime images into the reader's mind are so delicious the reader thereafter finds himself quickly turning the pages back to reread the passages in their entireties. Sometimes, Proust's words are like a Turkish Delight for the eyes. If the Moncrieff translation is this grand, one can only imagine how good the book is in its original language. Thus, for the tender sake of language, Swann's Way is a good book. There is a practice, an exercise into language in this book that, while not unprecedented, you seldom see in others. But all the rest is nothing more than a boring prose poem that serves as the overture to an epic that must surely be painstaking to finish."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"a novel in which nothing much happens and yet is the most perfect book i've ever read."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"I enjoy the fact that you can listen o he bible at anytime and there wont be any interferece form other areas, however, it is not the same as reading yourself.

That said, many of these people confessed they had never finished Proust all the way through; one went all the way to say he had found it too &quot;subjective.&quot; If you are reading literature to read literture STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read an incredible novel, then go ahead; you will not desecrate Proust's grave.Many times as I read this book, I found myself pausing, almost pained at the beauty of the language. I have read many authors, and have never read such beautiful words; his descriptions seem so divine, and yet he spends the first part of the book saying that he himself can't write! It's one of those moments where you want to shake the author with mental fists, but it's okay; it adds flavour.Proust is probably among the greatest novelists of history (probably one down after Dostoevsky). The title of the series &quot;In Search of Lost Time,&quot; immediately gives you the clue of what the theme shall be; moments of wasted time, moments of bliss that you wish to recapture, memories long gone that you wish you could recapture. But, that is the essense of life."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Don't get me wrong, Proust is a great writer, and many parts of this book are amazing. The problem is that his sentence structure and plot are poorly adapted for listening. He winds around and around the commas, parantheses, dashes, etc. to the point where you have no idea what he is referring to. I picked up a written copy of Swann's Way, and I the parts I remembered being bored and confused made sense to me and became very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"The famous madelaine of the opening scene which brings the narrator back to the scene of his childhood where he longs to go down to his mother, and be embraced and assured by her- and when she feels this a sign of emotional weakness. The involuntary memory and the story of the life of Combray is the opening of one of the greatest of all literary adventures. This adventure though it will eventually encompass and portray a whole society and its decay through a lifetime is primarily the adventure of the most exquisitely sensitive of all literary consciousneses. The rich perceptive and reflective mix by which the narrative is conveyed is one in which every line seems to provide its own pleasures in insights of incredible complexity and often beauty.The story of the narrator the would- be- writer in the first part becomes in the Second Part the story of Swann, the man of many loves whose love for his wife Odette is like every other genuine feeling shown to be compromised and contradicted in Proustean reality.This opening novel of the seven which compromise \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\" provides the reader above all with a sense of having entered a literary world like no other, one of the great literary worlds, like that of Quixote or Hamlet- Lear or 'War and Peace' a world which is parallel to and yet enhances and transforms our perception of our own real world. For the writer for whom every real paradise is a paradise lost this first entry into a literary Garden of Eden however rich and surprising carries with it also a sombre sense of doom and gloom and sadness a wheezing sickness and shortness of breath, a hint of life not as a long , slow quest to transform bitter Reality into Artistic Beauty."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"To be honest, I started reading this because I always felt that I should have and never got around to it, Proust being one of those &quot;important&quot; authors. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Proust really seems to be about the beauty of language and description. The sentences and paragraphs are long but they flow beautifully and I appreciate an author who wants to say beautiful things as well as tell a story. Literature isn't all about plot. I'm sure something is lost in the translation but I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Note that this review is for the audio book version of this novel. I will first give my impressions of the audio book and then give my feelings on the novel itself.The audio book experience was very positive. The narrator was John Rowe who sounded just like an older gentleman reflecting on his early childhood. It fitted the story well, at least when I finally figured out it was supposed to be an old man. At first I thought it odd that they were using an old man to speak for a child; but then realized that was the way it was supposed to be. The translation is the one done by C.K. Scott Moncrieff, who was the original English translator. I found the translation very beautiful and easy to follow. I would rate the audio portion 5 stars.As for the novel itself; I had mixed feelings. To give a background on myself; I am an engineer (that may explain right there to many people my feelings on the book), and have been listening to many of the great works of literature on my commute for the past few years. I had noticed this book on almost every list of great books I had seen and decided to give it a try. This is the first book by Proust that I have read.I found the language beautiful and very descriptive. I felt like I was getting into the head of a very artistic person and saw many things from a point of view that I have never experienced myself. The two biggest problems I had with this novel are first, I never connected with the characters and second, I didn't learn anything that I felt was useful. When reading literature I am almost always able to expand my horizons and see the other side of great issues, or to understand why people do things I don't approve of. None of these things happened to me.Bottom line; I can see why this is considered great writing, but it didn't click for me."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"'Swann's Way' has been called the least balanced of Proust's works, with the chapter - 'Swann in Love'- sticking out like a sore thumb, while this does seem apparent I have faith in Proust's reasoning for his placement - as he is a genius when it comes to structure. He structures themes in such a profound way that after you read him other authors start to seem flimsy in their approach. 'Swann's Way' is one of the greatest books about life and love I have read (so far) but I think you must look at it as part of a whole - a whole which one day I hope to grasp!"},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"It is a travesty that anyone could claim to find this masterpiece &quot;boring.&quot; Proust's novel belongs in that select pantheon of books that truly deserved to be called Classics.

That is why I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"A word about this particular edition. It's the easiest of the Moncrieff/Kilmartin editions to carry with you. During a Proust reading group, my friends were lugging around the huge and heavy volumes from the 3-book edition. I had this one, which became known as &quot;Proust Lite.&quot; Supposedly, this is also a more definitive translation than the ealier M/K translation, but we compared some sections and both seemed good.And, for what it's worth, In Search of Lost Time is the single most exciting and satisfying reading experience of my life. It's certainly not for everyone--Alexander Wollcott, I think, said reading Proust was like lying in someone else's dirty bath water. I'd say it's closer to living someone else's life. I even have memories from the book that seem as real as some of my own. The hawthornes...the melody of a sonata I've never heard...the hidden corner from which I catch a glimpse of a decrepit Charlus. So many others.

Only Joyce, Genet, and Melville have so intoxicated me with their styles; which i would call carnivorously, brutally gorgeous - though Proust is somewhat more delicate and sentimental (however persuasive his sentiment), he is equally omnivorous. Before picking up Swann's Way i was reading Gide and conviced that his was the voice most suited to my taste; subjectively speaking, the &quot;perfect&quot; voice. Gide is pure, simple and strong. But here was Proust, who said in a gigantic, intimidating sentence what Gide said in a taut one - but Proust said it better. He elucidates. He doesn't just put it into words, he makes it flesh. I felt i was understanding not just intellectually but almost experientually. His prose is living and all encompassing; scientific but mystical, sentimental yet detatched; irrevocablly convincing. He impresses, almost singularly among artists, the reality of his genius. Still, it seems to be art for art's sake, and for my money, i'll take a Dostoyevski, with his &quot;novel of ideas&quot; anyday."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"This is one of the classic works of literature. \\"Swann's Way\\" is the first volume of Proust's magnum opus, which has traditionally and somewhat inaccurately been translated as \\"Remembrance of Things Past.\\" The French title \\"A la recherch&eacute; du temps perdu,\\" would be more appropriately rendered as \\"In search of lost time.\\" The passive implications of \\"remembrance,\\" the much more active implications of a \\"search.\\" A key distinction lost in that literal, or not so literal, translation. The entire work is one of the longest in literature. Like knowing the first line in Tolstoy'sAnna Karenina, knowing that it is the madeleine (a cookie), dipped in tea that triggers childhood memories, is one of the touchstones that is the required knowledge of a literate person. As the author says: \\"And so it is with our own past. It is a labour in vain to attempt to recapture it: all the efforts of our intellect must prove futile. The past is hidden somewhere outside the realm, beyond the reach of intellect, in some material object (in the sensation which that material object will give us) of which we have no inkling. And it depends on chance whether or not we come upon this object before we ourselves must die.\\"The novel is set in the last quarter of the 19th Century, during the ascendency of the Third Republic, as well as a French middle class. Each summer Proust's family would leave Paris, for a small town in La Beauce, the French \\"breadbasket,\\" an hour and a half west of Paris (at least today, by autoroute). In the novel the town is called Combray. It's real name is Illiers, beyond Chartres a bit, and just to the north of the modern throughway. For Proust's centennial celebrations, the town's officials combined the two words, with a hyphen, and renamed the town. Proust's family would stay in his Aunt Leonie's house, and enjoy the marvelous temperature climate, and the very long days of summer (full dark did not occur until 11 pm around the solstice). Obviously it was the \\"pre-digital age.\\" Even having dinner at 8 pm, the French custom, would allow time for a \\"post-prandial stroll\\" during the long evening. \\"Swann's Way\\" refers to one of those particular walks that ended in the Pr&eacute; Catelan, a lovely garden that Proust's uncle designed. This walk he associated with joy and goodness as opposed to \\"The Guermantes Way,\\" the third volume of this work.Rich and dense, this novel is beautifully written. Literature should personally impact one's life; great literature more so. I first read this work when my children were babies. At the beginning of the work, Proust, who turned out in real life to become a quintessential neurotic, went on and on about the importance of getting a good-night kiss from his mother. His \\"rivals\\" were the guests his parents were entertaining... and I vowed, more or less successfully, not to let my own guests take priority when my kid's needed that extra bit of attention (and the best I can tell, that seem to remain neurosis free). For a number of summers we enjoyed those long twilights, renting a gite rural only 12 km away. Aunt Leonie's house is still there, and the garden bell that tinkles (if no one has stolen it!). My family and I would take the walk known as \\"Swann's Way,\\" with its lovely ending in the town's classic garden, and normally were the only people there. Such an experience is an essential complement to reading the work, even if it is read, gulp, on Kindle.Consider some passage that I've marked: \\"There are tints in the clouds this evening...a blue, especially, more floral than aerial, a cineraria blue, which it is surprising to see in the sky...has it not also the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea? Nowhere, perhaps, except on the shores of the Channel, where Normandy merges into Brittany, have I observed such copious examples of that sort of vegetable kingdom of the atmosphere.\\" Or, \\"I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely the messenger of the eyes, but at whose window all the sense assemble and lean out, petrified and anxious, a gaze eager to reach, touch, capture, bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the body...\\" If the reader likes the word \\"leer\\" better, for its succinctness, then Proust is probably not for you. Or, referring to the sound of the bells coming from the village church: \\"...which had not melted into the air they had traversed for so long, and, ribbed, by the successive palpitations of all their sound-waves, throbbed as they grazed the flowers at our feet.\\" And just one more: \\"...put to flight by that pale sign traced above my window-curtains by the uplifted forefinger of dawn.\\"Having just written such passages, I'm embarrassed to say that in 20 some years I have not gone on to volume two,In Search of Lost Time, Vol. II: Within a Budding Grove (Modern Library Classics) (v. 2), but with its recent purchase I should be able to make amends. Of the versions of this work extant, I'd strongly recommend the Vintage International, with the evocative cover that recalls the better aspects of summer in the Third Republic. And by all means, and not by chance, what better place to read this work, and recall one's own childhood than a summer visit to La Beauce? 5-stars plus."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Proust lulls you to sleep and then strikes you with lightning. If you make it to page 150, you're a fan for life. So many characters to fall in love with."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"This book is the entrance into another world, as finely detailed and exquisitely convoluted as a Mandelbrot Set. This is the enchanting tale of a super-sensitive and frail young lad growing up amidst the picturesque late-nineteenth century French countryside, his communion with nature (the beloved hawthorns), the written word (his beloved Bergotte), and the account of his first somewhat clumsy and tentative social encounters. In conjunction with this is the tale of the sophisticated dilettante playboy financier, Charles Swann, friend of the narrator's family, who against all expectations falls in love with the courtesan Odette de Crecy, and the tale of how this possessive love develops in Swann's mind and leads to so much grief for him in the end. Swann appears to function as a sort of prophetic shadow whose life-story prefigures the narrator's own life-story in many ways. Swann's Way is actually the name young Marcel gives to the shorter walk he often takes with his family around the peripheries of Combray, which leads right past Swann's country estate. It is there, amidst the hawthorn blossoms, that he meets his first love, Gilberte, the daughter of Swann and Odette.The long, unhurried poetic pace of the Combray narrative may appear somewhat tedious for a reader accustomed to a well-defined story and plot, leading many readers to abandon this book after the first hundred pages or so. However, once you have finished the Combray section, you will find that the narrative picks up momentum considerably; Swann in Love is far easier to read. My advice is to take the Combray section slow and easy, and don't give up. It is truly worth the extra effort to get through it. Doubtless, like me, you will also come to this book thinking of Proust as a sort of mediocre novelist known for his eccentricities and frail health. Once you complete this book, you will come to realize that he was a true master. And a last word of advice: The next volume in this series (Within a Budding Grove) is a sheer delight. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"In order to understand life, one has to read Proust.

Yet, if not impossible, it is hard for human nature to move away from those contradictions and hypocrisies. The most written about human feeling--love-is written by Proust in a beautiful way. Any avid reader must have to read Proust during their life. It is one of those books, which readers are guaranteed to enjoy."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"More than a commentary on Swann's jealousy or M. Charlus's homosexuality or the frivolity of the Guermantes' sorties, Marcel Proust's monumental work In Search of Lost Time paints the unsuccessful reconstruction of a forgone world and a lost existence from fickle memories, which like morning mists would fade with the rising sun. The narrator Marcel, longing for a past that didn't exist but must be created, sought to experience Bergson's continuous time rather than the fragmented and still-framed instantaneous moments by attempting to blur the boundaries between Cambray and Paris, childhood and adolescence, and Swann and himself and integrate here and there, before and after, and him and me through memory fragments of previous objects, people and sensations. As in a neural network or a mind-map, the madeleine linked his aunt to his mother, who in turn was linked to Albertine through jealousy, which also connected Marcel with Saint Loop and Swann, who, as with his (Marcel's) grandmother, linked his childhood and adolescence. And through recollection, Marcel would try to relive the buried years and resurrect his grandmother and Albertine.But even during the narrative, Marcel realized memory's willfulness and the variation in hues, shapes, pitch and timbre between the actual object and its mental reconstruction. When he encountered an old friend, the facial features were so different from his recollection and reconstruction, for better or for worse pregnant with all the emotions, preoccupation, biases, that he could not match face with voice.Because recollected sensation can never equate with the actual experience and time, like a patient thief, steals memories a morsel at a time until one day the owner would realize he was ruined, Marcel ultimately would fail to recapture and assemble stolen sensations and decayed seconds and in the end, must create new moments, new sensations and ultimately a new biography, through the synergy between past experiences and creative imagination. From those deceased hours and decayed memories sprouted In Search of Lost Time, not only Proust's novel but also that of the narrator.Whether we savor Marcel's frailness, Swann's infatuation, Charlus's pompousness, Franscoise's independent-mindedness, the sorties' frivolousness or the social revelation of the Dreyfuss Affair, we can enjoy Proust's classic without resorting to Marxist or Freudian or Feminist critique. And the sentences, like the serpentine Amazon, seemed to flow unceasingly into the distant horizon carrying with it the sparkling sunlight. Although ascending the novel's three thousand pages appears precipitous, the effort will be well worth the while and, at the end of the adventure, the reader can rest on the crisp apex and savor time's transience and memory's playfulness as if they were alpine zephyrs.Leonard Seet[...]"},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"The first volume of Marcel Proust's massive In Search of Lost Time is arguably the greatest introductory work of literature ever written. This edition is yet another revision of Scott Moncrieff's classic translation, first revised by Terence Kilmartin during the 1980's, and revised yet again by D.J. Enright for further readability; Enright apparently altered a number of the French expressions used by Proust which are fairly ordinary in French but come across as a bit strange in Moncrieff and Kilmartin's initial translation.Swann's Way is simply a wonderful and profound novel. It is often criticized for its lack of a forward moving plot, but such judgments are both unfair and incorrect. While it is true that In Search of Lost Time is a deliberately slow and contemplative work, yet during the first section of Swann's Way set in Combray, Proust is actually quite judicious about introducing the major characters and establishing the most important themes of the work, the themes of time, art, love, and longing. The narrator finds himself having difficulty sleeping and involuntarily recalls the events of his life, he flashes back to his childhood in Combray and Paris, and the novel begins. He reflects on his family, on the Verdurins, on M. Swann, and on his growing love for Gilberte and literature.Swann's way is simply a joy to read. Proust's acute sense of aesthetics, of love, and of the strange inner workings of bourgeois society place him among the true greats of literature right up there with Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Joyce. This edition of Proust's great work of art is highly recommended for those with patience."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"(This is a review ofIn Search of Lost Time, Volume 1: Swann's Way, the Modern Library hardback edition.)I notice the reviewer who claims that this is great reading for middle-aged people. Well, I have a friend whose mother says that you must wait until you are 70 before reading this novel.All I can say is that I read it in college and learned one extremely important lesson from it: \\"social climbing is a complete waste of time.\\" This was an important thing to learn while I was still young, and I'm glad I didn't wait until the age of 40 or 70 to appreciate it.And the lesson comes from someone who spent a few years in social climbing. He may have concluded that it was all a waste of time (\\"lost time\\" in a different sense), but what a story he made of it!I don't quite understand all the people who are \\"afraid\\" of this enormous novel. I suggest: pick up the first volume and give it a read. Nobody is holding a gun to your head. If you don't like it, that's fine. But you should be aware that, in the first two volumes, Proust is really just warming up his orchestra and playing a grand overture. (\\"How the $%^&# could some nutter Frenchman spend more than 1,000 pages on a freeping OVERTURE?\\" Well, part of the answer is that it is an extremely well-written and thought-provoking overture. But, if you get to Volume III, be prepared for the greatest social comedy ever written. Madame Verdurin and the Baron de Charlus step forward in full character, as well as Francoise, all of them giants of world literature.)Even in this first volume of the \\"overture,\\" there is a complete novella called \\"Swann in Love.\\" It will make you familiar with the main Proustian obsession, which is jealousy, and prepare you for the later \\"Variations on a Theme\\" which follow.By the way, the first 30 pages or so are about trying to go to sleep, and waiting for his Mama's good-night kiss..."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"I cannot deny that the extension and the slowness of this book can be considered overwhelming... Of course, there is no shirt that will fit everyone. Yet Proust's work is rewarding in every aesthetic sense like not many books that I've read. There is no author capable of writing in such a beautiful way, and Montcrieff's translation is quite accurate, doesn't allow great loss of the author's incredible vocabulary display. I must insist that no library can be considered complete without this opus magna."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"For a long time I could not bring myself to get through this book. The first chapter deals with sleep and going to sleep and this tended to lead to my mind wondering to other things. Unlike another French author (who is as like Proust as chalk is to cheese) Alexander Dumas, Proust does not attempt to fascinate with the first chapter. But once the novel gets underway, I could not put it down. The book has two main sections, one dealing with the denizens of Combray and the other with the title character, Swann and his love for the former prostitute Odette. The book functions as a series of very well etched vignettes complete with unforgettable characters and stories. Proust is a fan of Saint Simon's memoirs of the court of Versailles and uses these to comic effect throughout the book, particularly when describing the last days of an aged bed-ridden aunt, who he likens to the sun king in one comic section.If it can be said to be about any one thing in particular, the book is a meditation of nature of love and human emotions. Proust is not anti-love, by any means, but he sees human relationships as multi-faceted and not always healthy or positive.Reading this book has gotten me over my fear of lengthy exposure to Proust. I am eager to see further examples of his mastery of language and plot and look forward to eagerly reading the other books that make up A La Recherche du temps perdu."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Hopefully, a person picking up Proust knows what to expect, but remember his skills are in the act of writing, not in the story line itself. Not a lot happens, and it takes a long time to unfold. I did like the portion about the old ladies spying on their neighborhood, making judgements, analyzing activities, all from their windows. (Made me think of elderly relatives of my own in small towns.) Mostly, I found it difficult to keep reading, kept being tempted to put it down and find something a bit more exciting."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Remembrance of Things Past is undoubtably one of the greatest works in the history of literature. Proust's literary technique almost surpasses his profound content in beauty and elegance, yet throughout the work maintains a humorous and entertaining tone. This wonderful balance of philosophical complexity and personal warmth will speak to every reader regardless of ethnic background, thereby transcending insignificant differences and addressing humanity as a collective whole with it's documentation of memory, emotion, happiness and grief, all of which tie us together as human beings rather than separate groups.What makes it a masterpiece of the written word is it's ability to pinpoint the oridinary, minute details of everyday life without narrowly isolating itself to a particular nationality, religion, or social position. This is achieved through the meticulous craftsmanship and perceptiveness of Proust, whose unqiue observation and attention to detail is unprecedented and has set the towering standard which has yet to be topped.There have been few critics to disagree with the above, yet I was taken back when I found so many negative, uninformed reviews... it's art. You can hate good food, for example, but don't say it isn't healthy! That shows a great deal of arrogance and extreme ignorance on the part of the critic.Now I realize some of you are high schoolers or between the ages of 18-24, and because of this you being naive is forgivable. But as someone wise once said, &quot;If you don't have anything nice [or in this case INFORMED or INTELLIGENT] to say, don't say anything at all.&quot;This work is a masterpiece, pure and simple."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Another pristine paperback, nothing extraordinary to report, merely that there are no ripped or bent pages. The only thing is the bottom of the spine which is a little worse fir the wear in that it has been 'bruised' and mildly discoloured."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"In Search of Lost Time, Volume 1: Swann's Way by Marcel ProustA beautiful work on human consciousness. This edition is splendidly translated from the French."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"A man seeking to connect with the meaning of his life discovers a new theory on the reality of time. It seems that time is not traditionally linear but rather, in truth, humans are subject to triggers, as simple as a madeleine and a cup of tea, which can send one unwittingly hurtling into the past. Depending upon the associations one may have with such triggers, the journey may be pleasant or painful. But in order to understand where we have traveled, one must revisit the past and surge existentially against the people and places, lovers and friends, the art and music and society, which influence our lives. Otherwise, the mysteries of life may escape one's sense and sensibility. Proust's syntax is a mile long and if you demand a structured plot, you are likely to be disappointed by this novel. However, the beauty of the language is not of this world: it is surreal, lyrical, dreamlike, entrancing, astonishing. I recommend that you simply surrender to Proust's supreme gift for the language and drift along on the pure beauty of the language alone. This novel represents the early work of a genius and no matter what biases one may proffer about the writer, there is little doubt that the writing is one of a kind. Proust is on my Top 10 Writers of All Time List: perhaps, only James Joyce has a signature maximalist literary style as unique and creatively rich as Proust. I hope you venture to read this somewhat daunting novel -- it's one of the truly great ones."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"Curiosity first lead me to Proust. At first I didn't even now how his name was pronounced! But in my reading I had come across his name so many times I thought to myself &quot;While I have this University Library at my disposal, I might as well check out some literary giants - Tolstoy, Cervantes, Thomas Mann, Shakespeare...and Proust&quot; So here I am having just finished Swann's Way. It took me a week and I went straight through it, without ever feeling bored, on the contrary it was even exciting at times. At first I was bewildered by the looong sentences, then Proust's driving need for a goodnight kiss and how he could absolutely recreate insomnia on the page, and then I was caught up in the world of French Snobbery, of Courtesans, seaside holidays, maids and mass, love and jealousy, when, right at the point of most interest, from the whirlwind of the Champs Elysees to the Bois Boulogne, the novel finished with the words THE END (well, my edition did)and so now, like a soap opera addict, I'll have to tune into next time. One question, how old is Marcel (I call him that) meant to be when he meets Gilberte? I picture him at 7 or 8. Till next time"},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"First, I feel that it's imperative to identify the express edition which I'm reviewing as Amazon has a proclivity for assigning every review to every edition: The 1992 Modern Library hardcover of \\"Swann's Way,\\" by Marcel Proust, translated from the original French by C.K. Moncrieff and Terrence Kilmartin (1981), and revised (1992) by D.J. Enright. Having completed my reading of the book I can say outright that this particular translation fully met and exceeded my expectations in terms of both quality and fluid reading.The full and proper title here, \\"In Search of Lost Time, Volume I, Swann's Way,\\" informs us that this initial entry is simply the first episode of a larger work which consists of multiple volumes, one of the longest novels ever written. If you go with the Modern Library series there are a total of six volumes which encompass the novel in its entirety: \\"Swann's Way\\"; \\"Within A Budding Grove\\"; \\"The Guermantes Way\\"; \\"Sodom and Gomorrah\\"; \\"The Captive -- The Fugitive\\", and; \\"Time Regained, (and A Guide to Proust)\\".THE STORY: [I have made every reasonable effort here to render the general premise of the story with a particular eye to avoiding any major spoilers.] A young boy is raised in the fictional hamlet of Combray, (the real town is now named Illiers-Combray, clearly in celebration of Proust's novel), two hours southwest of Paris, in a bourgeois household along with his parents and extended family members. They are an eclectic lot. This young boy becomes the readers' anonymous narrator and protagonist, but he remains unknown to us only in name as he robustly informs us of his every act and thought.The boy endures a heavily sheltered existence although his parents' purpose in effecting his containment, a virtual strangulation of the boy's soul, is more for their own convenience than for any perceived benefit to their son. Thus deprived of any practical day-to-day knowledge outside his narrow social and cultural sphere, our narrator regularly observes and reports specific events, a fact which often serves to embarrass his family, ergo: comments regarding his great uncle's young mistress which immediately leads to the subsequent shunning of this old curmudgeon's presence from the family fold. (And, of course, this episode represents an exemplary and classic illustration of Proust's uniquely subtle brand of humor.)As the boy grows, he is permitted just a few freedoms such as taking walks through the community with family members and servants. One of these paths is referred to as \\"Swann's Way,\\" a foot route which passes the estate of M. Charles Swann, an amiable and artistically learned aristocrat. Swann interacts with the boy from time to time at dinner parties sponsored by the boy's parents.One other family member, a noxious and eternally complaining old great-aunt by the name of Mme. L&eacute;onie Octave, is widely feared and dreaded by her own clan. Her dissolute commentary about others affords a dubious foundation for much of the boy's perspective on visitors to his home and on society in general. But all this does not diminish the boy's zealous enthusiasm for that which he encounters outside the home as well as what he surreptitiously reads in period fiction.The first of the book's three chapters concludes with the boy's hope of future travel and of expanding his clearly limited social skills -- he expresses himself only with great difficulty.The bulk of the story, the second chapter which moves the scene north to Paris, is devoted to M. Swann's obsessive and bizarre pursuit of one Odette de Cr&eacute;cy, a concupiscent gal of the working class and who is adorned with a third-rate mind. Her personal appearance, an aspect which bears a marked resemblance to an ancient portrait which graces one wall of the Sistine Chapel (according to M. Swann), rapidly diminishes in direct proportion with her self-indulgent and hedonistic lifestyle as she ravenously consumes the fruits of Swann's fertilely-funded trees, thus indulging her abundant caprices at will. Swann revisits his venerated Italian tempera image vicariously through his puerile gazing at Odette. She strings M. Swann along, (albeit not too cleverly), limiting his access to her, and he desires her ever more with the coming of each day. Swann's passion is entirely unrequited. But he is hardly less at fault in the chaotic affair. His attentions on Odette personify an idiosyncratic dichotomy of worldly erudition tenoned with the navet&eacute; of an immature adolescent.Reports of strings of Odette-lovers, both male and female, flow endlessly to M. Swann but due to his inexperience in courting he is ill-equipped to deal with her frivolous maltreatment of him. He fulminates over her endless lies and improprieties and he periodically voices his worst suspicions to her - she remains frustratingly evasive during his inept interrogations. The only reason she continues to see him at all rests entirely with her own mercenary materialism and thus her frequent need to have her many debts swept away by the accommodating M. Swann. As the relationship develops, M. Swann's opinion of Odette sinks to the lowest possible levels; however, his desire to retain and control her manifests as nothing short of an absurd and injudicious mania.In the finale of the work, we return to the narrator, now a teenager in Paris with his family, who himself becomes enamored with a striking young lady by the name of Gilberte. She strings our protagonist along to some extent but not so mendaciously as Odette has done in the case of M. Swann. The young man then attempts to square his yearning for Gilberte with other fresh opportunities, (now afforded by his parents), to travel and thus realize a chance to fulfill those particular long-standing desires.At this juncture one can rightly say that Volume One, \\"Swann's Way,\\" stands on its own; but readers will undoubtedly feel the inspired urge to move forward into the next entry, as many questions and anticipations remain unanswered at this point.The consumption of Marcel Proust's (1871-1922) literature is really not companionable with the atmosphere of the typical waiting room of a busy dentist's office. This is mood literature to be sure and a significant level of concentration is required of readers if they expect to fully appreciate the notable number of literary subtleties with which Proust endlessly bombards us. There are three particular caveats of Proust's writings which tend to challenge readers:1. His extensive vocabulary.2. The employment of lyrically expressive language: Proust's literary images rival the combined artistic impressionism of Monet, Manet, Van Gogh, and Matisse.3. The exploitation of a daunting writing practice which has universally endured over time as the very bane of blue-haired old English teachers across America: the run-on sentence! Proust's sentences are more often lengthy paragraphs and one's thought train can indeed suffer from a lack of comprehension if apt mental focus is not duly exercised.Another Proust device arises through his narrator, the young boy whose name remains a mystery throughout this volume. The first chapter, where the boy expresses the intricacies of his youth in First Person delivery is much like that which we would encounter elsewhere in fiction. But in the next chapter which chiefly concerns M. Swann's relationship with Odette, we are forced to wonder (in retrospect) how the narrator can be present inside the mind of this much older man, particularly since various activities of Swann may have transpired prior to the narrator's birth! The narrator is empowered with, and shares, M. Swann's every contemplation, deliberation, and frustration. This entire section of the book continues in First Person delivery from the boy's viewpoint; however, as difficult as all this may sound, Proust has somehow shrewdly made it simple for the reader to accept both the textual commentary and dialogue at their face value.In the third and final chapter, we return to a more traditional direct, (continuing along in First Person), disclosure where the narrator personally interacts with others.Proust was a fervent devotee of a literary predecessor, Anatole France (1844-1924), (as I am myself). Proust's crafty brand of humor was clearly influenced by the renowned author of works such asAnatole France- A Mummer's Tale.; but France's writing technique was much more straightforward and unpretentious than that of Proust. The latter author has taken on a much more challenging approach to fiction writing and has artfully served it up to his readers in a worthy and palatable, if sometimes intricate, end-product. Here's an example, a humorous and clever extraction from page 207:\\"\`...He may be sure it isn't music that she's teaching his daughter.' But M. Venteuil assured them that it was, and indeed it is remarkable how people never fail to arouse admiration for their moral qualities in the relatives of those with whom they are having carnal relations.\\"In summary, I was much gratified having read this distinctive hallmark of European literature although it stands in stark contrast with the simplicity of Leo Tolstoy, or the conspicuous frankness of James Joyce. I can unabashedly recommend it to any enthusiast of classic literature. I should also mention that there is yet another fairly recent translation of this inspired work which has been remarked by many as a preferable choice (a notably thinner volume):Swann's Way: In Search of Lost Time, Vol. 1 (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"For the longest time, I was too intimidated to read Proust. Then, one day, I dived into this first volume like jumping into the deep end of a swimming pool. My only regret is not having jumped in sooner.This book is the beginning of one of the greatest novels ever written. The prose and imageries are breathtaking--not at all difficult to read if you take the time to savor each sentence. Proust, like all great writers, makes you read on his terms. But once you've surrendered to the style, what a treasure you find yourself floating in. The themes and characters are universal. It makes me wish I knew French to enjoy Proust untranslated. Swann's Way can be read as its own novel. But once you start, you would surely want to continue on."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"I tried 3 times in my twenties to read \\"Swann's Way\\", the first volume in Proust's 4000-page epic novel, \\"In Search of Lost Time\\", and could not do it. No patience. I had to go read some Bukowski just to wash out my brain. But I'm delighted to report that now, in my thirties, I've given Proust another shot and am absolutely in love with his writing. The serpentine arrangement of his sentences is extremely daunting, but I got some good advice on that before I started: KEEP GOING. Don't slow down and wonder where you are, just keep pushing through as though Proust was speaking to you and you couldn't stop to ask him what he just said. Like Shakespeare, it takes awhile, but soon you get into the rhythm and it's no problem at all.I don't know how the relentlessly-examined minutae of another man's life can be so fascinating over 100 years later, but it is. I was completely caught up in Proust's childhood remembrances, and was then completely caught up in Swann's tragic love affair, and then was completely caught up again in Proust's short coda about Gilberte. The final 30 pages were devastating in their beauty and regret, and I quickly reached for the second volume, \\"Within a Budding Grove\\".The original translation of the whole novel's title is \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\", and frankly that's a better-sounding title than the new \\"In Search of Lost Time\\", but after finishing \\"Swann's Way\\" I understand the difference, and why the latter is better: Proust isn't simply sifting through memories and giving a melancholy smile because women used to wear prettier hats when he was a kid; he is lost in the world where he's found himself as an adult, and he is becoming more and more trapped in his ailing body, and he's searching for the things in his life that gave it meaning, and how they felt, and why they felt that way. This is a tragic and almost impossibly beautiful piece of work, and I can't wait to read the rest."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"This new revision by D J Enright of the Scott Moncrieff/Terence Kilmartin Translation is outstanding. One of the greatest of all translations, of one of the greatest of all novels. The novel itself is one of the most wonderful, enjoyable experiences in literature. While not for everyone, I found all six volumes absolutely compulsive reading. It is with great difficulty that I forced myself to read other things, rather than start re-reading Proust (for the third time). Tom Clancy readers should look elsewhere. However, for readers who love the sensuous pleasures of great writing, nearly everything else will pale by comparison."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"I wish I hadn't waited so long to experience Proust, for now having read &quot;Swann's Way,&quot; I see that his deeply sensitive prose is a reference point for almost all of the introspective literature of the twentieth century. As the story of a boy's adolescent conscience and aspirations to become a writer, the book's only artistic peer is James Joyce's &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.&quot;The narrator is presumably the young Marcel Proust who divides his recollections between his boyhood at his family's country house at Combray and his parents' friend Charles Swann, an art connoisseur. In fact, the path that passes Swann's house, being one of two ways the narrator's family likes to take when they go for walks, gives the book its title. Proust uses the theme of unrequited love to draw a parallel between his young narrator's infatuation with Swann's red-haired daughter Gilberte and Swann's turbulent affair with a woman named Odette de Crecy.Intense romantic obsessions are a Proustian forte. Swann falls for Odette even though she is unsophisticated and frivolous and does not appear to love him nearly as much as he loves her. He is desperate for her, always sending her gifts, giving her money when she needs it, and hoping she will become dependent on him. It comes as no surprise that he is consumed with jealousy when he notices her spending time with his romantic rival, the snobbish Comte de Forcheville, and he is shocked by her lesbian tendencies and rumors of her prostitution. He finally realizes with chagrin that he has wasted years of his life pursuing a woman who wasn't his &quot;type&quot; -- but even this resignation is not yet the conclusion of their relationship.Proust's extraordinary sensitivity allows him to explore uncommon areas of poignancy, perversity, and the human condition. One example is the young narrator's childish insistence on getting a goodnight kiss from his mother at the cost of wresting her attention away from the visiting Swann. Another remarkable instance is the scene in which a girl's female lover spits on the photograph of the girl's deceased father in disrespectful defiance of his wishes for his daughter's decency. And I myself identified with Legrandin, the engineer whose passion for literature and art grants his professional career no advantages but makes him an excellent conversationalist.Few writers can claim Proust's level of elegance and imagery. The long and convoluted sentences, with multiple subordinate clauses tangled together like tendrils of ivy, remind me of Henry James; but Proust is much warmer and more intimate although admittedly he is just as difficult to read. The narration of &quot;Swann's Way&quot; is a loosely connected flow of thoughts which go off on tangents to introduce new ideas and scenes; the effect is similar to wandering through a gallery of Impressionist paintings. And, as though channeling Monet literarily, Proust displays a very poetical understanding of and communication with nature, infusing his text with pastoral motifs and floral metaphors that suggest the world is always in bloom."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"The first book of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; consists of three independent but connected parts. The first one, &quot;Combray&quot;, is a treatise on involuntary memory, triggered by Marcel's tasting of a pastry that automatically brings back memories of the old vacations at Combray, a fictionalized countryside town in France. The reader feels immediately identified with the character, since all of us have experienced the same. Sometimes, a scent, a face, a tune or a taste touches on an old, forgotten memory. The amazing thing here is that the taste of the pastry leads to one of the most daunting achievements in the history of literature: seven volumes of memories, of an undescribable beauty. This first part, as all the series (which is really one long novel) has an analytical, obssesive quality of extreme beauty. It is an homage to remembrances, to nostalgia and to the life that we recreate in our memory.The second part, &quot;A love of Swann&quot;, is the most peculiar of the whole series. It is a step back in time, to tell a story that Marcel had heard in his family circle. Charles Swann, a wealthy Jewish banker and a friend of the family, fell once in love with a &quot;cocotte&quot; or courtisan, a vulgar woman who made him mad with an obsessive passion. The story, relevant to the subsequent development of events in the novel, is also a treaty on jealousy. It is an exasperating tale of passion, lust, betrayal and obsession, told in a straightforward and beautiful style. Its last line is brutally smashing.The third part, &quot;Names of Lands: the Name&quot; is perhaps the most poetic. It is another dissertation on the character's childhood memories, the evocations that the names of places bring about, and the first love, the daughter of Swann and the courtisan Odette de Crecy.Hundreds of books have been written about this magnum opus. It is art for the sake of art; the deepest treatise on memory and Time; literature of the highest sort; a pleasure in pure writing and reading. It is always useful to compare it to Joyce. While Joyce tries to capture the ever-running present, Proust's endeavour is to recapture that which is already gone: the Past. But the past, seems to say Proust, is not gone: it lives, in a disguised form, in our present memory.If you are a casual or lazy reader, read something else: this is reserved for true lovers of literature. And, I would say, for true lovers of themselves."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"How can any work be so dreamy and poetic and at once so precise and analytical? While describing the sensory world with hallucinatory clarity and beauty, Proust simultaneously presents his characters (all quite unforgettable) as if under a microscope, revealing in luminous detail the complex interplay of memory, desire, conscience and habit in their divided hearts. The narrator (young Proust, more or less) divides the work roughly between a nostalgic portrait of childhood summers at his family's country home, and a mordantly funny record of an older friend's humiliating courtship of a notorious woman and subsequent crucifixion by jealousy. Proust has a cruel wit, a supernatural eye for paradox, a taste for the most delicious ironies and above all an all-encompassing wisdom that borders on the mystical - forgiving all, forgetting nothing."},{"Title":"Swann's Way","review":"This book is Great, however you need to get somewhere quiet to read it, as it does demand full attention. The section: \\"Swann in Love\\" is the best work I have read to date. I have learned now to love Proust's work page by page as opposed to making it a race to the finish.

Spring gave way to summer, then autumn in New York, followed by Christmas and one of the worst Februarys in the city's memory (in Sigrid's memory, too, unfortunately)For the author, fourteen years have passed. For Sigrid Harald herself, no matter how much internal evidence alert readers may cite to the contrary, it has been only one short tumultuous year.And now it is spring again. . . \\"As mentioned, this jewel of a character study spans the course of eight full length novels plus two short stories, one, \\"Lieutenant Harald And the \`Treasure Island' Treasure\\" was originally published in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, and the other, \\"Lieutenant Harald And The Impossible Gun\\" first appeared in Marilyn Wallace's fourth anthology. Both can be found in Margaret Maron's short story anthology \\"Shoveling Smoke\\".As other reviewers have noted, these stories must be read in the correct order to fully understand the amazing transformation Sigrid goes through in the span of a short year, both internally and externally. And yet, all of the books can stand alone as well-plotted mysteries. This is the mark of Maron's true genius.\\"Death of a Butterfly\\" (1984) - In May, a young mother is found brutally bludgeoned on her kitchen floor. But her tragic death only highlights the scars this beautiful but cold, self-centered, and demanding woman left on those still alive. For as Lieutenant Harald quickly discovers, more than one person had a motive for killing Julie Richmond: her ex-husband and his pregnant girlfriend, financially unable to marry while Julie was alive; her childless next-door neighbors, who gave Julie's son the love she never could; or her criminally adept brother, whose relationship with his sister was strictly hate-hate. Now Sigrid must unravel a tangled web of hurt to find the one strand of pain raw enough enough to lead to murder.On the personal front, Oscar Nauman keeps showing up at odd times, carrying her off to dinner, marching her around museums and galleries to remedy her abysmal ignorance of modern art, and appearing on her threshold with a weird assortment of groceries that he turned into gourmet meals in her heretofore soup-and-sandwich kitchen. By the end of the book she has even, albeit reluctantly, acquired a temporary roommate in the person of Roman Tremegra, an acquaintance of her mother's, plus she faces the need to find a new apartment by the time her lease expires August 1st (her building is going condo). All in all, lots of change is going on in Sigrid's life.Another complex plot of a murder of an unsympathetic character, which opens the door to multiple suspects. I certainly didn't guess the murderer."},{"Title":"Death of a Butterfly (Ulverscroft Large Print)","review":"If you like the setting detail and character development that this author excels at, you'll like this book.

Her characters are solid and believable. I'd read the Sigrid Harald books many many years ago and loved them and then came the Deborah Knott books. I like her plots and her characters and backstories. I think I'm reviewing Margaret Maron here more than the single book. I'd suggest that you start with her first and move in chronological order.

It was not high tension like Patricia Cornwall but a cleverly crafted mystery and glimpse of human foibles, besides."},{"Title":"The Manly family;: An account of the descendants of Captain Basil Manly of the revolution, and related families,","review":"This book contains questionable information. Perhaps it is the best Mrs. Manly could do in light of the information available at the time the book was written. The origin of the family line is doubtful and appears to blend two lines into one with relationships, if any, unsubstantiated. Important facts are omitted with much aggrandizement of other facts.

The book in intelligent, accurate and gives you the right idea that underlines the love of generations of great men for the water. Water as adventure, water as duel and meditation, water as gathering matter and sense of life. Episodes and tales to think about, a book that pushes you straight to the closest lake, seaside or swimming pool. Makes you understand as, sometimes, the most valuable and exciting things are not hidden in the deep and dark forest but are easily available and are just waiting to be discovered."},{"Title":"Haunts of the Black Masseur: The Swimmer as Hero","review":"I re-read this book every few years. It's one of my five favorite books of all time. If you like swimming, you'll love it. It's very poetic, the language is musical, it's unbelievably well written (James Joyce would like reading this), and a marvelous history of swimming, in the arts and in history. Reading it takes you straight to that place your head can sometimes go to, when you're swimming at midnight, in a dark, warm ocean, on a warm summer night, by yourself, and you slip into some kind of waking, crazy, ecstatic, dreamstate, nirvana/satori. This book is almost as good as swimming itself."},{"Title":"Haunts of the Black Masseur: The Swimmer as Hero","review":"Sprawson's book, more than a decade after its publication, is still the best post-modernist collection of thoughts on swimming in all its forms. It will be of interest to both the atheletic dabbler and the scholarly plunger (not that the two, as ably demonstrated by Sprawson himself, cannot be the same). This remains the best book about the historic and intellectual roots of our modern swimming mad world. Readers wishing to continue their exploration of water's embrace on the human mind and body will find much of interest in my sequal to Sprawson's book - Deep Immersion: The Experience of Water (nominated as top environmental book of the year), which reviews over two hundred modern accounts by writers plunging into water around the world. Stay wet! As Thoreau wrote: \\"That part of you that is wettest is fullest of life\\" (quoted in Profitably Soaked: Thoreau's Engagement with Water; Green Frigate Books, 2003)"},{"Title":"Haunts of the Black Masseur: The Swimmer as Hero","review":"Something primordial exists in swimming for those willing to recognize it, perhaps some residue of an ancestral species instinct to the sea, a subliminal memory of submergence in the amniotic sac, or the proffered suspension of temporal consciousness in its weightless rhythms. Sprawson explores this allure in athletics and in literature. Most central to his study are the Romantic poets obsession with swimming and water-- among them Goethe, Shelley, Swinburne, Pushkin, Poe and especially Byron who was a formidable marathon swimmer in his own right.The Romantic ideal was closely associated with Classical notions of the body and nature, and its notion of hero was intertwined with this. Hellenism held a special thrall over the Romantic period. This was the impetus to Byron's swimming of the Hellespont, and to a tragic sub text to his and other lives as they were swept up in naive movements or misadventure (Byron died in a Greek rebellion against the Turks). Swimming was seen as a dissent from the priggish, sanctimonious, imposed to something pure, original, regenerative through nature.But there was an impulse to self annihilation as well. Some were smashed on rocks, or gripped by undertows or had their health broken by cold water and over exertion. Fitness was not the prevailing motivation; swimming was muse, cave, judge. Its influence continued into the 20th Century, In Jack London's 'Martin Eden', John Cheever's 'the Swimmer&quot; or Yukio Mishima's seduction by Byron's hedonistic fantasies, it again cast down verdicts of elevation, dissolution and destruction.I was drawn to this book by an Australian broadcast on swimming during the Sydney Olympics, amongst which was excerpts from this book and an interview with Jon Konrads, the 1500 Meter Olympic Champion of 1960, who had returned to swimming in late middle age after decades of absence. In it he found a cerebral tonic, albeit at a much slower pace-- an invigoration, relaxation and something spiritually satisfying, even more so now than in his Olympic form. This is a worth while read for anyone interested in the sport and pastime. Even for the most pedestrian of lappers, it is an invitation to glide in eddies of imagination, sublimely cognizant of and refining the stroke, seeking some mysterious grace. There swimming provides an elixir of meditation and inspiration-- for those that it does not consume."},{"Title":"Haunts of the Black Masseur: The Swimmer as Hero","review":"The author examines swimming from all angles: the history, the competition, the recreation. The style is mesmerizing and turns a mundane subject into a revelation. This book should appeal to swimmers and non-swimmers alike.The artwork included is outstanding, and makes mw wish the author had included more.The author includes several stories about his own swimming adventures, but rather than being self-centered, these episodes are avenues into intriguing stories and history.The style of the writing is smooth and inviting.

There is a section at the beginning with clear instructions (with photographs) on the basic double-ended crochet stitch for beginners. There aren't many stitch guides available for double-ended crochet, so it's mere existence is something I enjoy.What I don't like (or what's missing):Many different designers are included, and there's a lack of consistency in instructions (e.g., purl stitch is also called pearl stitch). The photographs are of variable quality. Most are clear but there are quite a few which are fuzzy or very bright/low contrast. Although this is a booklet, it doesn't lay totally flat, so you do have to crack the spine to crochet and read at the same time.

This travel writing dates from 1947 and earlier. This is a very nice offering in the armchair traveler series. One expects a good deal from a brother of Evelyn Waugh.In 1926 the author traveled around the world. The tourist season of the Caribbean ends in April. Martinique was under French rule and is a far north of the line, equator, as Tahiti is south of it. The island's prosperity depends on rum and sugar. Martinique is a busness center. When Waugh wrote of it in 1928 there were a few influential Creole families. Society was formal. The tourist has to rely on first impressions, as does the book reviewer. The small fish of the tropics are deceptive. The countryside of Martinique is varied.The population of every tropical town is either commercial or administrative. Dominica is the loveliest of the islands of the Antilles and the most difficult to manage. It is very mountainous and very green. At least in 1938 it had no smart hotels. Jean Rhys had been born in Dominica.If you want to see the street carnival go to Port of Spain, Trinidad. St. Pierre had been the loveliest city in the West Indies. It was destroyed by the volcano at Pele. Jamaica was a vast playground. In the old days of sugar plantations it was adorned with windmills. Montserrat was discovered by Columbus in 1493.Barbados has none of the high mountained splendor of Trinidad. At least in 1947 it struck Waugh as the most English of the islands. Barbados had an integrated family atmosphere in his estimation. Barbados and Antigua had superb beaches.Angostura is produced in Trinidad. In the West Indies there is no such thing as a leisure class. There is a lack of privacy.Waugh feels that because Toussaint l'Ouverture was self-educated he was called a genius. He drove the English out of Haiti and was called a patriot. He was the descendant of an African prince.In 1947 Waugh writes that due to the generosity of the Carnegie Trust most of the islands are supplied with excellent reference libraries. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 marked the elimination of Spain as a monopolist on the Caribbean scene. There was general prosperity in the sugar islands. During the Napoleonic Wars more British soldiers lost their lives in the West Indies than in Europe.The liberation of the slaves ended the prosperity of the West Indies. Waugh compares the Amerindians Columbus found to the Polynesians. They welcomed the proud Spaniards. The Spaniards, however, were obtuse. They sought treasure, gold, and to spread the gospel. Within twenty years the entire Indian population of Hispaniola had been wiped out. Orginally there had been two million. The extermination may be understood in that it all happened at the time of Inquisition.In St. Vincent, Windward Islands, the Caribs were unsubdued at the time of French Revolution. The book is billed as a selection of Alec Waugh's best island histories. It is very fine."},{"Title":"Love and the Caribbean;: Tales, characters and scenes of the West Indies","review":"This book is an excellent choice for those with a working knowledge of the West Indies who want a more complete perspective of the area.

I was impressed. It has more information over a wider variety of topics than I expected, especially considering that this is such a broad subject.This, however, is also the book's weakness. The author was asked to cover such a massive range of information (the 'everyday life' of every American Indian tribe within a hundred-year period) that she would have needed three times the page count to do each tribe justice.Most chapters (Family Life, Wars, Weapons and Treaties, Clothing and Accessories, etc.) are divided into geographical area, with information about the tribes in that area mixed within the section. For example, under Family Life, Great Basin, we find paragraphs on the birthing traditions of the Shoshane, puberty rituals of the Paiute, marriage among the Ute, and death rituals of the Shoshane. All detailed and engaging, making this an excellent overview, but you may be frustrated if you're hoping to learn in-depth about any specific tribe."},{"Title":"Everyday Life Among the American Indians: 1800 to 1900 (Writer's Guide to Everyday Life Series)","review":"I am in love with this book and plan to look at other volumes.Instead of skimming it, I read it cover to cover.

It's part of a Writer's Digest series (a reference for fiction writers) and not intended to be an academic resource. Each chapter ends with a list of suggested additional readings.Chapter three is on \\"wars, weapons and treaties\\". The author avoids the politics of blame and simply reports without personal commentary. For example, of the Dakota uprising in Minnesota in 1862, she writes:\\"Perhaps the most well-known of all Indian-military battles are those related to the tribes of the Sioux confederation (Lakota, Dakota, Nakota). One early conflict occurred in present-day Minnesota when Santees raided trading posts and settlements on 18 August 1862. About four hundred white settlers died in the initial fighting, and the region became a war zone for several weeks thereafter. In late September, Gen. Henry Hastings Sibley followed the Santees to Wood Lake forcing them to surrender under the barrage of firing by his soldiers using various pieces of artillery. Though some of the Santees fled to Canada, many were arrested. Subsequent trails led to the execution of thirty-eight Santees in Mankato, Minnesota, on 26 December 1962. The remaining Santees were then removed to a reservation in eastern Nebraska.\\" (63-64)Of Wounded Knee in 1890, she writes:\\"Wounded Knee: 29 December 1890 the final Sioux battle - which like Sand Creek and the Battle of the Washita was truly a massacre - occurred at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, when federal troops opened fire on Big Foot and his followers, killing more than 150 Indians and wounding another fifty.\\" (66)= Contents =IntroductionPart One: Government and War1.

The editors have plucked from obscurity a psychological drama that is beautiful in its language, haunting in its imagery, and compelling to read. A real page-turner from the master."},{"Title":"The rover (Benn's Essex library)","review":"I would not have know of this book had I not seen the reference in the Afterward of Dewey Lambdin's book, &quot;H.M.S. Cockerel,&quot; which dealt with the British evacuation of Toulon in late 1793. The book was originally published in 1923, and just reissued in 1999. It was the last novel completed by Joseph Conrad. It is the tale of the sailor, Peyrol, but also of poor, mad Arlette, her parents murdered in the massacre in Toulon after the British evacuation, who roams silently about, her shifting eyes forever seeking someone. The story starts in late 1796, after the temporary British evacuation of the Mediterranean, with Peyrol's arrival in Toulon in command of a prize ship. After setting the stage for the story, events jump forward to the 1803-1805 time period when Admiral Lord Nelson was in command of a fleet blockading the port. The story has a tendency to shift from scene to scene, with some flashbacks in time that sometimes make it a little difficult to follow the sequence of events, but overall it is well written and a very good tale. It is a shift from the usual naval adventure, but fills in a part of the events taking place in that time period."},{"Title":"The rover (Benn's Essex library)","review":"The high renaissance of Conrad was Nigger of the &quot;Narcissus&quot;, Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Nostromo period and what a period that was. These later works are Conrad in his manneristic style. That is to say his strengths as well as his flaws show. Works like Victory, Rescue, Arrow of Gold, and Rover are like the works written by an aging Prospero, but still Prospero. Rover is by far the best of these late works though each exert a unique charm to any lover of Conrad. Rover is like a last and momentary return to glory for this master of sea tales. I bought tha Malay editions of these late works and am very glad to have these hard to find books. Rover is a pleasing meditation on the coasts of France of a mariners return to land after a long life at sea. But looming on the horizon are English ships! The old mariner has one last adventure and it will cost you much pleasure as it unfolds to a final sea confrontation. My favorite thing about this book is the meditation on the bonds and ethics of sea comraderie which here takes precedence over those of nationality."},{"Title":"The rover (Benn's Essex library)","review":"One of my favorite books of all time. Set in the period following the French revolution and war with Britain, the main character is an old salt &quot;Peyrol&quot; who brings home a prize ship and retires from the sea. There are hints that Peyrol's experiences at sea were more than just as a sailor but that he was a &quot;brother of the barbary coast&quot;. The story is about Peyrol's search for place and love, something he had not experienced in his many years of roaming the seas. The book goes to the heart and is not your typical sea story but one once read will be remembered."},{"Title":"The rover (Benn's Essex library)","review":"I chanced upon &quot;The Rover&quot; after having finished all of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin novels. It's a hard act to follow, but after reading &quot;The Rover&quot; one might almost think that O'Brian learned a trick or two from Conrad -- for example, how to describe a captain's state of mind and thought processes during a sea chase.The course of events in this tale takes some unraveling. Devices employed by Conrad include flashbacks, sudden gaps in the chronologic sequence, and implied dialogue. Consequently, the book reads more like a detective novel than one of O'Brian's straightforward sea adventures. That is to say, it takes a bit of detective work to follow the story.My only regret is that I read the introduction to this edition first; unfortunately it gives away the ending. That may be the only reason why I didn't rate this book five stars."},{"Title":"The rover (Benn's Essex library)","review":"Joseph Conrad was sixty-six years old, a few years younger than I am now, when 'The Rover' was first published in 1923. He must have been an 'old man' physically -- he died a year later -- with an old man's indifference to the profundities of his own earlier novels, since The Rover is a mellow historical Romance, a gently rolling tale of indomitable courage, sudden passion, and loyalty. The \\"Rover\\" of the story, Jean Peyrol, is an old man also, white-haired but still formidable, who is smitten by a Romance as quixotic and unfulfillable as that of any 12th C Provencal troubadour for his Lord's Lady. Et puis, viol&agrave;, mes amis! My review title has a 'tres ing&eacute;nieux' double meaning! Let's hear some applause.Conrad always had a knack for portraying sturdy, resolute, 'heart-of-oak' old seamen, on the verge of their last 'voyage'. Jean Peyrol is an awesome specimen. A peasant orphan carried off to the Indian Ocean before the French Revolution, an adventurer-pirate who eventually took stock of his life and became a 'regular' sailor in the French navy, Peyrol returns to Toulon just after the Reign of Terror. His native France is, to him, the most foreign of lands, but nonetheless he decides to take haven there, to root himself in peaceful retirement. By an unforeseeable chance, he finds himself lodging in the farm/inn of a woman-of-allure, Arlette -- beautiful, unfathomable, half-mad, the victim of the insanity of the betrayed Revolution. Most of the story is narrated in the conventional omniscient third-person from over the broad shoulders of Peyrol, a man of implacable self-control. The fictive realization of Peyrol's character is among Conrad's best; the old man is magnificent yet believable.As \\"fate\\" would have it -- and \\"fate\\" is a theme of this novel -- eight years later, Napoleon has further betrayed the ideals of the Revolution and the denouement is approaching at Trafalgar. Toulon and its coastline are under embargo, sealed by the British fleet. A young French officer arrives at Peyrol's sequestered cove, with a cunning plan that could change the course of events... and that's enough of the plot, mes amis! Suffice it to say that mighty passions are excited.The Ideals of the French Revolution are also a theme of this novel. Patriotism is not a despicable passion here, but the passions aroused in revolutionary times are fatally corruptible. Conrad's 'revolutionary' themes have gotten less attention than his depictions of moral ambiguity; \\"Lord Jim\\" is more widely read than \\"Nostromo\\". But \\"The Rover\\" isn't as shallow a romance as it might seem on quick reading. It reiterates the subtle skepticism toward 'revolution' that Conrad expressed in \\"Nostromo\\" and \\"Under Western Eyes.\\"The question has been asked, why \\"The Rover\\" has not been acclaimed by critics and scholars as properly worthy of their attentions. It is something of a forgotten book. This edition is from a series of 'nautical adventure' novels; otherwise \\"The Rover\\" would be out-of-print. Some association with the Hornblower and Aubrey/Maturin novels of sailing ships in the Napoleonic War era is inevitable. Several reasons for the neglect come to mind. First, the book isn't structurally complex enough to require exegesis by graduate students; after wrestling with the ambiguities of \\"Heart of Darkness\\", no magisterial professor will find enough sustaining obscurity in it. Second, it's 'French' in sympathies, and English readers have scant tolerance for granting any sympathy to the French side in the Napoleonic Wars. When Peyrol extols the leadership of Bonaparte, when he asserts that such leadership is a fated necessity of history, Anglophone readers will shudder. The historical necessity of the French Revolution -- sullied by bloodthirstiness, betrayed by greed and opportunism, inevitably so -- is nonetheless sanctified over the long haul. It had to be. It was 'fated' to be, in the sense that effects are always fated by causes. But in 21st Century America and England, the merest suggestion that the French Revolution wasn't a hideous crime from start to finish is unwelcome. Burke rules, though very few people have read his sluggish prose, and Paine is ignored. To some degree, I think Conrad's final novel has been depreciated simply because its 'heroes' are French citoyens, not British shopkeepers.But you needn't fret too much about interpretation when you read \\"The Rover\\". Chances are you'll never need to write a paper about it for any class. Read it just for fun! That's what I did, after reading four or five painful, somber novels of mid-20th C catastrophe. Possibly that's what Conrad had in mind: a thrilling escape from modern times."},{"Title":"The rover (Benn's Essex library)","review":"Had this novel been written by Graham Greene (which is not an absurd notion, given that one of its themes is the suppression of the Catholic Church during the revolution), he would have called it an \`entertainment'. Conrad does something else; he puts the following poem on the front page:Sleep after toil, port after stormy seas,Ease after war, death after life, does greatly please.(Spenser)This was Conrad's last finished novel. Was he tired? The poem became his epitaph, not much later.The Rover is a great and simple story, simply told, for a Conrad. There is no complicated narrative structure, not as much jumping in time as in many earlier works. Mostly we have the anonymous 3rd party narrator who can look into his protagonists' minds and who knows all about them.Most of the time he follows Peyrol, our hero, the rover, a retiring seaman who returns home in the South of France after decades in the Far East, where he was mostly involved in piratical exploits, recently legitimized by the laws of war. It is revolution time in France when he returns, taking a prize, captured from the English in the Indian Ocean, into Toulon.From Toulon he travels a short distance to his home region, which he has left as an orphaned little boy. He is wealthy and suspect: is he an aristocrat? A disguised clergyman? A foreigner, maybe a spy? The worst time of the terror is over by now.He has stolen a treasure, which he conceals and carries around with him on his travel. He finds a place where he settles down, in a seaside farm cum guesthouse occupied by two women and a former \`blood drinker', a fervent revolutionary. The women are the patronne, who is a seemingly half mad young woman, and her aunt. We assume that the man has a claim on the patronne.The narration then jumps 8 years. It is Napoleon's time now. Former sans-culottes are unhappy.Peyrol, the rover, is still in the same guesthouse. The English are back in the Mediterranean, sea warfare is on. (We know all about that from Patrick O'Brian.)Peyrol is getting dragged into the war. Retirement is suspended.Nelson has begun a loose blockade of Toulon by sea, trying to lure the French out for battle.English spy ships are hugging the shore.The rover gets involved with an attempt at deceiving Nelson.He owns a little sailing boat by now.(During his restoration work of his boat, he befriends a cripple, who has this remarkable comment to offer: Since those Republicans have deposed God and flung Him out of all the churches I have forgiven Him all my troubles. Spoken like a man, says Peyrol. This is one of the most religious scenes in all of unreligious Conrad.)The war story gets a little complicated by a love story, as one would expect. The patronne has her eyes on a French navy lieutenant. This aspect of the plot is not so great. Conrad's women were not his strong side.Structurally I would have wished more sea action. Anyway, it is a proper precursor for Jack Aubrey's Mediterranean adventures.The novel is one of Conrad's most enjoyable ones, though it lacks the psychological depth of his main period. I am not sure why it does not receive more recognition. (Why is there no proper current edition, e.g. in Penguin?) It was made into a film with Anthony Quinn, which strikes me as good casting, though I have not watched it. However the plot of the film has done violence to the novel, which is a repellant for me."},{"Title":"The rover (Benn's Essex library)","review":"This novel formed part of my english literature curriculum almost 40 years ago. That was the last time I read the novel. Conrad put much of his own experience into the book. He descibes with great power the life of Peyrol, a brother of the coast, returning home after a life spent at sea. Retirement is planned, but this is not to be through one final call to duty. Brilliantly atmospheric style brings to life the characters and countryside. Well worth revisiting for the first time since my school days."},{"Title":"Ancient Egypt Knowledge Cards","review":"\\"The archaeological riches of Egypt offer a glimpse of an ancient civilization noted for its accomplishments in architecture, arts and letters, government, and religion.

Worth every penny."},{"Title":"King Henry the Eighth (The Cambridge Pocket Shakespeare)","review":"I have tried to abide by a discipline to read at least one Shakespearean play a year. I rarely if ever have reviewed any of them because they are so picked over that I don't feel that I have anything to add. However, it was with a good deal of anticipation that I stepped away from the renowned to the obscure by reading \\"King Henry VIII\\". I say that because it was the subject that interested me and I admit that it made quite a difference reading a play about someone I knew something about. This, in turn, gave me pause to consider many things about \\"King Henry VIII\\" that I would never have even known to consider about his other histories. It's not that I read many of his other histories but those that I had read left me completely at the mercy of the Bard for any sort of perspective or overview.What I found most interesting about \\"King Henry VIII\\" is the limited scope that the play covered. Let's face it: even today Ol' King Henry VIII is a treasure chest of plots and subplots. Yet Shakespeare treated his subject with a great deal of respect and, essentially, rewrote history before it was even written. The four or five main characters (with the exception of Cardinal Wolsley) all come across in good light. Perhaps Ann \\"Bullen\\" is a bit empty-headed but certainly Henry, Anne of Aragon and the lesser known (outside of the Church) Thomas Cranmer are all noble through and through. There is little of the bawdy, glutonous Henry that history has given us. You would guess that Shakespeare would have done great things with such a subject but he didn't and the question that I asked myself was; WHY?I have not studied anything about this play. I prefer to always see what the play says directly to me before being told by others as to what it means. Thus I may be stating the obvious but I came away with the conclusion that \\"King Henry VIII\\" was written for Shakespeare's Quenn Elizabeth. It was pretty obvious when reading Cranmenr's final speech and it put everything into perspective. All that went before were noble and all that came after were not even mentioned. The \\"noble\\" divorce of Henry and Ann of Aragon was necessary so that Henry have the proper opportunity to sire Elizabeth. I'm not sure enough of my timetables to know if Elizabeth I was still alive when this play came out but even if she weren't it would still be the Bard's tribute to her.I had come to expect that most of the \\"good stuff\\" of Shakespeare (with the exception of \\"King Henry V\\") was to be found in his tragedies primarily and comedies next with the histories coming up a poor third. However, I kept my pencil busy underling passages in \\"King Henry VIII\\". It is a good play, it's not \\"MacBeth\\", but it's a good play. I'd have considered rating it 5 stars but then we'd have to rate some of the rest as 7's 8's and 9's. Most people who'd take the time to read Shakespeare probably already have a pretty good working knowledge of at least the popular history of the King with six wives. Read it for yourself and I think that you, too, will find that history is better understood when you are already familiar with the subject."},{"Title":"King Henry the Eighth (The Cambridge Pocket Shakespeare)","review":"... the reviews for King Henry VIII by William Shakespeare (and all their other books as far as I can tell) as if different editions have the same content - obviously in the case of classics that is far from true.... 3 editions of Henry VIII at this time: (1) Hardback edited by Gordon McMullar published in November 2000 (2) Paperback edited by Jay L. Halio published in September 2000 (3) Paperback edited by R. A. Foakes published in February 1998Their editorial reviews describe ALL 3 of these editions as &quot;This is the first fully annotated modern-spelling edition of King Henry VIII to appear for over a decade and includes up-to-date scholarship on all aspects of the play, including dating authorship, printing, sources and stage history.&quot; I don't think so! The reader reviews don't distinguish the editions but they are the same reviews posted for the different books. I wish I could contribute the answer but I am still trying to figure it out -- in the meantime, purchase cautiously or you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"King Henry the Eighth (The Cambridge Pocket Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare managed to describe the later life of King Henry the eight, with much intelligence and gracefulness. This play, written centuries before, has captured my attention unlike any present-day play or novel. King Henry VIII was based on the life of the notoriously known King Henry the eight of England. To my dismay, only two of King Henry's wives were mentioned. This play showed how King Henry's life was never truly complete: he couldn't trust anyone, he was unfaithful to the Lord, his wives and his country, and he was never blessed with a son, to be heir to his throne. For myself, the climax of the play was viewing how the king dealt with the change of wives and the birth of his daughter, Elizabeth. The play King Henry VIII by William Shakespeare is a wonderful recommendation for anyone who wishes to understand the tidings of King Henry the eight from a fictitious, historical, personal point of view, rather than from historical facts."},{"Title":"King Henry the Eighth (The Cambridge Pocket Shakespeare)","review":"This was an appropriate conclusion to Shakespeare's career. Not only are the characters such as Henry VIII, Cranmer, and Wolsey convincing, but the poetry and images are beautiful. In addition, through the fall of several characters such as Wolsey, we can see reflections of Shakespeare himself as he wrote his 37th and final play. It is also poetically appropriate that one of the greatest writers England ever knew ended his career by writing a play about one of the greatest kings that England ever knew! I DO NOT believe that Shakespeare only wrote parts of this play as many people do. With the beautiful images, poetry, and captivating characters, I am very confident in the belief that this play was written entirely by the one and only William Shakespeare."},{"Title":"King Henry the Eighth (The Cambridge Pocket Shakespeare)","review":"The edition is unedited, with no introduction, and without notes of any kind. Shakespeare texts, to be worth buying, need notes, at a minumum those that elucidate difficult words, of which there are many in Shakespeare, 29000 by one count. The absence of notes should have been in the book's description.

Although the content is great for teaching sounds of letters and phonomes, it lacked the ability to keep either of my children interested for more than 5 minutes. I'm sure he could learn a great deal from these if they were interesting but I found Spelling blaster and Reading Rabbit much more useful. I found myself board out of my skull trying to work with him on these and I don't bore easily. I then tried to use them to teach my 3 year old and had the same results. If your child is able to concentrate for long periods of time these CD's would be very useful. I was also not able to adjust and skip the lower levels to get to where my sons level was. We never made it to the useful part. The idea is great, but it needs some type of fun and reward system to make it work."},{"Title":"Color Phonics","review":"I received Color Phonics 2 years ago at a homeschool convention. At first my 3yo &amp; 5 yo sons got very little out of it...the three year old was confused by the voice saying the word where his mouse was right after the word he was supposed to look for. The five year old was bored, though he is easily bored. Now, I'm finally using it...each child (ages 3, 4.5, and almost 7 now) is required to play 15 minutes of Color Phonics before they may use their edutainment CDROMs. This has worked wonderfully...the content of Color Phonics is marvelous, and is helping my speech delayed 4.5yo to distinguish the different sounds. The almost 7yo has been struggling with reading (due we believe to binocular vision), and having the color coding is a great asset for him. (The 3yo doesn't get a lot out of it yet, but she will...she is also language delayed, so she's just not ready for it yet.) Yes, the program requires a bit of motivation not necessary with edutainment...but it wasn't designed as edutainment...it was designed to teach."},{"Title":"Color Phonics","review":"Despite a few software flukes, this program worked well for our son.

Each cd-rom focuses on a different element of phonics: consonants, vowels, consonant blends, short vowel stories and long vowel stories. The sounds are color coded so your child will learn both phonics and their colors. Within the program there is a teacher center where you can track your child's progress. There is a focus learning system which can be set up to reinforce weak areas. This is great for teaching a child to read, utilizing for remedial reading or teaching English as a second language."},{"Title":"Color Phonics","review":"I have taught Kindergarten for 8 years. I like the color coding and the excellent way they show the children HOW to make each sound properly. The reinforcement games of fishing for the correct letter or the given sound are well done. The main program is better played on the timed mode because otherwise it is too slow and boring. It is not engaging for long periods of time, but if you can get a child to do it...it would be worthwhile. It is a sound program except my criticism of it is that the stories concentrate so much on word families and rhymes, that they are not \\"readable\\" when it comes to understanding and comprehension.For example,the story \\"The Brook Hook\\" reads as follows: \\"A crook cast a hook into the brook. He hoped to hook a fish to cook. The fish took a look at the brook hook. The fish took a look above the brook and saw the crook. The crook would not cook a fish tonight.\\"I feel like I am reading Dr. Seuss' \\"Fox in Socks\\" (which is an excellent read, but too difficult for a beginning reader.)

Once completed, I installed ISA and referred back to the book for additional guidance. I'm still looking for the additional guidance.This title does a great job of introducing ISA to the reader. It spends chapters of time covering the ISA concept, architecture and Microsoft Minimum Requirements. From there, however, the book gets a little more glossy and sales brochure like. Deployment scenarios, installation and (very) basic configuration are covered, but the author has chosen to really only cover the installation of ISA in an enterprise / array configuration, leaving the stand-alone server installation out in the cold. Past the installation, the author tour guides you through the basic setup of the server (which actually was very handy and without this it would have taken me quite a while to figure it out) and then moves on to briefly cover some of the major selling points.What is really missing from this book is any specifics, or even an in-depth, point by point reference covering of the interface and components. For example, the author covers setting alerts for Intrusion Detection, but instead of explaining the configuration choices for each of the five actions, the author tells you that \\"Depending on your selection, a different window will appear that enables you to configure the option you selected.\\"The title is helpful, and I am glad I read it.

For example, an entire chapter on how ISA fits into IP (and an intro to TCP/IP), an entire chapter on system requirements.- Too much FLUFF! In addition to the 9 blank, lined pages of &quot;NOTES&quot;, the 25 pages listing (doublespaced) TCP known-ports, and the extra large font that pumps the index up to 24 pages, there are too many step-by-step, illustrated, descriptions of how to do basic tasks. Subtract the fluffiness noted above along with a few other egregious instances, and you're looking at a 250 or 300 page book, not a 408 page book.The only reason I read this book was because I was paid to do so. I don't use Microsoft software anymore, but I've used (and reviewed for publication) enough of it for a lifetime. Which is another reason not to buy this book--but an entirely different issue altogether.If you must use ISA, or if you must consider using ISA, this book will actually be worth it--it comes with a 120-day trial version of the software (another odious practice, but that yet another issue as well)."},{"Title":"A GUIDE TO ENJOYING WILDFLOWERS: Stokes Nature Guides","review":"I received this item very quickly.

I wrote my first thoughts in my diary: \\"As events unfold, I worry of our response. Will internal security become Gestapo like? Will we isolate ourselves? What about our civil rights or the rights of dark guys with beards and robes?\\" To know what could happen, we only needed to look back to the internment of Japanese-Americans or the case of \\"Tokyo Rose\\" (Iva Toguri).If you are interested in World War II history or the excesses of patriotism, this is a book you should read and keep in your library. Mr. Howe has done a through job gathering the events and as a bonus describes the world of living in an enemy's country. I also value the picture Howe paints of life as a POW in Japan. It's nice that he has humanized some of the Japanese military, even to the point of letting us see that there were good and bad on both sides. Consider, for example, the support Iva received from the fighting GI's and compare it to the pettiness of the (mostly) non-combatant government agents.Howe's writing style could have been more readable and there were a few errors of fact. (p. 244 Doolittle's first raid was in 1942 and not two years later.) These did not detract excessively.Our challenge today as Americans is to avoid another case of \\"Tokyo Rose\\"."},{"Title":"The Hunt for \\"Tokyo Rose\\"","review":"I had expected that the author would reveal a lot of what Tokyo Rose actually broadcast and, especially, the effect it had or was expected to have on our troops in the Pacific War.

On the other hand, if you are interested in Tokyo Rose's life and personal problems, and demand a lot of very detailed and specific biographical and prosecutorial information, this is the book for you.

They also gain a better understanding of their 'betwixt' teen, caught between childhood and adulthood. Parents encounter the broken-hearted teen; the rebellious teen; the hanging-out-with-the-crowd teen among the pages. The author's own 'humbling' experiences in dealing with her teen led her to reach out to the wider community for the variety of experiences that are contained in the book.

It begins as a standard love triangle: uncool guy (Ken) meets very cool girl (Ashley), introduces her to his cooler friend (Steve), and a rivalry develops. What sets LONG HOT SUMMER apart from other books in this genre, though, is its honesty. The reader's sympathy is not diverted to the usual, expected places. Rather, writer Eric Stephenson holds back any moral judgments in favor of showing his characters merely as they are, warts and all. Ken has deeper emotional issues than your standard put-upon no-hoper, while Steve is essentially a good guy who doesn't always follow his best instincts. And Ashley? Well, Ashley is still a bit of an enigma, but that could be because neither of the boys takes the time to understand her. This is a story about guys, and so the flaws in her portrayal are the flaws in their perception. It's a difficult line for the writer to walk, as it could be viewed as a cop-out by those who don't want look deeper themselves and see how the choice comments on the overall theme.Another unique aspect of LONG HOT SUMMER is its setting. Stephenson doesn't nail down a date, but judging by certain references, we can assume it's the early to mid-\`80s. The boys are part of the Southern California mod scene, meaning they spend a lot of time fixing up old Italian scooters and digging through record bins for obscure soul 45s. Steve, in particular, is one of the main scenesters, known for his impeccable taste in tunes and his stylish wardrobe. This is where artist Jamie McKelvie gets to shine--in the many details of the trio's social world, from the posters on the wall down to the stitching on the breast of a shirt. Such attention to detail is also his failing, however. Oftentimes a gesture or an expression can appear too labored over, making the characters stiff and lifeless. Thankfully, the dialogue is so crisp, it keeps such moments moving and the story never stops cold."},{"Title":"Long Hot Summer","review":"The Long Hot Summer is about a Mod-group of early-twentysomethings who seemed to be having difficulty growing out of old skin that is high school. Steve is a nice guy who tries to stay a nice guy even when Ken's suppose-to-be girlfriend, Ashley, comes between them. Only incidentally though, she wasn't expecting Ken to have such a cool, attractive best friend. Niether did Steve think that Ken's girlfriend was going to be so hot. The best he could do is distance himself from the pair and nobody seems to let him. Pushing and prodding by his whole group makes him doubt his better judgement. He ends up lying to everyone about everything. Ken, as well, is so needy of everyone he comes to contact with that he can't stop thinking about Ashley (who can't take Ken seriously, by the way) and Ken can't stopping mooching and manipulating his best friend Steve. Ashley isn't hard to understand, she thought Ken was cute (mind you when a girl thinks your cute she could mean one of two things- 1. she could think that your attractive in the cute sense or 2. you're has cute as a puppy. The bad-cute. Guys don't want to be bad-cute, their pretty much disposable. Ken was bad-cute. Who can blame Ashley for thinking that? Ken is in a sense bad news and for more reasons than Ken's and Steve's circle of friends can point out. Though she does decide to go for Steve although his problems are less obvious. Steve comes to a conclusion that he wanted to avoid about his long hot summer about the whole mess reluctantly. The writing and graphics never skip a beat from each and the characters stay true to form. A good read I can't get enough of The Long Hot Summer."},{"Title":"Prairie Kitchen Sampler","review":"One of my favorite &quot;reading&quot; cookbooks which also contains tasty recipes.

So one could reasonably expect a sustained consideration of trait approaches to the question of why some people are markedly more employable, productive and apparently successful than others. Now, this is a sensitive topic for psychologists; so such consideration would have to be critical. One would expect to hear of un-trait-like cases such as tortured geniuses, modest scholars, dullards who succeeded by hard work alone, and boastful victims of their own intellectual pretensions. Such cases, if they occurred with any frequency, would tend to undermine any 'simplistic' idea that there are real, trait-like differences between people in anything that can properly be called competence; and they would point the way to more advanced theorizing, perhaps involving such delights as multivariate conceptualizations and unspecifiable complex interaction effects.The authors of Competence Reconsidered, however, are not at all concerned to argue against, or to give evidence for dismissing an account of human competence that might trace lasting differences in ability largely to some one source.. They simply assume that there is no such reality. For them, \\"competence is not itself an objective phenomenon\\"; \\"competence and incompetence represent labeling phenomena\\" and are only intelligible \\"with reference to a particular social milieu.\\" Here are the good fairies of 1968 indeed -- now plump and frumpy, but still promising rapid social-psychological change once the scales drop from our eyes and we embrace subjectivism, relativism and utopianism and honour their harbingers. The 'guiding premise' of these bearers of yesterday's gifts is that it is personal impressions and self-attributions of competence that are the key variables in this field. They believe that apparent incompetence reflects regrettable misperceptions and expectations -- induced as often as not by an overly competitive society. And, consistent to the end in their idealism, they propose to remedy even literal eyesight problems by a psychological approach -- supported, they claim, by some ophthalmologists. Let the editors speak: \\"....at all points in the life cycle, it is one's construal of reality, rather than reality itself, that most accurately predicts self-concept, goals, academic performance, and overall mental health.\\"With the honourable exceptions of Deborah Phillips and Marc Zimmerman, the authors thus dismiss any possibility that people really differ in competence -- and only thus in perceptions of competence. There could be advantage in this stratagem. Rapid progress might be made with multivariate or interactionist theorizing. Yet dismissing trait accounts -- rather than proving them wrong -- has the disadvantage that the original question is forgotten together with the unwanted answer. Too frightened to ask whether and why some people are generally more competent than others, the authors are left with little to get their teeth into. Thus their only readily comprehensible concern is with how people themselves dimensionalize their own worlds -- for example, with the possibility that, just like psychometricians, people distinguish between 'fluid' and 'crystallized' intelligence. Such demotic constructions of reality can themselves be liberally offered trait-like characterizations: for example, the authors believe some people suffer undue ego orientation (as opposed to more worthy task orientation) even though little evidence is presented here for the existence of this hypothetical dimension. Yet competence itself cannot be envisaged as trait-like within the limits of these authors' piety.This flight from years of educational, vocational and clinical psychology could still have been well advised if it delivered some coherent new theory or even some interesting findings. Unfortunately, the authors are able to make little progress beyond their innocent celebration of the assumptions that have guided them off the beaten track. There are no breakthroughs as to how our perceptions of competence are developed. Merely, we become a little more discriminating (between luck, effort and skill) through childhood -- while still, even as university students, priding ourselves chiefly on our physical attractiveness. And the serendipitous findings that parents do not have low expectations of girls, that self-esteem correlates at +.80 with cheerfulness vs depression, and that elderly athletes prefer to compare their competencies with those of other, similarly elderly athletes will provoke only yawns from those readers who manage to plough through the book's dog's breakfast of such scraps.It is a pity that the authors did not address themselves to the more manageable question of what, precisely, is wrong with a trait approach to competence. For there is indeed a problem -- one that has long been known to psychometricians. It is this. For all that general intelligence (g) provides by far the best predictor of competence known to psychology, another relevant variable, neuroticism (n) is largely independent of g in empirical research. Sir Cyril Burt had drawn this conclusion by 1940; and the idea that n is a major personality dimension, akin to g in the realm of abilities, has subsequently been massively vindicated. Thus, we do indeed find tortured geniuses, gifted students who dread examinations, and people at the other extreme who have remarkably little anxiety about their own intellectual mediocrity. Just why such personal angst as people feel has so little relation to actual incompetence is a very good question. It could be that we only compare ourselves with people of similar intelligence in the modern West -- streamed as we all are by age 25 (despite modern educators' obstinate egalitarian efforts in our earlier years) into well-recognized ability groups. It could be that, for almost philosophical reasons, it is impossible to doubt seriously one's own intelligence -- thus leaving only other forms of self-doubt as possibilities. Or it could be that g and n are simple, independently given biological variables -- one conveying competence and the other conveying a variability in behaviour that makes for long-term adaptivity even if not for that easy predictability for which higher-n people often profess they would settle. Whichever account is correct, the present authors seem unlikely to identify it unless they take to using some measures of g and n in their empirical work."},{"Title":"Keys to Living Well: Dharma Words 1 (Keys to Living Well)","review":"Book Review by Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, Spirituality & Health Magazine OnlineKeys to Living Well: Dharma Words (1)Venerable Master Hsing YunBuddha's Light Publishing 06/05 Paperback $13.00ISBN 1932293132In our busy lives of e-mails, cell phones, multitasking, and computer chat rooms, there sometimes seems to be little evidence of thoughtful behavior and common decency. Even to use these terms is to be taken back to another time and place. The etiquette which was once taught in the home and savored as part of the spiritual life is endangered in both arenas.Venerable Master Hsing Yun is founder of the Fo Guang Shan (Buddha's Light Mountain) Buddhist Order and Buddha's Light International Association. He teaches a brand of Humanistic Buddhism that is down-to-earth and concerned with ethics, interpersonal relationships, courtesy, and conduct that builds character. In Being Good: Buddhist Ethics for Everyday Life and in Living Affinity: Nurturing the Environment, Our Relationships and the Life of the Spirit (a Spirituality & Health Book Award winner), Master Hsing Yun demonstrates a keen ability to examine matters of substance. This paperback contains a treasure-trove of lectures on virtues, maxims on how to deal with difficult people, warnings on things to watch out for in relating to others, mottos for right conduct, and advice for living a full and rich life.Master Hsing Yun has great respect for courtesy. He writes, \\"Courtesy is the foundation for handling people and situations. It is the guideline for human relationships and the benchmark for ethical conduct. When we behave courteously, it is easier for us to maintain appropriate and harmonious relationships. Therefore, courtesy is a basic condition in getting along with others, and it must be cultivated from a young age. From our parents and teachers, we learn the proper manners between old and young, senior and junior. Having courtesy, we should always abide by these manners, so as not to err in dealing with people and situations.\\"Buddhist Humanism is very high on the spiritual practices of compassion, kindness, humility, patience, tolerance, and other selfless virtues. These qualities must be activated each and every day in our interaction with others. For example, all of us at one time or another are bothered by grudges, things that individuals have done in the past that we just cannot forget. Master Hsing Yun notes: \\"Be forgiving and understanding instead of holding any grudges. We must never allow a grudge to fester and grow inside our mind, because we will only be harming ourselves in the end. The greatest virtue in life is forgiveness. When there is animosity from others, we need to be forgiving and understanding. We should not be calculating and attached to our views. Therefore, we need forgiveness and understanding to overcome animosity and the holding of grudges.\\"Closely related is the problem of jealousy or envy: \\"Because some of us cannot bear seeing others do well, such as when we hear our friends getting a promotion or our neighbors being prosperous and wealthy, we come to feel uncomfortable. We may start out feeling rejection and envy, and eventually we will resent them. Actually, when others are doing well, we should not only be happy for them, but we can even take a little pride in their glory. When we are not jealous of what others possess or have accomplished, we will not harbor any bitterness.\\"Master Heing Yun is convinced that contentment is one of the major keys to living well. He states: \\"After a meal, the Hakka people in Taiwan will always reply to the question, 'Are you full?' with 'I'm content.' It is important for us to appreciate contentment; otherwise, it will be of no use to us even if we eat gourmet meals every day. When we are content, we are truly happy. Contentment is of prime importance in life because the joy it brings is even better than fame and fortune.\\" This is a lesson that we in the West have to learn: at present our energies our fueled by discontent and we jump through consumerism hoops to reach the grail of something better or different. We would all be wise to heed the author's description of what it takes to be carefree: \\"Let go of honor and disgrace. Let go of fame and fortune. Let go of gain and loss. Let go of our desires.\\" Read this book, and you will see that there is no spirituality without serious attention to civility and courtesy.Reviews and database copyright 1980-2005 by Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat."},{"Title":"The Complete Digital Video Guide: A Step-by-Step Handbook for Making Great Home Movies Using Your Digital Camcorder","review":"Don't end up like me-time wasted at camera store book racks;fatigue from endless internet book searches.

Bob Brandon will show you step by step how to make those home videos more entertaining, exciting, and basically watchable by your family and friends. There was a time when I thought the art of videotaping was pressing the record button and leaving it on until the event was over. The problem with that was if I was filming a 3-hour graduation and mailed the DVD to my family living out of town, they would have to sit through an entire 3-hour graduation on tape without the view ever leaving the stage! I didn't realize it was torture for them, they were probably fast-forwarding through half of the event to get the part when my daughter received her diploma, and then fast forward again to the end. I would even hate to watch my own videos! At first I thought I needed better equipment to make the videos better, but then I realized, maybe I ought to read a quick book on technique before I invested money in equipment which may not solve the problem. The first book I picked up was the shortest and cheapest called, \\"How to How to Shoot Video That Doesn't Suck\\", by Steve Stockman. This book within minutes gave me the information I desperately needed to make my videos more exciting and I improved significantly immediately after reading this book. I honed Steve's technique as I shot more videos and I wanted to read more in depth following the same basic philosophy but in much more detail. I found Bob Brandon's book in the Library and it provided so much detail in such a clear and concise way of everything a home videographer needed to know on everything from choosing a camera, to planning your shoot, all the through editing. When I say detailed instructions, I mean step by step photograph by photograph in simple language of actual projects Bob has done. My favorite was his profile video of his mom. I did research on who Bob Brandon was to see how he was connected to the video industry and was blown away by some of the information I found and respect he has garnered in the television and documentary industry by his peers. There were even videos on YouTube covering his life (although he is now deceased). The reader will need to keep in mind that this book was written in 2005. Although some information is outdated, it can easily be adapted to today's technology. This book is hard cover for durability and written in very easy to understand language and has increased my video making skills tremendously!"},{"Title":"Photoshop Type Effects Visual Encyclopedia","review":"Some books are just plain fun to pick up and fan the pages.

The screen shots of drop down menus help you - and your own dash of spice will take it to the next level where the words become your own. This book is inspiring. It must be seen, more so than a text review can do justice. Printed on luxurious paper with dazzling color plates on almost every page I enjoy holding the book and moving from one example to the next. All artists and designers have a bag of tricks and box of tools. This book is not a beginner book for those learning Photoshop.

Even long-time users can find it hard to keep up, especially in areas that aren't your speciality.For instance, I use Photoshop fairly extensively as an image editor for my photography. But when it comes to Photoshop's text manipulating capabilities, I'm behind the curve.If you want to use Photoshop to a degree even approaching it's potential, you need help. Thank Buddha, there are lots of good books being written about Photoshop and how to use it. Among those written specifically to educate users how to handle type and type effects, Photoshop Type Effects Visual Encyclopedia from New Riders is one of the best and deserves a spot on your bookshelf.Author Roger Pring sets forth to inspire, inform, and teach in his book designed to turn on your creativity where type designing is concerned.In the first section of the book, Pring lays out basic information explaining the various ways to work with type in Photoshop. In the later part of the first section, we see real-world examples of type at work, including many examples of signs and signage.This book is called an encyclopedia after all, and the second section includes 72 different effects with step-by-step instructions so you can try them out. And many of the effects include alternatives with the instructions.The effects are grouped into categories, like reflective effects, atmospheric effects, lighting effects, simulations, and mood effects.There's also a very good appendix at the back of this book showing page after page of type with Photoshop filters applied, so you can see and compare what different filters do.One way to increase our productivity in Photoshop is to learn to use Photoshop's built-in shortcuts. We know that keeping our hands on the keyboard is more efficient than switching to the mouse for things like changing tools and views. So there is a complete listing of all Photoshop's shortcuts at the end of the book.The book also includes a CD filled with all the various effects samples, and a collection of about 20 Photoshop 'actions.'If you want to learn more about handling type in Photoshop, pick up a copy of Photoshop Type Effects Visual Encyclopedia.

The book is packed with a wealth of different effects that are breathtaking and as I read it it conjured up all sorts of ideas as to where I wanted to use the effects. The author gives excellent instruction in how to create the effects but does assume the reader has a working knowledge of Photoshop.

With the exception of a handful of other books on specific artists (The John Coltrane Reference and Ellingtonia for example), Chris is without peer when it comes to the most comprehensive, detailed recording histories of some of the most important jazz artists there have ever been. That is why my title is \\"This is it.\\" If you want the best, most complete, and painstakingly accurate discography (including the unreleased and live recordings) of Cannonball Adderley, you have no other choice.

And The Secret Battle is outstanding, in a class with Henri Barbusse, Under Fire andBao Ninh, The Sorrow of War.On the face of it, it is a simple story of a young man who serves his country faithfully and well in the trenches of Gallipoli and France during World War I, experiencing the nightmare of boredom, heroism, terror, exhilaration, overarching anxiety, mood swings, confusion, disease, especially dysentery, digging and more digging while witnessing death upon seemingly random death.Harry is loyal, truthful and brave, and serves his country well, even returning to battle after being seriously wounded and being offered a staff position safe in England. But he goes out again to be with his unit, and this time the accumulated horrors and nightly nightmares make him stop in the middle of a battle and return to a dugout where he is met by another officer, ironically one he earlier upbraided for cowardliness in the field when they were in Gallipoli together. Harry is court-martialed and, although mercy is recommended (he is still only 23 and has an unblemished record), none is shown; and he is shot. The novel ends with the powerful indictment of the entire affair: \\"That is the gist of it: that my friend Harry was shot for cowardice - and he was one of the bravest men I ever knew.\\" This is a truly fine work,indeed a timeless creation, worthy of a much wider contemporary readership."},{"Title":"The Secret Battle","review":"This book really gave a good example of how a soldier thinks and does some of the things he does while in a war zone. His mind works in some really weird ways he will remember these experiences the rest of his days and probably never tell them to anyone just keeping it to himself.

Even my Criminal Law text was better than this book was.As the other reviwer expressed, the text is extremely wordy. I feel that the author could have simplified it somewhat--after all Juvenile Justice is a 2000-level class at my university; not a postgraduate class. The information contained in the book is not bad, but the subject could have been made so much more interesting, and the entire book could have been shortened by a couple hundred pages without too much important information being deleted.I've kept all my other CCJ texts for future reference, but this book went back to the bookstore for cash on buyback day."},{"Title":"The Juvenile Justice System: Delinquency, Processing, and the Law, Fourth Edition","review":"As with the other reviewers the book is extremely wordy.

It just had too much information per chapter, just page after page of text."},{"Title":"Frog and Toad Together","review":"Frog and Toad have been around for years - I think of these asthe first series books my older children read. Once a child startsreading (with Frog and Toad Are Friends), the second, third and fourth books are welcome friends themselves.This book, published in 1971, is the second of four. Toad is a bit negative and nervous, and worries about rules, while Frog is often cheerful and dedicated to alleviating Toad's fears and doubts.&quot;A List&quot; is a funny story remembered long after reading it - Toad has a list of things to do, and anything not on the list can't be done. He loves to do something, then cross it off. But what happens when your list blows away, and &quot;run after the list&quot; wasn't even on the list. Worse, you can't remember what else was on the list. Frog is such a good friend, he just sits quietly with Toad as he struggles to figure out what to do.In &quot;The Garden,&quot; Toad would like to have a garden like Frog has, and with Frog's encouragement, he starts one. He tries directing the garden to grow, until Frog (hearing all that shouting) gives him some advise on how to nurture a garden.&quot;Cookies&quot; is probably one of the best stories. Frog and Toad make cookies, and they are so good that they can't stop eating them. They determine its about will power, and in the end they end up with no cookies &quot;but we have lots and lots of will power.&quot; Frog says.&quot;Dragons and Giants&quot; is about Frog and Toads fears and how they deal with them. &quot;We are not afraid!&quot; Frog and Toad screamed at the same time. A funny story that children will like.The last story &quot;The Dream&quot; is a bit deep - Toad is asleep and has a dream about starring in a play, while Frog sits in the audience and shrinks almost to non-existence.The stories are short, sweet and about friendship, but in a simple manner. Drawings of Frog and Toad are on almost every page, and are detailed enough to warrant a lengthy view and some comments from young readers. The words are understandable and readable enough for very young readers, yet they manage to hold a story with an amusing message. riendship, but in a simple manner.

I am 9 years old. The book that I read is Frog and Toad Together. It is by Arnold Lobel. The stories are called the List, the Garden, Cookies, and Dragons and Giants. The last story is &quot;The Dream.&quot; The story I liked is Dragons and Giants. I like that one because Frog and Toad think they were not brave. So they end up being brave together.I like the book because it was cool reading about Frog and Toad. I think little boys and girls will like this book. I would give this book five stars.

To this day (32 years old now) I can still remember the book like it was yesterday. They were good friends experiencing everyday dilemas. Frog and Toad were my childhood favorites."},{"Title":"Frog and Toad Together","review":"There's something refreshing about a children's book that doesn't seem desperate for your attention: no bright colors, no flaps to flip, no embossed glitter, not even a rhyme, for pete's sake. Yes, Arnold Lobel's Frog and Toad books are a different creature altogether -- awash in the Grumpy Old Man color palette, from Cigar to Pool Table -- and filled with odd little stories that cannot be read aloud without summoning the spirit of Walter Matthau.So why have these unlikely characters have become regulars in my son's bedtime reading rotation? Maybe it's the grown-up, wise quality of the stories: though written simply, and always possessing great morality and sweetness, there is a worldly little undercurrent, like a secret joke that young readers can't quite figure out, but want to understand. This opaque quality is like catnip to a toddler: the mystery of adulthood right there on the page, so tantalizingly close, but still, so confounding!Frog is the upbeat one; Toad the darker, pondering one. While other reviewers have attempted to link them to everything from Buddhism to Catholicism -- I'll stick with the Odd Couple reference, if I may.These two are not friends DESPITE their differences, but BECAUSE of them (a nice lesson for kids to absorb, though it's never presented as a Lesson, of course) spending every waking minute together, exploring the woods and discussing the meaning of life (and cookies). Behind the scenes, you just KNOW they smoke pipes, drink Darjeeling, wear tweed and watch plenty of PBS (especially the British Comedies).You'll find yourself taken aback at the level of sophistication Lobel manages to convey while never actually going over the child's head: \\"The List,\\" for example, hilariously mocks our grown-up obsession with Getting Things Done, while \\"Cookies\\" discusses the pitfalls and difficulties of relying on willpower, something both you and your child will be able to nod in agreement with. \\"Dragons and Giants\\" addresses real fears in a reassuring and funny way, as the pair runs for their lives from predators while insisting they are \\"very brave!\\" \\"The Dream\\" is the most philosophical of all -- Toad dreams he is a singing, dancing superstar while his friend, Frog, shrinks down to nothingness.Five stories in total are presented here, something I would normally shy away from (what with my 2-year old audience) but Lobel manages to make it work. Even more astounding, this book can hold said 2-year old's interest while coming from the old school of \\"more text than pictures.\\" Maybe there is just so much to ponder in these comforting pages that a slow, relaxed read is just the ticket."},{"Title":"Frog and Toad Together","review":"This is the first book and tape for me and my five year old son. On a whim, I finally decided to get one from the library this past weekend. I vaguely remembered reading Frog & Toad as a child, but couldn't remember any of the specific stories.We are having SO much fun listening to these stories! The stories are so delightful, and my son is really enjoying it too. I think we were both pleasantly surprised to hear it and to experience listening to an audiotape for a change instead of our usual \\"mommy read a book\\" routine. Of course, the occasional music (which is oh so perfect in how it depicts what's going on in the story....particularly for moments depicting light moments, and also those depicting danger) and the author's tone of the voice are what add to already great adventures in the book.The first day we listened to it, we had so much fun that we played it about 3 more times in a row. My son asks for us to listen/read the story every night.I agree with one other reviewer who said the author's narration (voice, tone, etc) is perfect for the story.My son loves all the stories, although for The Dream story, he looks a little perplexed, so I told him it's a story about a dream and most dreams don't make sense.In \\"A List\\", he loves the part where Toad says \\"Blah\\". And he also loves when earlier in that story, you can hear the sound of a door opening as Toad leaves his house on his way to see Frog. My son just turns to me and grins from ear to ear.For the \\"Cookies\\" story, he loves to hear the crunch of the cookie as Toad take that first bite at his own house before he goes to Frog's. He also enjoys hearing Toad tell Frog all the different ways that they can get into the box.His very favorite line in the book though is in \\"Dragons and Giants\\", when the snake comes out the cave and says, \\"Hello Lunch\\". We both crack up over time....and sometimes rewind it a few times :-)Like all the other reviewers mentioned, this is definitely a wonderful book about friendship. It was also interesting to read many reviewers note how there are so many real-life learning examples in it for adults. So true.Of all the books we've read, this is by far the one that has engaged my son the most, which is saying a lot since he has about 15 Thomas books and is usually preoccupied with those.This is I definitely have to get the other books from the collection. Definitely a classic.Happy reading everyone :-)"},{"Title":"Frog and Toad Together","review":"The Frog and Toad books were favorites of my daughters when they were young.

Frog and Toad are together in five featured stories including A List, The Garden, Cookies, Dragons and Giants, and The Dream.The stories are simple, but even in this world of computer games, Pixar and pop-up books, they catch a child's attention. A List features Toad doing his first To Do list. It is a nice way to talk to a child about being organized, but being flexible if things go wrong (Toad's list blew away, but he couldn't run after it because chasing his list wasn't on his list). The Garden is good about illustrating patience while watching seeds grow. Cookies is a funny story about will power. Dragons and Giants illustrates friendship and bravery. And the last story, The Dream is another story about friendship.Whether you use the stories as springboards for teaching tools or just to enjoy, they are wonderfully and simply illustrated and the story flows gently."},{"Title":"Frog and Toad Together","review":"Classic book to have in your child's library!Great short stories that have wit and humor for all ages to enjoy!I loved all Frog and Toad stories growing up and now my sons seem to love them just as much!A Must Have and it won't be a regret!"},{"Title":"Frog and Toad Together","review":"The Frog and Toad series teaches kids simple lessons with easy stories and cute graphics.

The stories are simple with a central theme - do good for others, treat your friends with respect, help your firends when they need help, laugh, and aporach life with adventure. These are great virtues to instill in young minds. If the books were made in cardboard stock, Teah would be even more happy with them - as it is she frequently grabs one of them when it's time for her bedtime story - and great bedtime stories they are.

This book contains two of our family's favorite stories: \\"A List\\" and \\"Cookies.\\" \\"A List\\" is the first story. One morning, while still in bed, Toad makes a list of all the things he must do that day. As you read this one, you'll recognize people you know (or have known). \\"The Garden\\" is the second story and is quite precious. Toad plants flower seeds and is impatient to see them grow. As usual, he puts himself through much in order to accomplish the inevitable. \\"The Cookies\\" is a great story for those of us who are cookie monsters. The two friends try to figure out how NOT to eat the delicious cookies Toad has just baked. Priceless. \\"Dragons and Giants\\" is next. This story is about being brave...a real challenge for these two fellows. Last, but not least, is \\"The Dream.\\" This story is about ego and has an important lesson for all of us about what's important in life.Again, the accompanying audio tape for Frog and Toad Together with Arnold Lobel as storyteller is a must.

Frog is the wiser one with Toad being the one with more silly ideas. As usual we have five stories which are not related to each other. In the first Toad decides to write a list of everything he will do that day and he does not deviate from it until he looses the list, which creates quite the problem. Next Frog gives Toad some seeds to plant his own garden and Toad is very impatient for them to grow. He talks to them, yells at them, sings to them, reads them stories, plays music etc. all to no avail. The third story has Frog and Toad with a freshly baked bowlful of cookies which they can't stop eating and they try to come up with a way to make the cookies inaccessible so they can no longer eat anymore and make themselves sick. The fourth story has Frog and Toad wanting to be brave like the heroes in fairy tales so they take a walk up a dangerous mountain and encounter various dangers along the way running quickly back home and feeling quite brave. Finally Toad has a dream where he can do all sorts of performing arts in a theatre where Frog is watching him.

It has now been reissued, with restored plates for Seredy's superb illustrations. The book was neither a Caldecott winner nor Honor Book, and was not a Newbery winner nor Honor Book. Seredy did win the Newbery Medal in the 1930s for her reworking of Hungarian myth in The White Stag, and her novel The Singing Tree was a Newbery Honor book in 1940. As to A Tree for Peter itself: I remember encountering the book in elementary school, likely in the fifth grade, but whether I came upon myself, was introduced to it by my sympathetic teacher or even more sympathetic public librarian, I cannot recall. What I can recall vivdly is being overwhelmed by the pathos of the tale and knowing intuitively that this was an allegory. Reading it again in adulthood, it seems almost -- almost! -- to teeter into sentimentality, but such is Kate Seredy's absolute conviction that the book avoids it, and becomes a manifestation of Christian teaching. One may remark, too, that the book is very short -- as, it seems, books about true goodness almost always are.

It's about a kid who changes his community and helps others conquer poverty. It's a beautiful story."},{"Title":"A Tree for Peter","review":"This book tells a great Christmas story. Its message is one of hope and is particularly powerful for someone for whom life isn't going so well. It's an example of how faith and believing in the goodness of God through times of deprivation can lead to wonderful outcomes when continued. I haven't re-read it recently, so I don't recall how much of this message is stated outright and how much is through symbolism (some definitely is symbolism), but that's what I recall about the message. It's a story for children through adults who want to be inspired at Christmastime. I hope we find time to re-read it as a family this Christmas!Background: My wife remembers this book from Christmas visits as a child with an elderly couple (their \\"Adopted Grandparents\\"). Years later, the elderly woman, Rosamond, wanted to give a copy of this book to our family and other relatives. She found it was out of print, but with the local book store obtained permission to make photocopies which she gave that Christmas. It's about 6 years later now, Rosamond has passed away, and the photocopy we received from her wasn't very good quality.

The story is powerful to all times and all ages, but is also historically a wonderful introduction to the human face of the Depression era- with the mix of courage, hope, and struggle through adversity that is so often forgotten in this era. And, the values of community, family, honorable behavior and giving back something to make the world a better place are somehow woven into a story that is never preachy, never sappy, or sacharine.

One wrote back to say that the book was &quot;too dated&quot; and &quot;too narrow in its viewpoint.&quot; I think they were referring to the Christ-like character that Peter meets. Although I am not myself a practicing Christian, I find *their* view far too narrow, and I fear that one of the best children's books of all time will remain out of print until that view changes.

In this time of material prosperity in America, so many of us have no experience of those days when a few moments of kind companionship, a new spade for a fatherless little boy, or the gift of a small tree might all be treasures which could change the world.

Still, if you go into a book with lowered expectations, you can only be delighted when you find them to be baseless. My experiences with some of the early Caldecott winning books, like \\"Mei Li\\", have sometimes ranged from gagging horror to outright shock. Looking at \\"Mei Li\\", I wasn't hopeful. It was written originally in 1939. It takes place in China with a Chinese heroine. All signs seemed to say that this book had prime racism potential. So imagine my delight and astonishment when I discovered it to be a fair treatment of a rural Chinese family existing in the 1930s. Sure, it had some elements here and there that I would have liked to have corrected, but on the whole it's a sure-footed interesting book. One of those rare Caldecott winners you can still read to your little ones today.Mei Li is not at all pleased. Her brother San Yu is going to the New Year Fair in the city and, because she is a girl, Mei Li must stay home. Fortunately, she's a fairly enterprising little lass and by bribing her brother with her lapis-blue marble she's able to convince him to take her with him to town as well. Once there she gives some money to a begger girl and partakes of the splendors of the city. After competing with her brother to show him that girls can do just as much as boys can, she stumbles across a fortune teller. The man predicts that she will rule over a kingdom, a fate which even the normally optimistic Mei Li has some doubts about. After dressing up, playing with toys, and escaping from realistic flying kites she returns to her home with her brother and uncle. That night, she greets the Kitchen God and is told that her home is her kingdom and in it everyone is her loyal loving subject. Says Mei Li with a bit of common sense, \\"It will do for a while, anyway\\".It's an odd kind of story, really. The narrative jumps wildly from place to place to place. One minute Mei Li's being held upside down by a female acrobat and the next she's created a crown out of her green marble and is prancing about like a princess. Her brother, San Yu, is also a realistically cruel older brother. In fact, he doesn't seem to much care what or where his sister gets to. This guy sneers, mocks, jeers, and generally makes his little sister's life a misery. Pretty realistic stuff. For her part, Mei Li is the ultimate likable protagonist. There's nothing she does that other little girls wouldn't do in her place. Along with that, she never really gets particularly upset with her older brother.I was a little surprised to find that the author and illustrator of this book were one and the same. Where the plot and narrative of this book is lightheared and wild, the pictures convey that silliness but also have a wry realism about them. Everything here is drawn in black and white. This is a real pity when you consider that Mei Li goes about carrying three brightly colored marbles, \\"one lapis blue, one coral red, and one jade green\\". It would have been nice to see those bright stones, as well as the colors that obviously pervade the Fair. The book also contains some incredibly realistic figures. Mei Li is often drawn with a deftly shaded and sly face, both adorable and pitiable depending on the situation. Sometimes the pictures in this book are cartooney. Sometimes they're blasts of brief shocking realism. For my own part, I think the best part of this book is the moment when an old priest lays below a bridge urging the children above to, \\"Ring the bell with a penny, and you will have money for all the year\\". In the picture, the priest lies with huge piles of pennies around him. His face is undeniably European and one clawed hand reaches out to greedily gather the money to him. I couldn't help but wonder if Handforth was trying to make a statement of some sort with this picture. Probably not, but it's fun to speculate all the same.So is the book offensive? I'm probably not the one to ask. I don't know my Chinese history particularly well, so I can't say whether or not the book is a faithful and accurate reprentation of the China of that time. The book doesn't really mention the name of the city presented here, so there's that. There is a map of the town, Mei Li's home, and its approximate closeness to the Great Wall of China, which is interesting. But the pictures do not promote stock Oriental images and the text is fully respectful of its characters. On the whole, I would say that this is a fair balanced book with a great deal of love poured into it.If you find that you would like to read an older Caldecott winning book, but you're not entirely certain where to start, \\"Mei Li\\" is probably your best bet. At once winning, charming, and altogether intelligent, it still has the power to interest the children that read it. Maybe the best word of all for it is: timeless. Sure, it's definitely set in 1939 China, but the images and story presented here will last for all time. A surprisingly beautiful little picture book."},{"Title":"Mei Li","review":"This book truly does describe a time and place. Mei Li is often told that she's just a girl and not valued. In the end, her family comes looking for her and tells her that she is their princess when she lives within the walls of their house. I hesitated to read it to my Chinese daughter, but I do think it tells the tale of cultural values from long ago -- something she should understand sooner or later."},{"Title":"Mei Li","review":"This children's book tells the story of a little Chinese girl who slips away from her family to see the big city of Peking (now, Beijing) in the 1930s. The book won the 1939 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a children's book, the second book to win that award. As mention in the criticism from &quot;Horn Book,&quot; it is a little wordy and forced and children of today may have not relate to Mei Li too much. But it is a nice introduction to a culture of a different time and can lead to interesting discussions between parents and their children.In addition, it is a book that should be on the shelf of any serious student of children literature."},{"Title":"Mei Li","review":"Thomas Handforth spent time in China and had become aware of the differences between boy's privileges and girl's expectations. He is able to show that girls can generally do what boys can do in this book. He is recognized for advancing the role of women in children's literature. Another book of his, Faraway Meadow, is a clever study on learning to accept diversity. It is unfortunate that he died prematurely and was unable to write further. The world may have become more tolerant earlier in our history if he had been able to continue influencing it with his writing."},{"Title":"CORAL'S REEF","review":"This story is about two children who have a wonderful fantasy adventure with several ocean animals.

This is the preferred alternative to the revolving door of expensive executives hired from outside to effect miraculous change.The book makes its case for acceleration pools in five sections. The first section argues that organizations should develop their internal leadership \\"bench strength\\" and suggests how to identify high potential leaders and provide them with growth opportunities. The argument is strengthened by several cases studies and identification of organizational culture factors that contribute to the success of acceleration pools. Part Two contains a single chapter with advice about identifying high potential participants. Most of this advice is in the form of general strategies for identifying participants, such as optimizing the size of the pool and considering morale effects of various inclusion and exclusion techniques. It would be a stronger if it included more about competencies and how to assess them accurately to select the best acceleration pool members.Part Three discusses how to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses--seen as developmental needs--of acceleration pool members. This section does discuss specific competencies and how to assess their mastery. There is also an insightful discussion of the \\"derailers,\\" such as arrogance, avoidance, and perfectionism, that impede employee development. Part Four may be the book's most useful section. It describes specific strategies for developing leaders. The focus is on providing these opportunities to members of the acceleration pool, but most of these approaches can be used independently of the pool concept. The possibilities organized into developmental assignments, short-term experiences, formal training and executive coaching.Part Five revisits the acceleration pool concept and fine-tunes the book's advice for implementing pools with the best chances for success. This is primary political advice for obtaining support from key stakeholders and helping a new acceleration pool program get a toehold before it has had time to prove itself.I recommend this book for anyone interested in developing leadership abilities, either for others or in themselves. Some caution is needed when implementing an acceleration program in government contexts given formal requirements for \\"fair and open competition\\" for opportunities that may lead to promotion. This can be done, however, as several of the authors' case studies illustrate."},{"Title":"Grow Your Own Leaders: How to Identify, Develop, and Retain Leadership Talent","review":"&quot;Grow Your Own Leaders&quot; is an excellent resource for any manager or executive who has a desire to increase his/her reputation as well as the talent pool and bottom line of his/her organization.

Philosophy is one of the fields in which my education continued in some depth (particularly in regards to those fields that relate closely to theology), and yet for over 20 years, this text, 'Philosophy Made Simple', has remained on my shelf as a well-used ready reference.The book is a collaboration between two authors, Richard Popkin and Avrum Stroll; they each wrote roughly half the book. The book is arranged topically, according to the following topics:Ethics (Stroll)Political Philosophy (Stroll)Metaphysics (Popkin)Philosophy of Religion (Popkin)Theory of Knowledge (Popkin)Logic (Stroll)Contemporary Philosophy (Popkin and Stroll)The largest, and perhaps most interesting, section is Contemporary Philosophy. This is subdivided into pieces dealing largely with Pragmatism, Existentialism, and Philosophical Analysis.Within each section, the pattern of discussion generally proceeds historically, from the pre-Socratics or Greek classics to the present. Ethics, for example, begins with classical theories of ethics dealt with by Plato and Aristotle, and proceeds through the various Greek schools (Hedonism, Cynicism, Stoicism), to philosophical Christian ethics, to Spinoza, Utilitarianism, Kant, then finally more modern ideas of subjectivism and objectivism, natualism and the like. Some topics begin more recently (Philosophy of Religion begins with Hume, for example; Epistemology begins with Descartes, but circles back to earlier ideas).The topic on Logic looks as both philosophical ideas as well as general tools for applying logical analysis. However, this does not serve as a logical 'mechanics' primer, and apart from the very basic ideas of logic, the scope of this book is too much a survey to get into much depth.The last section, on Contemporary Philosophy, deals with philosophy of the past 100 to 150 years. It begins with William James, and proceeds through to Dewey, Russell, Wittgenstein, Kierkegaard, and other people and topics of current interest. Philosophy is a slow-moving discipline in comparison to science and technology-driven fields, yet there is room for further developments that this text misses. On the other hand, it is hard to account for the whole of current philosophical discourse, for it is often only after a passage of time and analysis that the crucial ideas and development are recognised in hindsight.As the authors state in their introduction, almost all of us have philosophical ideas, even if we don't really know it or call these thoughts philosophical. It is important to that all members of a society have an idea about the functioning of that society. This text is a basic, accessible overview of the key ideas of philosophy, and will serve those in any field, even the beginning philosophy and theology student, well as a guide and reference."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"Do not interpret the \\"Made Simple\\" part of the title to mean \\"over-simplified\\" or \\"simplistic.\\" This book is a lucid and able survey of philosophy at an intermediate level. The seven sections cover ethics, political philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of religion, the theory of knowledge, logic, and contemporary philosophy. (The only major topic missing is esthetics.) In doing philosophy one is engaging in a serious, long-range conversation with past and present thinkers in an attempt to understand ourselves and the nature of the world in which we live. With this book as a foundation, one could go on to read advanced texts in philosophy and the technical literature. For instance, one could study Samuel Alexander's magnum opus Space, Time, and Deity, and not get lost in the thickets of thought. I highly recommend Philosophy Made Simple as a sturdy foundation for building your own philosophy."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"Don't be put off by the title.

Today, I use it for several of the courses that I teach. One is the Business Management Course which is a part of a degree offered by the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand. Another course is for computer specialists at Whitireia Community Polytechnic. In both cases the students do not have a strong background in either ethics or classical studies; however, they need to study ethics and to relate it to the work that they will be doing in their careers. I have found the Ethics section of Philosophy Made Simple to be the most practical book to use. Students can understand the text and it is easy to generate examples for use both in class and in their assignments. Once the elements of classical ethics are appreciated it is a small step to take them further into epistemology and political philosophy. If the text was to be revised again, I would suggest more on the language schools of philosophy (Ryle et al) and on the philosophy of science (including the philosophy of biology). Perhaps this would be best left for a further volume. I am very pleased to recommend this book to beginning students, and to others who would like an understandable outline of an important subject."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"As a first year student of Philosophy I decided that I would try to find a book that would give me an idea of the general aspects of Philosophy. In turn I came to the conclusion that I would purchase this book, and boy was I glad I did. After reading this book I had a profound idea of what I was getting into. Going into my studies I had a lot of confidence. Philosophy made simple will introduce to you all the different types of Philosophy, and the most renowned and influential characters that have changed the world we live in. You will also become aquianted with multiple sects and beliefs systems that derived from Philosophy. Even if you have attained a great understanding of philosophy, this book still places so much useful information concisely that the scholarly will also be impressed. So if you wish to get a head start as a beggining Philosopher purchase this book. For the scholar or teacher I highly recommend this book aswell."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"I was a Biology major in college. Before reading this book I had NO idea of anything pertaining to philosophy. I'm very glad I stumbled upon this book. I don't think there is any book out there that makes it easier to understand philosophy than this one. It explains things in simple language, one that the lay person can understand without having a degree in philosophy. If you are interested in philosophy and know nothing about it, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"The main aim of the author is to introduce philosophy to the reader by simply showing him/her that philosophy is really just what a person \\"thinks\\" about something. He then talks about different issues and states what different philosophers \\"think\\" about these issues. I think this is a very effective way of introducing philosophy to those that have not studied it. However, the title of the book is misleading because it is very hard to introduce Kant's ideas (for example) in a simple way. This is not due to some fault of the writer, but because of the fact that some philosophers thought of things in a very complicated way. I didnt give it five stars because there are a number of important philosophers that the author never mentions. Maybe he was trying to keep it as brief as possible, but an extra thirty pages wouldnt have done any harm!"},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"One of the problems with reading philosophy is that no matter what you're reading you're always expected to know everything that came before it. For those of us to which philosophy is not a vocation but an avocation, reading the entire canon from Plato through the 21st century just isn't feasible. When you're reading Marx and he starts talking about Hegel, for example, who has time to go back and read everything by Hegel just to figure out what Marx is talking about? That's why you need a good cheat sheet, which is what this book provides. The second function of a book like this is that by providing a general overview of the history of philosophy, it gives one the opportunity to select the philosophers and schools of thought that interest them, so one can pursue these areas through further study. This book is also quite successful on that score. It not only allows you to pick and choose those thinkers who pique your interest, it also generates a genuine enthusiasm for the study of philosophy. I walked away from this book with a list of at least a dozen specific works that I look forward to reading.I have tried other surveys on philosophy, some too deep (Coppleston's nine-volume A History of Philosophy), some too shallow (Will Durant's The Story of Philosophy). Philosophy Made Simple is the Baby Bear of this genre--not too hot, not too cold, just right. It does an admirable job of taking extremely complex theoretical subject matter and explaining it in language suitable for about a college undergrad reading level. I never felt like the writing was too tediously textbooky, nor did I feel like it had been dumbed down for me, &agrave; la Philosophy for Idiots. This book is technically not a history, but rather is divided up into subject areas--metaphysics, ethics, politics, and so on--each of which receives a roughly chronological treatment. There's also a chapter on logic which feels more like a math textbook, and was less interesting to me personally. The twentieth century definitely gets sparse coverage, possibly because there's just too many people to cover, or because time has yet to tell which recent philosophers deserve to stand here among the ancients. The section on contemporary philosophy (which starts about 1850) only covers a handful of subjects: the pragmatism of William James and John Dewey; the logical atomism of Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein; existentialism from Kierkegaard through Heidigger and Sartre, up to the deconstructionism of Derrida; and a little bit on Richard Rorty. Overall I enjoyed reading this book, found it valuable in its breadth and clarity, and will surely use it as a reference in the future. If more people knew about this book, perhaps philosophy wouldn't be so frightening to the general American reader."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"How simple could it be? Well, it isn't particularly, but it is more simple when you have this book. I first read this text as a freshman in junior college in 1972... Ugh. But I've referred to it ever since then, first as an introduction and later a quick resource for contrast and comparison. It was wonderful, and over the years it has been on my reference shelf and lent out to friends, students and my kids again and again. When I recently lost my original copy I was surprised to find that it was still in print, and didn't hesitate to order a replacement. The viewpoints of each of the classic authors represented my not be detailed enough for every inquiry, but this book helps in overcoming the hesitation you may have when you want/need to read the writers for yourself. So, for this reader, as a survey of major philosophical views and concepts, this book is wonderful."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"I don't think there is any way that philosophy can be made simple; but it is possible to make it less difficult, and authors Popkin and Stroll have done that with this book. They cover seven major areas of philosophy: ethics, political philosophy, metaphysics, the philosophy of religion, knowledge, logic and contemporary philosophy. In each area they take the reader gingerly along, guiding the reader through the history of each philosophy, what the topic specifically is concerned with, who the major thinkers were, and the various details of different philosophical schools. For each major stream of thought, the authors also provide a counterpoint from opposing thinkers. This gives a great balance to the book. Each chapter also has a short reading list of books related to that chapter's topic. After reading this book, I feel I have a better grasp on the major topics in philosophy, their major proponents, and the controversies surrounding each school of thought. My only beef with the book is the authors' use of the \\"he/she\\" convention to avoid appearing sexist. I found myself slowing down every time this occurred, which was often. Other than that, this is a really good book to read to get familiar with the major topics of philosophy, and to whet the appetite for further exploration."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"I took two philosophy courses about 15 years ago when I was doing my undergraduate work. When I became interested in philosophy recently I found Philosophy Made Simple. For a mere ten dollars this book gives one a terrific introduction to philosophy. Don't think just because it has \\"Made Simple\\" in the title that it is somehow overly dumbed down for the readers. The book conatains quite a few excerpts from some of the major thinkers in the history of philosophy. This book also gives one an overview of a number of different areas of philosophy which will be great for someone like me, who doesn't even know where to start. You can then easily pull names of philosopers from whatever area you are interested in out of the book and begin reading their individual works as I have. Overall a great read."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"I am reading Philosophy Made Simple for a discussion class on the basics of philosophy. The book covers the fundamentals of philosophy over the centuries in simple straight-forward language. It is easy to understand. Although it covers most all the big names in philosophy, occasionally some fairly important people are not mentioned. It is not comprehensive. It does have a nice breezy (but not condescending) tone. I will keep it for my library."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"as always, fast shipping and good condition for a used book. the content of the book it self is very informative but you should read something on a more introductory level first."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"Philosophy can be very difficult to comprehend especially if one has never delved into it before. Philosophy Made Simple is a book that attempts to aid the philosophically ignorant in understanding. That being said, this book does not necessarily make philosophy \\"simple\\", because I don't think such a thing can be done. (Many times while reading I found myself amazed at how advanced some philosophical ideas still were even though they were being made \\"simple\\"). However, the authors do their best, and succeed in my opinion, in bringing philosophy down to novice.My only complaint with the book is that they failed to include a section on Philosophy of Mind. But, this is a very miniscule complaint and no doubt others felt that even other disciplines of philosophy should have been included. Therefore, the authors would have had to leave out some sections regardless and should not be penalized for such.So, if one is relatively new to philosophy and desires to immerse themselves in it then I highly recommend Philosophy Made Simply. One will without a doubt learn above average from said book."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"I bought this for my school's debate team and while it is covers a lot of information, it is hard to find specific philosophies.

While the book is very thorough, it gets a little boring, and I kept wondering when it would discuss the contemporary stuff. Well it turns out that is only covered in the last like 10 pages, unfortunately. I ended up skimming large portions of the book, which is easy to do because critical sections are highlighted in bold. Overall pretty good, but if you're looking for a quick summary of philosophy, this isn't super quick."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"While Philosophy Made Simple does a great job in incorporating many historical philosophers in order to give a general account of the history of philosophy, what made the book such a great textbook for philosophy students (including myself) is its focus on the argumentation. First, the book goes over the arguments made by the philosophers, and it elaborates these arguments with sufficient clarity. Afterwards, the book then goes over the criticisms (either made by the authors or by some philosophers) on the arguments in such insightful matter by pointing out some of the serious problems of the arguments that I initially never thought of, and whenever I read over these criticisms I exclaim to myself (in my head) \\"Wow, I never really thought about it like that before!\\". To encounter this pattern of thinking for the first time was both exciting and inspiring, and it has motivated me to do more in philosophy. This is certainly one of the must read philosophy textbooks for beginners to expose them to the pattern of objective and critical thinking in respects to classical philosophical arguments."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"I purchased this book to get an overview and update since it has been so long since I studied philosophy. The authors present an excellent summary of the history and major facets of philosophy without burdening the reader with too much detail.

I recommend this book for anyone desiring to become familiar with and obtain a basic understanding of philosophy and its specialized vocabulary."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"In college a long time ago my nascent interest in philosophy was temporarily dimmed by a dull text. But it was positively sprightly compared to this book.The authors take an historical approach. If by \\"Simple\\" you expect \\"Introductory\\" then historical is not the right approach in any subject. (You wouldn't, for example, plow through all of Euclid's Geometry before learning decimal digits.) The result, for example, is that the second chapter deals with Politics. While important, political questions are hardly the most gripping that philosophy has to offer.Even as an introductory course in the history of philosophy, I can envisage a much better book than this one. It does have fine bibliographies at the end of each chapter, and would form a decent review book. There are a few amusing anecdotes, such as the one concerning a philosopher who testified about an auto accident.The last couple of chapters are better than the earlier ones would lead you to expect. The penultimate chapter deals mainly with deductive logic, and actually has exercises with answers. (If you enjoy this material, you will probably enjoy the more leisurely and thorough coverage given in \\"The Trivium\\" by Sister Miriam Joseph.) It also reviews fallacious reasoning. If you're going to read this book, read this chapter first (the authors seldom let the dullness from one chapter darken any other discussion, so you can read the chapters in almost any order), and perhaps you will be sufficiently armed to spot the fallacies that led, for example, Hume to conclusions he himself regarded as absurd. The final chapter deals with modern trends, which possibly interest the authors more than classical philosophy.Philosophy can change your life. This dry tome is unlikely to.

Since religion is a relatively recent phenomenon among mankind, the freedom to view life without it is an important feature of intellectual freedom that serves to release mankind from the false deceptions upon which most religions are based, to attract and retain followers (congregations)."},{"Title":"Philosophy (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","review":"The only problem I have with my order is that the seller did not list the edition/year of publication on my order.

Panentheism is slightly different from Pantheism, i have learned, in that it is the belief that EVERYTHING in the universe is an expression of God (emphasis on EXPRESSION, rather than on \\"He is in everything\\"). This belief is inserted in such subtle fashion, as all heresies are. What is heresy? It is false doctrine; it is unbiblical. The book of Titus warns us to rebuke a heretic once or twice and after this have nothing more to do with him, etc. Frankly I was almost taken in by some of it, so extremely subtle is it, and so warmly presented.So, while Norman Grubb had a few helpful things to say in certain chapters, such as What is Clear Guidance in Major Matters, and the corresponding chapter What is Clear Guidance in Minor Matters, I sadly cannot recommend either this book nor any of his others (except possibly the biography he wrote on Rees Howells). No current mainstream preacher/teacher or deceased mainstream preacher/teacher of good reputation has ever taught the beliefs of Norman Grubb, and this includes great men of God such as the Prince of Preachers C.H. Spurgeon and George Mueller (the latter whom Grubb mentions once in this book in reference to faith). Both would probably be appalled at some of Grubb's unbiblical teachings. If you do not have much knowledge of the numerous various heresies of the ages or are lacking in spiritual discernment then it would be best to brush up on this subject and save your money for something else.

It is also the story of a woman's triumph over Victorian ideas about a woman's place and over personal uncrtainties. Jane Addams became a leading humanitarian and spokesperson for women but she also led struggles which enhanced the notion of democracy in this country and the world. Ms. Addams did not see democracy as neoconservatives see it today. She was not a fighter for capitalism or Republican values but rather for participation and inclusion. She was also a crusader for world peace.Jane Addams and her colleagues were not like 21st century Americans. She was practically humorless and was moved by moral imperatives almost unknown to us. However, she, aside from being the \\"real thing\\", was famous for her kindness to immigrants and children.This book deals with her early life and her humanitarian efforts in the United States. It discusses the founding of Hull House, one of the first settlement houses in this country, and relates the operation of Hull House to the awakening of Addams' interest in many important causes.The book is a good read for those who are interested in women's history or in the history of reform and, indeed, radicalism in this country (for she was a radical). It is well researched and written and does not try to turn Addams into a midwestern Mother Teresa."},{"Title":"Teaching With Variety","review":"This book is sure to make you a better Sunday school teacher.

Adored by many, vilified by others, he has arrived on the scene of Venezuelan politics in a manner that has raised the ire of many in the world, especially the yellow regime that currently holds the reigns of power in Washington, D.C. Readers who are curious about Chavez will get a fairly detailed overview of his life in this book. The author is clearly biased towards Chavez, but given the nature of the western press these days, one can view this bias as a kind of historical countervailing power, an alternative to the diluted treatment of Venezuelan history that one is often confronted with. The author has spent much time in Venezuela, and has interviewed Chavez personally, and so readers can gain at least some confidence that the author knows what he is talking about.It is readily apparent when reading the book that the author feels that the policies and politics of Hugo Chavez should be understood in the context of the life and works of Simon Bolivar, the popular revolutionary of the early nineteenth century who was attempting to liberate some areas of South America from Spanish rule. The \`Bolivarian revolution', as it is now called, is one in which Chavez definitely wants to be identified with, and one that involves uniting the peoples of Latin America in order to counter the \\"imperial power of the north.\\" A community of nations and states will form this alliance, with priority given to the three areas that surround Venezuela, namely the Caribbean, the Amazon, and the Andes. This would also involve creating a military alliance, which Chavez viewed as a kind of \`Latin American Nato' (but not including the United States).The author describes in great detail the coup attempt on February 4, 1992 that was instigated and carried out by Chavez with the assistance of five army units. The coup was doomed from the start, for the government of President Carlos Andres Perez had found out about it a day earlier. Certainly a daring move by Chavez, and one that sheds considerable light on his personality, which is described by the author as extroverted, confrontational, and argumentative. Chavez apparently wanted to overthrow the Venezuelan government as far back as 1982, at which time he began organizing a group called the Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement. This group, called a \\"study circle\\" by the author, was supposed to be based on the teachings and philosophy of Ezequiel Zamora, Simon Bolivar, and Simon Rodriguez. Even with its emphasis on social and political philosophy, it is still difficult to view Chavez and other members of the Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement as being intellectuals. If they were, they were certainly of the Sartrian type, and believed that thoughts must be translated into action.One organization that is often mentioned in the western press these days is the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), which is usually characterized as a Marxist guerilla army, financed by drug money, and that is participating in the current civil war in Columbia. The author characterizes FARC as being an organization that is sympathetic with the Bolivarian views of Chavez, and that Chavez feels the same towards FARC, since Chavez wants to re-create the \\"Gran Columbia\\" of Bolivar: an alliance of Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. FARC has become apparently become a formidable force in Columbia, and its support by the Chavez government has antagonized the Columbian government. FARC is now considered to be a \\"terrorist organization\\" by the government of Alvaro Uribe Velez, which receives heavy support from the U.S. government (quoted as $3.9 billion dollars by the author). The author writes of the U.S. support of the attack against FARC in 1964 by the Columbian army, but does not give detailed evidence for this.And what of current U.S. involvement in the affairs of Venezuela? The author discusses in fair detail this involvement, but not as much as needed to make objective assessments as to the intentions of the U.S. government. The US does have access to the airports in the Dutch Antilles, which is offshore from Venezuela, and made requests (the author describes this as \\"putting pressure\\") on the Chavez government to allow flights over Venezuela as part of their \\"war on drugs\\" against Columbia. Chavez did not permit these flights, resulting in further antagonism between him and the US. As far as the coup attempt in 2002 against the Chavez government, the author cites a CIA intelligence brief as evidence that the US had prior knowledge of it. The author further claims that the coup leaders had the explicit consent from the US (the leaders having visited Washington several times), but he does not cite the detailed evidence for these claims. Apparently Miguel Angel Cortes, the Spanish minister for Ibero-American cooperation, revealed that as many as six phone calls were made to Otto Reich at the US State Department (who is a former US ambassador to Caracas), and that Reich was definitely supporting the coup plotters. The author also claims that the bishops of the Catholic Church in Venezuela were involved in the planning of the coup, but he does not cite evidence for this claim either. The author though gives the minute details of the coup as it unfolded, and how Chavez managed to regain control of the Venezuelan government.The reading of this book, the viewing of the political speeches of Chavez, and the perusal of the many blogs discussing Venezuelan politics certainly sheds light on the politics and ethical standards of Chavez. Even if one agrees with his political opinions, or even with his stand against the yellow regime of Washington DC, it must be remembered that he at one time did not hesitate to initiate the use of force. Extreme skepticism must therefore be applied to Chavez, as it must to every other living politician."},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"\\"Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution\\" by veteran journalist Richard Gott introduces us to the important struggle against neoliberalism being waged by the people of Venezuela and its charismatic leader, Hugo Chavez. This underreported story is told with skill, verve and clarity by Gott, whose first-hand reporting and intelligent historical analysis have combined to produce an engaging and fascinating book that should appeal to a wide audience.We learn that Chavez' roots in the Venezuelan countryside and his family's support of populist causes helped to shape his core values, including the belief that military power might be used to secure social and economic justice. Gott describes how the neoliberal policies of the 1980s and early 1990s first led to social unrest and then emboldened Chavez, whose first coup attempt while serving in the Venezuelan armed forces in 1992 proved to be unsuccessful. However, the phrase \\"por ahora\\" (for now) that Chavez uttered at his arrest thrust Chavez into the spotlight and captured the public's imagination. Eventually, the ongoing and widespread disgust with Venezuela's notoriously incompetent and corrupt government helped Chavez easily win election to the Presidency in 1998.At first glance, Chavez' Bolivarian Revolution resembles nothing more than a strong social/democratic state, wherein revenues from the national oil company allows the government to shower benefits onto its citizens. However, the Chavez administration's recognition of indigenous and minority rights and its substantive economic reforms belies a much more progressive agenda when compared with, say, the so-called social welfare governments of North America and Europe. Domestically, Chavez is seeking to improve the standard of living through an uniquely empowered form of citizenship; internationally, Chavez wants to create a political and military consortium that is dedicated to protecting the people and resources of South America from continuing exploitation by multinational corporations.Gott also compares and contrasts Chavez with his political ally Fidel Castro in order to differentiate the Venezuelan revolutionary experience with Cuba's. Whereas Castro had looked to the independence-minded Jose Marti for inspiration, Chavez draws upon Simon Bolivar to imagine an united South America. Interestingly, the Chavez/Castro relationship appears to be mutually reinforcing, so that while socialistic Cuba is striving to become more democratic, democratic Venezuela is working to become more socialistic.The analysis presented by Gott helps us understand that Chavez' challenge to U.S. hegemony in the hemisphere is very real, and in fact the election in December, 2005 of a socialist government in Bolivia suggests that the political dynamics may well have been permanently altered. Little wonder, then, why small-minded reactionaries such as Pat Robertson have no response to the Bolivarian Revolution than to call for its most outspoken leader's assassination. But if you are interested in getting the real story and in forming your own opinions, you are encouraged to read this timely and enlightening book. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"I'm of two minds on this book. On one hand, Gott is clearly an admirer of Chavez and he is a supporter of Chavismo, which colors his analysis. On the other hand, even for those who aren't favorably disposed to Chavez, the book is useful and interesting.Gott buys into the rhetoric of Chavismo without question. The U.S. is routinely described as an \\"Empire\\" that wants to \\"rule the world\\" (p. 13). It is okay to fault U.S. policy but there is little evidence it seeks to rule the world. He also buys into phony populist arguments such the assertion that foreign debt was \\"forced\\" on developing countries by international banks (p. 51). On the same page he admits Venezuela \\"rashly borrowed\\", well, was the Venezuelan government complicit in the debt run-up or not? You get the sense Gott knows better but just can't resist spouting knee-jerk populist rhetoric. He also exaggerates the U.S. role in the 2002 coup attempt, as Chavez also does. A CIA analysis is cited on page 223, but what it contains could have been gleemed from reading the Venezuelan press in the period before the coup. The U.S. certainly welcomed the coup but the evidence of active involvement is pretty thin.The book is interesting for the background it gives. The information on Chavez's formative years is useful in its own right. He is candid when he describes how some leftists have had falling outs with Chavez. Gott also explains why the opposition misjudged their support (and opposition to Chavez) by relying on polling data that didn't accurately sample the lower classes where support for Chavez is strongest.For people interested in Venezuela and Chavismo, it is a worthwhile read but don't expect much objectivity."},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"Gott's it is definitely not an unbiased and balance account, but it is one that would help you get the other view (although a tainted one some times). The book's alleged factual information is not accurate and its narrations are simplistic many times. The book lacks research and depth. For example a key event like the Coup de etat of April 11, 2002, has a very simplistic linear argument with a lot of controversial interpretations of the events, just read \\"Venezuela's 2002 Coup Revisited: The Evidence Two Years On By Francisco Toro\\" (you can Google it on the web). The later does allow the reader to realize how complex were the events that date and how much is still not clear. The Book editorial work was also lax, for example Heinz Dieterich Steffan is introduced as an Argentinean journalist, when he is German sociologist professor at the UAM in Mexico. This sort of mistakes undermines the book's credibility. However, the authors close encounters with Chavez are interesting enough to make the book an amenable read.Not withstanding, Gott does have insight on the region and is not as partisan as to be blind. Many of the criticisms he makes about the region are in many respects accurate and he has been following the region for many years. He has also shown he can do better research and more balance accounts of the events as he does in his Cuba: A New History; were at its end he writes a compelling portrait of the unjust and difficult conditions for Castro Cuba's opposition primordial organizations."},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"Gott is a veteran leftist British journalist, a Latin American specialist, who writes in a very clear and not ungraceful journalese style which I must say is very refreshing to read after just finishing a semester trying to read through dreadfully dull authors in grad school classes. The read is relatively quick.Perhaps the biggest point in the book is the insight provided about the opposition to Chavez, the people the American media portray as great heroes for democracy struggling against Chavez. This opposition almost exclusively comes from the remnants of the old discredited elites that had run the country into the ground before Chavez's election. After the overthrow of the military dictator General Marcos Perez Jimenez in 1958, the so-called Social Democratic party, Democratic Action(Spanish acronym AD) and the Christian Democrats (COPEI) agreed to set up a political system where they would share the spoils of the bureaucracy and effectively prevent any third parties from running for president.Carlos Andres Perez of AD was president of Venezuela during its economic high point, 1974-79. Venezuela nationalized foreign oil companies in 1976 but according to Gott the state run oil company was run as the fiefdom of its directors and its employees who seemed to have been a privileged class among Venezuelan workers. The vast majority of Venezuelans received very little from the abundant petrodollars of the 70's; a lot of the money was invested abroad or redistributed to the managers and employees of the company.. The government spent massively on infrastructure projects and used oil money to place grassroots supporters on the government payroll. The downward spiral of oil prices in the 1980's sent the economy into collapse by 1989. Andres Perez had previously denounced the International Monetary Fund as a genocidal tool against the poor of the third world but he reversed himself in early 1989 and started adopting the policies of that organization. He launched plans to privatize government owned industries, eliminate tariffs to protect small farmers, fire numerous public sector employees, and privatize the state-owned oil company. A hike in bus fares sent the residents of the shanty towns on the hills overlooking central Caracas down the hills to loot and riot. The military responded by moving into poor neighborhoods and often murdering anything that moved. Thousands were killed. This terrible riot/massacre was named the \\"Caracazo\\" in popular lingo. It scared to death Venzuela's largely white elite, this terrifying spontaneous uprising of Venezuela's largely dark-skinned poor.In the years following the Caracazo, the shantytowns in the big cities grew with new members from the country side and the elite kept getting richer and the poor poorer. Nationalist inclined military officers and civilians led by Chavez launched a coup in February 1992 against Perez. The coup failed but, Gott writes, Venezuela's elite was terrified: for one the masses of people appeared to be not unsympathetic to the coup. Gott quotes an interesting speech in Venezuela's congress after the corup by Rafael Caldera of COPEI who had been Venezuela's president from 1969-74 and was to be elected again in December 1994. Caldera seemed to almost endorse the coup: he stated that it was understandable that the masses of people would not rally to the government's defense in this coup attempt because the political system was run by corrupt elites and the masses were becoming more and more impoverished. Caldera, continued the privatization program, with the help of some leftists in his cabinet, Gott writes, such as Teodoro Petkoff, the founder of the party, Movement to Socialism. In 1993, Andres Perez was impeached for corruption and placed under house arrest.COPEI and AD were so discredited, according to Gott, that otherwise reasonably popular presidential candidates in 1998, such as COPEI's Irene Saez, saw their support in pre-election polls plummet to as low as two percent, when they decided to launch their presidential runs with the backing of COPEI or AD.Gott points out that Chavez, whatever the shortcomings he may have, is opposed by Venezuela's largely white elites because he has encouraged the country's poor, its marginalized black and brown people, to enter the political process. The Americans since 2001 have opposed him for pretty much the same reasons. The country's main labor confederation, the CTV, has mainly served as a subservient arm of the AD, and never has contained more than 12 percent of the workforce, usually the more elite workers. Chavez has inspired organizing efforts amongst the majority unskilled and informal sector workers, which scared CTV leader Carlos Ortega to such an extent that he collaborated in the April 2002 coup attempt. The protestors against Chavez are made up for the most part, of the country's small upper and middle classes.It seems that of all the measures which led the elite to conspire to launch the April 2002 coup attempt was Chavez's rollback of plans to sell off Venezuela's oil concerns to foreign companies. Such measures were part of 49 decrees Chavez launched in November 2001, which included a very small land reform. These were extremely mild Social Democratic gestures, but the elite media increased their vulgar screams about impending communist dictatorship to fever pitch. The basic concentration of wealth in the hands of the wealthy few was only being slightly affected but Venezuela's elites were quaking in their boots. Under the coordination of the business federation Fedecameras, the elite launched a coup with U.S. backing in April 2002 and an attempt to sabotage the oil industry in December 2002-January 2003.In Gott's last section he gives an overview of the \\"Missions,\\" different organizations in local areas, funded by profits from the state oil companies that provide to the masses literacy training, cheap food, health care, etc. .....to a large extent the book is interesting and nuanced and not afraid to portray some things discreditable to Chavez though I think his coverage of the incident with the Pemon Indians is inadquate, especially in covering Chavez's response to it."},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"A very well written book that reviews the life and achievements of one of the most controversial leaders of our time. Hugo Chavez is a remarkable revolutionist who the world is paying. This book reveals why the world needs to pay attention to the extraordinary Venezuelan leader."},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"Forty years ago, many radicals happily jumped onto Fidel Castro's bandwagon, captivated by the Cuban leader's anti-imperialist rhetoric and specter of a new kind of world socialism. Today, Hugo Chavez has taken over this role, with his speeches (rightly) comparing George W. Bush to the devil at a time when no one else will speak truth to power. It is this phenomenon which makes Richard Gott's biography so crucial.Most newspaper accounts of Chavez obscure who he really is by painting him in such broad strokes that we are forced to take sides less on what we know about Chavez then what we know about his critics (such as the United States). This book clarifies much about Venezuelan history and the present situation.Gott defends Chavez from his right-wing detractors by pointing out that since 1998 Chavez has been supported repeatedly by voters in Venezuela. And yet the author is not hopelessly mesmerized by Chavez. His sympathetic narrative mixes historical perspective, analysis and personal experience across three decades...but mostly goes without the uncritical eye lent Chavez by so many English-speaking radicals.The history of the Venezuela left--both military and civilian--is extraordinarily important to understanding how Hugo Chavez launched the Bolivarian revolution over the heads of the established parties, supported by the enthusiasm of the masses. It also begs the question of the future of socialism in Latin America.The narrative ends in early 2005, in the midst of the Bolivarian revolution, which has since tacked even further left. In 1998, Chavez advocated for a social-democratic \\"third way\\" between capitalism and communism. Today, he champions \\"Venezuelan socialism\\", going as far as declaring \\"I am a Trotskyist\\" in reference to the anti-Stalinist Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky."},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"After viewing the spat between Chavez and Spain's King Juan Carlos on TV last week, where the latter told Chavez to \\"Shut the f....k up!\\" with the former replying in the same coin, there can be no doubt who this young revolutionary army leader's, now President (what for his 3rd term?) hero and role model is: the old dying Leftist Caudillo himself, Fidel Castro. Richard Gott's book on 'Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela', Verso, 2005, that he has unleashed locally, and regionally - by alliances with Evo Morales in Bolivia and now with Ecuador, shifts Gott's focus from Cuba to the Latin American continent. He painstakingly and meticulously uncovers the layers of skin (that of a \`mixed-blood' mestizo, with an Afro-American heritage) that is the epidermis of this charismatic young leader, so reminiscent of Abdul Gammal Nasser and the \`Young Turks' in Iraq and the Middle East of the 1950s, and the officers' movement that overthrew the aging Portuguese dictatorship in 1974. The parallels are clear and Gott does well to remind us of both their potentialities and limitations, their unstable social bases, their populist appeals and their shifting day-to-day politics. Who is the real Hugo Chavez and when will he emerge? This seems to be the question many still ask. Gott traces the attempted coup against him in 2002 and its aftermath, not a blood-bath as the Right feared but an unusual 'negotiated settlement'. Chavez's moves between many political registers but has yet to anchor his Bolivarian Movement in a party that can represent his ideas for change. Or does he not need one? Gott has done his usual well-polished job here and we await with anticipation the outcomes of the titanic test of strength between Chavez's Bolivarians and their powerful rivals, local and abroad. He is still reliant on the huge oil-sales to the US for revenue and his revolutionary rhetoric seems only to have ruffled the feathers of those in power in the White House, whoever that may be after the coming election. What will happen when Fidel joins Che et al in the great revolutionaries graveyard in the sky- will he take over their mantle? A topical book and a topical leader. Well, recommended as there is no other of its type available really"},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"In 1973 Augusta Pinochet assumed control of Chile in a bloody military coup. Twenty five years later Hugo Chavez won the presidential election in Venezuela. One leader had support from the American right and the other the left. The right should be embarrassed by the assistance given to the ruthless Pinochet. My question was whether or not Chavez is deserving of respect on the left. Make no mistake; the author is not simply an unbiased observer. The back of the book states that \\"Gott is, if nothing else, a true believer of the revolutionary process in Latin America\\". He refers to Globalization as \\"the disease of the new millennium \\". The author frequently mentions Chavez's warm relationship with Fidel Castro but absolves Castro of the crushing poverty and repression in Cuba by blaming it on American embargoes. Twice the author mentions that Chavez honored Mao Tse-Tung on a trip to China without commenting on the fact that Chairman Mao was one of histories great villains.Chavez is clearly a brave man and definitely a visionary. What I wanted to know was whether or not he is a wise leader. In many ways his leadership developed as a response to neo-liberalism and U.S. meddling in South America. The despicable General Pinochet is the perfect example of how the U.S. has sometimes brought misery to our southern neighbors. His coup was orchestrated by Nixon, Kissinger and the CIA. Even the 2002 coup attempt in Venezuela had the blessings of the U.S. government under George W. Bush despite Chevez's high approval ratings. So much for Democracy. Likewise the IMF and World Bank have caused significant pain to the poor with their economic \`adjustments'.The problem that Chavez may have is his desire to issue a top-down solutions to Venezuela's problem. Nationalizing the oil industry is a reasonable response to the plundering of the countries national resources by multinational governments but Hugo is also attempting to relocate hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan's and restructure their diet from wheat to rice and maize. This kind of top-down management and relocation may remind some of Mao or Stalin but Chavez at least holds the distinction of having been democratically elected and despite the assertions of his opponents seems to respect the institution of democracy.I wish Hugo Chavez success. The world needs people who follow their own path and stand up to the status quo. As long as he does right by his people and respects their will I'll support his attempts. Unfortunately, Latin American leaders who stand up to the west tend to have short reigns. I wish the author had spent more time talking about the effects of Chavez's policy and less on the history of revolution in Latin America. About the only thing written about policy results was, \\"he has already got the economy of Venezuela moving again in a manner beneficial to the bulk of its impoverished population\\". That really doesn't say much. I can't really say that I know much more about Chavez's skill as a leader than I did when I started. I have to give this book a mediocre rating because it just didn't give me the answers I was looking for."},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"Don't believe Pat Robertson and CNN! Far from being a dictator, the democratically elected socialist president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, is the Salvador Allende of my generation. From the nationalization of Venezuela's oil reserves to his literacy campaigns and healthcare projects for the poor, Chavez is leading a peaceful revolution, improving the lives of millions of women, campesinos, indigenous people, Afro-Venezuelans, young people, elders and the working-class. Not to mention his opposition to the FTAA and his refusal to send anymore Venezuelan soldiers to train at the SOA. Despite a violent U.S. orchestrated coup attempt in 2002 and persistant attacks from the reactionary Venezuelan oligarchy, the Chavista movement continues to thrive. With Morales in Bolivia, Chavez in Venezuela, the Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas and the piquetero movement in Argentina providing innovative, grassroots,democratic examples of political organizing, a new, glorious dawn is breaking in Latin America. Viva Chavez!"},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"If you are thinking of buying this book, there are a few things to be aware of.(1) This book is biased. Mr Gott lavishes endless praise on Mr Chavez & it is clear where he stands in the fight for Venezuela's future. When it comes time to be critical of laws that endanger press freedom in Venezuela, Mr Gott does not criticize on the grounds that similar laws are in place in Western Europe. I understand everyone has their politics and that to some extent that will influence their writing, but Mr Gott goes overboard with his; the result is a book that may inaccurately depict Venezuela.(2) This book is more about Chavez than about Venezuela. I was expecting a book that detailed recent Venezuelan history and while there is no doubt that Chavez has played a large role in it, this book was too Chavez-centric for me. Rarely did he focus on events that did not involve Chavez as the protagonist. I suspect that this contributed to the book lacking depth.(3) This book does not have much depth. After reading Hugh Thomas' book on Cuba (Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom), which is written by a scholar with the depth and the extensive footnotes one should expect, I was sorely disappointed by Gott's book. There are no footnotes, so you don't know the sources of his information, although there is a bibliography in it. Perhaps if you are using this book as a way to get your footing on recent Venezuelan history, it is worthwhile, but if you are looking to use this book as a starting point for in-depth research, you will be disappointed.(4) This book leaves off in late-2004. I knew that when I bought it, so I wasn't surprised. But if you are looking to learn about modern-day Venezuela, be aware that much has changed in these last two years. You will need to fill that in for yourself... So, unless you have the research systems (e.g., Lexis Nexis, Academic Databases, etc.) or the time to read newspapers/article online, you'll walk away with an outdated perspective on a rapidly changing country. Heck, I bought this book two weeks ago and in the last few days, there have already been major changes in Venezuela.My recommendation: Buy this book if you want a shallow treatment of recent Venezuelan history. If you'd prefer something a little more thorough, try looking elsewhere. Or even better, if you've got the brains and time, do the research yourself. You'll no doubt understand the country better and probably with more depth than if you simply read this book."},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"This book provides one of the few looks that we have of Hugo Chavez. His dictatorship in Venezuela is one of the more unique in the world especially when analyzing his power base. A word of caution when reading this book however is that Gott is fiercely anti-American so a lot of the book is taken up with his rabid viewpoints. It is still one of the best portraits we have of Chavez and if you can look past the anti-American bias the book is very useful. If you want to learn about modern Venezuela you really can't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"The book is generally poorly written and biased. The book is informative and benefits from the writers own personal involvement in Venezuela for many years. But the text is poorly written, organized, and edited. As a result, it does not flow as well as it should. It's also simplistic in many places.However, the biggest problem with the book is that it fails to give a critical view of Chavez. It's written by someone who can barely hide his excitement at the coming of a \\"revolution\\" in Venezuela to fix all those problems that everyone knows Venezuela has. He fails to explain, however, the risks that Chavez's policies are eroding individual liberties, judicial guarantees, democracy, freedom of expression, and economic development.I also found the book's binding very odd. It's bound like a picture book with thick pages. I honestly don't know why book bindings are just not what they used to be. Oh well!"},{"Title":"Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela","review":"Typical analysis by someone who has no idea how life in Venezuela has changed due to the policies of Chavez.

My son loves it still 6 months later & I find it pretty amusing myself. We have had side discussions about time out, not drawing on the walls, how watching tv is a privilege, using your imagination, and how sassing your parents (\\"You're not the boss of me!\\") will get a child in trouble for sure. My son even took it to preschool last year to share with his class. Since it is about cats, I think young girls would be entertained as well. As a parent, I recommend this book particularly if you can get it with the read-along DVD."},{"Title":"Skippyjon Jones in the Dog-House","review":"Your kid may be fascinated by this book without ever understanding why. Is that a good thing? Well, probably -- I'm one of those who feel that literature should stimulate and challenge the brain. But I think most kids might find it hard to follow the wild Spanglish wordplay, to get all the jokes, or even to follow the storyline at first.Our young reader, whose reading skill is generally higher than the age range proposed here, had trouble figuring out whether Skippyjon really is a cat or a dog. That's partly due to the character's insistence on his alternate identity in the text, but it's also partly due to the fact that the illustrator has exaggerated the cat's doglike characteristics (notably the ears).In this book Skippyjon is banished to his room for a timeout, where he uses the opportunity for a flight of fancy in his closet. His imagination is wild to the point of being surreal, in my view. That's not necessarily bad, but it is unusual, and you might need a second or third reading to work out just what is happening, and who the \\"characters\\" are, and why they are singing such strange and silly songs.On one hand, the audacity of the text could be viewed as refreshing. But I am tempted to wonder whether Ms. Schachner dashed off this manuscript after sipping a bit too much Mezcal. Since she's an artist, one might say that would be in character, but I have no similar theory to explain why the publisher did not require more tweaking -- just a few things here or there to clarify the story and make it accessible to more readers.Who knows, perhaps one needs to read the first book in the series to really \\"get it\\" -- but that's not a good thing, in my view. Anyway, it is fun to read aloud IF you are familiar with Spanish phonetics and Mexican foods. But if you don't know that \\"Holy Jalapeno\\" is alliterative, or how a small white blankie might resemble a tortilla, then you might find the book even more confusing.Based on just this one book, I'm not ready to buy into the allegations of ethnic stereotyping. Chihuahua is a placename in Mexico, and the dogs are named after it. So, if an *imaginary* cat *imagines* that he is a chihuahua dog, then it makes sense for him to imagine that he speaks Spanish. But since he is NOT REALLY a Mexican dog, it makes sense that he'd only speak a limited amount of often-mangled Spanish -- which is what one finds in the book -- and that his understanding of Mexican culture is superficial.But I'd want to see other books in this series before reaching a conclusion on that topic. My opinion of this one is that it is quite fresh and the artwork appropriate to the silly subject. And for the past day or so I have been watching a kid picking this book up over and over, often in preference to a pile of other books available. That must count for something!"},{"Title":"Skippyjon Jones in the Dog-House","review":"My 6 year old daughter loves Skippy and we were both excited when we saw this, the second Skippyjon Jones book! The first book was fabulous! All of our family (dad, three daughters ranging in ages from 6-16, and myself) adored Skippy.

Of course this book is similar to the first--it is a children's book and we bought it specifically because we liked the format of the first book. We are already anticipating the third book and will happily buy it when it comes out. Skippy is an extremely imaginative, high-energy, creative boy kitty who, like all little kids at one time or another, does naughty things. That doesn't make this a bad book, if anything, it should be a way to have a conversation with your young child about appropriate behavior.

You HAVE to read it with a Spanish accent to really get the \\"jist\\" of the rhyme and my guy laughs silly over it. This goofy cat longs to be a chihuahua and after drawing a million of them on a newly painted wall, his mother sends him off to his room to think \\"siamese.\\" My complaint, which is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5, is that there is a point in the story where his mother tries to correct him and Skippyjon yells back, \\"you're not the boss of me!\\" Honestly, why was THAT necessary in this book? Doesn't add a thing to the story but shows a favorite character talking back to his mother. Not the best idea. Other than that, it's just plain silly, makes no sense whatsoever, making it the perfect \\"giggle\\" book for youngsters. Skippyjon Jones pretends he's a chihuahua superhero who saves the day for a bunch of chihuahuas in chihuahua land, by taking out a Siamese cat bobblehead toy that they're all deathly afraid of, from the attic in the chihuahuas' doghouse. To get \\"Skippito\\" up to the attic, they roll him up in a flour tortilla and \\"bounce\\" him on up. That was pretty funny! He stuffs the bobblehead into his superhero costume and then slides down the bannister into the tortilla. He's wrapped up again in the tortilla as the superhero of the day.

She loves it, and so do I. It is so cute and fun to read. The CD is great because it helps me put a tune to a couple of parts that should be sung. We ended up purchasing this book and the original Skippyjon Jones from Amazon so that we could finally give the library back its book!"},{"Title":"Skippyjon Jones in the Dog-House","review":"My Child is very ill and was given this book in the hospital. It is so funny and outragious that even laying in what was supposed to be a deathbed he just laughed and laughed so much the nurses and Doctors kept coming to see what made him so happy even though he was in so much pain. His time with us is going to be short but we'll keep buying his Skippy books they bring him joy."},{"Title":"Skippyjon Jones in the Dog-House","review":"I LOVE this series of books and so do children--especially those who know Spanish. They are SOOOOO surprised to see how it is mixed in with the English and in such a funny way. The CD's that go with the book are so good that I don't even try to read the books to the kids. The author does such a marvelous job of reading it with all the special accents, SINGING, and funny stuff I could never accomplish on my own--and I am a teacher!"},{"Title":"Skippyjon Jones in the Dog-House","review":"When we were looking for a story to read last night, my 3-year-old son pulled out this Skippyjon Jones book. I know I have read it to them once before a couple of months ago, but I didn't remember the details. However, my six-year-old son asked if it was the one with the Bobble-ito. As soon as I read the first couple of pages, he knew it was and he was very happy.I have to agree that the plotting on this one was a little harder to follow, IMO, than the other Skippyjon Jones books (we have the original one and the Egypt one), but my kids seem to understand it just fine. And you don't need to read the first one in the series to still appreciate this book. The first book we read was the Egypt one (aka Mummy Trouble) and we still enjoyed it without benefit of the first one.We enjoy all the Skippyjon Jones books because there is a lot of Spanglish in them, which is the primary language spoken in our house. My boys really seem to like Skippyjon's antics and his active imagination. They also seem to enjoy the reveals in the end of the story where we learn what real world items in Skippyjon's closet became part of his fantasy world with the Chimichangos. And they really enjoy the little songs throughout the book (you just need to provide your own melody when you read it). All in all, if you feel comfortable with a little Spanglish, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Skippyjon Jones in the Dog-House","review":"We love this book.

The passages from real world into fantasy are sometimes flimsy. But my 4-year-old son absolutely loves Skippyjon Jones books (all of them) and I will give it 5 stars. The book is challenging the brain and I cheer Schachner for that. I would like to note though that we live in California and we are surrounded by Hispanic names and Mexican food, so from that standpoint Spanglish is easier for him then may be for some other kids."},{"Title":"Skippyjon Jones in the Dog-House","review":"Who knew? Skippyjon Jones is a tiny Siamese kitten who thinks he is a Chihuahua! He has adventures when he ventures into his closet during time-out in his room. The words just zing off the pages in this book (clap, clap) and you can't NOT read it out loud to your kids.

What a little gem! I know a little Spanish, so I'm able to get the \\"flow\\" of the Spanglish accent and the rhyming. My son, although he's only 20 months and doesn't really talk much yet, just loves this book. He keeps asking for the \\"meow meow\\" book. Every morning he brings it to me to read to him first thing, and every night he wants it for his bedtime story. I enjoy reading it to him---the words roll off the tongue and the bright, vivid artwork looks great. I'm glad the author also illustrated her own book, in my opinion that makes for great artwork because the artist knows just how each drawing should look, and can make it her own.I hope to acquire more Skippyjon Jones books!Side note, I agree that I didn't care for the \\"You're not the boss of me\\" remark, but I don't think that's going to be a problem with our son, even if he continues to be interested in this after he is full-on talking.Lots of imagination went into the writing of this book, and being an imaginative person myself, I can appreciate that!"},{"Title":"Skippyjon Jones in the Dog-House","review":"My daughter and I love Skippyjon Jones.

In the book \\"Skippy...In the Doghouse,\\" Judy introduces Skippy's character by showing him writing on the walls and disrespecting his mother by saying \\"you're not the boss of me.\\" Throughout the book, she brings Hispanic stereotypes to life. It's disgusting and underscores how so many children are learning how to discriminate in early childhood."},{"Title":"Skippyjon Jones in the Dog-House","review":"My family loved the original Skippyjon Jones book so much that of course we tried this sequel... but found that it was practically a page-for-page copy of the original.

It makes a great gift!--Jana Costa"},{"Title":"Gotcha!: Tales from a Black-Belt Bounty Hunter","review":"I recently had the pleasure of reading this book co-written by Joseph Laney and Cyn Mobley. Cyn is a long-time friend of mine and one heck of a writer whose credits include 23 books. Her pacing, timing, and suspenseful style is very evident in this page-turning tale that highlights several weeks in the life of real-life bounty hunter, Joseph Laney. Laney shares the ups and downs of his profession with both humor, compassion, and a wily sense of human nature born from his experiences dealing with a less-than-savory (and sometimes not so bright) segment of society. He also shares his insights and knowledge of Isshinryu karate (he is a black belt and master instructor) and offers glimpses of his family life.Laney's story is both compelling and entertaining, particularly when he highlights some of the foibles of the criminals he brings to justice. His tactics are ingenious and occasionally a bit \\"out there\\" (his capture of one criminal who is caught naked in flagrante delicto with his large-sized girlfriend is a gut-buster!) but his humanity and sense of justice are what really shine through. Overall this is a fast-paced, fun read that will keep you riveted for hours."},{"Title":"The Enemy Below","review":"Novel from which the movie was based. BOTH are recommended.

John Taggert Steele's assignment is to track down and retrieve a missing witness, Genevieve Bowen. When he finally captures her in a remote cabin, he ends up her prisoner, thanks to a deer, some chain and a snowstorm.Caroline Cross's writing reminds me a little of Shannon McKenna's dialogue (Standing in the Shadows). Here's a sample scene that captures some of the best qualities of the book--Genevieve is trying to provoke a snowball fight:\\"While he sounded mightily aggravated, he couldn't entirely suppress the slight twitch at the corner of his mouth.She took it as a hopeful sign. 'The way you're getting all pissy? I think that makes you what my friend Arnold calls a girlie man.'Her gleeful insult did it.\\"John Taggert's appropriately alpha. Genevieve is considerably more capable than most heroines without losing her feminity. It's tough to show these qualities rather than just telling the reader to take them as articles of faith.Given the constraint of 179 pages, the author does a remarkable job in creating strong characters and an absorbing situation. If the format had been longer, the plot might have been more complex. And if Miss Cross isn't a one trick pony, she could be--soon--on the best seller list next to Linda Howard or Susan Elizabeth Phillips. At a minimum, this book is a great value for your romance book dollar."},{"Title":"Tempt Me (Desire)","review":"After blazing throuhg Trust Me, one of my favorite reads in years, I was anxious to start Tempt Me, Caroline Cross's second book in the Men of Steel series. I couldn't have been more thrilled - it actually lives up to the success of the first book and takes the reader in an entirely new direction! While the action in this story is confined to a bed in a mountain cabin, Cross manages to pack just as much heat and intensity into this romance as she does into her jungle trek in Trust Me. For any avid reader, it's a riot to watch Genevieve use a how-to-book to evade the military-trained Taggart. And for any woman who's tried to figure out a man, John Taggart Steele exemplifies why they are worth all the trouble! Caroline Cross has really outdone herself with this series - I'm dying to know when #3 will hit stores!"},{"Title":"Tempt Me (Desire)","review":"John Taggart has been tracking Genevieve Bowen for the past three months but so far she has eluded him.Genevieve is on the run trying to prevent being called as a witness to testify against her brother Seth in court. Genevieve knows her brother is innocent but circumstances will make her brother appear guilty of killing his best friend, so she is on the run desperately trying to get help.John works with his brothers in their security company Steele Security and he has been hired by the parents of the man Seth is accused of murdering to get Genevieve back.Just when John thinks he has her, Genevieve turns the tables on him and he finds himself the captive instead of the captor. Then their unstoppable desire for each other has the circumstances changing once again. John finds himself not just giving in to his desires for Genevieve, but also hearing her side of the story.John makes a decision about how to help Genevieve, but his chance is destroyed when in his absence, Genevieve is taken to jail and her fate is sealed. Now with the help of his brothers, John will do whatever it takes to help her and bring her back to him.Tempt Me is fantastic! It has some mystery and a bit of action, but what really got me, was John and Genevieve themselves. John, who can barely crack a smile, gets his life back because of sweet Genevieve, and Genevieve is given the gift of pleasure from John. They each have strong and compelling personalities. As a couple they took my breath away. There is a powerful chemistry between these two. Genevieve is so responsive to John, that I felt they really are soul mates. Tempt Me is a well-written story full of heartwarming romance and searing passion.

James Herriot tells all these stories with so much detail, you often feel like you're almost there.

Or country living. Or medicine. Or good writing. This is a feel-good book. Herriot relates his experiences and emotions as a new country veterinarian in pre-WWII England. Some events are funny, some sad. The book as a whole is moving, uplifting. This first book in his highly successful series is a literary walk down a country lane in Springtime. A great choice for FFA kids, pet nuts, or crabby old people who could benefit from a big whiff of fresh air. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"You have probably heard that Herriot is heart-warming, enjoyable, and all that. (It's all true.) But how so? And what is so instructive about it?Herriot was a small-town veterinarian who practiced for over half a century in Yorkshire, Great Britain. He took notes and remembered stories. He did such a good job of it that he was able to put together half a dozen books of his recollections. The accumulated stories are a delightful account of his efforts to get started in the practice, the whole gamut of farmers and pet owners in his area, and all the little details you normally wouldn't hear about. What a man he must have been to have for a grandfather.The great unheralded benefit of Herriot's writing, in my view, is for the small businessperson who has a limited number of potential clients and who must win them over to succeed. By seeing how Herriot handled a certain type of customer, one can improve the way one deals with one's own customers. The excellent results he ultimately got while dealing with some very tough customers in difficult situations can show the way and inspire you to greater patience and effort. This, in my view, is the hidden value of Herriot."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"All Creatures Great and Small is a fascinating true story about a veterinarian named Dr. James Herriot who cures animal illnesses and wins over the hearts of animal lovers. He has unique courage and warmth that touches many people who have read this book. This was a very good story that was so good it almost made me cry. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a great animal story."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This is the first of a series of sort-of-autobiographical books written by &quot;James Herriot,&quot; a real-life country veterinarian in Yorkshire, England. The first book covers his arrival in &quot;Darrowby&quot; in 1937, when new research and new technology were just beginning to change both farming and veterinary medicine. We meet James' boss, Siegfried Farnon, and Siegfried's fun but irresponsible brother Tristan, as well as a wide variety of local farmers and pet owners. As good as the BBC series is, the books are so much more. I think readers of any age (these books are perfectly suitable for older grade school age children) who like animals will enjoy the stories here, as will anyone with an interest in English country life, or stories of days gone by."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I've read this book before, and was delighted to read it once again. James Herriot mixes life stories with veterinary experiences to make truly enjoyable reading. Each chapter is a little story in itself, so it's also an easy book to read out loud to someone (as I did to my Dad when he was hospitalized). It's also a good book to read right before bed to wind down. If you love animals, or books about people living their lives, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"\\"All Creatures Great and Small\\",is a unique book to be sure.James Herriot's series is like a breath of fresh air.I do remember reading this series eons ago.I just loved the story of how a new veternarian triesto make a go of it in the harsh climate of the Yorkshire Dales.Just recently, I was given these precious books that werea part of my deceased fathers library.What a wonderful surprise to see that insidewere notes that my father had written while reading these books.It was like having my father back for a moment or too.The stories of Herriot's new life as a vet,are full of adventures and and mishaps along the way.Plus, the added addition of the farmers who came to admire the determinationof this man to make a differencein the care of all animals, great and small.One can't help but laugh and cry, while reading these books.Siegfried,the owner, and his brother Tristan, are a delightful addition.Their banter will have you in stitches.Oh, and we certainly can't leave out Mrs. Pumphrey and her dog Tricki Woo.Who could forget the famous words spoken over and over.\\"Oh, Mr. Herriot,I am so glad you've come.Tricki has gone flop-bott again\\".A genuine classic to be sure."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This was a great book. I decided to read it because I like animals, and I'm so glad I did. I loved this book; it was really funny and exciting. I am definitaly going to read more of his books and watch the tv show if it's ever on anymore. I think triston is hilarious. I would reccomend reading this; it was great."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I have enjoyed reading this work over the years as well as the other books in the servies. This story, autobiographical, of a English Vet just before the war, and later, after the war, is truely one of the top gems to be published over the past fifty years as far as reading pleasure goes. The author is a natural story teller and truely a very, very good writer, actually, quite polished. I certainly won't go into the plot or the story here as many others have already done so, but will, as I have, remark of the skill of this writer and the enjoyment his stories bring. I admit to being one of those who have collected his work and tend to reread each book in the series ever so often. Highly recommend this work. I am sure you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I can't imagine a reader finishing this delightful tome without wishing he had become a veterinarian. The message from page to page is the writer's love for his profession. Herriot is such a sweet spirit in his relationship with family, friends, clients, partners and patients. Do yourself a favor and purchase this book; it'll give you several hours of smiles and chuckles."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I am thinking about buying this book, is it a good choice to buy it--or not?"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Very disappointed this product is shown as a hardcover. And it is, but it is a paper back put in a hardcover."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"The book that my group read was called All Creatures Great and Small by this surgeon named James Herriot. The book was not the best book in the world and it did get boring at a lot of times but I did manage to read all of it. It was interesting to see a man work so hard to take care of all kinds of different animals. The funny part was when he was looking for a lady for him. If you do love animals and find living on a farm interesting then go ahead and read this book I am not going to stop you at all. It wasn't my kind of book though."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I am a 14 year old, and had to read this book for Honor's English over the summer. I got to pick the book, and I made the wrong choice. It is long and boring, and there is no excitement to make you want to keep reading. The book consists of James, the narrarator and author going to farms and treating animals. There are many complicated medical terms and half the time I didn't know what was going on with the aminal. It has its good parts, but they are few and far between. I wold not have finished it if I didn't have to."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I only read this book because I had to. It was torture! I hated it. Too long and boring"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"On the captivating cover, you see a humble man with an accepting look; but as they always say, \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\" Most book reviews you will see will try to tell you a brief summary of the book and will afterwards fathom its greatness and superiority, but this review will be more helpful than any other you have seen.Let me just be frank with you. Don't Read this book!!!!!!!! This autobiography begins with James Herriot describing episodes in the normal life of a veterinarian. Let's accept life, people! It takes real talent to write about yourself and make it sound commendable. A trait this author did not show in this publication. The book continues with James Herriot finding a new job and having a pretty normal life in his small town in England.Although I hated every bit of this book, I really hated the part(s) whenever he talks in an annoying detail about asking for \\"some hot water, soap, and a towel\\" just before he untangles a baby inside an animal, for instance, and his descriptive ability of basically boasting his achievements of solving complications inside an animal. I was particularly disgusted during these events because of their constant appearance in the book and how it never added to the excitement of the chapter or his life in general.I guess the writer really wants the reader to know about his life. Though from a reader's perspective, nobody wants to hear about a normal life.Now I should bring up the reason why I read this book in the first place instead of returning it to its home after reading the first chapter. I am pretty much forced to read this as part of a passing grade in reading, so I really had no choice.Just remember folks, never let \\"The Clasic Multimillion-Copy Bestseller\\" fool you. Notice how Classic is spelled intentionally \\"Clasic\\".So as a fellow reader and someone who has the ability to stop the plague of unhappy reading, I should warn you of the constant use of typos, and never using a period after an abbreviation; stuff that would normally get a reader pretty annoyed. So remember all you people out there looking for a good book, DON'T CHOOSE THIS ONE!!!!!!!!In case you haven't found out all ready though, I would rate this book 0 stars (though if you were to come up and ask me I would say -10... stars) -- Avishek"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I read this book many years ago and picked it up once again to enjoy once again a life of a young man becoming a vet and what he encounters and experiences.

I am trying to listen only in half hour segments in order to stretch the listening as long as possible. There are times I laugh out loud and times that I tear up. We watched the original series on television and have the video collection as well. I never, never tire of this series nor the wonderful characters and animals. This reading is absolutley brilliant as I said above and Mr. Timothy transports the listener to the dales of Yorkshire. I cannot think of enough superlatives to recommend this to lovers of All Creatures Great and Small."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I first read this series back in the 70's and also my children (10 of them).

Also going to invest in another series for myself."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I devoured the James Herriot bokks as a teen and am enjoying them again as an adult. What a bunch of quirky and extremely lovable characters! These books are quick reads but that most certainly does not mean they have no depth. The dry wit and very droll humour never gets old. Some of the events and the style of story telling could become repetitive and read as slapstick if written by a less accomplished author but James Herriot's voice is so very authentic and genuine."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Perfect stories from the life of a young veterinary doctor. The best book about people and animals that I have read in the last five years. Herriot continues his story of life as an English country vet inAll Things Bright and BeautifulandAll Things Wise and Wonderful.

Never have I longed to return to a place I have never been. I feel his adoration of a timeless land, the endlessly toiling farmers, and the mischievous brothers he works alongside.This book is an excellent choice to present to someone if you wish them to enjoy reading. The elation, the euphoria, and the occasional tale of woe is nothing but an affirmation the very essence of life.No spring is complete until I crack open its pages and revel in the gypsy pony, Helen Alderson, Tristan's pigs, and Clancy, the \\"womiting\\" dog.If I could only have a dozen books in my library, James Herriott's works would occupy most of it."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I purchased this book for my Book club read for the month of August. It was excellent and everyone loved the book. Even if you are not an animal lover, you will still enjoy this book."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"How do I describe this book? Amazing, beautifully done, remarkable, fantastic, will be treasured for years on end! All Creatures Great and Small, set in the 1930's gives you a view of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales, introduces hilarious and lovable characters (whether human or animal), and gives you a taste not only amazing veterinary work, but of a vet's personal life. Dive into the world of a young vet by the name of James Herriot (pen name) as he takes you on exiting adventures through the Yorkshire Dales.

I am now a people doctor and frequently wish I were a vet. The book is extremely charming, heart felt, humorous and realistic. Many times, I feel like I am there with James as he is treating an ailing animal or owner. I also purchased the audio CD, unabridged, and have a great time in the car listening to a very personalized voice narrating the book."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I've loved these books since I was a child; Herriot was the very first writer whose catalog I tracked down at the vast Grand Army Plaza Library, and I wouldn't stop 'til I'd read everything..."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I really liked this memoir of being an English countryside vet in the late 1930s. The book, though it did follow a loose chronology, seemed more like a series of articles or anecdotes than a cohesive novel. Some chapters did flow together, but the vast majority did not. That's not to say that I didn't like the book, because I did, I loved it - it had many parts that were laugh-out-loud funny - the brother, Tristan, was an especially comical character. The memoir was educational too, but the veterinary technicalities were well explained. It actually had less to do with animals than I thought it would - there was a great deal about people - even a central romance!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I loved these stories when I read them many years ago, but reading time is harder to come by these days. Christopher Timothy does as good a job reading as he did in the BBC series!

Jeremy T."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"James &quot;Jems&quot; Herriot provides the reader with a look into a bygone age in the North of England when the science of veterinary medicine was on the cusp of modernity. His recounts of not only his experience with animals, but with his employer, Siegfried, and his pursuit of female companionship are so sweet and funny that I often found myself smiling from sheer pleasure. I would have loved to have met this gentle-man and gotten an eyeful of his borrowed black patent leather dancing slippers with their silk bows!Luckily, on cable TV, is Animal Planet where there is weekly series that provides a glimpse into present day vets in England, Vets in Practice, and complements Herriot's writings well and gives visualizations to many of the same situations in which Herriot found himself, e.g. difficult cow births. I admire the dedication of these country vets and feel priviledged to have been given such a wonderful look into this man's life. I cried when I finished it- I am such a sap, I know...I look forward to reading the other titles in this series."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"After having surgery, I was very sick and could not concentrate on anything but pain.

My favourite of all time!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I read this books as a kid and wanted to read them again. Some how they made me want to be a vet, I must have glossed over all the time that Mr. Herriot spends with his arms elbow deep in the various orfices of cows, sheep and horses.

Good delivery. Would recommend to any Amazon buyer! Thanks, LDM"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"James Herriot was a country veterinarion who lived in Yorkshire before (and after) World War II. His stories are funny, heartwarming, sad, and highly educational. And after reading this, you will either want to be a vet or be very grateful that you aren't one.The book opens (after a brief chapter taking place several months later) with James arriving in Yorkshire, to be the assistant to the eccentric but kindly Siegfried Farnon (yes, that is his name). He becomes accustomed to Siegfried, Siegfried's mischievous younger brother Tristan (yes, that is his name), and the gruff, kindly farmers who eke out a living in the Yorkshire Dales. Pampered pooches who are spoiled rotten, savage pigs who chase Tristan around the farm, a nightmarishly strict secretary who drives Siegfried up the wall, James's car-with-no-brakes, cows running on three cylinders, a sadistic vet who makes James wear a rubber bodysuit, and an elderly, immensely wealthy widow who adopts a pig. And through this, James falls in love with the beautiful Helen Alderson and worms his way into the trust of the farmers.James Herriot (real name, James Wight) was truly a one-of-a-kind man. He let readers into his head throughout the book, where the cows kick him across the yard, farmers often treat him as an interloper or a nuisance, and his boss gives contradicting orders from one day to the next. But he never loses his drive or his love of animals. (Okay, he hates some animals, but only as individuals) He even lets the readers see him at his worst, when he's humiliated by some recalcitrant livestock, and one horrible scene where he and his date show up drunk and mud-smeared in front of the girl he adores. (Not to mention when Tristan got him to use very feminine-smelling bath salts) But don't think that all of these stories are funny or romantic -- quite a few are aggravating or outright sad. James didn't soften the blows at all.The people around James are just as fantastic: Siegfried, his weird but genial boss who can kick Tristan out of the house and forget about it overnight; Tristan, the mischievous anti-scholar who usually manages to keep out of trouble; and Helen, who seems a little too saintly at times (which isn't surprising, since James married her). There are a lot of details about surgery and stuff like that that will gross out the squeamish, but at least you'll learn a lot of medical trivia. (For example, what is a torsion?)It's sweet, sad, funny, romantic, dramatic. \\"All Creatures Great And Small\\" (and its four sequels) is a fantastic read for all ages."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"These stories are true treasures. While the BBC series is amusing, these stories are far more personal. You get to met Dr. Herriot (a pseudonym for James Alfred Wight) who starts as a young veternarian just out of school and joins a country practice. Cows get the better of him, the local Yorkshire farmers one-up him, he gets his car inevitably stuck in the mud and yet prevails as a caring, resourceful vet who loves his quirkly rural clients as much the animals he cares for. He also writes with such laugh-outloud humor and self-deprecation you just wish the book would go on and on. Fortunately, he wrote four more of these books (each named for a line in a hymn) and a memoir of his father, in whose practice he began. They really give you the flavor of rural life in England before and after WWII.I can't believe these stories are 30 years old, and Dr. Herriot has passed on. Thankfully he left this legacy behind for us to savor. These are books to re-read on dreary days with a cup of tea or just when you really need something to lift your spirits."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"What can one say about a masterpiece. For this is truly what this novel is. This is a timeless classic that will endure for generation after generation.Follow the true adventures of Yorkshire veterinarian James Herriott and his charming comrades as he traverses the Yorkshire dales in the 1930's attending to the ailing animals that he loved so dearly. You'll feel every mile as he bumps along over the fells and moors. You'll see all the wild beauty of the extraordinary Yorkshire territory of England. But most importantly, you'll feel all the emotions tugging at your heart from the hardened Yorkshire farmers to the humorous and warmhearted denizens of Darrowby. You'll meet the inimitable Seigfried Farnon, James's veterinary partner, whose constant contradictions nevertheless fail to conceal a heart truly without malice of any kind and filled with love and generosity. You'll meet Seigfried's brother, Tristan, with his, shall we say, overly relaxed view of life. There's also Helen, the woman who captures James's heart and the hysterically funny Granville Bennett whose eating and drinking prowess is not to be outdone by anyone. Yes, there are these lively characters and more that pepper the pages of this work of literary genius.But most of all, this novel will leave you with the warmest and coziest of feelings. From the blazing fires in the drawing rooms to the shivering winter nights spent delivering precious new animal lives, you'll be drawn into this world of delight and joy. Don't miss the opportunity of a lifetime to own this enchanting marvel!Smash B"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I recieved this book as a gift then it was first published in the 1970's. I have read it at least five times. Each time I read it I am delighted all over again.This is an animal lover's delight - but it's much more than that. Follow the young James Herriott as he starts his adventure as a country veterninarian. You feel his pain and joy as he experiences failures and successes. His courtship with his wife-to-be Helen is poignant. Herriott tells it like it is: there's no fancy stuff. Don't let that make you think this is dull. Herriott's descriptions of the landscape and characters make you feel like you're there: the sights and smells he describes tantalize your senses. You can smell the fresh country air, the hearty farm meals, and so much more.This is a book that will delight young and old alike. Read a chapter and it's a mini-book in itself, or curl up for the long haul. I found it very hard to put down.You'll be enchanted by Herriott's adventures (and misadventures) and find yourself laughing and crying. Even after 5 reads, I'm ready for another. This stuff never gets old."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Such a great book and a great beginning to an amazing series. I never had the oppourtunity to read this in school, but my older brother had a copy of it laying around for many years, and one day I picked it up and started reading. The stories were so engrossing it was hard to put this book down. The narration is so rich and textured, you can almost feel yourself transported to the places and meeting the people and animals, having the experiences the author talks about. In a way, I am sort of glad I didn't read this when I was younger, as I doubt that I would have appreciated as much as I do. Even though the stories take place a world away, the author has a way of making it seem familiar. After I finished this book, I went on to read the rest in the series, and I was never disappointed, but this one will always be my favorite. A great book for anyone, even if you don't care for animals."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I want to warn all Herriot devotees that in buying the omnibus editions they are NOT getting all the stories! For example in Jim's courtship of Helen, the episode of the Daffodil Ball is omitted. Let me demonstrate. 'In Let Sleeping Vets Lie' chapter twenty three begins:\\"After the night of the Daffodil Ball I just seemed to drift naturally into the habit of dropping in to see Helen on an occasional evening.\\"However in the omnibus edition we have:\\"After the night at the cinema with Helen I just seemed to drift naturally into the habit of dropping in to see Helen on an occasional evening\\"How dare they do this? I am extremely annoyed to have spent my money on these omnibus editions. I will now have to go to all lengths to get the original books which Amazon will not ship to New Zealand.The American publishers think they know better than James Herriot how his stories should unfold. They are wrong."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"It's been six years since I first bought one of James Herriot's novels, and far longer since I read his picture books (e.g. Bonnie's Big Day). Even now in my last year of high school, it's a choice I have never regretted making. All Creatures Great and Small is just one of the most heart-warming and touching books written by someone who was truly blessed by God. This book is serves as an inspiration and companion for the soul of any animal-lover, one whose stories will never fade with the passage of the years. It brings every facet of life and love into being, and is a calling for all animal-lovers around the globe. I have James Herriot, my idol, to thank for helping me choose veterinary medecine as my future career, a choice I have stood by for eleven years!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"James Herriot doesn't just write in this novel. He picks the reader up and takes him or her along with him to his first traveling veterinary job. The stories run the gamut from sad to amusing with an emphasis on the latter and the writing is superb. I'm reading some other books by \\"authors\\" who don't have side jobs and they can't rival the mastery of writing that James Herriot exhibits in his very first novel.This is an excellent book as are others in Herriot's collections. You can't go wrong. If you haven't read anything by Herriot, you're missing out. Start with this book and you'll want to keep a part of you in Herriot's world from now on."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I found this book to be a very easy read, and would recommend it to anybody that reads at the fourth grade level or higher. The Scottish author, James Herriot, describes his life as a newly hired veterinarian, in pre-WWII England. He shares with readers his experiences in handling distressed animals, their owners and caretakers, the business of being a veterinarian, and the successes and failures of love and life.His descriptions of the situations he was in, were right on. Being British, and the grandson of a blacksmith, I could easily picture in my mind what kind of weather he was experiencing, or how dark a barn, byer, or piggery might be. His characterizations of the local farmers and townspeople were great, and he met some really interesting people!The book left me with a new respect for what life was like for people in the days when life seemed so much simpler than what it is today. I have just started &quot;All Things Bright and Beautiful&quot;, and look forward to completing it, and the rest of Herriot's books in the future."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This was a revolutionary book. This is the book that Herriot uses to first introduce us to his friends, both human and animal alike. You will find yourself laughing through tears as we follow this Scottish vet to an English land filled with inspiring stories of people, farmers, and of course, animals. The quirky characters lend us a picturesque look into the life of a country vet. There is just no other author who can touch me the way Herriot does. This book is not just a woman's book (as my review seems to point to), but men will find the farmers and Herriot (though sometimes drunken) screamingly funny. Herriot's memoirs are indeed a classic in it's own right. The only item that seems to frighten readers away is how truly English the book is written. The strong Yorkshire dialect can make the new Herriot reader a little frustrated at first. Yet stick with it. It will certainly come to you sooner than you think. It's worth the trouble... Believe me!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I first became acquainted with the \\"All Creatures\\" series written by James Herriot as a high school student writing a theme paper for my British literature class. After reading the first installment I quickly read through the rest of the series \\" All Things Bright and Beautiful, All Things Wise and Wonderful, The Lord God Made Them All\\". The plot centers around James Herriot, a newly qualified veternarian and his employment as assistant veternarian to Siegfried Farnon in the village of Darrowby. You will also meet a cast of colorful characters, Tristian Farnon, Siegfried's younger brother, Helen Alderson, Mrs. Hall, Mrs. Pumphrey and her Pekinese, Tricky-Woo,and a host of other colorful characters who make this a memorable read. James Herriot has also authored several other books, each one stands on its own merit and are a treasure for your family library. The BBC also produced the series \\" All Creatures Great and Small\\" for television in the late 1970's. The series is a masterpiece! I would highly recommend watching the episodes as you read through the books. The books/series are fantastic family entertainment!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I consider the characters in James Herriot's book to be among my best friends. They have always had the ability to make me laugh or cry as I read about their exploits. James Herriot wrote about his life in a way that should be a model for all of us as we live our lives. His stories show a deep respect for all living things and a love for nature. He was a keen observer of human relationships and an admirer of the essential traits that make us all tick. Besides being all of these things, he was a masterful writer. Each of his anecdotes ends with a satisfying clincher and his descriptions are rich enough that you can smell the Yorkshire pudding and feel the blistering wind. He created in me such of love of that environment, that I went to &quot;Darrowby&quot; on my honemoon just to retrace his steps. Do yourself a favor and read this book!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"&quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; is a passionate and autobiographical account by James Herriot of his early years as a vet. Recently qualified, the young Scottish James finds work in the 1930s in a remote area of the Yorkshire Dales, during a time when jobs, let alone paying jobs, are scarce. In possession of only a small suitcase, he makes his way to the middle of nowhere in Northern England, waits around for an interview with his new boss, which he lands despite having fallen asleep in the garden when his boss finally returns.The eccentric Siegfried Farnon hires young James, and together they run a practice that mainly deals with cattle and farmers. Of course, being a stranger in this community is not easy, nor is it easy being a vet. Farmers have their own conclusions about cow diseases and some bizarre (non-scientific) treatments for them. It is up to James to convince them of his new found skills and to prove his worth in what is a reticent but deep down, a kind-hearted and generous community. In his job James runs across a bunch of interesting characters: his boss, Tristan who is the boss' carefree and accident-prone younger brother, farmers, a rich lady with a fat dog to whom James becomes and adopted &quot;uncle&quot;, as well as a girl or two.The story is warm, funny and heartwarming. The story is not only an interesting personal story, but also fascinating from a historical and scientific point of view. And let's not forget James' relationship with all the animals. Herriot demonstrates a rare talent for telling an engrossing story.Thoroughly enjoyable, and highly recommended to audiences of all ages.."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Given that the usual age-group of Herriot's readers are late teenagers, the book came a little late into my hands. Dr. James Herriot puts across his trials and tribulations as a novice vet, &quot;a Mr. Smartpants&quot; among hardy Yorkshire Dalesmen who are convinced of the superiority of their own home-grown remedies but nevertheless make calls at all odd hours whenever a horse is foaling or a cow is &quot;running on only three pistons&quot; (one of the four udders is calloused). Great descriptions of the picturesque countryside and an incisive observation of character (including his own) makes this an intersting read. Since at times there seems to be very little plot in the whole book, it is nicer if you read it just as a collection of anecdotes(some humourous, some tragic, some strangely both) about a young man about to start out in life. A lucid prose style and powerful narrative skils makes this a very satisfying read on the whole."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I first read this book when I was fourteen. Got it at the library in Danville, Arkansas, as I recall during a summertime visit with aunts, uncles and cousins. Hated to put it down every morning and go to swimming lessons. Hated to put it down to eat. Hated having to turn out the lights and get some shut-eye. This book is about the joys and the struggles of everyday life, and of triumphs great and small. It's a book about animal husbandry and the way people connect with animals, even when they have trouble connecting to other people.I've read this book three or four times since that summer so very long ago. It is brilliantly written. What a great investment of your time if you choose to read this wonderful tale of life as a veterinarian in a faraway country."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"The only warning I give before you start to read this book is that you must be willing to donate many hours because this book will make you want to read every single one of James Herriots books. \\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" is a fabulous book. Currently I am going to school to become a veterinarian (including the cow degree) and after sifting through this book I knew that every person who wants to become a vet should read this book.Not only does it show the joys of bringing a struggling lamb in the world, or pulling a dying animal back from the brink of death, it also displays the downfalls of being a vet. The unexpected nightly calls, the confusing symptoms, and the claws and teeth that are attached to each patient are all also a part of being a vet.Through it all James Herriot shows a deep love of his profession which cannot help but bring a smile to the readers face.I recommend this book to any animal lover from cats to cows, James has to fight with them all in the England countryside."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This book is quite possibly the best book I have ever read! This book started out great and ended just as well as it started. Even though I am only 14 years of age, I still thoroughly enjoyed this book to it's full potential. All in all this book got the highest mark on my chart. If you like animal stories or just like a really good book you should read this one!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I am a student of veterinary medicine in soouth asian cooountry called nepal.NEVER HAD I READ A BOOK LIKE THAT."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I really have nothing to add to all of the previous comments, except that &quot;I agree...what a great book!!!&quot;This book is also a perfect volume for reading at bedtime or on the bus because it is broken into about fifty short, stand-alone stories, so you can read just a little each night, or put it down for six months and pick right back up where you started.Some of the stories and insights just rip your heart out. His compassion for animals and people alike is inspiring and will bring a tear to your eye. What a great storyteller!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This was the first book of James Herriott's that I read, and I just couldn't put it down. I was so caught up in the story, it transported me to Yorkshire in the'60's. He is a master story teller, the story becomes alive, it makes you laugh and warms your heart. I could imagine all the characters in the book, what they may have looked like, their mannerisms, voice. I have read it over and over more than 10 times. It is both humourous and heartwarming and one of the most interesting books I have ever read."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"All Creatures Great and Small By James Harriot Dr. James Harriot is a veterinarian living in the Yorkshire Dales, in England, the early 1900's. In my book All Creatures Great and Small, James Harriot wrote about the unusual events that happen to him as a veterinarian assistant. Other titles by James Harriot are Cat Stories, Dog Stories, All Things Wise and Wonderful, All Things Bright and Beautiful, and The Lord God Made Them All. The purpose of his books is to prove that things aren't always what they seem. In the first chapter of the book, he is working at a &quot;calving&quot;, when he finds that the calf is in the wrong way. He tries to pull him around, but a man called Uncle disturbs him the whole time. He finally pulls the calf out and goes home. In the second chapter he's going to Darrowby to apply to become a veterinarian assistant when his employer, Mr. Farnon isn't there. So he waits for the whole day until he finally comes in and shows him around the Dales. A very sad chapter is Chapter 6, when Dr. Harriot is called to a sick horse. He rushes out there and discovers that the horse has a classical torsion and is dying. When he tells the owner this he gets furious, but before the owner can do anything, Dr. Harriot rushes out to get an injection and finishes the job quick and easy. In conclusion, Dr. James Harriot is a wonderful writer. He has great talent. I would recommend this book to anyone because of the daily chores he does and the activities that an animals' life could depend on."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This book is about the life of an veterinarian (James Herriot) in the 1930's. This book starts out when the James gets out of veterinarian school and lands his first job. Each chapter in the book is a short story about one animal case that James was evolved in. The book goes into great detail about the surgeries and procedures involved in working with the animals. In reading the book one gets a good feel for the small town in England and the life that people lead in the town. One thing is that drinking and driving was not considered a problem in those time, because many times in the book they describe drinking at the bars all night and driving home without a second thought.Even though the book is a bunch of short stories it still have a slight common thread running through it and a nice ending. The book started off slow, but I got really attached. It was a nice relaxing read."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This book is the template for great writing about animals. I have never found anyone who can top Herriott for combining humor, pathos, character study and warmth in the \\"animal\\" genre. . This is a book that will delight people of all ages forever. I'm sure Herriott has been the inspiration for many a veterinarian career. Every one of his books maintains the same consistently top-notch writing. A great holiday, birthday, anniversary, or any other occasion gift. I think I'll go back and read this book again right now!!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I bought the book for my 11 yo cause it was recommended. i ended up reading and enjoying the book, but how someone can imagine it suitable for youngsers under 18 is beyond me."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"The key thing to understand is this book/audio is much darker than the TV series. Herriot's clients are mostly animals in labour with various ghastly problems. Somehow hearing about them rather than seeing tame simulations, greatly amplifies the gross out factor.The farmers don't give the young vet any respect, and it really grates on him. It is almost as though he wrote the book for revenge.Timothy Christopher the reader is amazing. He creates a distinct voice for each character, including Mrs. Pumphrey, Tricki Poo's companion (reminiscent of the Amy De La Pompa character on The Royal Canadian Air Farce). He does all kinds of Yorkshire accents that sound right on -- at least to my ear weaned on British TV."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Great price, easy ordering and receiving.

It is as wonderful a work of master story telling as is available anywhere. James Harriot is able to place his world of animals, their owners and his life work with them on the pages of this book. A truly good read, indeed."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Read the first page. That's all you need to decide you want this book. The author is a veterinarian in Yorkshire, and perhaps my American readers are aware of a PBS series by the same name. He's just an amazingly gifted storyteller. This guy is a veterinarian, but his writing puts most \\"professional authors\\" to shame."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I listened to the audiobook narrated by Christopher Timothy. It was pleasant. It is partially autobiographical, but primarily fiction. It was written by a veterinary surgeon who worked in Yorkshire, England, starting in the 1940s. It is told in the first person and describes the working life of a country vet whose primary patents are large farm animals. He is sometimes injured by the animals, for example a horse kicking him. He also tells stories about the owners of the animals. For anyone interested in becoming a vet, I'd highly recommend this, but it is also entertaining for the rest of us. This is a period from the past before many drugs and modern treatments were discovered. I understand more vets today practice on dogs, cats, and other companion animals as opposed to large farm animals. Film and TV versions of the book are also available.DATA:Copyright: 1972.

It's very good and anyone who is a animal lover and loves 'slice of life' books will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This book is a delight from beginning to end. Animal stories are not my genre of choice and the only reason I read it was because it was the selection for my book club. The first chapter made me curious, but not overly engaged. Pressing on I discovered a delightful storyteller in Herriot. He uses his actual experiences as a rural veterinarian in early 20th century Scotland as his source. He mixes up the personal and incident details in order to preserve his clients' privacy without sacrificing authenticity. The end product is a book I didn't want to put down and was sorry to discover the last page."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"One of the few books that you will laugh out loud....loved these when I read them about 30 years ago.....beautiful..touching..."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Since first reading James Herriot I was drawn to the richly told, heart-warming stories.

Fortunately, I found that the show was very faithful to the books. When the show finally ended, I began reading Mr. Herriots entire collection of memoirs. All Creatures Great and Small is as satisfying in print as it was on television. Mr. Herriot's description of the farmers and town folk he encountered during his tenure as a country vet confirms that the every day stories of real people can be just as interesting and entertaining as fictional characters, when told by an expert story-teller.The Cloudbase Chronicles - Life at the Top: Living and Working at Chicago's John Hancock Center - An Engineer's Tale."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Living in England during the seventies, I became addicted to the television show which was based on Herriot's books. When the show ended I found myself craving more. The books are even more satisfying."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"James Herriot's first memoir, All Creatures Great and Small, provides the reader with wonderful true stories about the author's experiences as a veterinarian, fresh out of college, and his involvement with animals, their owners, and his colleagues, set in the picturesque Yorkshire hills of central England.This is a phenomenally interesting book, focusing not only on the creatures (all sizes, ages and conditions of dogs, cats, farm animals, and so on), but also the interesting characters, which owned these animals, and the amazing work that was done by vets in the days just prior to World War II in England. All Creatures Great and Small is a warm, often hilarious narrative, written in the first-person by this wonderful author. See for yourself why millions of people have purchased and loved this book as their own!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"All Creatures Great and Small opens an unforgettable series of personal memoirs by a country veterinarian in 1940's Yorkshire (also known as James Alfred Wight). These are written in a series of short chapter vignettes, with a warm, wry humor that vividly, affectionately, and sometimes mercilessly captures human nature in the context of this cultural scene. Many descriptions are laugh-out-loud hilarious, and will be spontaneously read aloud to the nearest listener. But Herriot is no cynic -- his writing pokes fun at himself at least as often as others, and his self-deprecating wit provides an appeal that is near irresistible. This first book in the series follows Herriot's starting-out years as a vet, his induction into Siegfried Farnon's local practice, his adjustment to the local ways and customs, and his courtship of the lovely Helen Alderson.A country vet's life involves a lot of bloody and sometimes gross work, which will appeal to some readers and may repel others. There is an obvious appeal for animal lovers and potential medical students, as he treats both pets and farm animals, and Herriot sets a good moral example through his kindhearted willingness to undergo inconvenience and indignity for the sake of the animals under his care. Implicit throughout his books is the belief that humans have a responsibility to provide good care to the animals who serve them.In his portrayal of his Yorkshire clients, he attempts to capture the flavor of their speech, and this does include some profanities. The words \\"bloody,\\" \\"hell,\\" and \\"bugger\\" appear fairly frequently, but there are few American swear words. Parents ought to use discretion, but I don't think this element should not be too harmful for mature readers.Because some of the humor is rather sophisticated and Herriot's prose is sometimes difficult, I recommend this for ages 16-18, but if enjoyed with a parent it is quite likely to appeal to younger readers, especially those who have enjoyed Herriot's stories for childrenJames Herriot's Treasury for Children: Warm and Joyful Tales by the Author of All Creatures Great and Small."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This was the only book missing from the series.

James Herriot comes to Darrowby during a time when jobs are scarce and he needs to stay. But he finds he loves the people and the animals.His associates are a lively bunch. His boss, Siegfried Farnon, is kindhearted, but has an annoying habit of contradicting himself (and then blaming it on James). Siegfried's brother, Tristan Farnon, is the younger almost-vet who is stuck with the worst jobs, loves the ladies and a drink or two. The farmers and neighbors are generally are hardworking lot. Their stories give the true color of the place and time.

I would highly recommend both!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This compilation of many of the stories of this master storyteller is superb in every way. I've met the man and one of the subjects of his experiences (in the story of the man with cattle). James Alf Wight (real name of author)was famous in the vicinity of Thirsk for his stories. One of his customers told me that as a kid he couldn't wait for the annual visits as \\"Herriot regailed him and his family with stories the whole time.\\" The book is a retelling of some of his stories - and entertaining in every way.

It's nice to read from the point of view of a kind-hearted yet practical country animal lover."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I read his books as a teen and loved them. Bought the whole set for my grandsons, [teens]. They laughed until they cried. [so did I]."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Yes, this is my all-time favorite book, and it begins my all-time favorite series. Can you summarize the almost limitless appeal of Herriot? I will try. First of all, this book takes place in England, and I am a committed Angliophile. It is warm and compassionate without being soppy. It is a timeless memoir that cuts a slice out of the pie of time and keeps it forever. Prior to Herriot, I exclusively read fiction. Not just any fiction, but Science Fiction and Fantasy Fiction, both of which are as different from this book as jam is from vegemite (eeuurggh!). Reading Herriot made me realize that the old saying \\"Truth is stranger than fiction\\" left out something. Truth is BETTER than fiction. Enjoy wiht my compliments."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"James Harriott's ability t create characters, that we all recognize, rivals shakespeare's famous gift,. His description is such that I went to England just to see that part of the world. It is exactly as he describes it. A very good read and one that makes us anxious for the follow on books."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I have read this book too many times to count, and it always makes me smile. The characters are rich and warm, people I would love to meet."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Well, books of short stories just don't get much better than this, do they?For me, Herriot is the only author in the world who can pull off heartwarming without being cloying. His amazing feel for the lives and dialogue of the Scottish farmers who he services gives each and every story a score of interesting details and conversation that is captivating for its novelty and authenticity.In this first book of the series, Herriot has more to say than at any other point in his career. Not that his brand of storytelling ever gets old, but here there is the added excitement of reading his first stories, for the first time.Another major draw for these stories is the look inside the nuts and bolts of veterinary practice, at a time when science was still struggling to overtake centuries of medieval techniques. Reading about sutures and powders and presentations is more fascinating than I ever would have thought possible.The character of Herriot himself is unflaggingly goodhearted, and yet utterly realistic; we see in him the best part of ourselves, and this too makes the stories a joy to read.I highly recommend reading this series chronologically, so that you can join Herriot as he moves from young apprentice to old master.I wish there were a hundred books in this series, but at the same time I'm thrilled that there's even one book out there that acts as such a standard-bearer for excellence in storytelling."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"To put it simply this is one of the best books ever. Fun to read yet, captivates you with it's amazing sence of humor,adventure, tradgity, and romance. Each chapter is a new story, each story completly differnt than the last but, with the same thrill for life. it has the fun charecters of Tristin, siefried, James herriot and everyone inbetween. From a bad tempered pig to a faitful sheep dog sam, the animals varie almost as much as the charecters. overall, most any book lover will adore this book."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I got the set of all 4 of James Herriot's books in paperback when I was a teenager (a long time ago--okay!), and I have read them many times since. It is no exaggeration to say that in the darkest times of my life, these books have helped me to pull through. I could laugh and cry with the stories, lose myself and my problems for a while, and come out feeling somehow heartened and renewed. I always wished I had written Mr. Herriot to tell him this. Anyway, I recommend these books to everybody. They're fabulous stories that will crack you up and pull at your heartstrings. What more could anybody want? Herriot is a master storyteller, and the characters he creates are at once universal and unique. I defy anyone to read these and not be touched."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"When I was a child my mother read me James Herriot stories. As a vet student later in life, I read the whole series with a new perspective. All Creatures Great and Small literally opened the door to my future.

When I saw by accident that this book was on sale, I bought it. I thought it started slowly - just as life in English countryside in the 1930s must have been slow and unhurried. We meet the young veterinarian who also narrates the story when his practice just begins and with him we get to know \\"all creatures great and small\\" whom he meets, helps to get better when he can or helps to end their sufferings when he can't. I thought this book was full of love in the best way and very well written."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Mr Herriot has a very interesting if not downright unique way of telling a story from the perspective of a country veterinarian about the animals he treats.

The many times I've read it since - so many times pages are now taped into place - I have slowed down and savored it. This book is a true gem."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This is the story of James Herriot, a country veterinarian. Actually, Herriot wrote many books about his experiences, but I think this is the first one. It had a lot of humor in it, from the hilarious (though I'm sure they weren't at the time) procedures that he goes through with different animals, to Siegfried Farnon, the quirky and odd vet who Herriot is assistant too. There were always great descriptions of the English countryside as well as the amusing people who live there. The repartee between Siegfried and his younger brother Tristan as well as between Siegfried and their secretary Miss Harbottle is really side-splitting. Herriot narrates throughout with a typical British humor, though he is fairly cheerful. He describes his various cases and what life is like in the countryside.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, &lt;...>"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I'm mostly a fantasy scifi guy but I'm also an animal lover and I picked up this book on a whim.

A lovely book to settle in with before bed, or on a rainy day."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I bought this book on CD to listen to on a long journey because I have read James Herriot and knew what I was getting with this book. This recording is superb. Christopher Timothy, who played James Herriot in the British television series, narrates and does a great job. Some people simply read the book for these recordings; Timothy, however, adds personality and depth to each character and really brings the stories to life. My whole family enjoyed listening and we have recommended it to several friends."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"The main character of the book is a precocious young veterinary surgeon that loves animals. James has extraordinary equanimity, but every now and then, it wears thin and snaps. James' employer, Siegfried Farnon is a very indecisive man that has a younger brother, Tristan. Tristan is often subject to Siegfried's wrath because de simply cannot do anything right. One may offer the opinion that it is unjust that Siegfried construes any of Tristan's actions as a crime, but Tristan is the car's worst night-mere and makes mangles wrecks of any automobile he comes across. Although much rancor is exchanged between the Farnon brothers, they manage to iron out their wrinkles after a while.Siegfried, however is a world of his own. This is because his great moral rectitude is patience. Siegfried constantly takes of a saintly expression and is completely prepared to forgive James for something he did himself. The irony this book contains will supply endless enjoyment.Every now and then, James meets a contemptuous client such as Mr. Sidlow. The Sidlows hold an exceptional disdain for veterinary surgeons in general. This is because they have a habit of perpetually using medieval remedies on their livestock like shoving raw onions up the rectum before calling a vet out to see the moribund animal once there is no hope of alleviation.One thing this book talks about is the bars that James and Tristan go to for relief. These are not the cacophonous bars you see today. Generally, the bars are small establishments that farmers make for a little extra income.If there's one thing veterinary surgery isn't, it's monotonous. Never will you find an onerous chapter in this volume. Even though this book is retroactive, contemporary young men and women will find it packed with loving fun and hilarity. I venture to say that the story telling ability of the author transcends many a skilled writer. This is a good book for any precocious youth."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"When I was in 7th grade I recieved All Creatures Great And Small as a Christmas present. At first I did not know what to make of it, however I had always been an animal lover and decided to take it for a spin. Never before had I run through the entire spectrum of emotions while reading a novel. Sad and dissapointed when an animal is lost, tense when a life is on the line, and relief when the patient has been brought back from an untimely death. There is no better description of Jim Herriot(White)than that of an eloquent story-teller. He does not try and elevate his vocabulary so as to be difficult to understand, but states his experiences as a country Veterinarian in ways which are somehow able to draw the reader into the enchanting setting of early 20th century Yorkshire, England. Now a junior in High School, I have this book to thank for steering me in the direction of Veterinary medicine as a future career. Reading this novel has changed my life, and may do the same for you."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I have not read the Kindel version of this book,but have read in soft cover, most of James Herriot's books & I just love them.I have sat & cried & then I have laughed out loud.They are very special wonderful books."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This book is a timeless treasure; a masterpiece of folksy writing that just draws you in and makes you feel truly comfortable. You can just see yourself watching in the background and Herriot tackles everything from delivering young lambs to minor surgery on horses. A reader feels connected in a way that is remarkable.I have no idea how many times I've read this book in the last 10 years, but I've no doubt that I'll continue to read it on occasion for as long as I draw breath.Just a marvelous adventure."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"There's an irony in the fact that this book I always found so calming and happy, that made everything on earth seem perfectly all right to me whenever I read it during bad times or good, is actually set during an era when trouble was brewing in Europe and the Third Reich was on the rise, destined to end this wondrous little world forever. That fact aside, I love this book. It is plainly magical. The stories here about James Herriot and his life as a rural veterinarian in 1930's Yorkshire radiate joy. Herriot knows how to tell a heartwarming, funny tale, but he never lets us forget that a country animal doctor's life is hard, sometimes tinged with sadness, and that even in a lovely place like the farming midlands tragedy is never far away. He practices veterinary medicine in a small town and out on the little family farms that dot the dales. His boss Seigfried (later his partner) and Seigfried's jovial brother Tristan work beside James as they answer midnight calls to birth calves, stitch up injured sows, and partner with the local farmers to keep England's agricultural concerns feeding the nation. Around these duties, James has assorted adventures and is a time or two lead astray by the charming, well-meaning but definitely problem-prone Tristan, who with his skirt chasing and love of the odd pint is perpetually in danger of flunking out of vet school. These lovable men allow us to come along as they mingle with some of the most amazing characters ever seen in fiction. They work with farmers who live in such isolation they have in some cases never been five miles from their own homes, and Herriot's prose celebrates their glorious idiosyncrasies. The vets are also cared for by the stern no-nonsense Mrs. Hall, whose stoical outer features hide a heart of gold within her gray-haired workaholic frame. This novel, set over about two years at the very end of the 1930's always brightens my day. It makes me wish things were still like that somewhere in this world today. (And that I could go there.)"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"The life of a country Veterinarian may sound quite unexciting, and rather boring. However, it is anything but, and that is proven by the tales that James Herriot (aka James Wight) tells about his time working in a small Yorkshire Village as just that. Straight out of University, James is given a position as assistant to resident Veterinarian Siegfried Farnon - a quirky fellow with very short-term memory. Through tales of strange animals and even stranger people he has met up with, Dr. Herriot weaves together a marvelous story that will make you laugh, cry, and so much more. A lovely book for animal lovers.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"All Creatures Great and Small is a heartfelt story about James Herriot, a local English veterinarian, and his adventures of being a vet.Herriot begins his novel by talking about himself and what he does as a vet, \\"If you decide to become a veterinary surgeon you will never grow rich but you will have a life of endless interest and variety.\\" He says. He uses flashbacks from college to relate to his work, \\"The old chap certainly wasn't kidding. Variety. That it was- variety.\\" Herriot says, referring to his college professor. Herriot also describes his \\"love of life\\" in the nonfiction novel. James Herriot shares stories about his friends' pet pig or a dog he is caring for, during the period of time he needs for surgeries. He also comes across small problems, such as, cows with milk fever and a horse having difficulty getting up off the ground.When I first began reading All Creatures Great and Small, I didn't know if I would finish the novel because of the amount of pages and chapters, but as I reached Chapter five, I was hooked because of his enchanting and joyful tone.Don't let the number of pages fool you; if you love animals or are interested in becoming a veterinarian, this is such a great and loving novel to read."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"One of the best books I've read in my life. A must read. Very well written. Makes you want to write like him.I remember seeing my high school biology teacher reading this book at her desk while she had some time to herself, while we did our thing with dissections, etc. It seemed that she couldn't get her hands off this book. And I'd wonder what the book was about. Something about creatures. Maybe it was about GOD and church and religion.Now that I've had a chance to read this book, twenty years later, I can say that it is a wonderful book! You don't want this book to end. And now I understand why my biology teacher was so hooked on it.This is a nonfictional book about an English veterinarian writing about his funny and sometimes dramatic profession. From how he started, to his everyday events in a small town (away from the big city such as London) to how he meets his future wife, and his gradual establishment of his veterinary life. This book is filled with funny moments that makes you pause with a smile on your face. And has its poignant moments that makes you realize its wonderful writing.This book gives you a glimpse of what the veterinary world is like on his side, on the countryside of life, with real people and real stories, and of course, with real animals. Animals and people and veterinary work that you will come to love."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I can't add much more than the previous reviews.

I must say, though, this is my favorite. I've seen a bit of the BBC series and it doesn't do the books justice. Herriot draws you into his world and makes it come alive in a way that is truly remarkable. I have ZERO experience with this time period or with veterinary medicine, yet, I find Herriot's descriptions of and insights into his world uplifting and fascinating. Buy the whole set, and don't miss his adaptations for children.

His stories of animal and human interaction are something that I am sure most readers could relate to. They portray a man whose compassion and humor can actually inspire hope, even in our pessimistic age."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This is where it all started with James Herriott for me - a paperback tucked in with 3 or 4 other books I received for my birthday a long time ago. I couldn't tell you what the other books were, but this book, and its sequels, have become dear friends. I can tell you the stories from memory (and from my heart) and I have read the paperbacks so often I've had to replace them with hardbacks just so they'll last longer.James Herriott was a vet practicing in Yorkshire (England) from the end of the Depression until about 20 years ago.The stories are charming, happy, glorious, tragic and tear-jerking. It was a wonderful but brutal time to be practicing veterinary medicine. It was before many of the surgeries we have now and Herriott was there for the introduction of antibiotics and many other medicines. Think about it - how often have you had your cat or dog treated for infections - 60 years ago there was nothing to kill the bacteria that brought death to so many. How impossibly hard it must have been for him to lose so many of the animals he treated, and how wonderful when he knew he saved them either for the farmers who needed their stock or the families who loved their pets. And the people he writes about! What characters!I have pets and love to read the stories about cats and dogs and horses. I teach medical students and use more than a few examples from these books about the PROCESS of thinking which is so essential to any practice of medicine. His stories here and in later books about diagnosing hoof and mouth disease or husk or heatstroke or nettlerash are fascinating reading about the mind of a physician as it works while the seconds of life tick away.This book is great, the series of books is great - curl up somewhere and get to know them."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I read James Herriot when I want to escape into his world,a world in which there are friendly farmers, amusing characters and a world with no malice even though a few humourous bungles occur.For a while I am infused with Herriot's love for this world, more forgiving of faults in folk, a very pleasant place to be in. I almost wish I could share in Herriot's rounds, treating animals, joining farmers in their kitchen for a friendly chat and a cup of tea. All his books are a real treat!"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"James Herriot is a wonderfully gifted writer. The way he can describe a scene with the exact perfect wording and phrase is simply uncanny.You are THERE on the Yorkshire dales living the lowly daily life of a young vet.Add to that Christopher Timothy's truly masterful performance and this audio book should be in the hall of fame. I cannot recommend it highly enough.A breath of fresh air. Genuinely hilarious, heart warming, uplifting.Give yourself the best gift ever. Listen to this book."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"James Herriot's books stand out in modern writing as absolute classics, evocative of an earlier, more innocent time, and more wonderously, by the skill with which these deceptively simple, entertaining, moving stories are written. Beneath the entertaining text and characters lies absolutely beautiful, artful writing, with craft and skill that ties all these chapters and stories together in a pattern of one country vet's life in England in the 1930's and 40's. These are so much more than animal stories. I am biased; these are my favorite all-time books, read and re-read since my youth. Increasing age has not diminished their charm. History will write James Herriot's name large. If you haven't read these books yet, you owe it to yourself to start with &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;. Whether or not you care for animals, you will fall in love with a gentler time, the escapades of a trio of young men, and the laugh-out-loud as well as very tearful events this author writes about so beautifully. Absolutely timeless and a classic."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"If you ever wanted to be a vet... \\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" will either inspire, or send you running off to be a lawyer. Heartwarming, funny, sad and highly educational, James Herriot's debut biography (he wrote five in all) give readers the whole messy, glorious picture of being a 1940s country veterinarian.The book opens (after a brief chapter taking place several months later) with James arriving in Yorkshire, to be the assistant to the eccentric but kindly Siegfried Farnon (yes, that is his name). He becomes accustomed to Siegfried, Siegfried's mischievous younger brother Tristan (yes, that is his name), and the gruff, kindly farmers who eke out a living in the Yorkshire Dales.Among the oddballs James encounters: Pampered pooches, savage pigs who chase Tristan around the farm, a nightmarishly strict secretary who drives Siegfried up the wall, James's brakeless car, cows running on three cylinders, a sadistic vet who makes James wear a rubber bodysuit, and an elderly, immensely wealthy widow who adopts a pig. And through this, James falls in love with the beautiful Helen Alderson and worms his way into the trust of the farmers.James Herriot (real name, James Wight) was truly a one-of-a-kind man. He let readers into his head throughout the book, where the cows kick him across the yard, farmers often treat him as an interloper or a nuisance, and his boss gives contradicting orders from one day to the next. But he never loses his drive or his love of animals. Okay, he hates some animals, but only as individuals.He even lets the readers see him at his worst, when he's humiliated by some recalcitrant livestock, and one horrible scene where he and his date show up drunk and mud-smeared in front of the girl he adores. (Not to mention when Tristan got him to use very feminine-smelling bath salts) But don't think that all of these stories are funny or romantic -- quite a few are aggravating or outright sad. James didn't soften the blows at all.There are a lot of details about surgery and animal care that will nauseate the squeamish, but at least you'll learn a lot of medical trivia. For example, what is a torsion? Herriot tells you early on, when he documents his nerve-wracking first case. But more than that, his love of animals is infectious -- it's easy to come out of this with a new appreciation for ordinary dogs, cows, cats, and so on.The people around James are just as fantastic: Siegfried, his weird but genial boss who can kick Tristan out of the house and forget about it overnight; Tristan, the mischievous anti-scholar who usually manages to keep out of trouble; and Helen, who seems a little too saintly at times (which isn't surprising, since James married her).It's sweet, sad, funny, romantic, dramatic, and full of the blood and sweat of vet work. \\"All Creatures Great And Small\\" is a truly unique and heartwarming biography."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Written by James Alfred Wight under the pen name James Herriot, ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL is the semi-autobiographical adventures of a 1930s vetenarian working in Yorkshire, England--and as he grows in experience we meet the people and animals that populate his world.Any one old enough to turn a page will love this book. It is written in an effortless and easy-to-read style, and the clinic's experiences with everything from runaway pigs to lavishly spoiled lapdogs makes for laugh-out-loud fun. Who could forget Tristan's battle with a savage sow or the dog that howled? How about the hens that flew the coop or Tricki-Woo's birthday party? Or the car with no brakes or the cow that would never get up again? Herriot's comic tales can easily make you laugh until you cry.But ALL CREATURES isn't only about laughter. There is also the hard work of farming and the simple integrity of those who struggle to survive on the land, where the loss of a cow can mean the difference between surviving another year and financial disaster. There is also the sorrow at the loss of a treasured companion. And through it all, from the wildly comic to the poignant and touching, there is always, always the story of the relationship between man and animal, joyously told. Easily one of the most completely enjoyable books I've ever read, and very strongly recommended."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"All Creatures Great and Small was a wonderful book, definitely one of my favorites. It was about animals, which was what drew me to the book to begin with. The book draws you in, not really in a suspenseful way, but in a way that makes you just want to keep reading. Also, James Herriot tells wonderful stories and is willing to make fun of himself and situations he was in, some of which were his fault. It was fun getting to experience his first few years as a country vet along with him. You also get to witness his relationships with animals and the people around him. Plus, all the characters are realistic and you believe all the situations that they are in.Even though there were a lot of good things about this book, there were also a few things that I did not like. The author was Scottish and he lived in Yorkshire so some of the language was kind of confusing and often you had to guess at what the words meant. In the beginning it was a little confusing, because usually each chapter talks about a different event in the authors life, but as you read you get used to that. Also, some parts of the book could get kind of long and repetitive, but most parts kept your attention quite well. Overall, I though it was a very, very good book that I would definitely recommend."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"You have to be dead not to enjoy this book.

At the same time, he develops a rapport with the quirky brothers who hired him into their practice, he begins building social relationships with the villagers, and he begins to lose his heart to one of the area's farm girls. All this -- with the specter of World War II advancing like approaching storm clouds upon these warm, humane people. The characters, setting, and heroic battles to save the animals and a way of life are totally unforgettable.

As he develops and matures from an early apprentice to a well known vet, James Herriot has a very interesting story.

James Herriot creates many new medicines as he sees these cases throughout his life.I think this book was amazing, eye-catching and made you keep reading throughout the whole book. I think this book is extremely good and everyone should read it. -- Reid"},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"The book All Creatures Great and Small is a great story by an interesting author, James Herriot. On Amazon, there are almost no legitimate arguments against this great story. The positive reviews love the story because it really gives the reader a sense of what James Herriot is thinking as he tells his own stories. This book is in fact a multi-million copy bestseller, being loved by almost any book critic that has reviewed this great story.As a 14 year old reading this book for school, it is very interesting to read about all of the experiences that James goes through when working as a veterinary surgeon in a small town in England in the early 1900's. He shares all his experiences working with the animals of the many farmers in their town. James is just starting out as an intern at the beginning of the book, and has to face all of the social aspects of farmers not expecting him, the new guy, but expecting his boss, Siegfried Farnon. Farnon is an extremely forgetful man. Often, anything that James messes up, he will forget by the next day. This can become problematic when he gives Herriot advice, but the next day forgets what that advice was and gives Herriot completely new, contradicting advice. The way that James Herriot really exposes the reader to every aspect of working in his new job is what makes this book such a joy to read. One of my favorite stories is when Farnon's brother, Tristan, destroys two of Farnon's cars within one day.One of the reasons that James Herriot wrote All Creatures Great and Small is to show the importance of perseverance. James has to perform many unpleasant tasks throughout the story, including getting up at very strange hours for an emergency case, or completing a daunting task that usually takes hours with little reward afterwards. All of this shows that he had to persevere in order to accomplish his dream, and illustrates the lesson: never give up. James Herriot accomplishes this goal amazingly. Every chapter shows his hardships, and that he never gives up throughout the entire story. Herriot could not have done a better job expressing this lesson, and I am glad that he makes this important lesson very clear to all of his readers.Overall, All Creatures Great and Small by James Herriot is an amazing book because of all the interesting stories that he tells, as well as the important life lessons mentioned through the stories."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"How can anyone possibly not love the series of books about the English country vet \\"James Herriot\\"?What wonderful stories! Not only well-written, but filled with humor, understanding, and at times total pathos. Books to laugh and cry with--what could be better?In the late '70s, I discovered them in a Heathrow bookstall--something to read on a long flight to West Africa. I was instantly enchanted! I've read them aloud to my children and find that, now as adults, they often re-read them. As do I."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"\\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" is the first of four books in this brilliantly written series. The companion volumes are \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\", \\"All Things Wise and Wonderful\\", and \\"The Lord God Made Them All\\". James Herriot (whose actual name was James Alfred Wight) began his veterinary practice in 1939 and continued serving his community for half a century. Each story that he penned carries the reader deep into the Yorkshire countryside of England and into the lives of many colorful and entertaining characters, both people and animals. You will be captured by the tales and find yourself laughing out loud at the antics of man and beast, relecting on the beauty of the close friendship of a pet, and weeping over losses that we all suffer when one of our animal friends pass. These are books to read again and again because they show the depth of compassion that one man had for God's creatures through a life lived in simplicity, and yet his writings are a profound example to all who love and care for animals."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"Mr. James Herriot is an uncommon writer, possessed of extraordinary skill and a mastery of the English language. When speaking of works of fiction, he is my favorite writer. His ability to choose perfectly appropriate and descriptive words, phrases, and metaphors to verbally illustrate unique characteristics, landscapes, feelings, and situations still has me mesmerized.\\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" is autobiographical in that Mr. Herriot is the central character of the book, though James Herriot is the pen name of the real author, Jim Wight. However, since the work is defined as a novel, then one may assume that Mr. Herriot took certain liberties in relating many of the tales he unfolds. Mr. Herriot is a veterinary surgeon, and much of his novel specifically involves dealing with particular cases of sick livestock and ailing house pets. One should not quickly conclude, however, that this story is merely about the ramblings of a country animal doctor who at times finds himself in interesting situations, as some reviewers would suggest.Instead, my feeling is that Mr. Herriot utilized his visits to multiple and varied farms and residences in the British countryside to highlight the individual conditions, attitudes, and distinctive persons he discovered at each location. The book becomes absolutely delightful and poignant, for instance, when Mr. Herriot kindly sits at an aging woman's bedside and tenderly comforts her with his voiced belief that her devoted, loving dogs and cats are indeed possessed of souls and that she need not fear that they will again be her companions in the afterlife.And I do not believe I have laughed out loud so frequently while reading one book. Some of my personal favorites are when his brakes go out on his car and he must navigate a steep and winding descent to the bottom of a low valley, where his next veterinary visit is scheduled, and when he finds himself on his first date with the woman he is destined to marry and the only respectable dress suit he owns is several years out of fashion and far too tight-fitting, which is partly why he becomes far too nervous and a bout of awkward conversation and actions follow. Additionally, much might be said here about the quirky relationship Mr. Herriot has with his unpredictable and explosive yet perfectly harmless and generous employer, a Mr. Siegfried Farnon, and Siegfried's younger brother, Tristan. Farnon's demanding attitude regarding his veterinary business affairs, especially in the face of Tristan's irresponsibility in mishandling assignments and responsibilities, is often the basis for much of the hilarity in the book.In speaking of his relationships with those to whom he is closest on a personal level and the frequently visited owners of his animal patients, Mr. Herriot has an especially profound gift when it comes to praising the best characteristics that are found in the human race. He speaks with eloquent fondness when describing the beautiful traits he sees in his lovely Helen, his soon-to-be wife. And when he stumbles upon a man or woman who he feels is in ownership of certain admirable exceptionality, such as industry or thrift or honesty or discipline or gentleness, his written accolades of such persons is heartwarming and deeply inspiring.Thus I would say that this book has everything. It touches upon the topics of death, faith, humor, love, devotion, stewardship, human strengths and frailties, prosperity and poverty, work and idleness, occupation, and the list goes on. Given that these interesting topics are handled so capably by Mr. Herriot's writing talent, I doubt that any sensitive reader would find this book to be anything but delightful and praiseworthy."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"All Creatures Great and Small is a book about James Herriot's spirit after becoming a veterinarian in 1937. His life-long journey begins when he moves to the beautiful countryside of Yorkshire England to work for Dr. Farnon. Dr Farnon is a respected veterinarian in the area and becomes James' mentor. James learns very quickly that there are many ups and downs in his vocation. Angry farmers, stubborn animals, and 3:30 house calls are just the start of his fun. His compassion is very evident in this book. He is a great role model for anyone. I was interested in reading this book because I am pursuing a goal to be a veterinarian myself. This book gives me very useful insight on how I could live my own life. I would recommend All Creatures Great and Small to anyone interested in reading a heartwarming story about animals."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"I first read this book when I was in elementary school, and that launched me into the wonderful world of James Herriot.The reason I love this (and the other books in the series) is because the author creates a wonderful picture of the beauty of life in the Yorkshire Dales.

I've also come to the conclusion that Herriot has created a brilliant novel in his first try that have taken so many others years to complete.

The 2 books are part of ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL. Back than, I'd laughed and cried while reading the stories - my favorite character was Herriot's boss, Siegried and Tristan (Siegried's younger brother) and of course all those village follks whom Herriot had encountered during his practice. I have introduced the books to my two teenage sons, and they too, have enjoyed reading them. I have to say \\"If Only They could Talk\\", \\"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet\\", and \\"Let Sleeping Vets Lie\\" are my top 3 favorites."},{"Title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"This beloved book is brought to life by the narrator, Christopher Timothy.
