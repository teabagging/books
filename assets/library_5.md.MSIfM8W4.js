It is about a dog named Buck, who had to struggle while turning from a tame dog to a wild dog. He ran into cruel people, but a man named John Thorton saved his life. Buck and Thorton were devoted to each other until Thorton was killed. Buck then had to live by himself in the wild. I enjoyed this book because of the interesting plot and descriptive phrases. I would recommend this book to other fourth and fifth graders because it is marvelous."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's The Call of the Wild is about eh journeys of a part St. Bernard and part sheepdog named Buck. This book is very inspiring and well written. On Buck's journey to the gold rush going on in northern Canada he encounters many changes and adventures. Being kidnapped from his leisurely home in California Buck finds himself going through dog traders on his way to Seattle. He is bought by two Canadian mailmen that need a sled dog to pull them north. During his stay with the two mailmen Fracois and Perrault, Buck develops a rivalry with the lead sled dog Spitz. Buck ends up showing that he is a changed dog and has adapted to the life in the north when he kills the lead dog Spitz. Buck becomes a great lead dog. London does a wonderful job of showing how Buck grows to become adapted to his new surroundings and his new way of life tin the north. London also shows how the wilderness can be cruel and an unpredictable place. I recommend this book to anyone who loves animals and the great outdoors. I think that this is a well written masterpiece that will be loved everyone who reads it."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Taken from his home of comfort and luxury, Buck is sold and moved north illegally. He is mistreated and abused as he is harnessed to work a sled dog's life. Buck quickly learns the harsh law of club and fang in his gold-hungry Alaskan environment. As the instinct of his ancestors surfaces, he gains wisdom and courage which help him to survive. Through long journeys and different masters, he becomes more wild and begins to forget his mellow past. While north, Buck experiences suffering, triumph, friendship, and love from both men and dogs in Jack London's book. I first chose to read this because I thought that it would be an interesting book of a dog struggling in the Alaskan cold. When I read it, the book turned out to be much more than I had expected. Torn between the worlds of civilization and the wild, Buck fights to live among gold-greedy miners in the northern widerness. He is forced out of comfort and tirelessly pulls sleds in a world where only the strong and fittest survive. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of its detailed and action-filled events. I found it especially addicting during the high-speed dogsled runs or the hide-tearing fights. Jack London's Call of the Wild is a spectacular and adventurous book that should be read by everyone!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This was my first book by Jack London. He had an amazing gift of painting a picture of the dog world. I don't know for sure what dogs think or feel, but Jack London apparently did, and what he wrote is believable. Buck is the \\"Rocky\\" of the dog world, and this is a very inspiring book that reads like it really happened this way. Some of what Buck experienced is not an easy read, but I recommend this for anyone -- like me -- who is new to the genre."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In response to other reviews, i think that this book has to have some gore as to convey the truth. ignoring the truth makes the truth mch harder when you have no choice ut to embrace it.

It is an intense, suspense. I really enjoyed this book because there was always something happening. Buck was so courageous, strong, and willing to defeat his enemies. He is definetly a character I will not forget. I can read this novel over and over. I am glad to have the opportunity to read this great novel..Aaron Ceasar Ohta7th Grader at Culver City Middle School"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I am not an avid dog or animal lover. I appreciate and respect them in a rather impersonal way. It's not that I haven't ever wanted to become one, but alas, my childhood gave me no opportunity to get close to animals of any kind, (due to my mother's allergies). The reason I am saying this, is that I believe a certain closeness should exist between man and dog before a totally objective review of London's The Call of the Wild can be put into perspective. After all, the entire story is told from a dog's point of view. (Although it is told in third person.) My good friend already has developed this closeness to dogs and that is why this book is such a masterpiece to him. Perhaps I would feel the same way if only my life had been different. Nevertheless, The Call of the Wild is a great, rousing novel, regardless of whether or not you are a nature or animal lover.The story opens with Buck being sold to an arctic sled team. He is ripped away from the comfortable lifestyle his is so accustomed with. The nice home, the polite owner, and everything else Buck has come to love is taken from him and he soon begins to discover who he really is.Buck remembers specific moments from his life. We are led from moment to moment, rather that a long, interrupted story. Buck has one moment where he kills his rival in a competition of which dog is to remain supreme and become the leader of the pack. Buck has a moment he will never forget, when he is caged beaten by a man in a red sweater. He has a moment of triumph as he is racing through the open air, leading the pack which he has trained and controlled. He has an agonizing journey in which he and thirteen other dogs must pull a trio of inexperienced travelers through vigorous terrain. He is nearly beaten to death. He comes in contact with a man named John, who will ultimately become the best friend he ever will have. Buck will save his life on two occasions. Buck will become the most respected dog in the North after he pulls a sled weighing a thousand pounds for a hundred yard. Buck will suffer the pain of loss, which ultimately cause him to murder human beings. Finally, Buck will become a leader of wolf pack. He will become a legend to some and a terror to others. Ultimately he will become who really is, what he was really meant to be: a dog unleashed in the wild.There are no flaws in The Call of the Wild. It takes a while for the story to get going, but once it does, it does not let up. In fact, it will get better and better. Every moment seemed to be constructed carefully by London. In a story like this, humans are given backstage to the dogs. Of course the human characters are not developed, but it is not really important that they should be. The dialogue is simple. This is not a story about dialogue either, so one would not expect any deep, thoughtful interaction between humans.This is a story about a dog's redemption, told in a most interesting and unique way. I am not educated about dogs, but I imagine it is pretty accurate in describing how a dog would think, act, and feel. Buck is as real as any human being in a novel. I found myself caring about him. In all reality, he is a rather viscous and untamed dog, but at his heart he is what he is: a dog. London does not try to dance around this and make him appear like a human because this would be a fatal flaw. Instead, he presents him in the way he should be presented. Buck is what he is, take it or leave it.Many have complained the book is too violent for kids. I don't believe it was written for small children. This is about the wild outdoors. This is about instinct. Instinct that is real and shouldn't be tampered with. You can't expect a story to be dumbed down because it appears to be marketed toward the young. Anything less than what has been presented here would have been a complete sell out. London was too smart for that and so his story.This is an honest and intelligent story. You must put your mindset to that of a dog in order to really appreciate it. Is this book a masterpiece? For me, it was very close. I think for the dog lover it most definitely would be. The only book about dogs that was better for me was Where the Red Fern Grows. Is this a deeply profound story? No, I don't think so, but it succeeds as well as it could have. It is an emotional, sad, and often breathtaking ride. London tells his story with eloquence and thought. Hopefully someday I will have a dog of my own and begin to understand the bonds that can exist between dog and man. Until then, I will just go on trying to understand, but at the same time, enjoying great books like this one written about them.Grade: A"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild by Jack London; Masterworks: Chicago, 1995.ISBN# 1-561563706BY Mike HendrixDo you want to hear what Buck goes through?

He started writing when he was 21 years old. I can connect to this book in many ways, mainly because I have two dogs. They show similar traits to Buck. For instance, my dogs fight over territory and bones.I would recommend this book to any one who likes dogs and also to people who like adventures.

ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In the novel The Call of the Wild, Jack London describes snow-sledding dogs on a white snowfield. This novel talks about the dog, Buck, who lived in warm California and had an easy life but was sold by a gardener&iexcl;s helper to an auctioneer from Alaska. Buck suffered from hunger, was forced to do severe work, and poorly treated by most owners. After keen competition, Buck became the lead-dog of the snow-sledding team. At this time, we can not find the words to describe how moving the duel with Spitz was. After the duel, he met his new master, John Thornton, who saved Buck from danger, and Buck respected the master and loved him. Then the master was killed by Indians, and Buck got his wild instincts and his animalistic mind back. Buck wanted to go back to nature; therefore, he went back to the wilderness for the rest of his life.Jack London expresses the agony and sorrow of human life into Buck&iexcl;s weary canine life. On the other hand, Jack London describes his own life by using the dog in this story. Through this novel, The Call of the Wild, readers can emotionally feel a sense of the author&iexcl;s life and trace his past. As we read the book, we can look at our own lives and feel emotions like guilt and sorrow. Consequently, I suggest reading The Call of the Wild because it is one of the most successful stories ever written."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Buck's father was a St. Bernard and his mother was a Scotch shepard. Buck was experiencing a leisurely existence in San Diego with a judge and his family when Buck was kidnapped and sold as a sled dog in Alaska. This was at the time of the 1898 gold rush. From the start Buck is different from the other dogs in the sled team: he is more intellegent, more resourceful, fiercer, far more cunning, and most of all braver. Buck, a natural leader, usurps the authority of the equally fierce lead sled dog. Buck, as well as the other dogs are worked to exhaustion by several incompetent humans; they undergo starvation and repetitive beatings until Buck is rescued by a kindly John Thornton, who nurtures Buck back to strength and health while providing the impetus for Buck's eventual claim to greatness._The Call Of The Wild_ is an extraordinary adventure story with Mr. London providing a magnificent description of the bleak and forbidding northern tundra. The scenes in which Buck and his canine rivals and antagonists nearly fight to the death are brutally riveting. Don't expect character development, though. The humans in the novella are mere supporting players to Buck who returns to the wild and achieves the promise of his ancestry."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This was the greatest book I have ever read. It completely changed my view on life and showed me what reality truley was. The Call of the Wild was a tale of a 140lb dog who went by the name of Buck. Buck was stolen from his California home and sold up north where he became a sled dog. In Alaska Buck learned the harsh reality of life as a working dog. Although this was a tough read at times its depth is infinite. If you can unlock the true meaning of this book, and see it as more than just an old boring adventure story, you'll be much wiser person because of it."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"\\"The Call of the Wild,\\" by Jack London, is a short novel that tells the story of a dog named Buck. Half St. Bernard and half \\"Scotch shepherd dog,\\" Buck is a huge, powerful dog who lives an idyllic existence on a magnificent estate \\"in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley.\\" But the gold rush of 1897 has created a demand for working dogs. Early in the book's first chapter, Buck is betrayed, stolen, and sold into service in the frozen wilderness of the far north. The story follows his adventures and his relationships with both humans and other canines as he travels across this harsh new world.The copyright page of the Dover edition notes that \\"Call\\" was published in book form back in 1903. It is a bold, rousing adventure story. Buck is a magnificent hero who evoked both my sympathy and my admiration as I followed his odyssey. He's a likeable but noble beast: truly one of American literature's great characters. London has filled Buck's world with a fascinating and diverse group of supporting characters (both man and beast). London's prose style is a pleasure to read: solid and muscular, yet with a subtly poetic, even mythic, flavor.\\"Call\\" could be read as a straightforward adventure story, or perhaps as a parable of the human condition. Either way, London draws an intriguing contrast between the polite ways of society and the harsh \\"law of club and fang.\\" This is a story full of adventure, violence, love, loss, and discovery. Both heartbreaking and uplifting, \\"The Call of the Wild\\" is, in my view, a true classic. Recommended as companion texts: Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" (another great adventure tale) and Phyllis Reynold Naylor's \\"Shiloh\\" (another profoundly moving dog story)."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book was filled with an abundant amount of description.

Jack made it interesting by putting good descriptions in the story so you can picture it. For example; &quot; The great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns,and the shambling trot grew weaker and weaker&quot;pg 58. This quote lets you picture just how the moose died.There was also somethings I disliked about this book, for example I didn't like that there wasn't a lot of dialogue which I believe would have made it a little better.

Jack London was very descriptivein this book. He used very good situations that made me want to read more and more. The one thing I didn't like about this book was that I don't think he used enough dialouge. The part that really stuck in my head was when Buck and Spitz fought to the death. The one thing that Buck had was imagination and that is what won it all. One of the qoutes that really sticks in my head is &quot;you've learned your place and I know mine.&quot; (pg 6) The man in the red sweater said this to Buck after the beating. overall this was a really good book and I would tell anyone to read this.Toni Nunn"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I thought the book was interesting yet boring in a way.

I had fluctuating opinions of this book. I had many likes, and dislikes. Some of the things I liked frome the story are things such as discriptions of characters, the viewpoint the story is told in (the dogs perspective) and how it relays the problems of life to us all. However, there are also some negative points from the story that I wasn't so fond of. For instance, the beginning started off slow, and boring. A very good, and my personal favorite quote from this story is as follows: &quot;...When the long winter nights come on and teh wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys , he may be seen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering boralis, leeping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat-a-bellow as he sings a song of the yougner world, which is the song of the pack.&quot; (Page 62)"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild written by Jack London was a splendid book. The book keeps you wanting to read on by having details about the places and animals. I didn't like the way all the dogs sufferes in the story. Even though Buck suffered at the point of almost death, he found John Thornton who saved his life. All the details about the characters made them almost real. London did a good job on making you feel like you were there. The quote &quot;God! you can all but speak!&quot;(Thornton pg.43) says all that you can say about Buck. I did not care for the part where Jack London wrote about how John Thornton dies. I advise that any person who enjoys reading about animals and the way life used to be during the northern gold rush, should read this novel."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; is a detailed book for anyone who likes dogs and the outdoors. The book is very descriptive, giving the dogs human characteristics. One of the detailed scenes was when Buck and Spitz fought to the tragic end. London described Curly's death by saying, &quot;No fair play. Once down that was the end of you.&quot; (London, pg.9) This shows how uncivilized the environment was. The dogs had to fend for themselves or risk being defeated. I liked the action of the book, but the setting jumped around a lot and it was hard to follow. I would recommend this book to anyone who has intrests in the experiences man and dog went through during the Gold Rush era."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the Wild is a book of adventure.

If you love really good dog stories, you must also include \\"August Magic\\" and \\"Heart of the Savannah\\" by Veronica Anne Starbuck in your library. These modern dog tales will touch your heart as this book will, and share the theme of humans bonding with their beloved dogs."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Dogs are cute, aren't they? The love and compassion, the friendliness and playfulness, the best friend you'll always have are some terms that go with dog. The book Call of the Wild deals with these fun-loving pieces of the dog Buck, but also shows us how dogs can be mean, terrifying, cunning and every other trait that can be associated with he word bad.Buck, a mutt from Santa Clara, lives in a world of warmth, with a judge and his family. He is loved greatly by all and is exclaimed as the perfect dog many times. A turn in Buck's life comes when he is stolen and sold to become a sled dog in Alaska just in time for the gold rush. Like human's lives go sometimes, we see Buck's take a 180. Buck grows and adapts, just like people do, and becomes a very strong sled dog. The title of perfect dog remains with Buck showing how he can adapt to different environments.London wrote a very good story that captivates the mind with similarities in lifestyles with humans and dogs. How we both have personalities, change throughout our lives, and adapt to our environments. In Buck's case it's in the wild."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's Call of the Wild was, to say the least, an extremely shallow book. London omnisciently narrates the difficult life of a dog named Buck in 217 pages. While the book was with out a doubt interesting, I fear it lacked substance. Its simple nature resembles a children's book but at times the vernacular would be difficult for a child to comprehend. At the same time, the introduction of characters is another confusing aspect as I found myself unable to conclude whether the new character was a dog or a person until five pages after their introduction. This leaves me wondering who his target audience was. It is with out a doubt too simple for an adult, yet too confusing for a child. The book definitely kept my attention, though, for I read it cover to cover in two hours. I suppose I would recommend Call of the Wild to middle-schoolers. They would enjoy the adventure and appreciate not being buried with themes and motifs."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book is about a dog named Buck and his life as seen through his eyes. It is quite a good book, although I did not think it would be at first, since it is seen from a dog's view, after all. The book starts off with Buck living in a comfortable place like any normal house dog. After a very short period, gold is discovered in Canada and there is a great demand for sled dogs, so Buck gets sold. Buck goes on telling about his transition to the sled world and the cruelty he sees. The majority of the book is made up of many little stories, each one for each owner of Buck. Some owners treat him well, while others do not. He also lets the reader discover interesting facts about dogs; for example, dogs sleep under snow to keep warm. Buck shows compassion to some of his many owners throughout the book. I really liked it, and read it from cover to cover in a little over one hour. (I also think anyone from ages 13 to 19 would like it, and any mothers reading it to their kids.)"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I should begin by saying I've never been that fond of dogs. Maybe I'm cynical, but whenever I see a story on the news about a lost dog that found its way home again, or the birth of a puppy, I tend to think &quot;So what? Couldn't the media find any real news?&quot; However, when I read &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, I found this to be a rather engaging story.As everyone knows, it follows the adventures of Buck, a dog that used to enjoy a life of comfort, luxury and privilege. With the advent of the gold rush, this life is snatched away from him when he is stolen, sold, and subjected to the punishing rigours of wild Alaska, where he becomes part of a team trained to pull a sled.Buck has to adapt quickly to this new life of hardship. He soon comes to realize that brute strength is the only way to survive; the weak will suffer and perish. &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; is a story of atavism, which needn't apply just to dogs. If we look back at our remote cave-dwelling ancestors, we know that only the most brutal of them survived, because the world of those days was so harsh. Very few lived to be thirty. The sick were abandoned, the dead were eaten. If conditions emerged to make physical life harsh and brutal once more, we know that it would be back to survival of the fittest. Jack London echoed this idea in his later story &quot;The Scarlet Plague&quot; (1912). London makes it quite easy to relate to the dog in &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;. One might also draw parallels to the treatment of the slaves, and the indignities they had to endure.The first &quot;dog story&quot; I was exposed to as a child was Stephen King's &quot;Cujo&quot;, which would be the very antithesis of &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;. However, I do believe King was one of many writers influenced by the work of Jack London. His popularity endures to this day."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I chose this book because the title caught my attention. The title to me sounded very interesting. It seemed like it would be about a wolf that howled the call of the wild. I thought his call would make other dogs start doing the same thing. After I read the story I was surprised at the ending. I also felt amazed at how good the book was. It was one of the best stories I ever read. The book was a little different then what I thought it would be. I felt almost the same way about the book when I finished reading it. It was still a very well written book like I thought and I knew the book would be an excellent one because it caught my attention after I read the fist few pages.The book is about a dog that had an easy life in California and then got kidnapped by one of his master's worker. Buck, the name of the dog, was taken to Alaska to be a sled dog. There he became a powerful sled dog who wanted to be lead dog. The lead dog did not like Buck and Buck didn't like him. After a while Buck began to like the wild and wanted to be free from mans control. I can't tell you the rest of the book you'll have to read it yourself. The author is Jack London. He is a very good writer. The Call of the Wild is a realistic fiction book written from a dog's point of view.Some reasons that I liked the book are how Jack London wrote the book. I think it is a very well written novel because he used from a dog's POV. He also made some really exciting parts in the book so you couldn't stop reading it. I also like how he made the book interesting by the tittle. That's what made me want to read it. I really liked The Call of the Wild. I think if you like reading about dogs or how the mail used to get passed on in the snow. I think you should read it. This book is for all ages.By: Andrew Meyer"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book was one of the best books I ever read! This is a touching story that I feel would be enjoyable for most readers. When I first read this book I was in 7th grade, and i didn't understant much of it. When I read the Call of the Wild for the second time a lot more of the reading sunk in and it had a deeper meaning. I enjoyed the book much more the second time I read it. I recommend this book for all readers.It is a great book, but not for smaller children, the fight scenes may be to graphic for them and much of the more meaningful sections of the book will go over their heads. The book teaches you what life was like for animals and people in the Alasken wilderness when the country was still young. It is also a good example of the relationship of man and beast when believes and customs of people were different from the present time.The book was published in 1903 however I feel that it's still a great book and always will be, it has a great story line and all of the characters have depth and you can paint a picture of them in your mind."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"CALL OF THE WILD was very interesting the way Jack London's point of view was expressed.

When he went to get broken (trained), he learned how he was going to be treated in his new life. Out on the trail, he learned very quickly the ways of the sled dogs. For instance, he wasn't allowed to sleep in the tent. Instead, he had to bury himself in the snow to keep warm.

It started out a little boring, but eventually became more interesting.The characters were so believable that it felt like you could be in their shoes, from every pat on the head or scratch on the belly, to every beating or fight. My favorite character was John Thorton because he protected and cared for Buck. Jack London did a fantastic job of creating all of the characters. Jack London had a way of making you want to read the book over and over again. He had so much action that it held you close. One of my favorite scenes was when John Thorton belted Hal for whipping and bashing Buck with a club, because he didn't have enough strength to pull the sled. A nether favorite scene was when the Yehat Indians attacked John' campsite and killed everyone while Buck was out hunting. When Buck came back he slashed the throats of the Indians.I might have possibly changed a few parts where animals have died, but then it wouldn't be a true story. I would definitely recommend this book, because it has many emotions throughout the whole novel.By Crystal Chapman"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"After reading \\"The Call of the Wild\\" or more precisely, after being transferred to another place and time, or even more to the point after being totally submerged into the being of this animal, I'm left completely awe-struck by London's work.To see what Buck saw, to feel the forces and the instincts that he felt... that is the power of this book. Here's a passage from the third chaper to illustrate what I mean:\\"At the mouth of the Tahkeena, one night after super, Dub (a member of the sled-dog team) turned up a snowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest Police, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. The rabbit sped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed of which it held steadily. It ran lightly on the surface of the snow, while the dogs plowed through by main strength. Buck led the pack, sixty strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay down low to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing forward, leap by leap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap, like some pale frost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.All the stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to kill--all this was Buck's, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was ranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the living meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood.There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; it came to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight. He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb of Time. He as mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move.\\""},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's style is very captivating. I finished it in one sitting, as it is pretty short novel and too gripping. There are least two strong messages in this magnificent story, adaptation is probably the greatest asset to lead and also we have a propensity to give in to our ancient savage instinct. If you are strong like Buck, the central character, no matter where, you will lead and leave your legacy. Also the dark side of the story is our real calling; though we have been evolved (genetically or socially or both--have it your way) to be civilized, we still hear the call of the wild from our ancient fathers. Why four stars not five? The lives of Native Americans (Yeehats--though a fictional tribe) does reflect much regard, may be because it was written a hundred years ago. I really do not suggest Jack London was racist, the scene seemed little unfairly graphic. Read the book by all means."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The call of the wild by Jack London is a great book for all ages. Buck (the main character) is a tame dog in Santa Clara California living with Judge Miller a man that evryone new and enjoyed. All this changed when a rush for gold in Yukon. These men needed strong dogs and because of the fact Buck was strong he was kidnapped. He was then tuck to Yukon where there was harsh snow and was very cold. he was treated poorly intill he met John Thorton. John Thorton was very kind to Buck but then one day he died. Buck was left in the wild and became friends with a wild animal and learned to live in the wild."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This story is about a dog named Buck. He was a huge St. Bernard, four years old and he lived in the South. One day he was kidnapped from his home by gardener's helper and sold as a sled dog in the cold North. Since this time his life was hard. Everday he tried to survive. He was hungry, he was beaten and he fought with the other dogs. Soon he was strong, smart and the leader over the team of dogs.I liked to read this book, because it is about interesting, hard life in Alaska long time ago, when people go there to look for gold.I liked especially this part when Buck stole food (pg 28-29), because he was hungry. I liked also when he grew, he was strong (pg 30-31) and clever (pg 47). He won a fight with Spitz a very big, strong, Arctic dog (pg 51-52)."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I read it when one of my kids had to read it.

It is the kind of book you would carry with you andc read it every chace you get. I would definately recomend this book to any one willing to give this book and reading a chance.

He is sold to a sled dog owner where he is treated cruelly and has to learn to survive by his instincts alone. Although this is a children's book, it is quiet violent in parts and does not sugar coat the realities of abuse. This is a great story as we follow Buck from adventure to adventure as he learns about the world around him. If you like this book, you should check out The White Panther, as it is an equally magical tale of growing up in the harsh wilderness.Buy this book if you want a great read.Relic113"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I think Jack London's &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; was a wonderful book.Buck is an awsome dog and handles his situation well."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Some things one must hold close to their hearts. This is one of them."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In the book Call of the Wild, Jack London inscribes about a dog, named Buck, who learns to subsist in the artic climates of the Yukon autonomously. The palpable theme of this book is survival. I am one of those people who abhor this kind of genre in a book. I did not find this book very gratifying for many other reasons besides this. Some sundry reasons are that Jack London skipped around a lot from one point to another. An example of this was in the ending of the book, after Buck mourns about the horrendous incident with John Thorton, then he suddenly reminds himself of the fellow wolf he had met before. After that, Jack London tells us how the Yeehat's tribe fears Buck. All of this blurs together making the book perplexing. I'm not really devoted to stories with a dog's perspective because we will never know what it is like to be a dog or any kind of animal. It's also very nauseating how London describes the fights of the dogs and how they die. Because of how Jack London depicts everything in each detail, it makes the story trifle monotonous and makes it seem very dawdling. Last but not least, I thought the beginning and ending was fairly depressing.In the beginning of Call of the Wild, for four years, Buck abides with the prosperous Judge Miller. In this time people were captivating dogs, for the use for pulling sleds to go up north in search for gold. Judge Miller's gardener, Manuel, abducts Buck and sells him to Perrault and Francois because of his Chinese-lottery gambling problem. Perrault and Francois were one of those people who were going up north to peruse their dreams of becoming rich off of gold. They ad infinitum hit Buck with a club. Other dogs in the pack didn't accept Buck, especially Spitz, who was the lead sled dog. Ultimately, Buck and Spitz had an immense fight. Subsequently, Buck becomes the prime sled dog of the pack.Just after Buck's triumph, Perrault and Francois sold Buck and the pack to Hal, Charles, and Mercedes. They also, treated Buck unfairly. These people were very callow. They habitually missed a trial and got lost. Then they had spotted where John Thorton was resting. By that time, Buck grew very fatigue. John Thorton saw how badly Buck was treated so he threatens Hal, Charles and Mercedes that if they hurt him again he'd kill them. So then, John Thorton takes Buck because Buck was very ailing and wanted to help him. They agreed in an unfriendly manner but in a matter of time, a calamitous event happens to Hal, Charles and Mercedes. It was good thing John Thorton took Buck away before something acute occurred to him.Buck grew to esteem and feel affection for John Thorton. He never left him unaided. After when John Thorton slipped off the rock into the rapid river and Buck jumped in after him and saved him, more love grew between Buck and John Thorton. After an abysmal occurrence, Buck feels woeful but knows that life has to go on.I counsel this book to people who relished Where the Red Fern Grows because of its depressing ending and its perspective on dogs, and My Side of the Mountain because of its akin theme, survival. If you do not enjoy forlorn books, animal perspectives, repulsive details, and slow-moving books, just as I, I do not recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"No need to review the book - only I wish it had text to speech therefore, the two stars for the publisher, and not for Jack London!

I thought the love between Buck and his last owner was amazing. My favorite thing about this book was the feeling of self dependence it givs you. You will thoroughly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The book Call of the Wild by Jack London was an amazing story. First it starts out on a beautiful farm in California. You know that this story will be different then others from the get go. This is because it is from the perspective of a large strong dog named Buck. Buck lives on this farm and loves his simple relaxing life. This takes place in the time when men are mining for gold in Alaska. They need dogs for their dog sleds. One night Buck is \\"dog napped\\" and is taken to Alaska. This marks the beginning of Buck's life. At least his new life in Alaska.This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read. It has sadness, adventure, and happiness all rapped into a quick easy read. This book is not for the softhearted. It has a lot of death, sadness, and suffering. Many people think that this book is no more violent then other books. The difference betwean this book and others is that all the torture and death is being inflicted on dogs. People would rather read about a man's face being mangled then a dog's. This book is full of adventure. You see Buck fighting for survival through the whole novel. You can also see Buck trying to stay happy in his new home. One of the things that attracted me to this book was the fact that it is such an aberration from the norm. There are not very many books right now with a dog as the main character.When it comes to this book there are not very many things that I did not enjoy. One of those few things would have to be the length of the novel. This book is barely over one hundred pages. The book suffers because it is so short. If it were a hundred pages longer it would have more character description and plot development. It would also be a much more interesting story if there were more characters. Most of the characters just come stay for a little while and leave. The only character that does not do this is Buck. In the grand scheme of the book though these are miner things. When it comes down to it this is an amazing book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The book Call of The Wild is a good book. It's about a dog, Buck, who is kidnapped from his home.

There is action, death, and learning. My class (8th grade) read this book. I didn't really like this book, only because I don't like this kind of book. So, I guess I would recomend this book to anyone who is into action."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild, written by author Jack London, is an animal adventure novel about a dog named Buck. Buck was born to luxury, but when gold was found in Alaska, he was kidnapped to be used as a sledge dog. He traveled thousands of miles, and since he was with an owner that didn't know how to take care of him, he nearly died.In this extraordinary novel, Jack London shows how an ordinary dog adapts to a tough and dangerous life. London's characters show how some people were very brutal and had no love for the dogs, but that there were some people that saw the dogs as beings instead of slaves. He sets a mood that keeps the readers interested and makes them want to read more. In this way, he makes them feel that Buck is not just an ordinary dog, but a smart, loving and heroic one.In my opinion, this book is very moving overall and well written. It starts out a little slowly so not many surprises pop up until the middle when buck gets into a fight.I would highly recommend reading this book. It left a great impression on me, as I hope it does for all other readers."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This was a well written book about a dog surviving in Alaska working as a sled dog.

Hestarts with a Judge for an owner. So read thisbook. I guarantee you will love it."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the Wild written by Jack London, is by far one of the most influential books I have ever read. It filled me with a sense of life, and power from the reading of the outdoors and the rugged life. The realistic story narrates the life of a dog, Buck, in first person (or should I say first dog,) who was stolen from his suburban home to go up to the Yukon to be a sled dog during the gold rush, he learns the rules of rugged life and survival, and the opposing ways of the wild towards the traditional house pet setting. In a way, Buck (the main character) can be viewed as a human being because the situations he is brought into, and the lessons he learns. He starts to realize there is much more to life then being a simple domestic pet, there are people out there who are very nice, and yet very evil, and he has to adapt to both. I believe that main point to this story is that in the real world, you must be the fittest of the fittest, and prove your strength, or be eliminated.This story really touches on how different people (and dogs,) can be. People are always in competition to be boss, like Spitz (one of the dogs in the story.) Buck was used to living at his home in California with other dogs, like a pug and a Mexican hairless, not vicious Huskies. He was spoiled as a simple house-pet and didn't have to learn anything on his own, until he was kidnapped. This was a smack in the face, and he had to start learning about life, and how harsh it can be. The man in the red sweater is brought up throughout the book, he is the first man to basically show Buck that he isn't anything but another worthless working dog, and this started his brutal life of killing, or getting killed.The lesson I believe London is trying to teach u in this book is to live life to the fullest, don't let obstacles get in your way, and be ready to suffer, because the rewards are extravagant. You will have to win some, and lose some, which Buck does with the other dogs, but lives on. I would rate this book a four out of five. At some points it will go into a lot of detail, and you kind of get lost, but other than that, I believe it is a great book for kids in middle school and up."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"After being so touched and blown away by White Fang, I found it incredibly hard to think that the Author could possibly top it himself. I was wrong. Well OK, its a very close call and this was written before White Fang, but even so - even better than White Fang. No mean feat. In fact, this may well be my favourite book (tied with Micheal Crichton's Jurassic Park and with White Fang not far behind). Those of you who have read it will know what I mean when I say that (reading it as I was sitting on the train) the part about the deterioration of Dave had me fighting back the tears. The book is incredibly well-written - exciting, emotional and very satisfying (if you can call a book that). Truly a brilliant piece of work.&quot;The proper function of man is to live, not to exist.

John Thorton is my favorite element in the story. The love between Buck and Thornton gave the book a positive essence after perceiving ideas of all the brutality. On the other hand this story was drawn out, awkwarkly worded, and used exceptional vocabulary. All these concepts made the book boring and incapable of being read to the degree that it was meant to be. Over all I would recomend this book to somebody who enjoys nature, has a high vocabulary and likes to read a book more than once."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I had to read this a part of my English class. It is a good story, and Jack London did a good job of writing it. However, this is the type of book that I will sit and read and slowly my mind drifts off and I start thinking of other things. It's very hard to keep your mind in the story, because the words go into such great details that it's hard to grasp all at once. Jack London's intentions were good. The storyline is very basic and easy to follow, however. It's a light hearted story about a dog Buck and his struggles in life. It makes you wonder how dogs really think. But honestly, I give this story a 2 because it just wasn't what I look for in a book. It's more old fashioned in a way. Maybe I'll have to give it another chance."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I thought that The Call of the Wild was one of Jack London's greatest masterpieces. The perpetual adventure and excitement of the plot makes the novel very interesting to read. The grit that Buck shows throughout his adventures, the, his unbelievable pertinacity, and his general behavior makes it impossible not to root for him. London's use of supporting characters provides the book with a sort of unity. Even some of the trifling characters such as Dave, Spitz, Francois, and Hal are essential to the novel. Because it is through these characters that Buck learns the vital lessons that he will need to survive in the wild. One character who introduced Buck to the wild was The Man in the Red Sweater. He was the one who showed Buck the importance of docile behavior, that belligerence towards man would do nothing but get him killed. After the man in the Red Sweater, Buck was sent to an uncouth enviornment. It was lucky for him that he went into it with Francois and Perrault, two very experienced dog sledders who helped Buck adapt to his environment. With this retrogression into a new place Buck had to become callous, he could no longer think of what was good for others, he could only think about himseld. To my surprise Buck did not loath these new conditions, he thrived in them. He became of stout nature and took the leadership away from his grave nemethis Spitz by killing him. After killing Spitz, Buck was at the summit. It was as though he could not be stopped. He became the most inexorable dog in the pack. He became so obdurate that even the humans couldn't control him sometimes. Through his amazing unruly and sly actions, he earned the awe and even covet, of all the dogs. Buck havwever would not be at the top forever. After Francois and Perrault had left. Buck and his team were assigned to the mail carrier department. The long runs tool a lot out of Buck and he became very lugubrious. He was turned over to Hal, Charles, and Mercedes, who knew nothing about dog sledding. Their trip would be very perplexed do to the ignorance of the three dog sledders. After a short while however, it was certain that Buck and his mates were doomed. The callow behavior of the dog sledders, and the jaded care of the dogs left only a remnant group remained. Ten dogs died during the voyage, and the rest died do to the floundered actions of one of the dog sledders. Only Buck survived, thanks only to the kind actions of Jon Thornton. Without any amenities left, Buck began to hanker fot the wild. But he could not leave Jon Thornton, he loved him too much. The man saved his life, and Buck had to pay him back. So he did. He romped through a contest to win Jon Thornton sixteen hundred dollars. With this money he could fulfill his lifelong dream, to go up north and search for the lost cabin and the lost gold mine. This task would require a lot of valor, but with Buck by his side Jon Thoronton felt that he could do anything. After a long search he finally found the cabin and the mine. With all his time now focused on getting gold, he had no time left for Buck. With all this free time Buck started running out into the wild more and more often. And there he stayed longer and longer each time. He was answering the call of the wild. Until one day he came back to find an ambuscade on the camp of Jon Thornton. Indians came into camp and killed him. Buck flew into such a rage that he destroyed more than half of the tribe. They had killed the only man who he truly loved, and he wanted revenge. But now Buck was free, he had no more links to civilization. He was finally free to answer the call of the wild. Overall this was one of the greatest books ever written. Jack London could not have done a better job with the characters, setting or the plot. I would reccomend to great masterpiece to anyone and everyone. This book is just that good."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"&quot;Call of the Wild&quot; is not an easy book to read. Devoid of the cute tricks and talking beasts of many animal-centered books, it is a harsh look at a formerly-pampered dog's lessons on survival among a pack of his fellows.Buck is an ordinary pet dog--until the day he is stolen and sent off to Alaska, in the middle of the goldrush around the turn of the century. Buck learns to cope with the rough lifestyle of a sled dog, competes for survival and status among the other dogs, and makes friends along the way.London's skill is evident, in that he is able to convey Buck's feelings and actions in an understandable way, without dialogue. His treatment, especially right after he is abducted, often makes the reader want to reach through and whomp his attackers. At the same time, you adore John Thornton for loving Buck so much and being kind to him when no other human is.With books such as &quot;White Fang&quot; and &quot;Call of the Wild,&quot; one wonders if Thornton and characters like that were alter-egos for London, since his affection for canines is clear in his writing. I also wonder whether he studied the pack structure of dogs kept together for a long time. And like in real life, there's not a happy ending for all concerned--such as one dog who simply can't keep pulling the sled.Buck changes over the course of the book. The same nobility and strength is still there, but it's tempered with wisdom and experience in wild matters as well as domestic ones.Without overdoing the descriptions, London gives you an idea of the cold bleakness of Alaska when your feet are in the snow and you have to trudge twenty miles. The readers will also find themselves agreeing completely with the brief descriptions of the characters who flit in and out.&quot;Animal that longs to return to the wild&quot; may be a cliche now, but it wasn't then. And now I'm off to read &quot;White Fang&quot;--I hope it's as good as this book was."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the Wild ReviewAlexCall of the Wild is a nail biting book of thrills. It is by Jack London and was published in the late 1800s. The Call of the Wild is when a family dog named Buck is stolen from his cozy fire and sold as a sled dog. Buck must overcome harsh conditions and vicious enemies, to find his part in the wild. This book is perfect for dog lovers who need to find out the life of sled dogs. But it is easy to doze off because of the tiny print. CAUTION: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TEN!This story takes place during the gold rush in Alaska. The family servant steals Buck, and sells him for money for his gambling needs. Buck is trained as a sled dog to find gold. As Buck stops for a break, the sled team is stolen. Many dogs die, for the stealers don't know how to handle sled dogs. Buck is one of the few soul survivors. Finally Buck is saved by John Thornton right before he is killed. This book has good information on the Alaskan Gold Rush.The author's addition of Spits gave the story a little more suspense. He was the bad guy in dog sense. He killed other dogs for pleasure. It shows what Buck will have to do to become the best dog in the pack. The writer's purpose was to show a life with many debates and issues and what that person has to do become a legend.I hope my review helped you with your chose of Call of the Wild.

If you liked other Jack London books then we reccoment this one because his writing styles never vary."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"For the 8th Grade summer school English course I was assigned to read this spectacular novel. At first I thought that the story was a bit dull, but as I found myself buried in all the drama and action I could not simply put it down. To be truly honest, I had a few tears roll down my cheek because for me, I have two dogs and I sometimes wonder what they are thinking and if they want to experience life out in the open. This novel was quite complicated to grasp at first, but after you read it a few times you understand the concept and imagination of this brilliant author. Jack London has a versatile and unique style of writing. I can honestly say that it has helped me use new and old poetic forms in everyday writings. This story isn't just about a dog, but a dog who is kidnapped, beaten, and deserted into a primitive lifestyle which he knows nothing about. He experiences brutal images of death, and learns how to survive in fatal situations. This book fills you with so much emotion that is it too hard not to tear. Believe me, this story glorifies all the facets and concepts of the English language as we know and study it today. This novel is educationally healthy for all ages."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"call of the wild and white fang are excellent books and very well written, if you haven't read them yet, you should have.."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Our beloved protagonist, the dog Buck, is kidnapped from a loving home and sold to serve as a sled dog in the brutal Yukon during the 1890's gold rush.The story is expertly told from Buck's point of view, with a procession of cruel masters and savage fights with the other dogs on the team for position and survival just for starters.This is not an easy book to read for an animal lover. There is suffering galore and heartache a-plenty along the way. About three fourths of the way through the story I was able to literally take a deep breath and begin to relax - thank God; it was almost like \\"you-don't-know-how-rough-it-was-until-it's-over-experience\\". London sure had me in his grip with his writing, and it made me briefly wonder if this might not be too brutal for a seventh grader, however there is beauty, redemption, love, and a powerful intimacy with nature here, too, that is quite unique."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Once there was a dog named Buck. He had a happy life in Santa Clara Valley, until one day he was dognapped and sent away to be a sled dog. Buck met some mean dogs and some mean people along the way.

I loved reading this book because it made me feel like I was part of their adventure. My favorite part of this book was when Buck found John Thornton and he became Buck's new owner. John Thornton changed Buck's life by loving him more than anything in the world! I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventures and loves dogs.

Dogs are in high demand because of the Alaskan gold rush and he'll get a good price for a dog like Buck.This book is told from the perspective of Buck. It's such a sad book. Even when Buck was happy, it was a sad book. The amount of work expected of these dogs was horrible and their treatment by humans not much better.

Seems like teachers mostly pick books that girls like. This may be unfair but so many boys hate reading and they are so often have to read boring books while there is this incredible adventure just waiting for them in Call of The Wild. It is riveting, full of action and one heartwrenching crisis after another, but it reads like a manly book because the wolf is a manly dog and tough as nails even though he has a heart of gold. I read the book in grammar school and never forgot it or any of the Big Three Jack London books, as I call them...Call of the Wild, White Fang and To Build a Fire.

I loved it as a kid; now reading it with my son. Love it as an adult. London is a gifted author--one of the best I've read."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The main characters in this book are a dog named Buck, John Thornton, one of Buck's owners, Spitz, another dog on a sled team, Francois, and Perrault, who are also some of Buck's owners, and last but not least Judge Miller, who is Buck's original owner, and Manuel, who's a gardener that dognaps Buck and sells him. Buck is a half St. Bernard half Sheepdog. He gets stolen from his original home and gets sold to owners of a dog sled team. John Thornton is Buck's last owner in the story. Buck is in some trouble and John saves Buck's life multiple times. He is a very good owner to Buck and Buck is very loyal to him. Spitz is the lead dog on Francois's team and defends his spot as lead as much as possible; he is very viscous, especially to Buck. Francois and Perrault are the owners of the dog team that Buck becomes a part of, and eventually lead sled dog. Judge Miller is Buck's first owner before he gets sold. Finally, Manuel, steals Buck and sells him so he can pay off some debts of his own. The main conflict is Buck vs. Nature. He has to overcome this new climate and become familiar with his new surroundings. Two main plot events are when Buck kills Spitz and then becomes lead sled dog, and then the second is when Francois and Perrault sell the team a group of gold hunters named Hal, Charles and Mercedes.I liked that this story had a lot of action and was an easy read. This book was very interesting and enjoyable. However I did not like the beginning very much because it was a little confusing, I couldn't tell whose point of view the story was being told from. For example, \\"And over this great demesne Buck ruled.\\" Another example is \\"Buck did not read the newspapers,\\" I thought that Buck was a human from this sentence. Last but not least \\"Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life,\\" also sounds like a human lived there. I could not tell if Buck was the name of a human or the name of a dog. But overall it was a pretty good book. I definitely would recommend this book to others, especially since it has great action and is such an enjoyable and easy read."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I believe the key to immortal appeal of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan is the combination of the finest aspects of instinct and intelligence. Tarzan is at once an exemplary human being and an exceptional \\"beast\\". Jack London accomplishes the same feat with his canine protagonist Buck in \\"Call of the Wild\\" (hereafter COTW). Buck is much more than a dog. He exhibits so many recognizable anthropomorphic traits that he seems to be well on his way to evolving into some kind of human. Even his final, affectionate owner John Thornton exclaims, \\"God, you can all but speak\\". As we follow Buck's transformation from pampered pet to wolf pack leader, London seems to suggest that to survive in life, you need more than blind instinct. You need to observe, learn, and adapt as well.When Buck is dognapped by his California's owner's gardener and sold to Alaskan dogsledders as part of their team, London describes his behavior almost as if he were a savage prima donna. How dare they subject a king to such a demeaning task? However, Buck's arrogance and obstinacy is literally beaten out of him by an unflappable man in the red sweater. Buck quickly learns that he's in \\"doggie boot camp\\" and had better do his share of the sled pulling, or die. As he gets \\"acquainted\\" with his sledmates, each of which also show human-like qualities as well as instinct, Buck learns from them as well what to do to survive. His progress earns the admiration of the dogsledders, but also the fierce resentment of the team leader Spitz. It might remind you of the old \\"newcomer vs. group leader\\" conflict often depicted in army and prison movies. Buck is not looking for trouble, but Spitz misinterprets this forbearance as cowardice, and keeps baiting him. Inevitably, this contention leads to a bloody fight. Buck, fighting initially on pure instinct, is losing, until he calls upon his intelligence to craft a strategy and cripple Spitz by breaking both his legs. The rest of the pack devour him. Despite the dogsledder's best efforts to dissuade him, Buck covets and eventually wins the lead dog position.Buck proves a more effective dog team leader than Spitz ever was, by again, using his instinct, strength, and smarts to bring everyone into line. He becomes a sort of king, but of the wild frontier. But at length, after many treks and some changes in owners, Buck becomes the property of three tenderfeet, Hal, Charles, and Mercedes. These humans lack both intelligence and survival instinct; as a result, leader Buck and the rest of the dog team suffer brutal abuse. Eventually, Buck consciously refuses to serve these three misfits, not only because of his weakened state, but also because he can sense that the trail over a frozen river will soon collapse. Hal and Charles beat Buck mercilessly, until John Thornton steps in, stops it, and cuts Buck free. The misfits and their remaining team go on, and, as Buck suspected, plunge through the ice to their frigid deaths.Up to this point, Buck has demonstrated many emotions and instinctive acts like anger, resentment, caution, pride, the will to live, attentiveness, wisdom, courage, obedience, and eagerness to work hard. But never unadulerated love. With John Thornton, he does. Thornton helps Buck heal and regain his strength. In gratitude, Buck follows and protects him. However, fate intercedes to take this final, best master away. A tribe of Indians called the Yeehats kill Thornton. In retaliation, Buck goes berserk and slays the whole tribe. Without any further ties to \\"civilization\\", Buck is free to use the best of nature and of nurture to take his lofty place in the wild.Buck saw, he learned, he adapted, he trusted his better instincts, and he conquered. What a Superdog!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This is yet another masterpeice. The plot is fantastic, and I admire it greatly.

After surviving his harsh handlers he then has to fight to stay alive every day. He never thinks about going back home - for now this desolate wasteland is home.

They usually feature someone's cute, fuzzy pet, lost in the wilderness, trying to make his way home. These doggies are often anthropomorphized; they are portrayed as having human thoughts and emotions, as four-legged, furry people. However, Jack London's novel offers a different sort of canine hero: one who is, though personified by the narrator, a dog in every sense of the word.Buck is a German Shepherd-St.Bernard hybrid who journeys from his warm, comfortable home in California to the wilds of Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. He encounters a variety of people and dogs as he struggles to adapt to his new life as a sled dog in the icy tundra of the north. And he encounters himself as well, the primordial wolf within that beckons him to the freedom of the wild.London, through the eyes of Buck, gives the reader a unique perspective on this period of American history while addressing themes and issues that are relevant today. _The Call of the Wild_ is a terrific read for those who have ever contemplated what it means to be truly free - and for those who simply like books about dogs."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"A classic story well-worth reading.

The book told a alot about the rough livesof the characters. &quot;He was beaten(he knew that); but he was not broken.&quot; pg. 6. Is a quote where the main character Buck begins to learn the law of club and fang. The book can be confusing at times, but I think this is a good book for anyone to read."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I thought &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; was an average book. Jack London did a good job on description. &quot;The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars.&quot; Symbolism was also very important. On the flip side, I thought it was a little redundant. The allegory was played to death, and some dramatic parts were almost the same. Overall, it was a decent book. When writing an allegory sometimes it is hard to use ones imagination, because one must keep everything sybolized. If you are looking to read a book that has deeper meaning, I would recommend this book. If you are looking to read a fun book I would not."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"My Opinion of CALL OF THE WILD by Jack Londin is a very interesting book. I Liked it. It kept me reading and i did not want to put it down. Jack made the dogs sound like they were human. That is what captivated me. For example at the very beginning on page one. &quot;Buck never read the newspaper or he would of known the trouble was brewing.&quot; There he tried to make Buck sound like an illiterate person. Then again on page nine when Curly was getting beat up. Buck looked at Spitz and thought &quot;Spitz ran out his tounge and laughed again, from this point on Buck hated Spitz with a bitter and deathless hatred.&quot; If I would give CALL OF THE WILD a grade it would be a B. I liked how Jack London descibed everything and how he made the animals sound like humans."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The book Call of the Wild was in my opinion , a good book to read . It had a little bit of everything in it ( humor, drama , death etc. ) some vocabulary is a bit old-fashioned , but other than that it is very well written . You feel drawn into the story , and will not want to put it awat . London captured the spirit of the gold rush and the savage behavior of the times . ( p24) ' Mercy was a thing reserved for the gentler climes'. On the trail [ in the Yukon ] you have to have both imagination and instinct, such as Buck had to become lead dog and to kill Spitz , who had been the lead dog . Over all this is a book you will want to finish . I would recommend this book to anyone of anyage ."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild by Jack London was a good book that is very well written. There is a lot of description that makes you feel like you can really picture what he is talking about. &quot;Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself togethor for the spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming and a mad glitter in his blood shot eyes.&quot; When you read that it gives you a great mental picture of what London is talking about. Some of the vocabulary is hard to understand because it is old-fashioned. It does help you understand more about the people and the times and makes it more interesting. I would reccomend this book for anyone who likes descriptive books and the outdoors."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I think that everyone should be exposed to this book; if only for the way that the author entices one to feel in the same feeling of hope, and hopelessness for Buck, as he is mistreated and unloved. This story has some parallels to the way humans respond and feel twords others. &quot;For the love of a man&quot; this is the title of chapter six. To me chapter six appears to be the resolution to all th tragedy,that happened prior to buck meeting John Thorton. As I began to assume that the book would only get better; I was wrong. At the end bucks newfound love John Thorton, and his resolution to the abuse and neglect he had undertaken had come into view- it left just as fast. John died, buck returned to the primative, and never gets the life that he deserved. This of coarse wasn't the happy ending that I feel would have been the complete resolution the bucks tragic twisted life. I didn't like how the all of the story was based on the goldrush. However to someone in which this type of topic interests; this would be the choice book for them. I liked how some of the dogs' characters were developed so beautifully; some could've been brought into a more descriptive light. I do recomend this book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack Londons Call of the Wild is a good book. There are many exciting things to happen in this story. After Buck(the main character)is stlen and taken to Yuon,Alaska he has to learn to live in the wild. My favorite part is when Buck kills Spitz(the lead dog,who is very mean). One thing I didn't like about this story is how Buck went through so many mean owners. Bucks best owner was John Thorton who took very good care of him. One time he bet that Buck could pull a thousand poundsof flour,so he took buck in his hands and says &quot;As you love me.&quot; Then Buck did it. Overall this was a good book and I recomend it because it will keep you reading."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild by Jack London has many negatives and positives.The book is very descriptive.The way the author describes the Yukon and their hardships was one of the interesting parts of the book.In the last chapter Buck becomes part of the wild and hears the call,as stated on page 61.&quot;It was the call, the many noted call, sounding mole luringly and compelling then ever before. And never before was he ready to obey. John Thorton was dead.The last tie was broken. Man and the claims of man no longer bound him.&quot;Based on my opinion,one of the negatives of this book is the story is based on the life of a dog and not a humanbeing.Also,it seemed like some of the chapters dragged on and did not get to the point.Over all the book was very interesting and kept me in suspense.I would not soy it was the best book I've ever read, but I do recommened it."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I would strongly stress that you please give The Call of the Wild. This story is great. In this book it has it all suspense, action, and drama. The part of this book that really makes the book great is when Buck, the protagonist and Spitz, the antagonist get into a brawl. This book really kept me on the edge of my seat. Sure it had some flaws, but what book doesn't? This story is also very discriptive about everything, mainly the dogs. The Call of the Wild is a really good book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"My child's shool required the students to purchase a copy of this book with a particular ISBN.

A great classic!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"There's a reason books like this one are called \\"Classics\\" and it's not just because they've been here for a while.Call of the Wild has always been one of my favorites and to read it on my Kindle to my daughter was just as rewarding as reading the paper book.Buck, a Saint Bernard, living the good life in California is suddenly abducted and set into the hard life of a sled dog. His ability to learn fast and his connection to his own instincts save his life more than once.This is a great adventure! Jack London certainly knew how to write from a dogs point of view."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's \\"The Call of the Wild\\" is much more than what could be considered a children's book. It is a unique and harsh depiction of the bitter realities of life in the Yukon during the days of the gold rush. Told from the perspective of the half-wolf Buck, \\"The Call of the Wild\\" allows readers to intimately experience the trails of life in the wild.The relatively short novel, around ninety pages, begins with the kidnapping of Buck from a well-to-do family in southern California and his subsequent arrival in Oregon and final move into Alaska as he is sold and re-sold. Buck initally misses his old life, but as he quickly learns the laws that make up his new world he becomes a fast learner and revels in the daily warfare and struggle for life. He soon becomes one of the best and most legendary sled dogs in the region, drawing admiring and jealous looks from anyone who doesn't own him. While Buck is faithful to his final owner, John Thornton, to the very last, he cannot resist the call to join his wolf brothers in the wild.Jack London's unique premise of telling the story from Buck's point of view offers a remarkably different reading experience from other books that offer a similar perspective - perhaps since this is not just a children's book. There are harsh and bitter realities presented in \\"The Call of the Wild\\" that make it much more of an adult book. London's writing is journalistic at times, simple and straightforward, mixed with a surprisingly lyrical bent at other times. It is an interesting combination that works well for the story he has to tell."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London (1876-1916)was a man of the outdoors who wrote best about nature tooth and claw. In his great novel \\"The Call of the Wild\\" he tells one of the greatest dog stories ever written.Buck is a dog living on the California ranch of Judge Miller. He is kidnapped and shipped to the gold fields of Alaska in the 1890's. Buck was placed in a cage and beaten with savagery by a man in a red shirt in Seattle. Buck was sold to two French fur traders; fought and won a horrific battle to the death with their lead sled dog Spitz and sold to a Scottish half breed. Buck almost dies as he and the team have to travel near the Arctic Circle and Canada for over 3000 miles. The dogs are ill kept being cold, hungry and abused. Later Buck is sold to two brothers and a woman who do not know how to survive in the wild. They too abuse Buck.Buck is rescued when he stumbles into the cabin of the kindly John Thornton who restores him to health. Thornton is killed by Indians so Buck returns to the wild where he roams freely. Buck is a strong, independent dog who learns that only the strong survive in a cruel environment.Jack London penned the novel in 1903. He believed that in the world only those who are tough can survive against enemies. London's world is a harsh, cruel place. The story of Buck and later White Fang in another novel remind us of how difficult life can be in a merciless and hellish setting. The book also reminds us of the need to be kind to animals."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book was mind envigorting and scintytilating. I enjoyed it much and I would would suggest this book for people who like nature and are looking for a good read. It was super duper."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the Wild was an interesting and violent book. If you do not like gore and violence Do Not READ THIS BOOK. It was somewhat boring at parts but then there was excitment and lots fun gore and broken necks. Not the most ecologically accurate book. the book had a unique perspetive of nature and dogs. thank you."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Is one of the best books I have ever read. This book has so much beautiful desciption of the setting, characters, feelings, etc. Jack London has capture the eyes and attention of readers again with this book. His protagonist ( main charatcer ) Buck has a personality that is witty, clever, sophisicated, funny, fierce and firey. The story is told form third person omminescent ( meaning like, Jack London knows the history of all the characters and what the go through and stuff like that. ) London uses what he knows about the wild and dogs and puts it all into this wonderful written book and has the reader let it be known that all dogs and all other small or big animals have a personality of their very own that is unique in every way. I give this book 5 stars becuase of the accuracy of this book and how its told. I hope you take the time out of your day and read some of the call fo the wild. You'll like it. Trust me."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"All over the world children are familiar with the name of this book, most of them have read it actually. I bought it for my son but back home found that he had already read it borrowing from his school library. Interestingly he was still very glad to possess it. That speaks for the appeal of the story and the narrative. Buck is a dog who learns hard lessons of life in the most honorable way and even the adult reader has no difficulty to identify with his struggles with proper dose of emotion the author intended. Buck acquires all the commendable qualities so necessary in an earthly life and retains all the instincts that bind living beings to each other. But then he does something that may have an unwarranted effect on the child's mind. He responds to the call of the wild and reverts back to what a 'dog' meant before human being became involved with this species. Is that a fair comment on civilization? May not this story,in the subconscious, encourage another POL POT, I could not stop wondering! Jack London did not live long enough to know its answer and thus we have to inculcate such values in young minds so that no wrong message is cooked in it. But, still, reading this story is highly recommended for all children."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the Wild is up there with Tolkiens Hobbit/LOTR for me. I have read and then re-read it several times over the years since I was a kid and its greatly entertaining on one level and inspirational on another.COTW is great on many levels. First as a heartwrenching dog/wilderness/adventure story it can't be beat.On another this is one of the most primal, pagan, back to nature, might is right stories ever written."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Everyone who gave The Call of the Wild only 1 star doesn't seem to understand the book. The book is not horrible. Even though Jack London got a little carried away with his descriptions doesn't mean it wasn't a good book. Some things seem unrealistic in the book, but that's not the point. The book is an allegory, which is a story where the characters are symbols of everyday life. Buck is supposed to be &quot;everyone&quot; in the world, and he makes it through life without dying, and he even has a legacy afterwards. All the other dogs, like Spitz, have their own character traits, and they all died. You have to be like Buck; you have to be centered and grounded and you have to know who you are. The theme of the story is &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;. This is what Jack London is trying to say. Don't think I'm an English teacher writing this. I'm in 7th grade and I had to read The Call of the Wild for school. You should think of this book as a great one. Why do you think some expressions and terms used in everyday life today come from The Call of the Wild? Why would people 100 years later read this book? The reason is because it is a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the Wild is an extraordinary book by Jack London. In this book, you follow a dog named Buck. Buck has a good life with his owner, Judge Miller, and lives in Santa Clara Valley, California. But one day, when no one is home, the gardener kidnaps Buck and he is sold again and again across the United States and Canada, all the way to a Klondike region of Canada, where a gold rush is going on. Buck is forced to pull sleds with other dogs, and finds that it is a dog-eat-dog world, literally, and that the only way to survive is to get to the top. But many obstacles get in his way, including a dog named Spitz. Buck's primal instincts come back to him, changing his personality along the way. Jack London does a great job of showing how different your personality can change depending on the situation. I find that this is a very important thing to know and that he shows it very well. This book really made me think, probably due to all of the intense scenes in this book. If you like dogs, action, or Jack London, I definetly recommend this intense book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Rooted in a dramatic phase in history, the 1897 Klondike Gold Rush, The Call Of The Wild is a spectacular novel filled with adventure and suspense. It is a captivating classic, a thrilling tale of a hero who faces numerous unknown risks and damages. Buck, part Scotch Shepherd and part St. Bernard, leads a sheltered life of a ranch dog, who is loved by everyone. Then, kidnapped from his home in California, he is thrown into a world of turmoil. Buck is sold and shipped to Alaska to fulfill the need for sled dogs during the Klondike Gold Rush. Although not ready for the world of the harsh Arctic North, Buck fights to adapt and live. To survive, Buck had to accept and learn the lessons of the arctic. Buck triumphs over all the obstacles and odds. The Call Of The Wild is a fascinating novel because Jack London allows us to see life through the eyes of Buck. You are able to know what Buck feels and thinks. Buck has the talent to see human emotion, weakness, behavior, and thought. Throughout the novel, Buck expresses the qualities of strength, loyalty, and intelligence. Another interesting aspect of this novel is that London makes each of the dogs an individual, he gives them each their own personality. London also makes this novel exciting by telling it &quot;like it was&quot; To survive in the harsh klondike was a struggle. In Buck's fight to survive in the north, we understand London's personal beliefs. London believed that &quot; all life was a struggle in which the weak fell by the way and only the best, the super beings, could hope to rise. This idea influenced London very much, and appears strongly throughout The Call Of The Wild. Selling more than two million hard bound copies in just the United States, The Call Of The Wild has succeeded tremendously. Filled with adventure, this novel could be compared to to other novels by Jack London, such as White Fang and The Sea - Wolf. Another author whose books are written similar to Jack London's is Gary Paulsen. Author of The Hatchet, The River, Dogsong,and The Haymeadow, Gary Paulsen is the &quot; distinguished author of many critically acclaimed books for young people, including three Newbery Honor Books.&quot; Both Jack London and Gary Paulsen's books are filled with realism which satisfies adventure - hungry readers. Jack London had great determination and was a very astonishing man. London knew the positives and negatives of life. Poverty, suffering, trouble, and pain were something London was forced to endure. However, he never let his misfortunes defeat him. Instead, he turned his zest for life into stories which could be a reminder to all people that you can achieve anything, as long as you put your heart and soul into it."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"It is not surprising that this book continues over time to be a classic, enjoyed and re-read many times, as I* have re read it over and over...

I'd even rate this 6/5!!!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"It was one of those books I knew of but had never read. I loved it. I just believed that London was the dog.

Buck, a dog living on a California estate in the Santa Clara Valley, is stolen and shipped to the Klondike where he is trained as a sled dog. After a series of adventures, he heeds &quot;the call of the wild&quot; and abandons human civilization. London was able to draw on his experiences in the Klondike in the late 1890s to provide accurate details of the life and on the environment. In a way, this book might be considered an alegory; about the return to one's roots, the fight for survival in a hostile environment, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed it. In July of 1998, the editorial board of the Modern Library listed this book as one of the top 100 novels written in the English language for the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I think I originally read this in 6th or 7th grade. I remember thinking it was okay, but not as good as White Fang. Well, it's a lot better than I remember. Though it may be generally regarded as a young person's novel, it also stands up well to the test of a true literary classic. Yes, it's about a dog, it's also about spirit, survival, will, and the primitive forces in anyone. It's a quick and easy read that I would recommend to anyone, regardless of reading level or interest."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I found this book a most compelling read. On the surface, this is an exciting story about Buck, a dog whose life is dramatically changed as he moves (or is stolen) from owner to owner. It is a wonderfully exciting read as he travels from California to Alaska in the Klondike days. Still, there are some underlying themes in this well-written novel: the struggle for Buck to adjust to his environment that constantly changes; to excel not only as the most powerful, but rather as the master of his world. I didn't want this book to end."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I see the literary genius of the book, the writers ability to get into the head of a dog and portray all his experiences from its's perspective. The harshness, starvation, brutality, and death were difficult to listen to and I kept expecting Buck to crook, but there were moments of kindness and warmth that made this not quite as sad."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of The Wild is an adventerous, wonderful book. You should read it if you like happy endings and like adventures. In the beggining a nice dog from a rich family gets dognapped. As you can imagine it would probably be scary for a dog whos only been hugged and kept in walls. He gets sold to some men who deliver medicine. He works his way up to the top, has fights with husky's , and has many ferocious adventures. It is very sad in the beging but the ending is very happy. White Fang is another good book by the same author who wrote Call of The Wild."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the Wild, a story of strength, courage, and survival. Buck, the main character of the book, started out as a nice and pampered dog loved by almost everyone in his town. But that soon changed when people discovered a small, shiny speck that set everyone going to the Yukon Territory, gold. Everyone wanted strong dogs that could haul all the equipment needed to survive the rigid climates of Alaska. Unfortunately, Buck was the kind of dog the miners were looking for. He was immediately captured and sold to go to Alaska which started his transformation. While he was in Alaska he faced many hardships, which I thought were very sad and somewhat gruelsome, but he went on withstanding the pain and suffering he faced during the journey. His characteristics and personality almost made me think that he was an actual person instead of a fictional dog. With the hard and dangerous life he had in the undesirable condition, he eventually turned from a dog that had a relaxed life to a wolf-like creature struggling to survive in the harsh conditions. He had many confrontations with men and other dogs which many were very sad and painful for Buck. But there was still hope for Buck because he now had the wild side of him to sort of comfort him. That hope enlarged even more when he met John Thorton. The moment Buck met Thorton, it was a bond that was to last until time has come to end it. At first Buck and Thorton were inseparable with Buck following Thorton around everywhere he went. But later, his wild counterparts began to grow larger than the bond with Thorton and started to go out into the wilderness separating from Thorton. Out in the wilderness, Buck soon befriended his first wild friend, which made him fit even more into the wild. When Buck and Thorton's ties were finally broken after a very sad and heartbreaking tragedy, Buck knew exactly where to go, to the call of the wild. With Jack London's talented writing, this masterpiece of classic literature gives a different style of writing that I think is unique from all the rest.

It was moving and suspenceful at times. It was about a dog and his many owners. He was at Judge Miller\`s, train, two sled dog owner and John Thornton. Buck goes through a lot. He pulls a 1000 pound sled. He races a sled to the Alaskan Klondike for gold. He also finally gets an owner who loves Buck for Buck not as a racer or a hero to pull 1000 pounds on a sled but as a dog. Then Buck saves the life of his owner John Thornton and finds a wolf. I can\`t share the end though.I think it was a good book. It was sort of like real life because people go from job to job and at least one person appreciates them for who they are inside. It was like my life because I moved houses when my dad left to visit him. It was like going on a train ride to somewhere new. I didn\`t have it as hard as Buck. He was a loyal dog and never gave up. Over all it was a great book. I would not recommend it for any one under 5th grade.I read it and had a little trouble with the hard words."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book is an excellent choice for anybody that likes action adventure.

The wolf goes through many obstacles. In my life I went through many obstacles I feel a personnel connection. This author is well known for writing. I would recommend this book to 9th graders.

He uses the backdrop of the unforgiving Yukon and the main character Buck as a metaphor of a child growing up and trying to adapt to the everyday toil of being an adult of an unsympathetic world. Jack London can be like a modern day Aesop talking about his philosophies of the world. His character though strong and powerful on an individual basis was subjugated and dictated to the whim of his master no matter how he tried to establish dominance over the master he realized that he will suffer consequences if he doesn't conform to his master's wishes. Also as a part of the pack of other dogs he establishes control and struggles for dominance assuming that it is the only way to survive.I disagree that this book on its own should be considered a book that is just for kids because I found a new depth reading this book and relate to the story and the author's motivation for reading the book. London was a person who was bored with the monotony of toiling with menial jobs and decided to look for adventure. How many people out there in the world today feel the same way as London frustrated with their living condition and need space to experience new ideas and sense the opulent and tangible treasure that the world has to offer. This book is a look into the psyche of London and any person that longs for something more than 'just another day at the office.'"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The book The Call of the Wild: The Call Of the Wild is an extremely good book.

The book is about a dog named Buck and this story is told through his eyes. He lives in a big mansion in Sun Kiss, California. With a lot of money Judd Milley lives with his family and staff. He is kidnaped by the gardener's assistant then sold to a man who sends him around the USA and canada and ends up on a boat. That reaches a beach in Alaska. He is forced into a harness and has to pull a sled to where the mushers think there is gold. He gets in touch with his wild side and learns the only way to survive is to get to the top. But spitz gets in the way of making it to the top. Buck has many owners in the frozen waste land. But he only loves one of them, Joe Throton, a kind hearted musher. He takes good care of Buck. Buck and Throton find gold in a rocky valley. The dogs rest and the humans mine every day for the shining metal that controls all humans. Buck gets more in touch with his inner best and starts going out on hunts and kills big game animals. He comes back from an unsuccessful hunt to find Thronton and friends dead. He then goes on the hunt of a life time.Buck the main character is a 140 pound dog with thick black and brown fur. He is aggressive and fierce. Joe Throton is loving to Buck and spends time talking to buck by the fire side. Spitz is a minor character and fights Buck for leadership over the pack. He is fierce and violent.I think this book is great for people who enjoy adventure books it is very sad and violent and filled with gore. The book gets into the fights too much, for example,\\" Buck sinned his teeth into the jugular of the starving husky and the fill of warm blood splashed all over him warming him from the cool wind blasting down from the Arctic sky.\\" I would give this book a nine out of ten. I hope you read this book, it opens your eyes to the greed of men when gold comes into view. You have to find out what happens to Buck on his wild hunt for revenge."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"\\"The Call of the Wild\\" is a classic. I first read this book in grade school and recently decided to revisit the story. While it is a short read, it is enjoyable.Buck is taken from his easy life as a loyal pet to serve as a sled dog for a cruel master. As Buck struggles to gain his footing as a sled dog, he struggles with the lead dog that is symbolic of all oppressive authority figures. Like many of foes, Buck thrashes the lead dog in his path to legendary status. It was not until Buck has John Thornton as his sole master that he finds true companionship again. But when Buck looses John, his transformation from house pet to wild animal is completed. Achieving difficult feats and proving his mark in the wild, Buck becomes a legend in the frozen wastelands of the Yukon.In prose that can be easily understood by young readers, this book can be enjoyable for all ages. When it comes to stories from the perspectives of animals, Jack London has no peers."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I haven't read this in a long time but I decidecd to the other nights and I know why now. Jack London wrote this about some of his experiences when he left for the Yukon in the late 1800's gold rush, but it is written through the point of view of Buck, a half German Shepherd, half Saint Bernard 140 pound dog who was owned by a Judge and once lived on a nice estate in Santa Clara, CA. Buck was stolen by one of the judges workers and sold to be taken to the Yukon as a sled dog, at a time when evidently this was very popular. Upon getting there he is beaten for the first time until he realizes man is the boss and he must obey. He then is bought and quickly learns the \\"law of club and fang\\" and how to survive in the frigiid Canandian winter. After seeing a few dogs get killed by other dogs when losing a dog fight, he quickly learns to kill or be killed in afight. He eventullay clashes with the lead dog in a do or die fight that was waiting to happen and by pure brute force and pride he takes over as lead dog and helps his owners set new records in time across the Yukon. When that trip is done he is sold to some half wit dog sleighers and he quickly loses his strenghth as well as most of the other dogs until he refuses to go anymore and gets beaten to near death only to be saved by a loving man, as the team he was with goes on they quickly fall through the ice and die. His new owner brings him back to strength and gets to loving Buck like he is not used to.

It follows the story of Buck, and dog who is yanked out of his lazy life by a cruel gardener and forced to travel to the Yukon to aid men (and women) in search of gold. He experiences intolerable cruelty; he gets beaten and whipped almost to death, he is almost starved by a set of owners, and he learns the basic rule of thumb; kill or be killed. He often fights with the other lead dog until he finally knocks him off. It isn't until he is taken care of and showed what real love means by John Thornton that he finally warms up to humans again. But his love is cut short when a group of Yee-hats kill his entire team; Thornton, the other dogs of the team, and Thornton's friends. He then becomes full of rage; he spies the Yee-hats some distance away and knocks off almost the entire pack. He wanders around, not quite conscious of what has happened until a wolf pack come along...then he finally recieves \\"the call\\"; hence \\"The Call of the Wild\\"This is one of the best books I have ever read, but also the saddest I've ever read. It had a huge impact on me; I wasn't quite sure of it until I almost burst into tears when talking about it.

Then after that, this wonderful animal is beaten by a man with a club and from a house dog he turns to a mean, growling, fighting for food, sled dog? Well Buck in Call of the Wild had to; He is a long gray haired St. Bernard- Scotch shepherd. His former owner was Judge Miller. Manuel, Judge Miller's gardener, stole Buck when Judge was sleeping. Talk about harsh! The man with the club was named Morgan. He was a bad man.I liked this book from beginning to end. It was exciting and fun; I was never bored. I liked the way Jack London wrote the book, I got lost in words I couldn't put it down. I saw in my head what was going on, like a movie. The most exciting part was when Buck was in a fight with the lead dog, Spitz, and won! I thought the ending was the best, it made my heart feel light and happy; I can't tell you the ending for that will give the whole book away. I did not like it when Buck was beaten to start moving when he was tired, Also when Morgan hit him with the club, over and over again until the scared Buck stopped attacking, it made me mad and I wanted to jump in the book and hurt those mean people, But of course they are just characters. This story is action packed; it will make you sit up straight and read for hours. I recommend this for people ages 6-up and for animal lovers everywhere. I also think Jack London's creative fictions will make everybody's imagination go wild, especially if you love action adventure animal stories."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In this book, The Call of the Wild, there is non-stop action keeping the reader always want to continue.

Jack London puts you in the mind of a dog which makes this book different and more unique than many others. This dog is the main character and his name is Buck. He is half St. Bernard and half Scottish sheperd. In the beginning of the book, Buck lives with a judge and his children in his California home. Buck is a good-natured dog who loves to be around people. One day, Buck is kidnapped and shipped to Alaska where he is trained as a sled dog. He has two masters who he has faith in. Their names are Francois and Perrault. They are both French Canadians and know the land very well but, Buck realizes the many troubles in the Alaska and meets his main enemy, Spitz. Spitz is a vicious and brute tempered dog. Buck first despises Spitz when he and a pack of wolves killed a well-mannered dog, but is weak so Spitz decided to kill him. Buck never forgets the gruesome moments of this. In the middle of the book, Francois and Perrault disappear and Buck has two new leaders of the slay. They are Hal and Charles.

Buck and Spitz have a malicious dogfight. How will fight for the rest of their life?

Read The Call of the Wild by Jack London.David LA7"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The classic book THE CALL OF THE WILD by early-20th Century American author Jack London is one of the timeless novels that should be read by all children of late-elementary school age. I was 11 when I first read it, and it made quite an impression on me. Having grown up with two cats, and being very interested in dogs, this book really spoke to the animal-lover within me. It is the story of Buck, a family-devoted Saint Bernard living in the late-19th Century, whose peaceful existence is robbed when he is sold into slavery by the devious gardener. Shipped up to Alaska, he is mercilessly beaten and made to join a dog-sled team by Alaskan Gold-Rushers who care little else about anything but gold. Speaking from a unique third-person perspective that closely follows Buck and his thoughts, the author concentrates on what Buck must do, and indeed, what he must become in order to survive. The result is a story that is intriguing, sad and hopeful.I ended up reading THE CALL OF THE WILD several times when I was 11 & 12. Although this is a book that I believe should be read by all kids between the ages of 9-12, I caution any potential readers under the age of 9 that this is a fairly violent story; it may disturb them more than entertain or inform. I think that it should definitely be made into a modern full-length feature film (probably animated, so that real dogs are not subjected to these kind of conditions). If so, it should easily get a PG-rating, which I believe is appropriate in terms of drawing the right age group to see it. I know that WHITE FANG, another London classic which I have also read, was made into a feature film several years ago; unseen as of yet by me, it was a highly regarded live-action PG-rated film that was enjoyed by many.THE CALL OF THE WILD is one of the early-20th Century American literary treasures that is as important as anything written by John Steinbeck, William Faulkner or F. Scott Fitzgerald.

Buck, his master, and his master's friends went on a search North for gold in the 1800's. Buck explores the woods while he leaves his family at camp to dig bags and bags of gold.

London starts out the novel by telling his readers the story of a half St. Bernard, half sheep dog, named Buck, whose living the good life on an estate in California's Santa Clara Valley, when all at once his life drastically changes forever, and he must learn how to fend for himself in the cold, harsh wilderness where the only morality is killed-or-be-killed. This is told through the eyes of the main character, Buck, who takes a long bumpy ride from the &quot;good life&quot; to something completely new to Buck. Along the way Buck loses some close friends, meets some people you'll grow to hate and finds himself the ideal caring master whom he grows quite fond of. But don't think the story ends there; Buck continues having wild adventures up until the very end of the book. I think this novel is good for most all ages. While the young may not understand the deeper meanings and themes of the book, they will be enthralled by the thrills and chills of the main character Buck, while the older more mature readers will surely be enticed by the deeper meanings London writes about. I personally enjoyed this book; though it did seem to drag on from time to time it is definitely a book worth reading!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"&quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; is a novel written by Jack London, the &quot;most widely&quot; read author in the world at the turn of the twentieth century. London lived a wild life, traveled the continent of North America, and committed suicide at the age of forty. London's story about Buck, a family pet stolen and sold to be a sled dog, is a realistic tail of the Alaska Gold Rush. Buck's new life is a hard one as he learns to adapt to the cruelty of people, animals, and the weather. Buck learns from his experiences that some people and animals are good and kind, and others are cruel and deadly. London, also, learns from his experiences in the Northwest, and the experiences make his novel seem to be true of that time and that place. London's life was not an easy one, and the life he created for Buck was not an easy one. When I read &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, I was impressed by the way Buck survives the cruel treatment and the harsh land of Alaska. The realism in the story suggest the way life really is. Some people, like Hal, are cruel and show no mercy. Other people, like John Thornton, are kind as he saves Buck's life. I wish that Jack London could have had a friend like John Thornton in his life."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"London achieved his masterpiece with this book. He never wrote anything better than THE CALL Of THE WILD (first called THE SLEEPING WOLF). It's also to redeem the dog race, which he condemned in a short story entitled \\"Diablo\\". Ironically, London originally started out writing a short story, and instead it kept growing and growing until it reached a novel length.In the late 19th century early 20th century naturalism (a literary movement that places value on science and observation with the mindset that there is no fixed morality - its only chemical by-products) is just beginning to catch hold. Naturalism is a direct response to Realism, which Huck Finn is a prime example. Realism came about as a literary movement in the late 1860s after the Civil War, because the writers wanted to point toward a moral code. The movement started to fail in the late 1880s or 1890s because things weren't getting better. Naturalism, especially in this book (although CALL OF THE WILD has many things foreign to naturalism as well), contends there is no moral code, and that the way to get to the true explanation of life is to really get back to nature and observation and science. Although fundamentally opposed to naturalism (read C. S. Lewis's ABOLITION OF MAN for a detailed argument, as well as THE CASE FOR CHRISTIANITY, the first two books in MERE CHRISTIANITY), I like this book quite a bit. Why? Glad you asked. Lets take this story and make Buck a human. Would the story have been well received? No. It would have gotten the same treatment SISTER CARRIE did. The sheer genius in this book rests in the fact that Buck is a dog, and, being a dog, London can do quite a bit more. The moral code doesn't really apply to animals in this fallen world. There are also strong evolutionary themes in this work (Darwin just recently becoming popular in that era).Another paradox to this work, since it is supposed to be naturalist, is how much Buck transforms. In most naturalist novels the characters hardly learn anything through the course of the novel (look at Carrie at the beginning and at the end of Drieser's novel - she doesn't learn anything really, as opposed to Realist work where the moral is always clearly stated) - not so with this book. Buck not only learns but he becomes progressively more and more powerful. The interesting thing about this novel lies in the fact that, although supposedly naturalistic, in the end Buck becomes a mythic character. There are twelve elements of myth, and this reaches all of them. There is a book (A Hero With A Thousand Faces I think) that goes through them all. Anyway, and it shows up in SISTER CARRIE as well with the rocking chair serving as the symbolism, the major preoccupation with naturalist writers is why do humans have this constant yearning for something more? London doesn't have the answers (because he didn't have Jesus), and, for a naturalist novel, the ending is very strange and out of place because it ends in a romanticized and impossible mythic realm, in a valley where the gold crowds the river beds and Buck becomes a legendary terror among the Yeehats.One theme that struck me as very interesting is the theme of man (or in the case dog) against society - or more appropriately Civilization. Civilization imposes rigid and unnatural things Buck, and he becomes aloof from all. London describes him as a lord, and he has no real love. Yet, as he abandons these conventions of Civilization (and in many cases morality), he falls in love with (in a man-dog relation can go of course - lets not get indecent here) John Thornton. Yet even his love for Thornton he must abandon for the Call of the Wild. It seems (although, as it is a dog, the lines are a lot more blurred since a lot of what London says is true for animals, but not for the human race) the closer you get to the real primal creature and abandon society's convention, the closer to the real world you are. If you take that to apply to humans, its true and it's a lie. Man has two natures within him, one for righteousness the other for sin. If you are a Christian, then you will end in the place where Buck did - that land of myth that is impossible in this world. But if you indulge your sin nature and do not come to Jesus in the end you will go to.Something must be said for WHITE FANG. WHITE FANG is this novel in reverse. It's a story of a dog who becomes civilized, and although CALL is better WF is very good. I tend to look upon them as companion works, with one tracing the harkening back to the wild and the other the domestication of dogs.There is also a complex economic underpinning to this novel. Jack London proclaimed himself a socialist, and yet bragged that he wrote novels for money. Much of the motivation in this novel is economics - why would people go up to the Klondike in the first place but to get gold? And in the end they end in the valley of gold, that land of myth.Jack London was a contradictory man. Much like Buck, he had come out of the states and went to live in London in the slums, a horrible place, one of the worst on earth at that time. This corresponds to Buck going from sunkissed California to the Klondike, and London sought out the extremes in both situations. In the end he committed suicide, dying at the age of 40.(Just a side note: Buck is involved in the transmission of the mail at first, and at the end of the book he involves himself in the transmission of the male genetics...."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild is about a dog who is stolen and trained to be a sled dog.

Loved the story. I appreciate that I can get some of these books and finish off some of my \\"must reads\\"."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This is the novel that made Jack London famous, and rightfully so. The Call of the Wild is a masterpiece that belongs on any top ten list of American literature. Its excellence is made even more remarkable by the fact that its protagonist is a dog. Due to this singular characteristic, or maybe because of the various sanitized versions in print and film aimed at young audiences, many who haven't read the novel erroneously presume it's a children's book. Though it's true one could categorize this work in the genre of adventure fiction, any designation as children's literature could not be further from the truth. It is a brutal and at times frightening story, constructed upon a foundation of deep scientific and philosophical thought.The dog in question is Buck, a giant Saint Bernard/shepherd mix who leads a comfortable existence on the California ranch of one Judge Miller. The Klondike Gold Rush of the 1890s erupts, creating a demand for quality dogs needed for the difficult work of pulling sleds. Buck, suddenly a very valuable commodity, is stolen from his idyllic home and whisked away to the harsh wilderness of the North, essentially becoming a canine slave. Buck at first resists his captors, but after frequent beatings he realizes his survival depends upon prudent obedience and opportunistic cunning. Once thrust into this world of violence and toil, Buck not only adapts to his harsh new life but learns to thrive on it.The Call of the Wild is truly a beautiful piece of writing that outshines anything else London produced in the early Klondike period of his career. Each sentence is poetically crafted, and imbued with an almost Emersonian insistence of the dignity and majesty of nature. A love of dogs is not a prerequisite for enjoying this book, but a love of nature may very well be. Buck and the other dogs in this novel are symbols for the myriad ways in which different specimens of mankind react to the conflict between the harsh reality of nature and the comfortable illusion of civilization. Though in some respects the dogs act as surrogates for human behaviors and attitudes, London does not anthropomorphize these animals. The subhuman psychology he relates is based on the sound empiricism of natural observation. With the exception of some brief speculations into Buck's experiences with ancestral memories, the canine behavior described here does not overstep the boundaries of science.In The Call of the Wild, London has created the ultimate literary manifestation of Darwin's theory of evolution. Buck's world is governed by \\"the law of club and fang\\", a paraphrasing of Darwin's \\"survival of the fittest\\". There is no good or evil in London's depiction of nature. The only morality present in this primordial world is Pantheistic and Stoic: Nature is always right. When Buck is removed from civilization, his prehistoric instincts take over, and while the life he lives may be harsh and brutal, the freedom gained is more than reward enough to offset the hardship. Buck is allowed to choose between savage and civilized. Though today that's a choice few are able to make, London's masterpiece hearkens back to a more primitive time in humanity's past, striking a chord with the animal nature buried deep within us that longs to be unleashed."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This abridgement keeps the story line and characters of the original, but cuts out a lot of the descriptions, scene-setting, and sermons to make the book more managable for kids. Still, nothing can take Jack London's story of human malice and cruelty, and the viciousness of dog-status fights to the death, and turn it into a sweet story for dog lovers.Buck, the dog, descends the ladder from loyal and loving pet, to chained and beaten cringer, to skulking wanna-be, to dog killer, to watching humans die, to killing humans.The call of the wild means that inside every good and decent creature, there is a vicious and snarling animal. Only civilization keeps us mannered and orderly.People think this is a story for children, and it's fine as a moral cautionary tale, but it's not entertaining family reading."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I may not remember just how this was described, but I thought it would be more new. It is not too bad, just not as new as I thought it would be."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Summary:When: During Gold Fever; \\"There's plenty of gold in the west!\\"The life of a pampered dog takes an unexpected twist when he is traded away into labor-intensive work in an underhand transaction. Once the proud Saint Bernard-Shepherd dog of a judge, Buck's new owners are gold diggers, determined to find gold in the west no matter how thorny the expedition may be. The weather is bitter, the weather is glacial, and Buck experiences the harshness of starvation, death of loved ones, hard labor, and bullying from other animals. Buck must find a way to cultivate and develop stamina and energy when his owners' resolve lead to few rest stops and food breaks. Along the journey into the west, Buck's perceptions on life change. At first, Buck detested his captors, but later he begins to respect and admire them. He learns to cower in fear to humans, fight for his life and strength when no one else will, gain respect from his fellow dogs, and be trusting of one human trekker in particular.Perception:As someone who is not particularly fond of dogs or animals in general, I found this book to be a real page turner. The Call of the Wild is not simple a story about a dog and his survival of the winter. It is about the broader aspect of life. We emphasize with Buck when he must adapt to being beaten and deprived of love, we shed a few tears when we see how much perseverance Buck developed to ensure his survival. The characters, sights, sounds, and descriptions of the atmospheres and personalities are credible and helped me visualize exactly what was going on easily. The way Buck changes and grows throughout the story inspires me to reach beyond the realm of possibility in my endeavors."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"A peaceful dog named Buck lives a happy life in the South on a farm. He enjoys it there but suddenly one night he gets stolen. He is sent all the way up north when sled dogs are needed to help with the gold mine. On the way Buck is beaten and punished. When Buck gets to the North, he quickly learns that you have to fight for your survival or you die. Buck is handed over through many hands and watches many other dogs fall in the harsh struggle. Finally when the day Buck falls into the snow and has no strength to get up, a courageous man saves his life. After this Buck learns what real love and passion is. Never in his life has he felt this way till now. These are just a few of the details Jack London uses in his adventurous book about a courageous dog named Buck.Jack London is a very strong writer but some of the things that really stood out to me were his details, diction, and the theme. These strong literary elements made the book fun and enjoyable to read. The details made the novel exciting and tense; this kept you wanting to keep reading after every chapter. The details also made it easy to follow. There was never a time when I didn't understand what I was reading. Also the diction made the novel complex. Not in the confusing way but the rich juicy and vivid way. It gave the characters their own personalities. This also contributed to the not so confusing part but mainly made it thrilling to read. Finally the theme was amazing. It talked about a spoiled dog going from the easy going life to the harsh and cold life in the North. Buck persevered throughout the whole journey and showed tremendous courage. He put effort into what he did and gave it his best even when the circumstances weren't the best. These are just some of the main qualities that stood out in my mind when I read this engaging book.There are a couple of parts in this novel that require the reader's discretion. There is a little bit of violence and a power struggle. There is minimal violence but it is there. A couple deaths but nothing distracted from the overall quality of the book. There is also a point where the team of dogs goes against the drivers which is considered risky behavior but there isn't much description one either of these topics and only briefly happens.This book is probably meant for mature 12 year olds with an average reading skill level. It does have some complex words and difficult, but yet strong diction. This is an American classic so you should be able to find this at your local library or easily online. I really suggest this book, and it's very entertaining. Just because this book is controversial doesn't mean that you shouldn't read it. I hope you like it just as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I not only ordered the book but also purchased the audible book.

At the time, I was in elementary school and I checked it out from the middle school library when we were on an orientation visit. I found it so interesting that I proceeded to read everything of his that I could find. London's expression of events from the perspective of the dog and the innate killer instinct of Buck combine to make an accurate story about nature, the kill or be killed reality of survival.Yet, Buck is also capable of great love, his actions when he is with Thornton expresses the best traits of a domesticated dog, loyalty, courage and intelligence. Buck defends Thornton when attacked, rescues him from a watery death and engages in simple affectionate play. A true classic of American literature, this is a book that all children should read.

I had to read this for my english classes and i really enjoyed it. Basically, it's about a somewhat spoiled dog named Buck, who gets kidnapped and taken to the snowy wilderness of alaska during the klondike gold rush back in the 1800's, and it tells all about what he endured, how he was able to get much tougher than before and finally, how he meets a human he can really love, john thornton. I don't want to spoil the ending, so you'll have to read to find out what happens in the end! wil he make it back? or will he be willing to stay in the frozen north? it will have some parts where the dogs endure some pretty harsh challenges and cruel humans. you will love it"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The book The Call of the Wild is a fantastic story about a dog going to Alaska and trying to survive in harsh conditions. The theme of the story is survival. The main setting is freezing Alaska. The main character of the story is a dog-named Buck. Buck is a mix of a St. Bernard and a Scotch Shepard. He is mainly a gray color and is very aggressive when someone or something aggravates him. He is a quick learner, and adapted to Alaska within a few days. He mainly learned from the other dogs by observing them. Buck learned the dog law in Alaska, The Law of Club and Fang, which is kill or be killed, and eat or be eaten. The main conflict is Buck trying to survive and the resolution is when Buck is finally free and can freely roam Alaska. In the story Buck has two jobs. The first is with two good owners: Perrault and Francois, who grew to love Buck and cried when they were done with their job and traded him and the crew. On that one, they were delivering items to Dawson and back. The second trip was much harder, because he had three owners: Two of them were mean men while the other was a woman that cried all the time. They delivered mail, which was much heavier and made a harder trip which lead to an unhappy turn of events. In the first part of the story, Buck is in his hometown in California, and his owner sells him. Next, he gets in Alaska and sets off on his first job. After a while, he goes on his second journey. Finally, Buck is free to roam in Alaska. He is now acting like his wolf ancestors. I recommend reading this fantastic and heartwarming book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I read this book over and over as a child and after reading it again this past week, I see so much value in it. A story told from a dog's point of view, it teaches children empathy for animals and that value cannot be overrated. One might make the mistake of thinking that because it is written from the dog's POV, it is trite or cutesy...it's not. It is gritty and realistic, emphasizing how a man's character can often be revealed in the manner he treats animals.A rollicking adventure from start to finish, expect to cry and be overjoyed as you read. I would recommend that you read it before giving it to a child, just to make sure it is age appropriate for their developmental stage."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This is a powerful tale of survival of the fittest in the Alaskan Wilderness. It's the story of Buck, a large St. Bernard/Collie kidnapped (or dognapped) for the Klondike Alaska Gold Rush of 1897. Mistreated and passed between human owners, Buck quickly learns to survive by stealing food, and fighting for leadership of the hounds pulling the dogsled. Buck happily comes under the ownerships of kindly John Thornton, but turns savagely vengeful after Thornton is killed. Later, he joins a wolf pack in the wild. This story is told from Buck's point of view, and the descriptions of a frigid, unforgiving wilderness inspire many readers. Others are moved by the author's take on the dark side of human nature and the Darwinian struggle to survive.Author Jack London (1876-1916) knew of the stark wilderness from his participation in the 1897 Gold Rush. Readers might also like his other writings like SEA WOLF and WHITE FANG."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In the book, The Call Of the Wild, by Jack London, an abused dog named Buck is stolen by an evil groundskeeper named Manuel. After many struggles and challenges he is sent north to Canada were he peruses the role as a sled dog. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good dog story.This book was one of the best books I have ever read and held it reputation throughout the whole thing. The main Theme of the book was to inform people that if you ever have problems or challenges in your life, stay strong and overcome them. This book also helped alert people that dogs are being abused everywhere and that they are living things just like us.Buck goes through many owners, one selling him to the next and so on so forth. The new owner hurts and pushing him more then the one before. When Buck gets to his final owner, John Thornton loves Buck just as much as buck loves him. This really shows because when Buck hears the call of the wild he feels the temptation to run off and chase it, but he resists the erg simply for the love of a man. One of Bucks former owners had a very fun accent witch made the book way more fun and interesting.In conclusion this was a great and interesting book with believable characters and a terrific story line. I would surely recommend this book to any reader of any age looking for a satisfactory book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"All of The Whole Story books are fantastic.

In 1903, Jack London was hard up for cash and had just completed the manuscript. He sold the serial rights to the Saturday Evening Post for $700 and, since the editors were not all that keen on his first choice, suggested the title \\"The Sleeping Wolf.\\" (Interestingly enough, the magazine version did not even include what has probably become the book's most famous scene: when John Thornton blusteringly makes a wager that Buck can pull a sled weighing half a ton.)Soon after, Macmillan agreed to take a chance on the unknown writer and offered to publish the book for $2,000, with no royalties. By this time, London had warmed to his initial title, \\"The Call of the Wild,\\" but left the final choice up to his editor. Both the magazine and the book publisher reluctantly used London's now-famous title, and seven years later London wrote to his editor, reminding him of his tin ear: \\"I'll be damned if that very muchly-rejected title didn't become a phrase in the English language. This is only one of many experiences concerning titles, wherein editors, booksellers, and publishers absolutely missed.\\"But it still boggles the mind that London earned a grand total of $2,700 for a book that quickly sold more than two million copies.And what a book! I must have read it three or four times as a youngster, but even now, over twenty years since I last picked it up, it still manages to electrify me. \\"The Call of the Wild\\" is often cited as the best work of fiction ever written about dogs, but the book is equally about men--and about London himself. As a puppy, Buck is like a human child--dependent on his benefactors and with few cares in the world. But soon he is wrenched from his first home, ending up in Alaska to perform the most menial tasks in appalling conditions for a series of contemptible owners--much like the impoverished London himself who, beginning at the age of 14, went from cannery employee to oyster pirate to jute mill laborer to vagrant to prisoner to laundry worker to would-be gold prospector. In such conditions, both dogs and humans resort to their most primitive, robotic instincts.\\"The Call of the Wild,\\" however, is not only about descent into feral survivalism. It's also about the irrepressible yearning for independence and even solitude, and it shares a good deal, thematically, with London's social writings. If you tend to think that London's masterpiece is little more than a work of children's literature, you might want to visit it again and see how it works as an allegory. While it's certainly a great novel about dogs, it's also a perceptive statement on the human condition."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"London is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. His writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. This isn't a story to read when you are depressed. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors. The story he tells is stark and real, and as such, it is not pretty picture he paints, nor an elevating story he writes.As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes. Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches.Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with, he thrives. Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to \\"the call of the wild,\\" becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The two rivals circle the ring, probing for any point of weakness. The duel has lasted longer than either competitor had anticipated. Weakened by fatigue, the challenger feints high and goes for a crippling blow. No, this is not a boxing title match in Las Vegas. This is a life-and-death struggle of one domestic dog for survival in the cold, icy, barren regions of the Alaskan plains. This is a clash between the civilized and the primordial. This is the conflict between domestication and liberation. This is the Call of the Wild.Jack London centers his story on a dog by the name of Buck. Buck is a big, strong dog, his father being a St. Bernard and his mother being a Scottish shepherd dog. At one hundred and forty pounds, Buck was no mere house pet. Kept physically strong with a love of rigorous swimming and constant outdoor exercise, Buck was a lean, formidable dog. Undoubtedly, his great condition was part of the reason that the gardener's helper dog-napped and sold him to dog traders, who in turn sold him to Canadian government mail couriers. The gold rush in Alaska had created a huge demand for good dogs, which eventually led to the &quot;disappearances&quot; of many dogs on the West Coast. Buck was no exception. He was sold into a hostile environment, which was unforgiving and harsh. Although civilization domesticated him from birth, Buck soon begins almost involuntarily to rediscover himself, revealing a &quot;primordial urge&quot;, a natural instinct, which London refers to as the Call of the Wild.This book is set in the Klondike, a region in Alaska that was literally stormed by thousands of men looking to get rich quick via the gold rush. Transportation was increasingly important, but horses were near useless in winter, prone to slip and fall on snow and ice. Dogs were by far the best means of transportation in Alaska at the time, somewhere near the end of the 19th century. As the demand for dogs grew, the prices for good dogs skyrocketed. This price hike inevitably created a black-market- style selling of dogs, and the gardener's helper Manuel did what many men did; they sold the dogs for a good price.A recurring theme in London's novel is the clash between natural instinct and domesticated obedience. Soon after the dog traders captured Buck, a man broke him with a club. Buck is thoroughly humiliated, but learned an all-important truth of the wild: The law of club and fang. Kill or be killed. Survival is above all. Buck resolved to himself to give way to men with clubs. In the beginning, Buck had problems with this new restriction, but learned that when his masters' hands hold whips or clubs, he must concede. However, that did not keep Buck from doing little deeds like stealing a chunk of bacon behind his masters' backs. However, as London says, &quot;He did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his stomach . In short, the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them.&quot; In this way Buck learns the way of the wild but also acknowledges his inferiority to men with clubs or whips. Eventually in this novel, Buck throws away his old life completely and replaces it with his natural urge, the primordial version of himself, the Call of the Wild.Another underlying theme is the relationship between dog and master. In the beginning, Buck is acquainted with the Judge with a dignified friendship, his sons with hunting partnership, his grandsons with protective guardianship, the mail couriers Francois and Perrault with a mutual respect. Against the man with a club he despised but gave respect. However, when Buck met John Thornton, he loved his master for the first time ever. There wasn't anything Buck wouldn't do for his master. Twice Buck saved Thornton's life, and pulled a thousand pounds of weight for Thornton's sake. Even after Buck routinely left his master's camp to flirt with nature, Buck always came back to appreciate his kind master. However, even after Thornton was gone and Buck had released all memories of his former life, Buck never forgot the kind hands of his master, even after answering the Call of the Wild.Jack London truly brings Buck to life. Using a limited 3rd person view, the reader is told of Buck's thoughts and actions. Obviously, London gave several ideal human qualities to Buck, including a sharp wit, rational reasoning, quick thinking, and grounded common sense. However, he does not over-exaggerate the humanity in Buck, which would have given an almost cartoon-like feeling for a reader. Rather, being a good observer, London saw how dogs acted and worked backwards, trying to infer what the dogs think. The result is a masterful blend of human qualities and animal instinct that is entirely believable. It is obvious that Buck's experience was similar to many other dogs' experiences."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I first read The Call of the Wild when I was 11, and it had a profound effect on me. I loved the story, the adventure, the romance of the wilderness, and the themes of hope and the struggle for survival in the wilds of Alaska.The book is mainly written for the young, but adults will find something refreshing, true to life, and escapist in the book.Set in the goldrush days of the late 1800s to early 1900s, it is the story of a stolen dog (Bucks') experiences in the Alaskan wilderness, and his struggle for survival and for dominance amongst the huskies and half-breeds of the sled dogs in the extremes of the northern wilderness. The story is harrowing, but ultimately delightful, encouraging young readers to imagine, to feel, and to be inspired to search for adventure and meaning.Another book by Jack London is White Fang, which is very similar, so those who like this book might consider reading this also.Recommended for those who like dogs and dog adventure stories, the Alaskan wilderness, the goldrush days, and those with a spirit of adventure-especially the young, but also the young in spirit."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I have to admit that I have not really given Jack London his proper due up to now. Perhaps it is because I don't by my nature like outdoor adventure type stories, or perhaps it is because I associate White Fang and \\"To Build a Fire\\" with my youth. The fact is that Jack London is a tremendously talented writer. His understanding of the basics of life matches his great knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. The Call of the Wild, despite its relative brevity and the fact that it is (at least on its surface) a dog's story, contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many another respected author. The story London tells is starkly real; as such, it is not pretty, and it is not elevating. As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking: Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kindred to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes is supremely sad and bothersome. Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Poor good-spirited Curly never has a chance, while Dave's story is made the more unbearable by his brave, undying spirit. Even the harsh taskmaster Spitz has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows full well that this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for gold. Buck's travails are long and hard, but the nobility of his spirit makes of him a hero--this despite the fact that his primitive animal instincts and urges continually come to dominate him, pushing away the memory and reality of his younger, softer days among civilized man. Buck not only conquers all--the weather, the harshness of the men who harness his powers in turn, the other dogs and wolves he comes into contact with--he thrives. This isn't a story to read when you are depressed. London's writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, but it is also somber, sometimes morose, infinitely real, and at times gut-wrenching and heartbreaking."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This is a little easier to read version of the original text written by Jack London. I was disappointed because I purchased the book for my classroom to read together with books I already had. The more difficult vocabulary words we were working on were not in this version, even though most of the text is the same. This version is good for someone to read if they are looking for an excellent story that has a simpler text."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London is amazing. Most writers use adjectives to describe a setting, but London's words ARE Alaska. They ARE the bitter struggles a domesticated dog must face in the snowy land. There's a scene in Call of the Wild in which the team of dogs must cover 3000 miles over the virgin terrain without rest. Jack London conveys the bone-tiredness of these dogs down to their heart. It's wonderful how his words bring the characters (I almost don't want to call them characters) fully to life.The story sounds like just a dog tale at first--a dog, Buck, is kidnapped from his comfortable life in California and sold as a sled dog for the Alaskan gold rush. While he endures the wilderness and the other dogs, Buck learns that survival comes only with tooth and fang. This lesson brings him very close to his forbears, the wolves.If you look deeper, Call of the Wild is as much a story of humans as it is a dog tale. Buck encounters various incompetent masters who try to break his spirit. Are we like this? But Buck also learns to trust a master who is gentle and gives love. We can be like this, too.Call of the Wild is not a story for the squeamish or very young. By involving us in the characters' lives, Jack London tells the truth. It is a life-and-death war between the harsh land and the soul every day. There is blood, death, cruelty--but it's the truth."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The exciting book, &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; by Jack London, is a call worth answering. This book is about a loveable dog named Buck who has to learn suddenly to defend himself in the wild. The different characters will undeniably delight you for hours. Buck has an interesting life and you will surely want to find out about it.From the beginning, the narrator starts the story with Buck's happy life in California. Unfortunately, Buck the Husky is stolen and taken to Alaska, where he is sold! As a result of his change, he has to gain the respect from other dogs and becomes happy again. Buck is sold to many masters and has as unusual a life as a dog has ever had. Lives that you will have to read about in this fascinating book.Truly, Mr. London has captured the essence of the hard and unusual life of the wild. The characters are all different; therefore; this book is for everyone. For instance, Buck the dog is loyal and tough, but one of his masters is ignorant and weak. There are many places in this book, so everyone will learn something. The main places are California and Alaska, which are as different as night and day. All in all, this book will take you on a wonderful adventure.To sum it all up, &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; is one of the best known and loved books. In this book, we see the incredible challenges that Buck faces. This book tops some of Mr. London's other great books such as: &quot;White Fang&quot; and &quot;The Star Rover&quot;. More importantly, this book will teach everyone that with perseverance and a little courage, you can do anything."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Buck has a good life. He's friendly with his master. He escorts the kids when they take walks. He hunts with the men on the grounds. But one day, Buck's life changes forever. One of the gardener's hired hands needs money and decides to kidnap and sell Buck. Dogs are in high demand because of the Alaskan gold rush and he'll get a good price for a dog like Buck.This book is told from the perspective of Buck. It's such a sad book. Even when Buck was happy, it was a sad book. The amount of work expected of these dogs was horrible and their treatment by humans not much better. It was a good story and quite eye opening, but the animal abuse was hard to take sometimes. I'm glad I waited and read it as an adult, because I don't think I would have appreciated it as much if I was still a child."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"i just read this book for the first time and found it entirely moving. it's a really beautiful story of good and evil, nature vs. man (nature wins!). while the violence in this novel is sometimes disturbing, i think this is an excellent book for children, say ten and up, that could provide opportunities for discussion with parents on themes of humanity (as well as inhumanity), nature, and death."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I really did like the book, but I have to admit I was sorry to see Buck go into the wild. I realize that dogs are naturally wild, it was just sad for me to see him leave all human kind behind. I think that London did an excellent job portraying a dogs point of view though. I liked it better then White Fang, but they were close in rating! I recommend this book to a person of any age. I once read it in elementary school, and now a senior in HS I still enjoy it! Two thumbs up! (despite the disappointment in the ending...)"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the Wild is an awesome book. As I read it got more addictive and exciting. During the most exciting parts my heart would start pounding. As I kept reading to the end it started getting really emotional, so I stopped reading for a few days. After I got to the end I decided that it was such a good book and I should read it again.Call of the wild is about a dog named Buck that is a half breed (part St. Bernard part Shepherd). He lived in California with Judge Miller. Then, one day a person stole Buck and sold him so he could get money to support his family. So then Buck was sent to the Northland and very exciting things happen to him.Age: 14"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I recently decided to reread many of the classic books I had read in the past. The Call of the Wild is a real classic American story. Jack London is the master of telling adventure stories about men and dogs in the Yukon of the turn of the century.While many are content to see this as only an adventure story I read a great deal more into it. I am not sure what London's religious views were but I think from his writings he was a seeker of truth. This truth is hard to find and I am not sure if he ever found it.I was struck by one passage that described Buck trying to pull a sled that had 1000 pounds on it. Before he started his task his master, Thornton knelt down by Buck's side and took the dog's head into his hands. Rather than playfully stroke him he whispered into his ear: \\"As you love me, Buck. As you love me.\\" Buck understands and then completes the task. This passage for me had very strong Christological overtones. I was reminded how God the Father requested of his Son Jesus to fulfill his task on earth. I do not know if anyone else has read this into this passage but it certainly seemed to me that London was asking a very deep question.I am fascinated how when you read books at different times in your life you can get very different meanings. I am enjoying rereading these classic books. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild, by Jack LondonBuck was born into a pampered life of civilization. He was raised in the south with a big family; 3 generations worth. But unfortunately, one of the men who worked on the farm was a gambler, and like most gamblers, he often lost; had mouths to feed and debts to pay. So one night, that man decided to kidnap Buck and sell him to another man for a few bills--I say \\"kidnap\\", but that word is not quite appropriate: Buck is not a child, but a dog, and because gold has been found in Alaska, large dogs like him are bringing a premium price in Alaska.Immediately upon arrival at his destination, Buck is beaten into submission by a club-wielding man in a red sweater. This is his first introduction to the law of the wild; with might comes law.Not long after he has been purchased to join a dog-sled team, a fight breaks out between the team leader and a different new dog named Curly. The fight ends with Curly's death. This is his second introduction to the law of the wild; mercy is a weakness.Because of his natural tendencies towards pride, he himself gets into a lot of fights with the team leader. However, he is much to cunning to bring it to an immediate stand-up battle; instead, he reinforces the other dogs' tendencies towards anarchy, bringing down the efficiency of the pack overall. This irritates the team leader to no end.Finally, they have it out, and Buck emerges triumphant; the old team leader is never heard from again. Buck takes his earned place (by virtue of his might) as the new team leader, and immediately brings the other dogs back into line. Their efficiency becomes so great that they set a new record on a run.The rest of the story continues on, and Buck slowly slips further and further away from civilization; following the call of the wild, he eventually joins with a pack of wolves.As a favorite quote of mine proclaims, \\"beneath the veneer of civility, we're all children of Cain.\\" Nowhere (to my knowledge) is this thought further explored than in this book. It is both a great story, and an interesting look at just how easily it would be for civilization to fall away. Really, excluding all of our neat gadgets, not much has changed: all of our vaunted rules and mores exist merely because we're much too afraid to venture out alone at night.Memorable Quote:Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet he retained his wildness and wiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come in from the wild to sit by John Thornton's fire.For more reviews like this, please check out my profile!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"A deceptively simple story of a dog - Buck and his coming of age from 'lap dog' to the harsh reality of survival in the wild. Told from the dog's perspective slipping from first to third person it's an easy read over all. Some of the language is from an earlier generation and written in an almost poetic style in parts, several passages may need to be read a few times to get the full meaning of what the author - Jack London is wanting to communicate. 'Man' is protrayed as brutal, selfish and uncompromising for the most part, much the same as his fellow dogs. Interesting to note the most brutal of the humans are not the tough, frontier, pioneering self-made men of the Alaskan wilderness but the so called civilised southerner's who are out of place and out of their depth. Buck sees them all as inferior really but for their ability to use weapons and the control and power they have over his life. He devotes himself to one man despite their limitations and theirs is a powerful bond almost to the point of embarrassment as seen by others, it's a different bond he has with the wild nature of his ancestors. This story attempts to reflect both as Buck makes his way in his journey of self discovery and who he really is. A good read, a good story and worth the telling.A good Kindel transfer, almost no mistakes but for a 'page break' code in the middle of one word. Some books are riddled with typos making for a distraction to the flow in reading, this is not one of them."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I've lived in Alaska for over 40 years. Reading Jack London was the main catalystfor my wanderlust, for my original travels to the arctic. I had a boyfriend whorecommended this book and who dreamed of traveling to Alaska. He never madeit to the arctic but I did - and I stayed.This book is poignant, hopeful and sad - all in one. It is about a great dog namedBuck and his resilience and love for his master, Thornton. Buck is tenacious, resil-ient and fearless in the face of abuse and adversity of all sorts. He is a great dog!I chuckled when Buck scared off 12 wolverines. Wolverines are considered themost ferocious of animals. If you run across a wolverine in Alaska, you pray orrun or shoot.There was one little anachronism that bothered me. Jack London talks aboutcrickets in Alaska but there are no crickets in the arctic. I miss crickets so I amsure about this fact!When I re-read this book recently, I remembered with nostalgia the very firsttime I read it as an adolescent and how it led me to my home in Fairbanks. Thisis a great book about the arctic, about a great dog, and a great book overall."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In this book, there is no stop action keeping the reader always wanting to continue. This book is filled with action, adventure, terror, and drama. It is taken place in 1903 in the state of California and in Alaska in the region of Klondike. Jack London puts you in the mind of a dog. This dog, which is the main character, is named Buck. He is half St. Bernard and also half Scottish Sheperd. In the beginning of the book, Buck lives with a judge and his children in his California home. One day, Buck is kidnapped and shipped to Alaska where he is trained as a sled dog. He realizes the many troubles in the Alaska and meets his main enemy, Spitz. Spitz is a vicious and brute tempered dog. Buck grows hungry and goes from a cuddly dog to a devil. Buck and Spitz grow angry at one another and have a malicious dogfight. How will fight for the rest of their life? This book is one of the best books I have read because of how well Jack London puts you in the head of a dog and puts you through a torturous time. Read The Call of the Wild by Jack London.David LA7"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I thought this book was very good. I felt the emotions of Buck very strongly. I would recommend this book for grades 5 and up."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book The Call of the Wild is about a dog named Buck. Buck is a very powerful dog which is half St. Bernard and half sheepdog. He lives on Judge Miller's estate in California's Santa Clara Valley. Buck lived a very comfortable life, until an end when people discover gold in the Klondike region of Canada and a great request arises for strong dogs to pull sleds. A gardener there kidnapped Buck and teaches Buck by beating him with a club and after he sends Buck up north to Klondike. Arriving in the cold North, Buck gets surprised by the cruelty he sees around him. As soon as another dog from his ship, Curly, gets off the boat, a pack of huskies violently attacks and kills her. Buck got very surprised and also got very scared. He learns how to fight and more. Buck and his leader Spitz get into a huge fight with a huge pack of wild dogs. Buck then kills Spitz and he takes the place as a leader. After the journey the two mail carriers sell Buck to a man. That man didn't know how much load you're supposed to put in, how much food to take, and more. The dogs soon ran out of food and they were staving and exhausted. Then one of the men cut Buck loose and Buck runs away. Then he finally gets a new master who loved Buck and who cared for him. He always returns to Thornton in the end, until, one day, he comes back to camp to find that Yeehat Indians have attacked and killed his master. Buck attacks the Indians, killing several and scattering the rest, and then heads off into the wild, where he becomes the leader of a pack of wolves.I don't think there was any part where a disliked this book. I really liked this book and enjoyed it very much. It was very fun and once you start reading this book you can't stop because you keep wondering on what will happen next. I liked the part when he meets his new master. I felt very happy for Buck because he finally got somebody that will love and take care of Buck. \\"During the four years since his puppy hood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation.\\" When I first read this quote it caught my eyes. When I first read this quote it caught my eyes so I read it over again until I finally understood what this quote meant. This quote was very interesting and I really liked it. It talks about Bucks life before he gets taken away to the north Klondike. \\"Each day mankind and the claims of mankind slipped farther from him. Deep in the forest a call was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously thrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire, and to plunge into the forest. . . . But as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love of John Thornton drew him back to the fire again.\\" This quote sounded very interesting to me and I really liked this quote.I think there was no favorite part for mew in this story because this whole book was so fun and I really liked it. My most favorite part in this book is when Buck get loose. That was one of my favorite parts because I felt very happy for Buck. This was my favorite part because since Buck got loose, he doesn't have to get tortured anymore. I really enjoyed reading this book and I recommend this book to all ages. I hope everybody gets a chance on reading this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I remember The Call of the Wild being a perennial book report choice for many students when I was in school. I never selected it and for that I am glad. I don't think it would have held my interest in elementary school as it barely held my interest now. While reading the book, I saw the hard life of a dog through the dog's eyes. It was a decent enough story but I just can't grasp why it's a classic. There was a lot of dog on dog violence and some brutal animal abuse. All in all, it was kind of depressing."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"great book ... london's prose is excellent ... does not mince words ... perfect for an airplane ride, etc. ..."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"As I ordered the book--I felt comfortable ordering from Amazon as I have always been pleased---once again-very pleased!!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"-Call of the wild is a good book for older kids, but is a great book.-If your looking for a bloody book then this the book for you.-It's a good story about life and the things you run into on the way."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I first read this book in junior high, and when I read it again the brutality of this book made me realize how cruel life can be. I had forgotten much of it and I was somewhat surprised how cruel this book was. Jack London uses human emotions and characteristics as he writes of Buck, the loyal, strong dog that goes from a passive life in Cailfornia to the barreness of the Alaska gold rush.London's human characters are merely role players, cameos if you will, while the animals undergo a reverse evolutionary process from tranquil to ferocious beasts of the wild. In the end, the civilized dog, Buck, takes his rightful place at the head of a pack of wild wolves. Whether this is believable or not remains to the reader to decide, but London writes artfully and conviningly about his subject.London lived part of what he wrote about, so the fact of the gold rush towns and personalities are true, but his dogs achieve a superior role that may or may not be really possible. Nevertheless, this truly is a gripping story and, while it is aimed at a male audience, any reader who enjoys this type of book will be rewarded with a good story."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's remarkable saga of Buck's adventures in the Klondike during the days of the Gold Rush should be read by every child, especially any child in a family considering adding a pet to the family.Sharing the experience of the protagonist will instruct the reader and develop an understanding and love for man's best friend.Samuel L.

The dog endures a bunch of harsh treatment until he finds an owner who really likes him and treats him well.That ends badly, and the dog follows his violent and atavasitic instincts in the end."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The call of the wild, by Jack London is a great book for all ages. Buck (the main character) is a tame dog in Santa Clara California living with Judge Miller, a man that everyone new and enjoyed. This changed when a rush for gold in Yukon made men need strong dogs to pull their sleds. Buck was a very strong dog and as a result, was kidnapped. He was then taken to Yukon where there was harsh snow and was very cold. He was treated poorly until he met John Thorton. John Thorton was very kind to Buck but then one day he died. Buck was left in the wild and became friends with a wild animal. I personally like it because it is always telling you what is happining in great detail. Jack London also got right to the point making it easy to understand."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's The Call of the Wild is a well written book. He describes the primitive environment while traveling to the Yukon, in a way that makes the reader feel like they are there. The book is descriptive, but uses some advanced vocabulary. I really like how London gives the dogs a human personality in the story. It is unique and interesting. The relationship between two of the characters in the book, Buck and John Thornton, is very close. London writes &quot;as you love me, Buck. As you love me.&quot; (London p. 5o) My favorite part in the story is when Buck puts together all of his strength and love for John Thornton together, and pulls a sled 100 yards with 1,000 pounds of flour in it. This is a bet between John Thornton and Matthewson, Thornton is extremely excited when Buck pulls through. I would recommened The Call of the Wild to readers who like adventurous stories."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my opinion Jack London's &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; is extremely thought provoking. I enjoy his writing because his imagery is so descriptive and detailed. For example, when London explains the appearance of the bull he says,&quot;...savage temper...back and forth the bull tossed his palmated antlers...eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light...&quot;(London p.57). Whenever I read this qoute I can visually see this bull getting upset. Although I did enjoy this book I found that one thing bothered me and that was his lack of description on the human characters. The Scotch half-breed could be an example of this because London doesn't fully describe him as a person , but keeps him and the majority of the other human characters vague. All in all I thought the book was knowledgeable, action filled, and kept my interest at all times. I would definatly recommend this book to anyone especially people who enjoy reading in depth and descriptive books, and learning about life in general."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"London uses complexity in his phrasing that allows you to feel challenged to think about what you're reading as well as giving you the sensation that you are there. &quot;Buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging and wrestling with it.&quot; (London p.5) I like how the reader can picture exactly how Buck's anger is taking him over. This gives the book texture. The Call is definatly not a page turner for the general audience. I believe it appeals to readers who enjoy the 1800's and outdoor setting. London allows the reader to feel the savage behavior of the times. &quot;No fair play. Once down, that was the end of you.&quot; (London p.9) In some areas, none in particular, it seems the situations drag as if the point is never to be reached. Over all this is an average novel that I think everyone should give a chance."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; was written in 1897 by Jack London. The story takes place in the Yukon during the Goldrush. I thought this book contained a good combination of action and suspense. I liked the detailed description such as this quote from the book, &quot;Because men, groping in the Artic darkness, had found yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming to find, thousands of men were rushing to Northland. (pg.1) I also liked the heavy vocabulary, although it was difficult at times. I also liked the nature and rough mood that London set. It kept the story interesting. The only part I didn't like was the abrupt ending of the story. I thought that London was just trying to end the story too quickly. Overall I liked this book and coming from a person who doesn't like to read, it was pretty good. What I'm trying to say is that this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's Call of the Wild is a descriptive novel taking place during the 1897 Alaskan Gold Rush. This novel is about heroic dog who is taken away from his sheltered life in the Santa Clara Valley to the hard trails of the mighty Yukon. Buck's body changed dramatically. &quot;Buck's one hundreded and forty pounds had dwindeled to one hundred and fifteen.&quot; &quot;They were all footsore and dead tired.&quot; ( page 31 ) This short story contains many characters along with a number of unfamiliar settings which makes it confusing. I recommend this story to dog and nature lovers everywhere."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack Londons The Call of the Wild, was a very well written book. Although it has great uses of words and phrases, the book didn't grab my attention. I thought the time period follows the book very well. Nothing was too modern. One of my favorite parts of the book was at the end. Buck becomes friends with the other wolves. Before that, Buck and the wolves got into a quarrel. One of the scenes in this novel that I disliked were how much the dogs were traded. Because London did this so much it makes The Call seem like the same things keep happening over and over again. London writes: Francois called Buck to him, threw his arms around him and wept over him. And that was the last of Francios and Perrault. Like other men they passed out of Bucks life for good. (London pg.27). I advise readers who enjoy naturistic adventures, to read this book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my opinion The Call of the Wild by Jack London is mediocre. My favorite part of the book is the in depth descriptions. For example, I really like the way that London describes Buck after he had been pulling the sled for awhile. &quot;His muscles had wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness.&quot;(London p.38) I also like the way the book is written and how it doesn't drag on forever. I do not like the beginning of the book because i think it is boring and doesn't grab the attention of the reader. I also think that the vocabulary is too tough and overall the novel is a bit confusing. Although personally I do not like, The Call of the Wild, I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys a great adventure."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack Londons Call of the Wild will definately keep you on the edge.This book is an attention grabber that will prevent you from putting the book down. This book teaches you about survival,life in 1897, the gold rush,and life in the Yukon. The book was based on the life of the dogs,specifically Bucks point of view.I believe the way the world is and how people treat eachother today can compare to the story.The part that was my favorite was when John Thorton saved Bucks life on page 41. His words were &quot;If you strike that dog again ill kill you&quot;I automatically thought of John as my favorite character.Ihighly reccomend this book to anyone who wants to read an excellent story that you wont want to put down."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of The Wild was an excellent book!

As you love me.&quot; Just those simple words gave buck the strength to pull all that weight! All in all,I don't however think this book is for everyone.

It was apretty good book but all the over-analyzation by my english teacher ruined it. I'm sure the first time I read this book out of school I will love it. WARNING: this review reveals plenty of the plot and story of the book!!!!!!!A foremost theme of Call of the Wild is that \\"environment can shape the way a character acts, feels and appears to others.\\" The way Buck is changed by all the scenarios he is thrown into throughout the book is a prime example of this idea. Just the way anyone can change starting out as royalty and ending up as a commoner, there is an obvious adjustment in Buck's behavior depending on whom and what he is around.Buck's life at the beginning of \\"Call of the Wild\\" is drastically different than Buck's life at the end of the book. Buck begins his mind-boggling journey as nothing less than kingly. He is loved by everybody and has anything a dog would ever want; children to play with, a pool to jump in at any time, and a master with a true love for him. But not long after the beginning of the novel Buck is sold by a gardener with a gambling problem. Buck is immediately brutalized for disciplining. From then on Buck has a totally different mindset. He then lands on Deya Beach where he has to fight for food among savage dogs. Buck knew that his life would be in danger from that point on. Buck is owned then by Perrault, a man who like Buck as a common worker. Around people like Perrault Buck feels comfortable but his life was still in danger from enemies like Spitz, a cruel and vindictive monster of a dog. Buck overcomes his enemy and becomes head dog. In this position Buck becomes ever more powerful both physically and emotionally. With Buck becoming more dominant and wolf-like the sled team was able to flourish. Buck is then sold to Charles, Hal and Mercedes. These three were inexperienced and knew nothing about dogs. Because of Buck's experiences prior in the novel he is able to influence the way the rest of the dogs act, making life very hard for the unlikable Charles, Hal and Mercedes. Bucks next owner was John Thornton, a man with a vast knowledge of dogs. Thornton has a deep compassionate relationship. It is with this owner that Buck is finally able to find his inner primitive wolf. In the setting John Thornton creates a setting in which Buck is able to go and satisfy his craving for connecting with the likes of his ancestors.Throughout the novel the reader is wondering if Buck will ever meet the like of his ancestors. The reader is always wondering how Buck will react to the scenario he is thrown into next. To keep the reader in suspense and wonder the author uses many different settings until Buck is ready to communicate with the wolves he came from. Without the characters creating the right setting the book would have no meaning. If Buck didn't change with the setting given to him the book would have no meaning. Buck did change from being a pampered house dog to being a dog in the wild because of the settings created by the author."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This classic Jack London novel tells the story of Buck, a dog born to luxery and ease, before being dognapped and sold to prospectors in Alaska to work as a sled dog.

Faced with adversity, Buck grows strong and fierce, and he must ultimately decide whether to continue his life with a human master, or to truly heed the call of the wild.Sure to be a hit with dog lovers everywhere, \\"The Call of the Wild\\" is an excellent adventure story for readers of all ages. This was one of my absolute favorite novels growing up, and it's every bit as exciting and meaningful now as it was when I was a child. It's a timeless novel that has truly earned the title of classic. Of note in this edition is that it's hardback (yeah!!) with great illustrations. Paul Bransom does an excellent job, and Buck really comes to life pictorally as well as through London's writing. I can't stress enough how fine an addition this novel is to any library."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I had to read this book for my 8th grade LA class and out of the many books we have read this year I would say that this book was really not that good. It did have some good parts in it, like when Buck gets in to fights and kills many humans, very action packed. But my big complaint in thios book is the author: Jack London. The author just wastes 1pages describing a tree, who cares! Another thing that I did not like about the book was that it was very hard to understand! Jack London would skip around with different characters point of views, very confusing! The reason that I gave the book 2 stars, eventhough I did nopt enjoy it much was because if you could get to the fighting, action packed, it really did keep me on the dge of my seat!The reason I title this review, \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" is that if you can survive all of the detail that Jack London puts into the book and get to the real exciting parts, you might enjoy it!P.S. I am not being mean to my LA teacher just because I did not like the book!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"So this is the future of books in the public domain, whose copyrights have expired? I think this thing was printed for me, it says 'made in the USA Lexington, KY 15 December 2012' which is about when I ordered it.But this 'book' is so slim and so slick that I can't give it as the gift I had intended.This is not a book, this is a fancy throw-away piece of yuck. The pages are BRIGHT white, the serifed font very 1980's ish with no dignity. The bottom of each page reads the page number, then a slash and then the wor 'Page' - like this; ...64/ Page, 65/ Page, 66/Page...it's so ungainly ugly! Overall it measures 9x6 which is larger than a folded sheet of standard paper and is barely .25 inches thick. Glossy glossy shiny cover. The image on the front of the wolf is nice enough, but it's repeated in a ghostly transparent way on the back and thus it comes across as slick tossed off nothing.I'd wanted a BOOK. Something with dignity and weight, something that feels like a book, smells like a book.I never have felt like crying before about the future of books, till today.This collection of words on a page has lost so much of the connection to dear Mr Jack London, may he rest in peace. When did he write it? This 'book' DOES NOT SAY! No original copyright date, no originally published date, it's just simply omitted. I think Mr London wrote this epic adventurous tale in 1902 if memory serves. I don't want to Google it, but you can.I just wanted a book to give to an 8 yr old boy who loves reading, and would love reading something that connected him to the distant past, yet reads so current, but he'll get none of that unless he Googles it and discovers the connection that way. No, I'm not giving him this bummer of a 'book'. Instead I have called up a used bookstore and indeed, they had a lovely copy by Heritage Press in a paper sleeve. It's a BOOK, thank heavens."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"What a brilliant classic by Jack London where the main hero is a dog by the name of Buck! Who doesn't love classics or dogs? I felt that on a miniscule scale, I could relate to Buck in his departure from the comfortable life to follow the calling of the wild, even if he didn't fully understand it.The Call of the Wild by Jack London was so good, so addictive, that I was thrilled to stand in long lines at the film festival and slightly upset to put it away when the movies started. It reads like poetry, it penetrates like good wine, it stays with you like a good long kiss and it leaves you wondering about a different world, the world of wild animals and dark forests and deep mysteries of time and nature.The transformation of Buck from a house dog to a wild wolf-like leader of the pack in the harshest conditions known to man and animal is oh so captivating. It is a hard return to the bare minimums, a revisiting of the brutal rules of survival of the fittest where whatever doesn't kill you toughens you beyond your wildest imagination.The journey demanded that Buck adapt or else, and those passages are the height of London's articulation, all through the eyes of a dog, no less! From learning the law of club and fang to discovering the laws of following versus leading the pack, from surviving a terrible turn of events when his fate falls into the wrong hands to finding and experiencing a deep love of man, and finally, to answering the call of the wild, this marks one of the best short novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Almost a juntapose story to the other great classic from Jack London &#34; White Fang&#34; but instead of the domestication of a wolf, it deals with the slide from domenstic dog towards his ancient wild nature.

I think it should be REQUIRED that abridged versions be identified as such."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Gold was found in Alaska, the rush to obtain it required a strong constitution and many dogs to do the work that horses usually did in the states.

On the way he learns many concepts from surprise, to deceit, and cunning; he also learns loyalty, devotion, and love. As he is growing he feels the call of the wild.This book is well written. There is not a wasted word or thought and the story while building on its self has purpose and direction.

Jack London is a very talented writer, and although some of you kids out there find his material boring and unimportant, there are lessons that can be learner from Jack, and from Buck who is our hero in this novel. I grew up in the Yukon, and although it was much more recent that the time in which the story takes place, this book is very realistic to me. Some of the other reviews say that this is a tall tale, but there is truth to it. Mother Nature is unforgiving, whether it be in the desert or the snow, and Jack portrays this fact very well. In the North, it really is survival of the fittest, though it has mellowed out somewhat over the last hundred or so years. There are people and creatures in this book that are cruel, but reality is no more kind to us now than it was back then."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I reread this book as part of a personal goal to read \\"The Classics\\". It did not disappoint. I did discover, though, by reading some info about Jack London that the Kindle Edition is missing a 4 line poem at the beginning. I heard that is true about Moby Dick too. Why would the folks that create the Kindle Edition make changes? It baffles me and disappoints me. I guess I get what I pay for, eh?"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Growing up, The Call of the Wild was one of the staples of my library, a book I read half a dozen times before I turned 18. I hadn't picked it up in fifteen or twenty years, but I did so yesterday and read it through adult eyes. The story I remembered, but I was shocked anew at the dark and cruel world London created. It is a story of nature versus beast. Of survival of the fittest. Of the molding of a savage, feral animal.The year is 1897 and the Yukon gold rush is in full swing. Buck is dognapped from his California estate home and delivered to the northern wilderness where he learns quickly the \\"law of tooth and fang.\\" Only the strong, the merciless, the cunning survive. Primeval instinct takes over, and Buck learns to become all these things.London writes a great deal about this reverting to wolfish instinct. Buck was \\"harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears.\\" His ancestors \\"quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks. They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been his always.\\" London illustrates for us the domestication of wolf to dog by tracing it backwards through Buck's feral slide. But with a trick of his pen, London merges this with a much larger form of evolution. Buck, with his age-old eyes, sees the image of a prehistoric man, hunched and hairy, fearful and wary. \\"Survival of the fittest\\" (natural selection) is a significant, logical theme in this book, but parents beware, at times London draws heavily on a Darwinist worldview.In this hostile and primitive setting, Buck adapts, he reasons, he hates and holds grudges. He also delights, he imagines, and even finds humor in a situation - all very humanlike qualities. Yet he remains very much a dog, so we can easily forgive the monster he turns into. He becomes a cunning thief, a harsh task master, and a brutal killer of weaker dogs and of the smaller animals that give him life. In such a climate, London tells us, he must be this way to survive. The book details \\"the decay of his moral nature\\" (if dogs have such a thing). Morality is a \\"vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence. It was all well enough in the Southland, under the law of love and fellowship, to respect private property and personal feelings; but in the Northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such things into account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper.\\"So you can see why this book has always mystified those who classify books by genre. It is called children's literature because the main character is a dog. Yet it has some troublesome themes. And it also has some horrible, horrible scenes. Dogs are beaten to death by men. They are killed in gruesome fights. And men kill each other. I remember crying as a child each time I read this (and I admit I got misty again yesterday), yet I've been drawn back again and again by the power of this story. I love the wilderness, despite its harshness, and I've always been an incurable dog-lover. And not everything in the book is darkness. In chapter six, Buck falls madly in love with a good master. This deep, mysterious bond that can form between mankind and dogkind is something I can related to, something I've always treasured.For all its darkness, blood and cruelty, at the end of this book I'm always overcome by a heavy feeling of awe. I'd recommend this one for ages 10+."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"A gripping story of a dog's transformation from a domestic pet to a fiercely wild dog.

I now understand why Jack London is so renowned."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild is a well written book in many aspects: the story was illustrated in smooth transition from a simple meaning of humanity to high level philosophical analysis of society transcendent from primitive to industrialization. By using basic human relation with animal (a dog named \\"Buck\\" incarnation of primitive survivor) , Jack London exposes the illness with primitive living of slavery where the weak is the prey of the strong. However, John Thornton ( a hunter) transcended the worldly feeling of mankind to protect Buck and saved it from death. By this, human relation with animal became Godly way. It is not a simple matter of possession or ownership; but a profound humanity."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London spins a great tale as seen from the eyes of a dog.

But while he is a sled do he goes through many mushers, some nice and some that are very cruel to him. Buck soon becomes one of the best sled dogs on the trail and everyone wants a dog like him.

Buck also finds that it is very hard to become a sled dog, and to get along with the other dogs. Although its is very hard to become a sled dog, Buck does it, and becomes one of the best.

Most of the book is set in the arctic north and is centered during the time of the Klondike Gold Rush. After reading this I wanted to get up and head north. The book is about the life of a dog named Buck, which is a half-St.Bernard and half-shepherd dog. The book unveils Buck's reversion from a typical family pet dog to a hard working sled dog. His breeding allows for growth and strength as he will become of the greatest dogs during his time.

I first read it when I was 13 and did not appreciate it at all. I'm now 35 and absorbed the story from an entirely different perspective. I LOVE dogs and have always been curious about pack animal behavior which &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; depicts in its truest form. My heart went out to Buck after he was dog-napped and thrown in a cage to be transported to his new &quot;owners.&quot; I kept picturing my dog going through the same ordeal, and I wondered if she would have responded like Buck did.Having spent two years working for the Humane Society, I will say that this book is not for the faint of heart when it comes to reading detailed animal brutality. The description of Buck's being beaten into submission (literally) are heart wrenching.This is a great story...rich in detail and emotion. I'm now reading &quot;White Fang,&quot; the companion book to &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; which London wrote three years later. &quot;White Fang&quot; is about a wild animal being tamed unlike this book which is about a tame animal becomming wild."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Everytime you think that the book is at its climax it has something bigger to add to the story. Like when the main character Buck was in a fight with the leader of the sled team Spitz and they finally had a big fight I thought that the story was going to not be any more ation. But I was sadly wrong. I also liked this book because it teaches you about how when this was going on for real how happy exsited about the gold and having the best dog.This book would be very good for discussion because you could debate about wether or not this book talks about aniamls rights. When i was looking up information about how other people thought about this book i found a lot of people that thought this book was very bad to teach to children. I thought that it was bad with what had happened but i also thought that it was interesting about what they used to do to dogs to make them trained. In the book the humans thought that the dogs were trained but the dogs were actually scared of them. Over all this book was very good and eveyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I like the book because it was very different. It was moving and suspenceful at times. It was about a dog and his many owners. He was at Judge Miller\`s, train, two sled dog owner and John Thornton. Buck goes through a lot. He pulls a 1000 pound sled. He races a sled to the Alaskan Klondike for gold. He also finally gets an owner who loves Buck for Buck not as a racer or a hero to pull 1000 pounds on a sled but as a dog. Then Buck saves the life of his owner John Thornton and finds a wolf. I can\`t share the end though.I think it was a good book. It was sort of like real life because people go from job to job and at least one person appreciates them for who they are inside. It was like my life because I moved houses when my dad left to visit him. It was like going on a train ride to somewhere new. I didn\`t have it as hard as Buck. He was a loyal dog and never gave up. Over all it was a great book. I would not recommend it for any one under 5th grade.I read it and had a little trouble with the hard words."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Exciting BookWhen I read this book I liked it. I liked this book because there were a lot of dogs getting into fights. I learned that in dog sledding you could tell the dogs go and stop. The book was exciting because Buck was sent to his new owner to pull a sled with other dogs. He had to go to a place that had snow and he had never seen snow before. This is why I liked this book.I think that other people should read this book. I think that because it gets more exciting each chapter. People should read it because people could learn some things about dog sledding. I would tell my friends and other people to read this book who like dogs because there are a lot of dogs in this book with some weird names. This is why I think people should read this book.My favorite character in this book was Buck. He was my favorite character because he killed another dog-named Spitz and became the leader of the other dogs. A character I didn't like was Buck's new owner. I didn't like Buck's new owner because he was hitting Buck with a club. These are reasons why I liked Buck. In this book it used good diction to help me understand the words in the book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's Call of the Wild is considered by many to be a literary masterpiece and for good reason. The New York Times Booklist has declared it one of the \\"100 Greatest Pieces of Literature from the 20th Century\\". From the first page London vividly describes every nuance and detail in the life of the canine protagonist, Buck, who is dognapped from his life of luxury and thrown into the harsh and unforgiving Alaskan tundra. London thoughtfully develops a host of characters that further the story and teach Buck valuable lessons. The story is filled with action, tragedy, love, and the primordial forces of nature. In the Yukon, Buck makes up part a dogsled team that is responsible for delivering the mail, which marks the first step in his rapid evolution from a domestic pampered pooch, to a cunning, and perfected canine specimen that is one with nature. London demonstrates the value of careful research and planning in his adventurous and action-packed masterpiece. Every historical detail is accurate, and every occurrence highly plausible. His seamless integration of characters (human or canine) allows the reader to take a glimpse into the frozen world just as it was shortly before the turn of the century. However, it is in his writing regarding the mysterious \\"call [of the wild]\\" that London truly shines. These passages are greatly enriched by a rawness that is so often forgotten in literature. As Buck begins to respond to \\"the call\\", he embraces his lupine heritage more and more.

Although the title may pertain to the wolf spirit running through the blood of the protagonist--a half dog/half wolf--it could just as well apply to the lure of this book. It is sensual, primal, powerful, and makes one feel alive. Wax eloquent over the stylistic graces of a Nabokov or Proust; get your pleasure from perusing the post-modern wink of contemporary fiction and meta-fiction. If it works for you fine: but a book that takes you on a mind altering journey of the senses, belies the craft and craftiness of an E.B. White to expand your mind into the cosmos, helps one transcend the isolation of the self through pulsating life rather than through thumbing one's nose at the \\"liberation of dominant cultural discourse\\" by attending university seminars, and allows one to hear the unfettered voice of a writer who was engaged in the deconstruction of the exploitative nature of capitalism and human greed--both in writing and a life, go for it.

I thought it was very well written, especially the battles between the dogs. The reader can almost see the dog's cuts and feel their pain. Upon reading this sentence, &quot;There was no warning, only a leap in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out equally swift, and Curly's face ripped open from eye to jaw.&quot;(London p.9), I cringed, I could almost see the shredded skin covered in warm blood, and the white bone shining through. That was just one example of the excellent description used to enhance this tale of Buck's struggle for survival. I wouldn't say this book is perfect though. For example, I didn't think it would be possible for the dogs to understand the English language as well as the book portrays. Other than that I believe this novel to be excellently written, and I would recommend it to anyone who asked."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my opinion the book The Call of the Wild by Jack London is one of the most interesting books I have read. This story took place in 1897 during the California gold rush. A part in this book that i remember well is when Buck describes his surroundings as a &quot;dog eat dog world&quot; [london page This quote reveals the savageness of his environment. It definately kept my attention because I was curious to find out what was about to happen next. London also made his characters believable. The dogs expressed emotions as if they were human. Iwould truly recommend this book to other students if they like to read about adventurous and descriptive stories."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my opinion, &quot;The Call of The Wild&quot;, is an okay book, for people who like to read novels about animals being beaten. I know everything in the end turned out okay, but I still don't think Buck shouldn't have had to go through that. Buck would have had a fine life at the ranch before he was doggknapped by Mannuel. The first time Buck was abused was when Mannuel handed him over to the other man and said &quot;Twist it, an' you'll choke 'm plentee.&quot; (London page3). That was awful. Another reason I didn't like this book is because of the time period it was uninteresting. The speech was also hard to understand. I wouldn't reccomend this book to little kids or animal loving people like me, maybe to someone who wants to learn about history, death, and hard times of the Yukon."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my opinion, &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, by Jack London is a good dipiction. I would recommend this novel to intelligent readers, because London uses difficult vocabulary words. When some of the people talk it is hard to understand, because they use colloquial language. For example &quot;And seein' it's government money, you ain't got no kick coming, eh, Perrault?&quot; (London page 7). The characters represent the time period very well. They show the hardships of living near the Yukon, how dogs are important for pulling a sled while the people look for gold. Overall if you are looking for a book to expand your knowledge, and vocabulary, this is the dipiction for you."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I think The Call Of The Wild was a decent book. It had some positives and some negatives. Some positives about the book I liked was the description he used. he described the characters very well, as well as the senery too. Also i like how he made the dogs out to be just like humans. Some negatives about the book I didnt like very well was that the book was not very interesting! It needed some kind of spark or something else added to it to spice it up a little bit. Also it lacked action, there was some action but not enough that made me want to keep reading the book. One quote Jack London used in my mind, that i liked is &quot;Dat Zpitz fight lak hell, but that Buck fight lak two hells!&quot; I like this quote and it stands out in my mind because it shows some dominance Buck has in the book. It also shows that buck is the rightful leader of the pack!

In the book there some things i just dont like.However,the one that stuck out the most is the setting within the story.They could have picked a better place to have this novel take place.In the Yukon lands just wasn't the place for me to get into this depiction. Through out the course of this book there were alot of quotes.Some were bad,some were good,but one really caught my eye.Onthe third page Jack London wrote that Manuel said,&quot;trust it,an'you'll choke e'm plentee.Ifind this true in life it self.If somebody acts up on you,you can always give a little to straighten them up.

London's vivid descriptions of the characters and environment are enough to hold the reader's interest until the storyline takes off. London states &quot;His eyes turned blood-shot and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend.&quot; (London, pg. 5) This shows how Buck was already starting to revert to his race's old ways. The only faults of this novel are that some of the fight scenes are not very realistic and the book seems a few chapters too short. The story follows Buck, a content farm-dog, to the Yukon. Once there, the book shows him change into a savage, primitive beast. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure or frontier books.

The novel uses a lot of description but I'm not a great reader and didn't underestand a lot of the words. For example, when London says. &quot;an old husky, long and lean and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commamded respect.&quot; (page 10) He uses a variety of descriptive words to keep the readers attention but for me it was a couple too many. Over all, the story was pretty good! If you like description and nature, this is a great book for you to read."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's The Call of the Wild is a story about survival. The time period gave it a boring atmosphere,though. Some parts kept the reader interested and others seemed to drag on. I really liked the part where Buck killed the rabbit,it kept the reader alert. Chapter 4,&quot;Who Has Won Mastership&quot;,seemed to drag on. The vocabulary is difficult,I wouldn't reccommend this book to elementary or middle school students. I don't think they'd understand such sentences as,&quot;The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life.&quot; (London p.39). Another thing I didn't like was that the human characters were so boring. There wasn't enough conversation. Overall it had a great plot and beautiful ending."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; is an overall pleasurable experience to read. The description he put into everything that he wrote about was great. Some of the desriptive dialogue i like best was used by the character Francois. He said &quot; Dat Buck, heem pool lak hell, I tich heem queek as anyt'ing&quot; (London pg. 10). I thought the line was humerous, and i also thought it was imfomative in the use of colloquial language. On the other hand, however, the book could have used a few vocabulary tune-ups. Some of the words used are a bit to advanced for the average reader. Also, some of the characters like Hal, Charles, and Mercedes were a little to ignorant to be believable. All in all, if you are a nature fan with a big vocabulary, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The call of the wild was a boring, pointless book. I had no intrest in it because it was just another book about a boy and his dog. It was a plain old boring family book. It's even stated on page forty-one &quot;it's my dog.&quot; Said by Hal to John Thornton in a fight over Buck. That quote totally proves the whole boy and his dog theory. I would never recomend this book to anyone. I'm not saying that it is a bad book but it was not a book I could get into and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I thought that THE CALL OF THE WILD by Jack London was a decent book. It was kind of dull and lacked that spice that keeps the reader glued to the book. I did like how descriptive he was in some situations, but this description was also the downfall of this book. I didn't like how he gave the animals human feelings. Like on page 42 when he was talking about Buck. He says &quot;love, genuine passionate love was his for the first time.&quot; In all, I would only recommend this book to people who have nothing better to read."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the wild is about a dog named Buck. Who was torn from the cozy life he was born in and placed in the primitive world. During Bucks travel from one world to the next, Jack London graphically expresses the change in behavior and attitude as Buck goes from domestic to primitive. Throughout the story you are introduced to many different characters which help Buck along. For example, &quot;The Man in the Red Sweater&quot; who introduced buck to the club, and said &quot;Well Buck we've had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that.&quot;, Spitz who was very jealous of Buck. The most important element that taught Buck to adapt to his surrounding would have to be his surroundings which taught him &quot;Survival of the fittest.&quot; Throughtout the chapters you watch as Buck goes from being a faithful,kind,loving,passionate animal to being a beast. But although buck has been beaten and mis-treated by man, He still has some compassion. This is expressed when Buck meets John Thorton. This is where the saying &quot; A dog is mans best friend&quot; is brought to life. In conclusion I would recommand you read this book because it will both intrigue and captivate you."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's The Call of the Wild, I think, wasn't that great. It was descriptive, nd the characters did seem real, but I wouldn't recomend it. For one thing, there isn't much dialogue, and when there is, it's not very understandable. For example: &quot;T'ree vair good dogs. Dat Buck, heem pool lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyting.&quot; Ther are worse, but I could't understand them. Also, I don't like the way that all of the characters died (or left without return) except Buck. I don't think that the main character should miraculously live through everything, just because he's the main character. That is wht I think about Jack London's The Call of the Wild."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The book that I read was about a dog that was stolen out of his house. People were getting dogs because it was dog sledding time so they needed strong dogs that could be used during the winter. I think this book is called the called of the wild because, a dog was taken from his home and was taken far away, so the dog was not used to the wild so he got lost and was lost in the wild not knowing were to go so I think that means the call of the wild for him because he had to trough a lot of things to be able to get back home with his real owner not to the people who took him. This book is also about the guy that if he would read the newspaper he would have known that his dog was missing since the morning. This book is mostly for people who are interested in dog books but not only on that also in people who like books about adventure because this was kind of like it. Also people who like very good books like this one that I read."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book was pretty good over all. It was a slow read, but Jack London knows how to write a good book.I would not recommend this book for anyone under 5 grade. It was pretty Gory. The first couple of pages were hard to follow. This book was a good book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"\\"The Call of the Wild\\" is a book about a dog that starts out as a spoiled dog named Buck that lives the good life, but when gold miners find out about gold in Alaska they start needing sled dogs. Buck was at a store one day when two men kidnapped him and sold him to gold miners who put him though all kinds of stress, but the more of the wild life he experiences the more of his primitive instincts start kicking in...I would advise this book to anyone who is in to a good Action/Adventure book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"At First, I thought it was kinda boring but then later on in the book I coudn't stop reading. I think Call of the wild and white fang are both great. I loved this book so much."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book, about a dog being terribly mistreated throughout the story, should come with a warning label. Some of the more graphic computer games are not as descriptive as the treatment that the good natured dog, Buck, receives from most of his owners throughout his travels. Finally, the one owner who saves his life and gives him love dies at the hands of the Indians! Not a fun book to put down at one in the morning without another good book to pick you up. This book probably should not be advertised for children under age fourteen."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"If you are interested in reading a srory you cannot relate to, try &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; by Jack London. This book was a real let down. In the begining a swindler named Manuel got me interested, but he soon exited the story. The setting never got devloped properly and would change before I could visualize it. Although the book had up's in the dog fights the constant repetition was ever present in my mind. Of the little dialouge in the book, my Favorite line is &quot;I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils.&quot; Francois said this on page 25. This line was said about Buck after he kills a fellow dog. This story never got me into it enough to like it, and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"If you would like a computer to read this book to you, this would be the book for you to purchase.

Jack London thinks he knows everything about wolves. NOT!! HORRIBLE!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my opinion The Call of the Wild by Jack London was a good book. Jack was very descriptive; he made the novel come alive and he kept me reading. Though, there were certain sections I didn't care for, such as the beatings of the dogs and John Thornton's death. Also the characters Mercedes, Hal, and Charles were very annoying, and it seemed unrealistic when they made it so far acting the way they did. The quote &quot;I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils,&quot; (page 25) shows that Buck was a strong fierce fighter and what the language they spoke back then was like. I found the colloquial languages easy to comprehend. I suggest this novel to all younge adults eager to learn what life was like in 1897. Again I enjoyed The Call of the Wild and would like to read more books like it."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In Jack London's Call of the Wild I thought that it was a very detailed book. This book was so detailed that you got a really good picture of what it was like. Then other times it was so detailed it got really boring. You really get the feeling of what it was like back in the 1800's and the Yukon. &quot;Dat Buck for sure learn queek as anyt'ing&quot; I like this quote because this is how I think that Buck is becoming wild. This is how Buck earns the respect from his handler and teams. It is amazing how he could become a great sled dog so quick. From a scale from 1 to 10 I give this book a 7 because it had good detail and a good story line."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London is a great author. I am not a big fan of this subject. I read this book for school. It has a lot of words that are small on good size pages. I think the story was hard to follow. There is also some blood in it.

If you are a good reader and you like this subject you would probaly like it."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book was one of the worst books i have ever read.

I first read this book in the 6th grade. It was &#34;OK&#34; but I had no context in my life to connect with it. An adventure I've been on made me recall some of the haunting words of Mr. London and I re-read it. There is much wisdom in acknowledging that the &#34;call of the wild&#34; is in and all around us and every living creature. Buck was domestic and happy, yet the call to something greater and unknown after hardship and tragedy is inspiring. Maybe our intuitive selves are as powerful as our educated and well- behaved selves."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Very good book. It is written from the view of the dog as he is dog napped and sent to the youkon."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I am not one for most classical literature, but after being required to read Jack London's &#34;The Call of the Wild&#34; in an 8th grade language arts class, I cannot wait to read more books written in a similar style. London's choice of words and realist/naturalist style of writting are very interesting, even for me as a 14 year old. Buck has become one of those &#34;close&#34; characters in terms of reading, though the story itself is more depressing than not.In my class, we were required to annotate the text, which personally made it easier to connect with the characters and harder to part with them. In this set up, that is a good thing.I was hesitant to read this book even though I had to, but now I'm glad I broadened my horizons a bit more. For the teachers out there, this is a story that I bet your students will truly enjoy.

The environment bread harsh attitudes. Also in the testing of ones mettle one finds their true potential.Buck (a dog that is half St Bernard and half Shepherd) goes through many lives, trials, and tribulations finally realizing his potential. On the way he learns many concepts from surprise, to deceit, and cunning; he also learns loyalty, devotion, and love. As he is growing he feels the call of the wild.This book is well written. There is not a wasted word or thought and the story while building on its self has purpose and direction. The descriptions may be a tad graphic for the squeamish and a tad sentimental for the romantic. You see the world through Buck's eyes and understand it through his perspective until you also feel the call of the wild.The Call of the Wild - Dog of the Yukon (1997)"},{"Title":"Nuclear Witnesses: Insiders Speak Out","review":"As a student at Carleton College in the 70's, I took a seminar called Science and Society co-led by professors from the chemistry and religion departments. That class informed my entire life on the ethical dilemmas posed by \\"technological advances\\".Reading Nuclear Witnesses revives my commitment to questioning the wisdom of modern scientific advances. This twenty year old book is especially vital to the realization that 20/20 hindsight is not a luxury humanity can afford when it comes to nuclear power.As mankind continues to put material wealth and power over environmental health and spiritual values, it is even more important that we baby boomers and those coming of age study the recent past and maintain perspective on the promotion of the next panacea that will permit the persistence of the Western civilization's excess. New threats to our environment are extant with Bush II's repudiation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and his cavalier attitude to the environment (Kyoto Protocols, and Alaskan drilling)What is so compelling about Nuclear Witnesses is the first person account of those close to the nuclear industry--the Navaho who mined uranium, the U.S. Army serviceman who witnessed atmospheric atomic tests, the carpenter and millwright who built defective nuclear plants and the scientists who were pressured and sometimes physically threatened to falsify their findings.These real time first person accounts are even more frightening read in retrospect as we have lived through more peacetime nuclear scares since Three Mile Island and witnessed the arrogant accumulation of nuclear arms in non signatory nations (and non-nations, -Al Qaeda?) in under-developed parts of the world.Read this 1982 book with 2002 eyes against the backdrop of military exercises conducted by two Third World nations with nuclear capability-India and Pakistan.Read it and weep."},{"Title":"Seeing Beyond the Wrinkles: Stories of Ageless Courage, Humor, and Faith","review":"As I read through the stories in &quot;Seeing Beyond the Wrinkles,&quot; my heart was warmed.

However, the novel is not finished, which is very disappointing. The story wanders from the beginning, in which a ship from early Rome is blown off course across the Atlantic ocean to North America about the first century A.D., to a description of two Ppre-Columbian Native American populations who exist in peace until a forbidden love causes a war. The story never returns to the plight of the Roman castaways (which is disappointing, as it starts out in a very interesting way), and continues to digress at many points throughout the story. One of the major interests about this book is the premise that Joseph Smith, who founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, commonly called the Mormon Church, used Mr. Spauldings book as the basis for the Book of Mormon. After reading the unfinished novel, it becomes plain that the Book of Mormon and Manuscript Found have little in common other than the setting of North America and the fact that pre-Columbian American peoples are both featured in both books. The Mormons were responsible for publishing Manuscript Found (which was never published by the author for want of any publisher's interest in it), in an effort to show that the novel could not have been used by Joseph Smith as a source for the Book of Mormon (which Mormons believe is an additional book of sacred scripture and a testament of Jesus Christ when he appeared to pre-Columbian Native Americans shortly after his crucifixtion and ascension to heaven). Many critics of the Mormons have stated that Mr. Spauldings Manuscript Found was Joseph Smith's inspiration for the Book of Mormon. However, after reading the book objectively, and comparing it to the Book of Mormon, I found almost no similarity at all, other than the setting of Pre-Columbian North America. Still, Manuscript Found is an interesting work. The edition published by the Mormons shows photocopies of Mr. Spaulding's original manuscript at the beginning of each chapter and also prints the parts he crossed out so that the entire manuscript may be seen in the published form, including the author's editing marks. It is worthwhile to read it."},{"Title":"Manuscript Found: The Complete Original (Religious Studies Center Specialized Monograph Series, V. 11)","review":"The principle source for Manuscript Found was his Professor John Smith at Dartmouth. Professor Smith's Natural Philosophy lectures completed in 1780 provide the peopling of America migration schemes and Smith's Greek Classics lectures on Homer provide the Helen of Troy motiff used to frame the story. Though it is not recorded whether he revisited the peopling of America theme after 1780, he did develop the Dartmouth Arminian Theology lectures between 1787 and 1809 that parallel the Book of Mormon and early Mormon Doctrine quite closely.These theology lectures were not directly available to Solomon Spaulding who graduated in 1785 and only the Old Testament lectures were directly availble to Ethan Smith who graduated in 1790 and later lectures were available indirectly through Ethan's son Lyndon who attended Dartmouth from 1813-17. Since Solomon Spaulding completed Manuscript Found in 1812 and died in 1816, his nephews James Spaulding who attended the Dartmouth Medical School from 1811 to 1813 and Levi Spaulding who attended Dartmouth College from 1811 to 1815 did not have an opportunity to influence Manuscript Found but were available to play the same type of role in bringing awareness of Manuscript Found to the Dartmouth campus that Lyndon Smith played in bringing Ethan Smith's early theology books started in 1811 to Dartmouth when he arrived in 1813.Joseph Smith would have been only indirectly aware of ideas discussed at Dartmouth through his brother Hyrum, who attended Moor's School between 1811 and 1815 with Indians. Elijah Lyman a Smith in-law, however, maintained continuous contact with Dartmouth from his nearby Brookfield, Vermont, pastorate where he trained Dartmouth graduates to go on missions to the Indians, including Alfred Finney who graduated in 1814 and trained with Elijah Lyman for a year before going to spend the rest of his life with the Cherokee where he set up the Dwight Indian School."},{"Title":"The Ecstasy of Enlightenment: Teaching of Natural Tantra","review":"First, the good news. This is a handsome little book, and well written and well conceived in certain ways. It is fortunate that these poems are now available in English. The poems themselves are fascinating from a historical point of view and contain some interesting imagery. I am not able to read the original old Bengali in which these poems were written, so I don't know the accuracy of the translations, but the poetry of the translations is for the most part quite nice.Now the bad news: Mr Cleary also provides an interlinear commentary on each poem. Mr. Cleary makes a good stab at this, but I think he really misses the point. His approach is far too intellectual (no ecstacy here!) and rather narrow in scope, and it is not Tantric! These are Tantric poems, not scholarly Madhayamika-Prasanghika poems. The symbolism is conveyed in multiple rich layers of sensuous physicality, Tantric psychology and spirituality that seem lost on Mr. Cleary. I've practiced Hindu Tantra and then Tibetan Buddhist Tantra (which grew out of Tantrism from other parts of India) for many years now, and it is obvious to me what most of the symbolism is talking about, but the author hasn't a clue IMHO. The commentaries are also strictly limited to interlinear notes: there are no summary statements for each poem that would link the themes together. I suspect he didn't do this because he didn't often see the unity in each poem because he was way off base about the meaning of the symbolism, all caught up in non-Tantric Zen/Taoist stuff. Hence, the commentaries end up as a series of short unrelated paragraphs mistakenly interpreting almost every symbol from a Sutra perspective, only rarely bringing in an interpretation that addresses Tantra or the blending of Tantra and Sutra. It would have been better just to publish the poems."},{"Title":"The Ecstasy of Enlightenment: Teaching of Natural Tantra","review":"If you are VERY new to eastern thought or one who wants someone to break things down for you to the 'nth degree, this could work for you.

Berkan, Visions Of Hope: Stories Of Victory Over Child Abuse is compelling collection of true stories of people who have survived unthinkable physical and/or sexual abuse as children, and who learned to transform their lives and overcome their pasts. The stories alternate with powerful and meaningful asides about the nature of child abuse, what it is, how it harms young psyches and how its damage does not have to define a survivor's life.

Originally started by L. Frank Baum writing as Edith Van Dyne, the series was continued by Emma Sampson after Baum's death in 1919. While Baum favored Mary Louise, Sampson continues the series focusing more on Josie,the young detective, and treats Mary Louise as a minor character. In this book, Mary Louise donates the house she inherited from her grandfather and a significant sum of money to the local orphanage. Two new orphans attract the attention of Josie O'Gorman who begins to investigate the mystery of their missing parents and the strange young woman who abandoned them.

He also explains how many if not most woodturners don't do it right and even why they don't, which helps. In parts it reads like a technical manual because the technical terms here are the clearest and most efficient (&#34;efficient&#34; is a good descriptive of the style, presentation and perspective of the book). I must confess I'm still puzzled by several of the terms, such as &#34;clearance.&#34; (I'm not sure how the chisel has &#34;clearance&#34; in respect to the spinning stock, but I do know I can figure it out.) In spite of this he is crystal clear on how to precisely do what his analysis recommends is best. I am still working through the book and still breaking in my lathe, but I have several books on woodturning and this one is far and above the others for extremely practical guidance with intelligent explanations. Darlow makes me feel that he respects my abilities highly, in that he assumes I'll follow with his detailed discussion and that I'll follow his instructions exactly."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Woodturning","review":"Excellent book, a lot of information for a beginning and intermediate turner.It is quite deetailed in describing specific steps needed to create a number of typical woodturning projects."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Woodturning","review":"If you're new to woodturning, this book is for you.

This book should be required reading for anyone thinking of managing or leading people, covering all the things you need to do to succeed, or, in other words, all of the things managers so often don't think about resulting in unnecessary failure.

The Art of Managing People by Asking Questions","review":"-- This message was also posted on MLPF and LinkedIN Lions ---Most people appreciate the difference grandparents made in their lives. While their parents are much more concerned with how a child should be, their grandparents have the patience to create the space for the child to become who they really are. Basically it is the felt difference between emotional stress and emotional support.The same is true for management books. Most management book authors are like parents, telling the child how it needs to be. And managers are like children, wanting to live up to expectations. Do you have friends or relatives who are a manager? Do you feel they could use some emotional support? After all, being a manager is quite often a challenge, and sometimes it is more than one can bear. These are the times when they need some kind of support.Here's the good news. My friend and mentor, Frank Kanu, has published a management book that will bring your manager friend the emotional support (s)he sometimes needs. Here's an example:\\"When there's no plan, deadlines are missed, budgets are overextended, customers are unhappy, employees are angry and exhausted, and managers have to clean up the mess.\\" (p128)I remember the time when i was an employee, and i read \\"the Dilbert Principle\\" by Scott Adams. And for the first time in my life i felt the emotional support, coming right out of this book.This book by Frank Kanu, \\"Stop Telling... Start Leading !\\" is such a book. If you would like to give your friend the emotional support that you think (s)he deserves, then by all means, buy the book and give it to her or to him. The book is available from Amazon.com.As a gift for you, i will throw in a free PDF version of my own book \\"Bilocality and the inner world of attention\\". I feel that this way, we've all done just this little extra, to help those who need us most.Let's continue improving our life and those we care about.Warmest regards, Ronhttp://www.whatisattention.org"},{"Title":"Stop Telling.

Stevenson's views are clearly influenced by his Christianity, and some of them seem implausible from a more modern, scientific standpoint, but there is still much of value to be gleaned from these stories.\\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is about an upstanding, respectable doctor who has a darker side which he guiltily hides from society, until through his experiments he severs in himself \\"those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man's dual nature.\\" This view of man's nature, as well as the natures of good and evil, is rather mystical, even Platonic, and not particularly insightful...but Stevenson has other things to say on those subjects which are. For instance, this story also explores the theme of how giving in to minor vices corrupts one's character, leading the way to greater evils and making it ever harder to remain on the path of righteousness.---\\"The Body Snatcher\\" is the least interesting story of the three, about corpses for dissection by medical students being provided by increasingly foul means. It deals with some similar themes to \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", such as that acts of evil that would seem impossible to one at first may be reached by gradual steps, and that once the first step is taken it becomes increasingly more difficult to turn back until the end result becomes inevitable.---In some ways the most interesting of the three stories, \\"Olalla\\" is about a young man who falls in love with a woman with a terrible secret in her family. In some passages, Stevenson seems to reject the dual nature he portrayed in \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\": \\"the soul and the body are one, and mostly so in love. What the body chooses, the soul loves; where the body clings, the soul cleaves; body for body, soul to soul, they come together at God's signal; and the lower part (if we can call aught low) is only the footstool and foundation of the highest.\\"By the end, however, he explicitly rejects this view in favor of the Christian doctrine of Original Sin: \\"behold the face of the Man of Sorrows. We are all such as He was---the inheritors of sin; we must all bear and expiate a past which was not ours; there is in all of us---ay, even in me---a sparkle of the divine. Like Him, we must endure for a little while, until morning returns bringing peace\\"---and speaks of \\"sad and noble truths; that pleasure is not an end, but an accident; that pain is the choice of the magnanimous; that it is best to suffer all things and do well.\\"I don't have much sympathy for this view of life, but Stevenson's artistic presentation of it is good and I enjoyed these stories. They are well-written and thought-provoking, and pack a lot of punch for their short lengths, which is more than you can say for a lot of fiction these days. So, not my favorites (not even my favorites by Stevenson---I prefer his adventure stories, such as Treasure Island and Kidnapped), but worth reading. Michael Kitchen's narration of this audio edition is outstanding."},{"Title":"The Strange Case Of Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson's novella was published in 1886.

In short, it means a good time.A couple of days spent reading this book means you will certainly lose a few brain cells thanks to the mindless plot and poor dialogue.The book sells itself as a fun, summer-type of read that details what happens when two couples head the Provincetown for a week of fun. During the first few obligatory \\"road trip\\" chapters, I think the foursome must deal with a flat tire, but the writing is so bland I cannot be sure.Once they hit Provincetown, the women begin drinking, arguing, flirting and drinking some more. Here's where the terrible dialogue hits its full stride. Every character speaks in the same voice, a voice that requires constant use of the phrase \\"you guys\\" (when referring to each other) and lots of (!!!!!!) exclamation points to make up for a lack of anything worth exclaiming over.Toward the end there is a drawn-out \\"mystery\\" plot about what happened to the group's supposedly-straight friend. I'm sure this storyline was needed because, like most people, I definitely start freaking out if a friend of mine disappears for a few hours while ON VACATION. Ludicrous.I couldn't actually bring myself to finish the book, it was that bad. Maybe the last 30 or so pages are brilliant, but I'm doubtful.I almost bought this book during a recent trip to Provincetown. Thankfully my girlfriend, who is not so prone to impulse-buying, read the first page and wisely cautioned me against it. I checked it out from the library instead. If you absolutely must read this book for some reason, I recommend doing the same. Save your $16.10 instead for dinner at Tofu-A-Go-Go, one of my favorite restaurants in Ptown.For a compelling, intelligent read, check out &quot;Light, Coming Back&quot; by Ann Wadsworth, or &quot;Fingersmith&quot; by Sarah Waters.If you need a dose of Provincetown during these cold winter months, read &quot;The Men From the Boys&quot; by William Mann or &quot;Land's End: A Walk in Provincetown&quot; by Michael Cunningham.&quot;The Big House: A Century of Life in an American Summer Home&quot; by George Howe Colt, is an outstanding nonfiction book about an old home on Cape Cod."},{"Title":"P-Town Summer","review":"I don't like to write bad reviews especially considering this is probably Ms. Stocker's passion but I would not suggest purchasing this book.After spending many a vacation in P-Town I was really looking forward to this read, but instead found a predictable drawn out storyline. The story revolved around having a drink every waking moment, constant cattiness, predictable hookups, and boring conversations. This may sound like interesting drama, but it wasn't. If it is at all possible to make drama drab, this book has accomplished such a thing. It just didn't seem real in any sense and that was not a good thing.Bottom line, I would not recommend buying this book.

A worthwhile introduction to myths."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"The major fault of Edith Hamilton's classic Mythology also serves as its greatest strength. Hamilton edited this collection in a very conservative social mileu, and chose to edit out and play down much of the sex and violence one typically finds in the greek myths. However, that choice makes it an excellent selection to give teens and pre-teens their first introduction to the world of Zues, Perseus, Hercules, and the rest.Several other intructory books on myths are available, but this remains the classic. Other less sanitized collections, however, are probably better for older readers.The myths are well presented and organized. A short section on Norse myth, though prefunctory and not Hamilton's speciality, provides in theresting contrast and good fun for young readers. The essays included are good, though not the books greatest strength.

All the stories don't flow like a novel would and it is more like a short story with the mindful notations (e.g., prior to retelling the Hercules story, Hamilton says that she chose to retell Apollodorus's tale of Hercules over Ovid's because of it provided more detail).Hamilton provides more than just the Greek myths and adds a bit of a sociological analysis through the lens of mythology. It wasn't what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's &quot;Mythology&quot; tell the &quot;Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes&quot; of classical mythology and this volume, first written in 1942, is now a timeless classic itself. This was the first book of mythology that I ever read and it is still the best. When Hamilton retells the love story of Cupid and Psyche or the tragedy of Agamemnon and his children, she does so with a full sense of what it meant when first told by Apuleius or Aeschylus. These are not children's tales, but the heroic legends and religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Furthermore, the illustrations by Steele Savage have the elegance of wood block prints, which, for all I know, is exactly what they are. I appreciate Hamilton's choice to avoid relying on Ovid, for while the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the most comprehensive ancient text dealing with the classical myths, Ovid is an unbeliever. For Hamilton the writings of Homer, Hesiod and Pindar are more abbreviated in terms of providing details for the myths, but at least they take the tales seriously.Another strength of the book is how she organizes the myths in her seven parts: (1) Covers the complete pantheon of deities, including the lesser gods of Olympus and Earth and the later Roman additions, as well as the earliest heroes. (2) Retells the various tales of love, between mortals and the gods or each other, along with the Quest for the Golden Fleece and other early heroic adventures. (3) Focuses specifically on the greatest heroes, Perseus, Theseus and Hercules, with Atalanta thrown in the mix in a curious but understandable editorial decision by Hamilton. (4) Puts together Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid into a giant epic stretching from the Judgment of Paris to the founding of Roman, with the Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides. (5) Tells about the great mythological families, namely the House of Atreus (Agamemnon), the Royal House of Thebes (Oedipus and Antigone), and the Royal House of Athens. (6) Covers all of the lesser myths, most notably Midas. (7) Goes off in a new direction, providing a very brief introduction to Norse mythology that seems woefully inadequate given the comprehensive compilation of classical mythology that precedes it.I looked over other possibilities as a basic textbook for my Classical Greek &amp; Roman Mythology course (I know, it sounds redundant and repetitive to me too, but it is not like I came up with the name of the class), but I selected this one as my basic text (with &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; by Robert Graves to provide considerably more details and alternative tales). If you want analysis of these myths, then you certainly want to look elsewhere. But if you want a solid retelling of the key stories of classical mythology, then Edith Hamilton's volume is still at the top of the list for my money (and those my students have to pay for the book). I fully admit that I am biased because I read this during my formative years and her language and rhythms are engrained in my brain."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY will give you a good overview of the Greek Gods and heroes as well as a smattering of some of the great writers of Greek and Roman culture, Sophocles, Aeschylus, and Ovid, as well as others. The book will also validate the contention that if God did not exist, man would have invented him. The Greek gods are portrayed with human foibles: jealousy, anger, trickery. No god was all-powerful. Zeus, for instance, is depicted as being fallible in many ways. Hera was constantly getting the best of him.When Hamilton turns to the Greek heroes, we once again see how these characters were fashioned according to prevailing value system. Theseus shuns the kingdom of Athens for that of commander-in-chief. He wants to people to be free. We see him in action when the Athenians invade Thebes to force them to bury the five remaining champions who had died trying to elevate Polyneices to Oedipus's vacated thrown. When the King of Argos asks for his help, he calls an assembly to decide. When they conquer the city, he will not let his soldiers sack the city, insisting that the army came only to bury the dead. He then prepares the bodies for burial with his own hands.Two of the most interesting of the gods are Dionysus and Demeter, the two gods most concerned with humanity. Hamilton uses them to show how winter came about. Demeter's daughter Persephone was kidnapped by Hades, God of the Underworld. When Demeter brought blight to the world, Zeus negotiated a deal whereby for a third of the year Persephone would live in the underworld. In Dionysus's case winter is that time of the year when the God of the Vine was pruned, only the bare stalk remaining. In the springtime, he would revive. He was the assurance that death does not end all. His worshippers believed that his death and resurrection showed that the soul lives on forever after the body dies.In the last two chapters, Hamilton turns to Norse mythology. The most fascinating thing about them is that they were so fatalistic. The Gods knew that in the end evil would win out and they would be destroyed. The most important thing to the Norse was that they show courage in the face of death."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This mythology books is one of the most comprehensive and cmplete books I have ever read.

Treat yourself to the Ultimate Classic!"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"While it is certainly true that Edith Hamilton is a standby in the field of Classics, her telling of myths must be taken with a grain of salt. A product of her time and education, she has a tendancy to try and force a quasi-Christian mythos on Greek legends ie a Savior figure being slain and resurrected. Although this is a good introduction, particularly for younger folk, it should be viewed as a springboard and no more. It is easy to read, and relatively well laid out, but anyone with a serious interest in Greek mythology and mindset should look elsewhere for a truer understanding and appreciation, one that does not force or contrive Christian parallels."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I had to use this book as a textbook for my high school mythology class. To her credit, Edith Hamilton was one of the first to provide so diverse and inclusive a collection of Greek and Roman myths in one volume, and it is an excellent resource for finding so many stories, even the obscure ones. As a storyteller, however, Hamilton is lacking. Although she opens each chapter with a note on the literary sources for the tale, she tells them in a matter-of-fact, scientific manner, not allowing the story to unfold and flow in an enjoyable way. She does have her moments; for example, her telling of Cupid and Psyche is quite excellent. In general, however, her method is boring and frustrating, as she does not put many of the stories in a chronological, or even sensible, order. To be honest, I think my best experience with Classical mythology was my first, which was reading picture book collections in fourth grade. The stories are always great, provided you can get through the storyteller."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Hmm. Wasn't really thrilled with this book. I found it to be a bit dry and boring.

I had hope that this book would help me start to remember at least some of it, but it seems to have made things a little worse.Author Edith Hamilton retells various Greek and Romans myths, in her own words. Most gods are referred to by both names which, at least for me, only adds to the confusion. On top of that, Hamilton's writing style doesn't appeal to me. I had to read and re-read sentences, not because they were complex and confusing but because my mind would actually wander in the middle of sentences - not a good indicator.Clearly, mythology is a matter of taste, but if you're anything like me - a bit ignorant on the topic and trying to correct that - this book is a good reference, something to open and rely on for info, but not a good read.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Very good book on a basic guide to ancient mythology, but I was disappointed to find out how basic it was. I like how it seemed the author was mixing Greek, Roman, Nordic, and other ancient mythologies together... However, this book seems to stick to Greek and Roman and barely touch on Nordic, and the other mythologies might as well have been deleted they tell so little. Certainly not a bible for mythology at all!Overall I learned a little, and it was interesting, none-the-less. I don't feel cheated, but I wouldn't buy it again."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This is a long standing work on mythology. The emphasis is on Greek and Roman tales, with a too brief discussion of Norse mythology. That some of the other reviewers mention it in the same breath as Bulfinch is testimony to the volume's value.The work features a nice introductory essay to \\"set up\\" the discussion of Greek and Roman myths. There is also a rather unsatisfying brief introduction to the underdeveloped section on Norse mythology.The first part features \\"The Gods, the Creation, and the Earliest Heroes.\\" Here, Hamilton examines the array of gods, the stories of creation, and early heroes (such as Prometheus, Europa, and Polyphemus [hero??]). Part Two explores \\"Stories of Love and Adventure.\\" In this segment, Hamilton considers Cupid and Psyche, and a series of tales of love (e.g., Pyramus and Thisbe, Orpheus and Eurydice, and so on). Also, the story of the Golden Fleece is retold.Part Three summarizes \\"The Great Heroes before the Trojan War,\\" including renderings of Perseus, Theseus, and the great Hercules. Part Four, as one might have anticipated, looks at \\"The Heroes of the Trojan War.\\" Hamilton spends time on a number of figures and stories, such as Paris, the fall of Troy, Odysseus' post-Troy adventures, and the travails of Aeneas.Part Five considers \\"Great Families of Mythology,\\" such as the Houses of Atreus (think Agamemnon and Iphigenia), Thebes (Cadmus, Oedipus, Antigone), and Athens. Hamilton then moves to Part Six, where she summarizes the stories of \\"The Less Important Myths,\\" including Midas, Glaucus and Scylla, inter alia.Part Seven, as already noted, is a too brief coverage of \\"The Mythology of the Norsemen.\\"And, finally, a wonderfully helpful genealogy at the end (e.g., Ancestors of Perseus and Hercules, the House of Troy, and so on).This is well written and shows considerable erudition. There are some problems in coverage as noted, but, in the end, this is still a welcome volume."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's &quot;Mythology&quot; tell the &quot;Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes&quot; of classical mythology and this volume, first written in 1942, is now a timeless classic itself. This was the first book of mythology that I ever read and it is still the best. When Hamilton retells the love story of Cupid and Psyche or the tragedy of Agamemnon and his children, she does so with a full sense of what it meant when first told by Apuleius or Aeschylus. These are not children's tales, but the heroic legends and religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Furthermore, the illustrations by Steele Savage have the elegance of wood block prints, which, for all I know, is exactly what they are. I appreciate Hamilton's choice to avoid relying on Ovid, for while the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the most comprehensive ancient text dealing with the classical myths, Ovid is an unbeliever. For Hamilton the writings of Homer, Hesiod and Pindar are more abbreviated in terms of providing details for the myths, but at least they take the tales seriously.Another strength of the book is how she organizes the myths in her seven parts: (1) Covers the complete pantheon of deities, including the lesser gods of Olympus and Earth and the later Roman additions, as well as the earliest heroes. (2) Retells the various tales of love, between mortals and the gods or each other, along with the Quest for the Golden Fleece and other early heroic adventures. (3) Focuses specifically on the greatest heroes, Perseus, Theseus and Hercules, with Atalanta thrown in the mix in a curious but understandable editorial decision by Hamilton. (4) Puts together Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid into a giant epic stretching from the Judgment of Paris to the founding of Roman, with the Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides. (5) Tells about the great mythological families, namely the House of Atreus (Agamemnon), the Royal House of Thebes (Oedipus and Antigone), and the Royal House of Athens. (6) Covers all of the lesser myths, most notably Midas. (7) Goes off in a new direction, providing a very brief introduction to Norse mythology that seems woefully inadequate given the comprehensive compilation of classical mythology that precedes it.If you want analysis of these myths, then you certainly want to look elsewhere. But if you want a solid retelling of the key stories of classical mythology, then Edith Hamilton's volume is still at the top of the list for my money. I fully admit that I am biased because I read this during my formative years and her language and rhythms are engrained in my brain, just like the illustrations by Savage."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I've done quite a bit of reading about greek (and roman) mythology and I still enjoyed this book. They way the myths are writen is so good that I could almost feel myself back in ancient Greece, observing the scenes. I also enjoyed the quotes from the original source where the myth was told (e.g. The Odyssey, The Illiad, etc). Overall this is a good basic classical mythology book. Even people who already know these myths should read this book if only for the delightful manner in which they are told. For someone who cannot match a roman god to his greek conterpart this might require flipping back to the first chapter. If you pay attention the first time you read it you shouldn't have any trouble with this.Near the end of the book there are a couple norse myths. That's it. If your looking for a book that has myths from more than just Greece/Rome you'll be disappointed.

I've also found that it comes in handy as a reference work.

Broken into easy parts to read and interestingly written accounts of their tales"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"The author takes a nicely readable and informative look at the classical mythology of Ancient Greece. Readers come away with a strong understanding of the subject, everything from Hercules to Ovid, Cupid to the Gods, plus their loves, quarrels, etc. Readers also gain a strong knowledge of the heroic legends and fervent religious beliefs of the world's first semi-democracy (only male citizens voted). My favorite sections included the loves of the Gods, and the writings of Homer, though some say she was a bit brief with the latter. We studied this book as high school freshman, and while not converted into a fan (I prefer Greek philosophers, particularly Socrates), I did come away much better informed. Fervent aficionados of Greek mythology should enjoy this volume as well as books offering deeper analysis; other readers should be satisfied to start and stop here."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"What I found pleasantly surprising about this book is that it is easily understood, yet a very viable source of ancient Greek mythology. Great for all ages if you are interested at all in Greek mythology."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"The most readable primer on ancient Greek gods I have ever read, perfect for all students, whether you're in high school or college.

This collection of myhtologies is like cliff notes for nearly every mythological story imaginable.This means that if you truly want detailed informatioon, this may not be the correct purchase for you. For all school/educational purposes, this collection is well equipped to aid you in your endeavors.Some may say that it does not give accurate accounts of certain events, but need i remind you that in mythology, there is no corrrect or set standard of a story. In mythology there are constantly changing elements, none of which transform the meaning of the story. This set of stories by Edith Hamilton actually tells the original/most famous version of the tale, then gives alternate endings/summaries of other versions.Good Luck!"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Hamilton is definitely the gold standard for retelling these glorious, ancient myths. Her style is engaging and the structure of the book makes it very easy to keep track of such ridiculously branched family trees. This is much more than just a reference book...it's more like a giant Greek fairytale book."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I've had this book on my keeper shelf since high school. Reading such stories has fueled an interest in reading quality fantasy stories. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you shoud have this as a complementary book."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I first read this book in sixth grade, and instantly fell in love with it. I loved the concept of mythology and loved how the book was written. I didn't find the boring aspects everyone else seemed to find. I devoured the book whole, and now, years later, I bought it. I was curious to see if the magic would hit me twice.It did, in a sense. I vaguely remembered the stories, so the aspect of surprise and shock in some of the stories was ruined for me. Granted, when I first read it I was very young, but there were still some things that were more enjoyable to read the first time. Since then, I've moved onto other classic mythology books, and have found them to be very enjoyable too.It is true, yes, that Edith Hamilton writes well, but overall the book is dry. It is true that this is a mere introduction and does not present us with every tale in the history of various mythologies (the Norse mythology section is pitifully short - I'd turn elsewhere for that). Overall, though, it's an enjoyable introduction, an easy read (if you can deal with the dryness), and an overall good book. It's convenient on the shelf and can serve you for many years to come.A pretty good buy, but more serious readers should head towards more serious books, even if they'll be more difficult to read."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's very popular 'Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes' is a very basic, very popular and very good text for the introduction of Greek and Roman mythology. This book by Hamilton, simply entitled 'Mythology' is an expansion of the material in the shorter book. Largely, however, it is a repetition of the same material.In our Western culture, the term 'mythology' is most often equated with these tales, and Hamilton, first writing before World War II, has helped to reinforce that equation with the current generations of readers.Those looking for the mythological stories of other cultures will be disappointed -- with the exception of a brief section on Norse mythology at the end (about five percent of the entire volume), it covers nothing outside the Greek and Roman pantheons. Of course, part of the difficulty of approaching mythology of other cultures is that, in many instances, it is not mythology to them; or, in the case of mythology, one needs a firmer grounding in the culture and religious aspects of that culture before the mythology becomes accessible.Hamilton (raised, as I was astonished to discover, in Indiana, where I currently reside) studied at Bryn Mawr, and had a distinguished teacher career in addition to writing this useful text. Hamilton's writing is not complicated and very easy to follow -- this has made her texts selected often for high school and undergraduate courses in Greek and Roman mythology, more frequently perhaps than any other text produced in this century.Hamilton begins the text with an essay giving an overview of what mythology is, and what the purpose of it was.'Through it,' she wrote, 'we can retrace the path from civilised man who lives so far from nature, to man who lived in close companionship with nature; and the real interest of the myths is that they lead us back to a time when the world was young and people had a connection with the earth, with trees and seas and flowers and hills, unlike anything we ourselves can feel.'She proceeds with a brief history of the development of Greek mythology, the origins of the stories lost in the mists of time. She tells of the influences of Greek thought on subsequent developments in thought and religion: 'Saint Paul said the invisible must be understood by the visible. That was not a Hebrew idea, it was Greek.' Unlike most religious constructs, the Greek mythological world tried to make sense of the greater life of the universe in terms that were very human indeed, with a minimum of mystery. 'The terrifying irrational has no place in classical mythology.'This is not to say, of course, that there were not terrible stories and fantastic creatures -- indeed, the mythological stories are full of them -- Gorgons and hydras and chimaeras dire. But these are mostly metaphorical (and were understood as such), and primarily used for a hero to be made (this same idea has pervaded to the most recent Mission Impossible movie).Hamilton proceeds after this essay to describe the members of the pantheon, the major and minor gods and goddesses, the ideas of creation, the heroes (human, semi-divine and divine), stories of love and devotion, justice and injustice, and, of course, of warfare, victory, defeat, and courage. Those heroes before the Trojan War, perhaps the Greek-mythological-equivalent of a world war, had battles and dire circumstances to fight and overcome. The Trojan War figured largely in the mythological frameworks of Greece and Rome -- all the gods and goddess were involved in this conflict, it seemed, as were many of the heroes of Greek mythology.Hamilton, writing in a fairly conservative period of time, and in a fairly conservative culture, sanitised the mythological stories to a large extent. The Greeks were a very human and often rather bawdy bunch; the Romans were even moreso. Much of the sexuality in the mythological stories is omitted, save to demonstrate the less-desirable aspects. Quite often, undergraduates who study mythology are astonished to discover, if they had used Hamilton's text in an earlier high school setting, that there is a lot more sex and violence in the 'real' stories than they had been previously exposed to.Of course, one of the primary aspects of the mythological tales was not to explain the cosmos or to build complex theological constructs (reason did these, often with help from the myths, but not using the myths as the basis), but rather the illustration of moral truths -- those of honesty, virtue, and courage as primarily valued in Greek and Roman society. Evil befalls those who do not lead a moral life; rewards come to those who do. Of course, there is a bit of whimsy in the cosmos -- bad things happen to good people, etc., even in ancient Greece. The fluctuating personalities of the gods (and the number of them) ultimately gives a satisfying explanation (if not a satisfying reason) why such things might occur."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Although it's difficult to give an accurate review of such a large book with so many different stories, overall Edith Hamilton's Mythology deserves five stars. For a discussion on the myths within this book, please skip down to the capitalized section.The effort put into this book is tremendous. It is quite obvious by her writing the Ms. Hamilton has dedicated plenty of time to this work. Although not all works which have been worked on for so long are necessarily successul, this one is.The book mainly covers Greek and Roman mythology, with a small section of Norse mythology at the end. As there are at least two different names for each god and goddess due to the difference between the Greek and Roman myths, the stories can get a bit confusing. Yet Ms. Hamilton does her best to aid us in understanding. The work begins with an introduction to mythology section which describes certain gods and goddesses, as well as the history of mythology. As stated, these parts may be confusing since there are usually a Roman and Greek name for each important figure.THE STORIES THEMSELVES. The myths themselves are told excellently by Hamilton. She offers views from many different sources, often choosing the best source for each story (or each particular part of a story). As myths differ from writer to writer, you may find that the version of one myth is different from the version Hamilton tells. This is expected. However, Ms. Hamilton does an excellent job telling the myths as best she can, especially considering the amount of myths she tells in the book.The only complaint I have of this book is the fact that some myths that I consider important only receive a few pages in the book, while less important myths (in my opinion) have several pages dedicated to them. Another example of this is the presence of such myths that I thought were important in the 'less important myths' section.Overall, this is a good overview of mythology and is definitely recommended. If you are planning a trip to Greece anytime, I suggest picking this up as it will help explain the significance of many places within Greece that you may end up visiting."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"In my opinion, mythology is a very interesting subject that helps us better understand past cultures' lifestyles and many of the stories are extremely enjoyable. Edith Hamilton's Mythology is a great overview of the Greek classics and it describes how the Greeks were the first mass culture to deify in their own image, have gods that acted very human, and could directly interact with their subjects.The book is set-up very well with sections on the Olympian gods, lesser gods, classic tales of heroes and villains, and much more. Hamilton is a great writer and she really makes you &quot;relive&quot; many of the stories. I also appreciated how Hamilton gave adequate background on historians such as Homer, Ovid, Virgil, etc.Many of the stories contained here most people have heard of, but not in the way that Hamilton tells them. Hercules, Theseus, the Trojan War, even the Calydonian Boar Hunt, are retold in a maserful and enjoyable manner. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the great classics that have remained a part of our culture for many many centuries. My only gripe with the book is that it does not contain much on other mythologies such as the Egyptian, Sumerian, and Norse (Roman myth is heavily related to Greek and is discussed), but there are plenty of works on those."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"it was boaring. don't read it"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I had to read this book in my English 1 class, and even though I thought it would be a drag, I was suprised at the information I got from it. By the way, I am 15 and a freshman at Oak Grove High. Anyway, I now have a very strong knowledge of mythology and I thank Edith Hamilton for writing such a good book and a great leaning tool for us kids in High school"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"My father had a copy of this book when I was growing up, and I read it and re-read it multiple times. I loved the stories and still do. So, of course I had to buy a copy for my kids to (hopefully) pick up and read, and sure enough, my youngest now keeps it on her nightstand, and constantly has her nose in it. When the book arrived, it was like seeing an old friend I hadn't seen in years (even though I've now moved on to Robert Graves \\"The Greek Myths\\" as my \\"go-to\\" version for Greek mythology).Edith Hamilton's version was completed some 50 years ago, but it still holds up as a great introduction for high school and junior high students to these timeless stories. Her prose is clear and direct, and she provides great summaries of some of the lesser known tales, in a way that will keep the interest of any younger reader. This book was NEVER intended to rival Bulfinch's mythology, a book that to this day I refuse to buy because I find it tedious, turgid, stultifying, and sterile. I would rather have my teeth drilled than read Bulfinch's mythology. I would rather be thrown into a cage filled with a hundred starving, rabid weasels than read Bulfinch's mythology. I would rather be tied up and forced to ride the \\"It's a Small World\\" ride at Disney World 100 times in a row and have that insipid little ditty implanted into my brain for a week than read Bulfinch's mythology. Did I mention that I don't like Bulfinch's mythology?And why do I dislike Bulfinch so much? Because after reading Edith Hamilton's take on the Greek myths on my own time, purely for pleasure, as a young teenager, I had Bulfinch foisted upon me by my high school, which, for those of you who care, included a curriculum that featured some grounding in the ancient Greek and Roman cultures. So I have had the chance to sample both, first-hand. And if my goal was to turn-off a young reader from learning about our classical heritage, I couldn't think of a better way to do it than to force Bulfinch upon them. It is written at an inappropriately high level for that age. Thankfully I had a chance to read these stories in a more friendly format, thanks to Miss Hamilton, so I wasn't permanently discouraged from ever hearing them. No, I think a book written at the high school level, like Edith Hamilton's, that doesn't dumb the stories down to the point of insulting the reader, but doesn't lose them with dense prose either, is just the ticket for someone in high school, or someone just being introduced to these stories.I still don't like Bulfinch (obviously) - I'll take the Robert Graves version as an adult, thank you very much.In short, Edith Hamilton's Mythology is highly recommended for your kids, or for you if you're delving into these marvelous stories for the first time. Oh yeah - it has really cool pen-and-ink illustrations throughout it as well. These are stories that have stood the test of time for 2000 years. What's not to like?"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Most inveterate readers, even those that consider themselves reasonably erudite, are all too often woefully lacking in Mythology 101. They may know that there may have been a labyrinth in which lurks a monster, but which monster, and where, and who killed it, is not on the tip of their tongue. In MYTHOLOGY, Edith Hamilton weaves together a tapestry of classical legend and mythos that attempts to makes sense out of man's earliest gropings in coming to terms with a universe that was at once totally unlike man himself and yet could be understood only imperfectly by analogies to himself.This book covers only Greek and Roman classical mythology. True, there is a brief concluding chapter on Norse gods, but essentially Hamilton presents only those timeless tales that form the basis of Western civilization. Hamilton posits a world that must have seemed fierce and forbidden to those Greeks and Romans who undoubtedly saw themselves as the highest paragons of sophisticates that the world had ever known. We in the twentieth century have the knowledge of the microverse and the macroverse to tell us the difference between what we do know and what we can know. Two milennia ago, the Greeks and the Romans had the equivalent in their classical mythologies. It must have seemed finely ground truth that the forces in the world on high could not have differed markedly from the world on low. When they looked skyward at a high mountain peak and heard a deep rumbling and saw bright flashes of fire, it could have meant only the presence of Zeus to the Greeks or Jupiter to the Romans. It is no further surprise that they carefully constructed a pantheon of gods who resembled themselves in human foibles and virtues even if their powers were beyond comprehension. Hamilton's book is a catalog of these traits with which the ancients would have found themselves comfortably familiar.Hamilton writes of these myths in seven parts, ranging from the greatest of gods to the lowest of gods to ordinary mortals who by their actions, were anything but ordinary. She begins each part with an informal but usefully chatty introduction that places that part into its proper historical/mythical/social context. She indicates the source of that myth, and where possible the work itself. Then Hamilton goes into a detailed summary of that myth in a way that reminds the reader of the later fairy tale, with which it is surely related. Her intention is not to present brand new material to the uninitiated, but to allow the reader to retread ground that might have slipped from memory. To such a reader, the list of names of gods, goddesses, and extraordinary mortals would not seem like a disconnected catalog of heavenly names from the Pantheonic Yellow pages, but more like a delightful stroll down memory lane that serves to remind the reader that we today may not be as wordly and knowledgable as the ancients surely considered themselves to be, but each of us, perhaps all of us, continually strive to explain the inexplicable in terms of the already familiar. Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY does this as well as any other book of its type."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I came to Hamilton's book with no background whatsoever in Greek (or any) Mythology. Being somewhat ashamed of this fact, I consulted the reviews here (at amazon) and my local library to find Hamilton's Mythology.I really did love reading this book. As breathtaking as it is, with so many names and alternate names to keep track of, I still thoroughly enjoyed the read. I wasn't submerged in the subject beyond my comfort level as a novice, but still found the content at hand extremely enlightening for the sake of analyzing western culture. Of course, there are myriad references to mythological stories and events even in modern literature and scholarship, so the overview I received from Hamilton helped me to understand some of those references that I recalled from my earlier readings in other subjects. I was appreciative of the fact that her book was as accessible as it was. Though others may have viewed her language as \\"dumbed-down\\", I thought her lack of condescension was very welcome, especially for my level of comprehension of the subject.Hamilton's book has opened the doors, so to speak.

This was the first book of mythology that I ever read and it is still the best. When Hamilton retells the love story of Cupid and Psyche or the tragedy of Agamemnon and his children, she does so with a full sense of what it meant when first told by Apuleius or Aeschylus. These are not children's tales, but the heroic legends and religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Furthermore, the illustrations by Steele Savage have the elegance of wood block prints, which, for all I know, is exactly what they are. I appreciate Hamilton's choice to avoid relying on Ovid, for while the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the most comprehensive ancient text dealing with the classical myths, Ovid is an unbeliever. For Hamilton the writings of Homer, Hesiod and Pindar are more abbreviated in terms of providing details for the myths, but at least they take the tales seriously.Another strength of the book is how she organizes the myths in her seven parts: (1) Covers the complete pantheon of deities, including the lesser gods of Olympus and Earth and the later Roman additions, as well as the earliest heroes. (2) Retells the various tales of love, between mortals and the gods or each other, along with the Quest for the Golden Fleece and other early heroic adventures. (3) Focuses specifically on the greatest heroes, Perseus, Theseus and Hercules, with Atalanta thrown in the mix in a curious but understandable editorial decision by Hamilton. (4) Puts together Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid into a giant epic stretching from the Judgment of Paris to the founding of Roman, with the Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides. (5) Tells about the great mythological families, namely the House of Atreus (Agamemnon), the Royal House of Thebes (Oedipus and Antigone), and the Royal House of Athens. (6) Covers all of the lesser myths, most notably Midas. (7) Goes off in a new direction, providing a very brief introduction to Norse mythology that seems woefully inadequate given the comprehensive compilation of classical mythology that precedes it.I looked over other possibilities as a basic textbook for my Classical Greek &amp; Roman Mythology course (I know, it sounds redundant and repetitive to me too), but I selected this one as my basic text (with &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; by Robert Graves to provide more details and alternative tales). If you want analysis of these myths, then you certainly want to look elsewhere. But if you want a solid retelling of the key stories of classical mythology, then Edith Hamilton's volume is still at the top of the list as far as I concerned.

Boy, was I in for a disappointment. Not only does Edith Hamilton blandly summarize every story, but she leaves out many of the details that students are eager to absorb. Although I have great respect for the text since it was one of the first to bring Greek myth into an easily-accessible form, it is dated and a poor text for a high-school mythology class. Some teachers argue that the elevated language and confusing sentence structure is good practice for serious students, and it is in other contexts. But I am of the opinion that mythology should be fresh and exciting--as it was to the original myth-makers.

It's a great reference tool, and the stories are amazing in their own right. It covers everything and makes it easy to understand. Great buy."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton starts her book with an introduction to Greek Mythology in general and that is when you first know how passionate she is about the myths and what it meant to the people who wrote them. Hamilton's a relaxed but formal author who wants to tell you as much as she can about the gods. The stories range from heroes, revenge, love, adventure, and there are even summaries of the Iliad, Odyssey, and Aeneid mixed in.For those of you reading mythology for the first time, you may not like Hamilton's style. She's as specific as anyone possibly could in less than 500 pages. But if you love mythology as much as I do and absorb all the stories you can find, you'll love her opinions on the authors and the stories. I felt like I was sitting in a chair with her reading it all too me, answering almost all of my questions without me saying a word with a charming air to each tale. I was in awe through out my journey through the good, the bad, and the gore of the Greeks, with some Norse thrown in at the end."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This book gives a great overview to all the major stories that are prevalent in Greek and Latin mythology. She does a good job of explaining where she took her source information from and why at the beginning of each chapter, which is good because there are many stories that were told by more than one major Greek poet, and then modified when the Romans took over. Included in the book are descriptions of the major and minor gods and goddesses, and information about them is compiled from the major stories in a condensed format, so that you can get the full picture of how each was depicted in the section. It also describes the great heroes (Perseus, Hercules) and their many adventures, and takes a whole chapter to condense the Iliad in a format that is much easier to read. It does the same for the Odyssey. It then describes the tragedies, most chiefly those of Oedipus, and at the end there is a little section on Norse myths, which have been made popular by Wagner's operas. At the end of the book are family trees, which really help to display how the gods and heroes and major characters are interrelated. All in all a very informative book that is easy to read. Highly recommended for every mythology buff.Other books to consider:The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley, American Indian Myths and Legends by Richard Erdoes, and Chinese Ghost and Love Stories by Pu Singling"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This is the best single book I've ever seen on classical mythology. An interesting feature is that instead of treating mythology as a monolithic collection of stories, she thinks that the personality and intent of each ancient writer was important: she contrasts the early writers to whom the myths were sacred to later ones like Ovid who considered them entertainment. When commenting on the Hercules cycle, she starts with a discussion of the intellectual hero vs the strong-man hero. Her section on Norse mythology has been criticized as too brief, but she did get the essential difference: the somber Odin foreseeing his tragic downfall is a complete contrast to the capricious Greek gods who never have to fear death or even pain, and represent a crucial difference between Greek and Viking culture. A myth was almost always told for a reason, whether to entertain or to embody the culture that created it."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This book is designed more for the beginner in Mythology. I would assume it was for junior high to high school level. It is written on a level a child can understand. If you are looking for a college help, it may not be as in depth as you wish, but if it is for enjoyment, introduction, or less than college level, it is good reading."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Hamilton's mythology deserves its place with Bulfinch's mythology as one of the primary anthologies of classical mythology. Although the book covers Greek/Roman myths thoroughly, the Norse myths are touched upon only briefly, which is why I have given the book four stars rather than five. Nonetheless, the quality of the book is excellent, and it is useful as a volume to be read for entertainment, and as a classroom primer (I myself have taught a Mythology class using it as the primary textbook). Hamilton's retellings are engaging, and her scholasticism is evident throughout--a small example is her use of the less popular Roman names for the primary gods (Jupiter, Juno, Mars, etc.) when they are found in myths of Roman origin. Hamilton also includes information at the beginning of most chapters about the source of the myth and its author, which is very helpful. She synthesizes the longer myths, such as the Trojan War (found in the Iliad) and the quest for the golden fleece in such a way as to highlight their major events and give the reader a flavor of their content. Overall, I have not encountered a better survey of classical mythology in one volume. Incidentally, if the reader desires more information on the Norse Myths, I recommend Kevin Crossley-Holland's Norse Myths, which is also an excellent volume."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"\\"Mythology\\" covers all the major and most minor Greek, Norse and Roman gods, goddesses, stories and locales.

It looks like a family tree, in a English royalty kind of way.As a writer, I use it for a quick reference guide. I usually only need a few nuggets of information, and she gives me plenty.

This book is a blend of these two ideas.The book is not organized to be a quick reference. It tells the main stories and characters as well as gives a brief section on the minor figures. For each section, the author explains where she is getting the material (for instance, from Homer or from Ovid) with a little editorial comment. Then, she relates the myth. She is giving you the story, but it does not read like a story. It reads like a college instructor giving you the highlights of the story with the occasional comment.Although the bulk of the myths covered are either Greek or Roman, Hamilton does include some Norse mythology.

It provides a summarized version of nearly every significant Greek or Roman myth. Everything from Odysseus' journey to mere descriptions of all minor characters in this vast subject. However, its only good for beginners.Having a brief background in mythology prior to this book, I found it fun and disappointing. It was a good 400-page read, but the writing lacks. Hamilton's interest to keep things short makes the myth sometimes hard to understand and blazingly fast. While the latter isn't bad, if you're interested in reading the details for yourself, this isn't the right book.With the mediocre writing of Hamilton's (she uses &quot;stuff&quot; to describe elements in mythology, but that's just one problem), Mythology provides a decent overview of everything people need to know for the Greek and Roman theology.Another bothersome feature this book had was its chapter on Norse Mythology. It seemed that Edith Hamilton got bored of writing this book and jabbed the Norse Mythology section in to appropriately title the book. It lacks in any depth. Additionally, her narratives show that her enthusiasm for writing this book was nil.Once again, if you're a beginner and interested in mythology, buy the book. If not, you're better of with Bulfinch's Mythology or individual tales (Homer's Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid)."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This book offers an excellent introduction to Greek mythology, which I found accessible and engaging. Hamilton surveys a wide breadth of the most important and classic stories from both Greek and Roman Mythology. I find myself referring back to the book from time to time, to understand a passing reference to mythology.In her introduction, Hamilton demonstrates her grasp of the essential characteristics of Greek Mythology. She notes that the Greeks told stories that romanticized human life, rather than showing a grim or haunted Universe, as other early civilizations chose.She also astutely captures how humanized their stories were: &quot;In Greece alone in the ancient world people were preoccupied with the visible; they were finding the satisfaction of their desires in what was actually in the world around them. The sculptor watched the athletes contending in the games and he felt that nothing he could imagine would be as beautiful as those strong young bodies. So he made his statue of Apollo. [...] They had no wish to create some fantasy shaped in their own minds. All the art and all the thought of Greece centered in human beings.&quot;Indeed! And the fruits of their labor are timeless stories that enrapture us."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I originally read Edith Hamilton's book for a high school literature class. I've loved reading Greco-Roman mythology since childhood. The lives of the major Greco-Roman Gods and Goddesses were better than soap operas to me.When I began reading Edith Hamilton's book back in high school, I thought I'd enjoy reading this text. Although she conducts an excellent scholarly study of GrecoRoman myths, I didn't care for Edith Hamilton's writing style which starved much of the life, warmth, and beauty out of the original tales. She makes the myths sound like more like a comparative literary study than actual stories. It was a huge disappointment: Hamilton's style made GrecoRoman mythology feel like slow torture.I still own my original high school copy of Hamilton's Book. Even though I've finished college and am nearing the completion of grad school, my feelings regarding Edith Hamilton's book haven't changed one iota. Even after re-reading the text several times, it still reads as the same bland, boring, pretentious piece of drivel I read as a freshman in high school. I still, however, use her book as a supplemental reference text.This past week, I decided to pick up and read the alternative to Hamilton's work -- Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable when I began my private study of mythology after reading Joseph Campbell's \\"Pathways to Bliss\\" and \\"The Hero with a Thousand Faces.\\" So far, I love Bulfinch's work and am enjoying it immensely. Bulfinch manages to infuse GrecoRoman myths with life and he manages to make the characters come alive with his storytelling. Bulfinch even include references to Greco Roman mythology in poetic citations. In addition, he even includes pronunciations of Greek/Roman names. Like Hamilton, he also includes alternative versions of myths in his text, but does it with a slight sense of humor. Bulfinch's book is a huge -- much bigger than Hamilton -- but, it's engrossing, interesting, and lively -- I've barely been able to put it down since starting it.Bulfinch's work has made me want to search for other alternative books as well to continue reading about GrecoRoman mythology.If you're looking for a short introductory comparative study of GrecoRoman mythology, then Edith Hamilton's work is for you. But, there are better studies out there in my opinion -- and I urge you to look for alternatives. If you want a text that's not dry, boring, and pendantic then it's hard to beat Bulfinch's Mythology's \\"The Age of Fable.\\""},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Marlon Gunn2/2002Amazon.com---review of Edith Hamilton's book MythologyBasically, I'm a new reader of this book and I love it already. Greek mythology is one of my favorite types of books to read, except for horror books, however. Anyway, what Edith Hamilton does with this book is simply amazing. She has such an uncanny style that separates her from other various writers. She explains the Gods and their purposes in life like she knew them, as if they were real people. I sense that she had a true \\"knack\\" for Greek mythology.Mythology, especially ancient Greek, is at the utmost, my favorite types of adventure-like books. To me, I consider Greek myths adventurous. When I learn something new, about something that I've already read about, I can somehow picture the different deities fighting in battles and sorts.

However, there are so many different stories in this book, it starts to become hard to tell one from the other. That is one thing I disliked about the book Mythology. True, they were separated and placed into categories, but I felt like there were to many stories/legends crammed into one book. However, over all it was a truly wonderful book."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"All the important Greek and Roman mythology is included in this work, with a few &quot;Norse tales&quot; tacked onto the end for flavoring, one supposes. The Norse myths comprise the book's final &quot;Part Seven&quot;, which runs only from page 443, to the end at page 462. These myths of the Northern European Peoples appear after &quot;Part Six&quot;, which bears the rubric &quot;The Less Important Myths&quot;.Only indirectly, and briefly does the author mention such German myths as The Nibelungenleid and Parzival, and then she merely dismisses them thus: &quot;Sigurd is the most famous of Norse heroes; his story is largely that of the hero of the Nibelungenleid, Siegfried... I have not gone into it, however.&quot;There are no Celtic myths. The legend of Arthur's round table at Camelot is omitted, and so are the tales of Roland and the Paladins of Charlemagne. The Holy Grail is nowhere to be found, and there is not a single word about Uncle Remus.All that having been said, one must wonder if the title &quot;Mythology&quot; isn't overstating, just a bit. It certainly leads to disappointment if a reader makes his decision based on the title alone. Perhaps &quot;Classical Mythology&quot; would better suit the text.All of the above doesn't make this a bad book. Actually, the author has turned in a workman-like performance, and all the Greek and Roman foundation tales of Western Civilization are included.I have found the dust jacket blurbs, on my 1942-copyright, used edition, to be interesting reading... this book is a good place to get acquainted with classical mythology."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I had to read this for my AP English class and I probably wouldn't have continued to read it after the first couple of pages if it hadn't been required.While this is a very well written book, conducted in an entertaining but also informative method, it tended to be a bit boring. The names of the Gods and Goddesses seemed to be innumberable and impossible to pronounce unless you've had some previous learning of the Greeks or Romans. Furthermore, since it was difficult to find out how to say their names, it made it difficult to remember them!However, a few of the stories were fun to read, and other were humorous. Also, the stories were written with simplicity; it would be feasible for a middle-schooler to read just as it would be for high-school and beyond.As far as mythology goes, and to it's inherent barrier of excitement, Hamilton did well."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Missed this book from home. Read it in my childhood and jusy haf to read it again.

I would hang back and wait until the library opened and enter as a normal patron :) This book kept me entertained for many many days. As I sat back in the bean chair for hours in the kids section (back then you didn't have to worry about strangers taking kids) I would read about the adventures of Jason and the Argonauts or the mischievous Gods and at the end of the day when it was time to go home I couldn't wait to come back the next day and read some more. Mrs. Hamilton was a great writer, easy to follow and suspenseful. The book is laid out so that you could read it cover to cover or just the sections you are curious about. This was my first introduction to Mythology and by far my favorite Mythology book. After many years I found it or maybe it found me again at a book sale and this time I took it home with me and now it has a permanent spot in my small book collection. I would recommend this book for any children or adults interested in expanding their imagination."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's timeless classic lives on well into the new milennium. This timeless work is the introduction to mythology for many, and it is a fine account. While not as in depth as some would like, I thin this is more accessible to the modern reader as opposed to the earlier Bulfinch's (which I also love).All who are uninitiated to the world of the Greek and Roman gods will find this book indispensible when the topic turns to Greek mythology. Hamilton also does a fine job of pointing out the sources for her retellings, so the enthralled reader can then go to the originals in translation from various authors.This book is a great primer on mythology. I think it is probably one of the oldest text-books in-print continuously since 1942 for good reason."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This book is a fine reference for myth lovers.

I bought my own copy and reread it, it is still interesting and written very well by the author. Anyone interested in Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology will find it interesting and easy to read."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"A great maay children started their mythology interest off, when the teacher recommended this book. In all these decades, it is still one of the best works and is cheaply purchased. The stories are accurate and acceptable myth versions, simply put in wording for the beginner to follow the storyline easily. It is very well geared for a young mind. It is my long held opinion, that this makes a good text book for home schoolers. And it was the textbook when I took a mythology class in 1972-73.I bought this older volume for sentiment, after my own old book mildewed from a storm problem. I thought I was getting the *white* cover, shown on this page... but it arrived with the dark cover... something only a collector would mind. There is a modern print & slightly larger size version with all the same inside, but I find it hard to handle, thus my normal-sized paperback purchase."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's Mythology is a true classic that no personal library should be without.

It's especially great because not only does it tell myths of the Greek Gods and Goddess', Hamilton provides many adventures of Mythical heroe's and the major offspring's of Zeuss. I reccommend reading MYTHOLOGY if you ever have to do a report on Greece - or just for the enjoyment!!!"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"The author accumulated the legends from authors such as Ovid and Hesiod, and then organized them into her own words. I really enjoyed it since the text was readable and I wasn't subjected to huge amounts of quotations from the original authors. I think I got more out of this book than if I had read the original works. Summarized very nicely."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"As a very quick and superficial introduction, this book may have some benefit, in the same way that the Cliff Notes can be useful, but if you want to get the true flavor of the myths and of the Greek universe, you best go elsewhere. Edith Hamilton reached so widely, while being so hemmed in by the strictures of her day, that she paints the stories only in the broadest of brush strokes, and bowdlerizes them in the process, much as might be expected of a proper British lady scholar writing in the days of top hats and steam locomotives.We may well be doing a disservice to our students by exposing them to this work, bland and devoid of the passion, immediacy and rawness that still resonate from the surviving Greek and Roman texts. If we want to imbue the present generation with love of knowledge, I would recommend instead Robert Fagles' wonderful translations of Homer and Sophocles, Nick Rudall's translation of Euripides' &quot;Trojan Women&quot;, or Calimach's vivid rendition of the male love myths in &quot;Lovers' Legends&quot;. But not Dame Edith."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Everytime someone asks me for a book on greek mythology (which used to be a lot, since I worked in a bookstore), I pointed them directly to this book. This is a must-have for anyone remotely interested in Ancient Greece, although this book is enjoyable even if you aren't.Hamilton hits on all the basics of Greek mythology, including theogony, heroic epics, and (my favorite) the love stories. Most books concerning Greek mythology only deal with certain things, or have less-than desirable synopses. Not to mention it's compiled in a small, cheap paperback (history books aren't cheap anymore, they're almost all published in hardcover and trade paperback).One of my favorite things about this book- if I'm bored, i can just flip to one of my favorite stories. ALthough the book is in a type of chronological order, most of the stories can be read without reading the previous ones (although I highly recommend it, since they're all really good stories).So if you've ever been interested in the historical version of The Trojan War (you aren't going to get it from the movies), if Pygmalion really fell in love with a statue, or all about Zeus' philandering and his wife's clever trickery to catch him in the act, buy this book :)"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"After reading this novel for my Enlgish class, I would like to share my thoughts. For people that are looking for a book to catch them up on Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology, in a quick period of time, this is your book. It gets to the point and just re-tells what the previous writers have. But if you want to take your time and read mythology with passion and time, choose another book. Hamilton just tells it as it is, although if some stories are vivd, it would probably be thanks to Ovid."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Mythology has been one of my areas of interest since college, in 1956. I read this book then. It makes you want to read more on Mythology. After all isn't that what a book is supposed to do.

Was not worth reading."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This book is GREAT, and most excellent in its covering of the Greek and Roman myths, but I found that the information on the Norse myths to be sadly lacking. Overall, the book is good to own, but if you're looking for Norse mythology, buy something else."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This book, mythology by Edith Hamilton is a pretty good book for pleasure and it has pretty good information too. The only downside of this book is that it doesnt keep your intrest that well. After the introduction, most parts are exciting, but there are still a few dull parts.This book goes through many sections of greek mythology and a bit of norse mythology at the end. At first, the book starts out with talking about the gods and goddesses and then it moves onto stories of the gods and demi gods. This is a easy to understand book that is also a lot of fun if you are looking at it from a certain point of view."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I purchased this book for a school assignment, and went into reading it thinking that it would be boring.

Anyone who loves mythology should own this book."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Overall, \\"Mythology\\" is a decent introduction to Greco-Roman mythology, and when I read it in the third grade or so I loved it and it gave me a good base of knowledge. However, this year I had to study it in English class and just about memorize it, and my opinions about it have changed. This book is meant to be read as a textbook, looking things up when one feels it neccesary. That is how I originally read it. By no means should this dry, utilitarian tome be read cover-to-cover. Hamilton's writing style is concise and she gets her point across, but one cannot read more than one story at a time without nearly falling asleep. Reading Hamilton is a far cry from reading Homer or Sophocles. The most positive aspect of the book is its sheer comprehensiveness- Hamilton covers the gods and demigods thoroughly, as well as a large number of mythical tales. If you manage to force yourself through the whole of this book, you will gather from it quite a lot of information.The title might lead you to believe that this book is a comprehensive look at mythology in general, but don't be fooled. In Hamilton's eyes, no culture or mythology is worth a second thought except that of the Greeks and Romans. She accuses all pre-greek religions of glorifying pain and sacrafice, which is not true at all. She says of the religions of the ancient world, \\"Mankind's chief hope of escaping the wrath of whatever divinities were then abroad lay in some magical rite, senseless but powerful, or in some offering made at the cost of pain and grief.\\" She belittles the lore of Egypt and Mesopotamia, calling the Egyptian goddess with the head of a cat \\"a rigid figure...suggesting inflexible, inhuman cruelty.\\" It was the goddess of music! She describes the Greeks themselves, in pre-hellenistic times, as living \\"a savage life, ugly and brutal.\\" She says of Greek mythology, \\"what the myths show is how high they [the greeks] had risen above the ancient filth...\\". Disgusting. How dare she call the mythology of the Egyptians and the Assyrians \\"filth\\"? She does mention Norse mythology in her book, but gives so tiny a glimpse of it that she ought not to have included it at all. She doesn't bother to go into any detail at all about the Norse gods, and ignores almost the entire Volsung saga, telling only the stories of Signy and Sigurd. She tells us nothing of Freja's disturbing obtainment of Brisingamen, the dwarf-wrought necklace, or of the ring of Andvari that brought such misfortune upon its wearers. She does cover the Creation and Ragnarok, though not in much detail.This book should have been entitled \\"Greco-Roman Mythology\\" or \\"The Mythology of the Greeks and Romans\\"."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"A must read if you enjoy Greek mythology. Hamilton presents each character in both their Greek &amp; Roman titles so you can cross-reference from the various mythology books out there. It's an easy read, and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I had started reading this book at a friends house and being an art professor it was just what I was looking for in my class lectures on greek art history."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This was a book for a essay assignment. I had been looking through public libraries and compared to many mythology books and finally chose to buy this electronic version. The display of this book on my kindle is very comfortable and the reading on kindle frees me from carrying a book. Very happy with the purchase."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I would say that this contains all the mythology that is important to know for the lay person. These are the gods that pop up all over the place in a lot of literature. The section on Norse mythology is somewhat lacking. By now most literate people would consider this one a classic."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton observes the difficulty of writing Shakespeare's \\"King Lear\\" on the level of \\"Cinderella,\\" as well as reversing that same endeavor. Her goal was to leave distinctions intact among ancient authors such as Hesiod, Homer, Pindar, Ovid and others; so that the classic myths retain immortality without seeking to flavor the recounting by her own style or attempt to entertain the less initiated reader.In this book are the gods of myth, the Titans, the Olympians, gods of water, underworld, and the earth; with heroes, gods of flora and fauna, lovers, gods of adventure, tales such as the Trojan War, families of the gods, gods of royalty and others less fortunate, as well as including Norse mythology. Interspersed are illustrations, with Greek and Roman emphasis, which add to the author's effort to familiarize any reader with the way men and women felt, believed, and lived according to what influence the ancient stories gave to conduct, architecture, ambitions, and how those stories fueled the competitive spirit.Mythology of this time period affected how ancient civilizations interacted with nature and each other, based upon the trend away from how past beliefs held little distinction between myth and reality. Ignorance became less common than education, instead of the other way around. Ancient Greeks and Romans of this time period enjoyed the imagination of the mythology prevalent in this new era of thought, allowing themselves to revel in the possibilities for personification and animation that began to occur anywhere, anytime, about anything. In this freedom, what today we consider strange, to those being introduced to Roman and Greek mythology as is found in this book, their world was full of beauty and awe. Reason took the place of terror, mystery, and magic; and although at times life still had brutality and savagery, the ancient people heard and read the traditions passed down as mythology shared conquest and intellect, artistic ability, and political order. No longer was this exclusively the privilege of royalty, priests, and wizards or sorceresses.The literature of these ancient poets and story tellers helped to position mankind's importance in the universe, as astronomy, science, medicine, and interaction took place on frontiers previously left to the gods.Unlike Egyptian gods with features of animals, Roman and Greek gods took human form entirely and except for size and power were easily identifiable as beings similar to our own in appearance and form instead of resemblance to cats, birds, or mixtures of varieties of animal form in combination. Fantasy shifted into rational thought even for gods and goddesses, which gave levity to reverence; and deities were thought of as companions so fear would yield to adoration with the arena of respect; bringing harmony and balance in how those Greeks and Romans worshipped.The incomprehensiveness of unknown omnipotence was softened and fantastic or irrational fear began to ease into a sense of understanding. Mythology as shared in this book told of youth, beauty, and delight as mankind let go of superstition, magic, and dread. Priests and necromancers began being replaced by heroes and less immortal men and women; which in turn began to fade away the former attitudes of the need for human sacrifice to appease the gods.Religion would never be the same. Justice and philosophy shifted in ways that would change mankind's existence and pave the way for how much finally changed when Jesus Christ ushered in the modern concepts we hold today that would change life on this planet in ways the Greeks and Romans only began to imagine possible."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This book is an expansive introduction to the most important Greek myths. For the reader needing a re-fresher or hoping to familiarize himself/herself with somehow still culturally relevant ancient Greek mythology, this book is prefect. Presented in an entertaining manner, going into just enough detail to maintain interest, and covering just enough material so it is remembered, this book makes for great light reading."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This text got me through high school and college courses in mythology. The stories are detailed enough that you get what you need without information overload. I highly recommend this to everyone interested in Greek mythology, you won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes is a very basic, very popular and very good text for the introduction of Greek and Roman mythology. In our Western culture, the term 'mythology' is most often equated with these tales, and this book, first written before World War II, has helped to reinforce that equation with the current generations of readers.Those looking for the mythological stories of other cultures will be disappointed -- with the exception of a brief section on Norse mythology at the end (about five percent of the entire volume), it covers nothing outside the Greek and Roman pantheons. Of course, part of the difficulty of approaching mythology of other cultures is that, in many instances, it is not mythology to them; or, in the case of mythology, one needs a firmer grounding in the culture and religious aspects of that culture before the mythology becomes accessible.Hamilton (raised, as I was astonished to discover, in Indiana, where I currently reside) studied at Bryn Mawr, and had a distinguished teacher career in addition to writing this useful text. Hamilton's writing is not complicated and very easy to follow -- this has made this text one used in high school and undergraduate courses in Greek and Roman mythology more frequently perhaps than any other text produced in this century.Hamilton begins the text with an essay giving an overview of what mythology is, and what the purpose of it was.'Through it,' she wrote, 'we can retrace the path from civilised man who lives so far from nature, to man who lived in close companionship with nature; and the real interest of the myths is that they lead us back to a time when the world was young and people had a connection with the earth, with trees and seas and flowers and hills, unlike anything we ourselves can feel.'She proceeds with a brief history of the development of Greek mythology, the origins of the stories lost in the mists of time. She tells of the influences of Greek thought on subsequent developments in thought and religion: 'Saint Paul said the invisible must be understood by the visible. That was not a Hebrew idea, it was Greek.' Unlike most religious constructs, the Greek mythological world tried to make sense of the greater life of the universe in terms that were very human indeed, with a minimum of mystery. 'The terrifying irrational has no place in classical mythology.'This is not to say, of course, that there were not terrible stories and fantastic creatures -- indeed, the mythological stories are full of them -- Gorgons and hydras and chimaeras dire. But these are mostly metaphorical (and were understood as such), and primarily used for a hero to be made (this same idea has pervaded to the most recent Mission Impossible movie).Hamilton proceeds after this essay to describe the members of the pantheon, the major and minor gods and goddesses, the ideas of creation, the heroes (human, semi-divine and divine), stories of love and devotion, justice and injustice, and, of course, of warfare, victory, defeat, and courage. Those heroes before the Trojan War, perhaps the Greek-mythological-equivalent of a world war, had battles and dire circumstances to fight and overcome. The Trojan War figured largely in the mythological frameworks of Greece and Rome -- all the gods and goddess were involved in this conflict, it seemed, as were many of the heroes of Greek mythology.Hamilton, writing in a fairly conservative period of time, and in a fairly conservative culture, sanitised the mythological stories to a large extent. The Greeks were a very human and often rather bawdy bunch; the Romans were even moreso. Much of the sexuality in the mythological stories is omitted, save to demonstrate the less-desirable aspects. Quite often, undergraduates who study mythology are astonished to discover, if they had used Hamilton's text in an earlier high school setting, that there is a lot more sex and violence in the 'real' stories than they had been previously exposed to.Of course, one of the primary aspects of the mythological tales was not to explain the cosmos or to build complex theological constructs (reason did these, often with help from the myths, but not using the myths as the basis), but rather the illustration of moral truths -- those of honesty, virtue, and courage as primarily valued in Greek and Roman society. Evil befalls those who do not lead a moral life; rewards come to those who do. Of course, there is a bit of whimsy in the cosmos -- bad things happen to good people, etc., even in ancient Greece. The fluctuating personalities of the gods (and the number of them) ultimately gives a satisfying explanation (if not a satisfying reason) why such things might occur.Hamilton's book is a good one to use in teaching, but it must not be considered the final authority on any of the topics it addresses. Nonetheless, it has earned its place in the pantheon of influential books, and will most likely continue to be so for some time to come."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Mythology is classicist Edith Hamilton's book on Greek, Roman and Norse mythology, illustrated by Steele Savage (no kidding). The bulk of the work is devoted to the Greek, and the Norse is mentioned only in passing. Myths are arranged thematically, not chronologically (except for the initial creation), which is disruptive to the flow of the work.Hamilton does several things well. First, she gives history on the authors from whom these stories have descended, and differentiates between their styles. Second, she gives good insight into the character of the people of the time as well as into the character of the mythological figures. She obviously knows the material and cares about it.Mythology reads like a history book. Many stories get wrapped up too quickly, and quite a few are told too simplistically. Many details are left out. The writing is juvenile at times, and paragraph flow is occasionally an issue. This is almost a Cliff's Notes on mythology. Ultimately, Hamilton makes most of these myths boring. Others, with too many details cut out, the reader will find hard to get into.Mythology has some good things to offer, but on the whole, this is an inferior way to enjoy the myths. This book may be useful to some as a quick-reference guide, but that's about it.TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"A very meaningful and enjoyable book. I had to read this book twice to increase my memory on all the gods, heroes, gods, monsters and mortals related to one another and stories that intertwine with one another. This really opens you up to the later play writers and the birth of the ideas that later came about in the rational thinking of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. I couldn't help partiality to the story or character is of Thesus and the city of Athens, the birth of equal justice and government of the people; democracy, which is far removed from the so-called pseudo forms of today.What is really beneficial about this book is that Hamilton takes the well known writers from the different centuries, those who repeat, elaborate, embellish and abridge the same and relational stories and then puts each story down in its full summarized form. In this she takes her information from the famous Roman writers Ovid and Virgil, from the Greek poet, Homer, from the poor farmer in favor of justice and questioner of nature, Hesiod, the lyric poet, Pindar, the tragic poets, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aeschylus, the comic poet Aristophanes, the Alexandrian poets; Apollonius of Rhodes and others, the pastoral poets Theocritus, Bion and Moschus, the Latin poet, Apuleius and the Greek poets, Lucian, Apollodorus and Pausanias. Some of these poets took their stories seriously, while others were not, such as Ovid, who was excellent at details, appreciative and thorough, yet he considered much to be nonsense, his work simply art form.It was in the fifth century where much of the Greek mythology was being replaced by rational thinking as in Euripides story of Creusa where he says to his audience, \\"Look at your Apollo, the sun-bright Lord of the Lyre, the pure God of Truth. This is what he did. he brutally forced a helpless young girl and then abandoned her.\\" the end of Greek mythology was at hand where such plays drew full houses in Athens. The same can be said for the Judeo God Yahweh who suffered and starved his own peoples that dared disobey and slayed his enemies with no compassion, taking the virgin women, livestock and valuables as spoil.Some of the books stories do lack details. For instance, in the story of Odysseus, who revenges with murder of the gallant men that abused his estates assets in their desire to marry his widow. Here Hamilton does not mention the murdering punishment of hanging applied to the abusive maidens that were in his household that can be found in the Odyssey. Also, in Hamilton's book, as in the move TROY, she describes the death of Patroclos as a surprise, his armour removed at death revealing his true identity. Yet the Iliad does not support this. On page 200 it states that only at first did the Trojans believe this, then soon realizing though Patroclos own words and actions that it was him and not Achilles fighting. For instance, Apollo disguised as Hector's young uncle, Asios, speaks to Hector saying, \\"Hurry, make for Patroclos, and you may get him, Apollo may give you victory!\\" So much for fine details, this is an excellent book.The last portion of the book has a short amount on Norse mythology, which is very beneficial in comparing to the previous Greek and Roman thought and you can see the influence on Wagner and others. The Norse courage in a doomed existence of heroic bravery is very different from the Greek, highly comtemplative in analysis."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I was looking for a book that detailed all of the stories of Greek Mythology. This book attempts to but gets lost with too much jumping around from one story to another and between Greek and Roman Mythology. I felt that this book was difficult to follow and didn't really keep you interested enough to try."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Regardless of challenges to accuracy, consistency, etc., this book is a classic and provides helpful background for high school. It is an easy and interesting read that also sets the stage for further exploration. It also has an interesting psychological take, claiming that the Greeks created deities with very human attitudes, ambitions, self-contradictions, and faults. A nifty handbook, Mythology is also a great resource for when your little brother wants ideas for what to name his comic book characters."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This book is hot, it kicks, it rocks, it rules. Can't say it enough; this is phenomenal storytelling, this is pure unsullied love for classic myth, this is beautiful. You cannot find a more complete source than this. All the stories are there, all the details, every little insignificant character. You want animated tale-spinning, you have it here. All the passion and the morals and the humour and the fire and the history and the charm and the beauty and the mystery...collected into this single volume. It's a crime not to read it."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's \\"Mythology\\" is the most concise and readable compendium of its subject that I have ever happened upon (it's part of my required summer reading for AP English). While it's not a thriller, and the first few sections take some real endurance to get through, the reader is rewarded in the end. I recognize that the book is not meant to be exciting reading - it's a scholarly work - but some of the sections whose myths are only a page long are irritating to read. It was hard to stay focused when the characters changed so frequently. However, I sincerely enjoyed the myths of the great heroes, the Trojan War, the Aeneid, and the Orestia (which have a great deal more substance than the rest). \\"Mythology\\" has also piqued my interest in other classical works, which I hope to pursue on my own or in college - to date I have only read \\"Oedipus Rex\\" and \\"Antigone\\" by Sophocles. \\"Mythology\\" is probably the reader's best investment of time and effort with the greatest return in knowledge."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Nice overview for someone new to Greek mythology. It covers the major figures and stories, but for anyone who has studied mythology, it is overly simplistic. The stories have been \\"sanitized,\\" possibly for a younger audience. For example, Aphrodite is said to have sprung from the foam, but Hamilton chooses to omit the Uranus story explaining why she came out of the foam in the first place. Those with a serious interest in Greek mythology should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's &quot;Mythology&quot; tell the &quot;Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes&quot; of classical mythology and this volume, first written in 1942, is now a timeless classic itself. This was the first book of mythology that I ever read and it is still the best. When Hamilton retells the love story of Cupid and Psyche or the tragedy of Agamemnon and his children, she does so with a full sense of what it meant when first told by Apuleius or Aeschylus. These are not children's tales, but the heroic legends and religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Furthermore, the illustrations by Steele Savage have the elegance of wood block prints, which, for all I know, is exactly what they are. I appreciate Hamilton's choice to avoid relying on Ovid, for while the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the most comprehensive ancient text dealing with the classical myths, Ovid is an unbeliever. For Hamilton the writings of Homer, Hesiod and Pindar are more abbreviated in terms of providing details for the myths, but at least they take the tales seriously.Another strength of the book is how she organizes the myths in her seven parts: (1) Covers the complete pantheon of deities, including the lesser gods of Olympus and Earth and the later Roman additions, as well as the earliest heroes. (2) Retells the various tales of love, between mortals and the gods or each other, along with the Quest for the Golden Fleece and other early heroic adventures. (3) Focuses specifically on the greatest heroes, Perseus, Theseus and Hercules, with Atalanta thrown in the mix in a curious but understandable editorial decision by Hamilton. (4) Puts together Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid into a giant epic stretching from the Judgment of Paris to the founding of Roman, with the Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides. (5) Tells about the great mythological families, namely the House of Atreus (Agamemnon), the Royal House of Thebes (Oedipus and Antigone), and the Royal House of Athens. (6) Covers all of the lesser myths, most notably Midas. (7) Goes off in a new direction, providing a very brief introduction to Norse mythology that seems woefully inadequate given the comprehensive compilation of classical mythology that precedes it.If you want analysis of these myths, then you certainly want to look elsewhere. But if you want a solid retelling of the key stories of classical mythology, then Edith Hamilton's volume is still at the top of the list for my money. I fully admit that I am biased because I read this during my formative years and her language and rhythms are engrained in my brain, just like the illustrations by Savage."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"My English teacher insists that the youth of America is losing culture. So, it is her tradition to assign this fairly large book for reading, so that we are all somewhat versed in the basics of Greek mythology and can recognize the various allusions to it in literature.What I thought would be a torturous experience turned out to be a rather enjoyable one. I found most of the stories to be well-told and extremely interesting. Edith Hamilton makes sure to leave no detail untold in her accounts of the various lives and actions of the ancient Greek gods and goddesses.It is over a year later, and I still use this book as a reference for any sort of literary allusion or reference to Greek mythology. So for those considering this book for pure reference purposes, the book contains a massive index to help you find just about any and every character in Greek mythology.While I agree with some reviewers that the end section on Norse mythology is out of place, it wasn't necessarily poorly written as some claim.Overall, an excellent purchase for anyone who reads literature, or is just interested in the ancient Greek myths."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I would have to say that this is a pretty good mixture of mythology.

No one told myths as well as the Greeks and Romans did and no one told Greek and Roman myths as well as Edith Hamilton did. If you don't buy into these stories, they still serve well as good literature. The book has all the main myths. In here you will find the story of the creation of the world and mankind, you will find details on each god and goddess and a list of the twelve Olympians. The stories included are famous such as the the Trojan War, the Odyssey, the Quest of the Golden Fleece (for fans of Ray Harryhausen's \\"Jason and the Argonauts)and other tales to delight the mind. The book is just long enough to give all of the main stories but not so long that it will bore the reader."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's Mythology covers a wide variety of myths in a harsh, forced style. While the plotlines are well told, I found that the stories see to go a bit cold when retold under Ms. Hamilton's hand.

However, this book will see you though a mythology course exceedingly well, even though it is not a book I recommend for a leisurely read."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This is not what I remembered as the mythology: the rich and fascinating stories I had read when I was a child.This book is a very dry, summary of the mythology.

The teacher formed a Latin Club which was part of the Ohio Junior Classical League, and all Latin students were invited to attend the annual Ohio JCL Convention in Columbus, OH, each year. Several contests were always provided, and one year I was on our quiz bowl team. The subject that year was Roman mythology. The Romans, of course, basically borrowed their myths from the Greeks, giving them Latin instead of Greek names. My teacher either gave me a copy of Edith Hamilton's Mythology or suggested that I purchase one for myself in preparation for the quiz bowl contest.The Greek-Roman myths draw from several widely different sources, including legends passed on by word of mouth from one generation to the next and literary dramas written by ancient playwrights. Edith Hamilton, a world-renowned classicist who was born in Germany, grew up in Ft. Wayne, IN, and graduated from Bryn Mawr, sought to provide some continuity to the stories. This book tells about the origins of the gods, the Graeco-Roman creation account, the earliest heroes, and many of the familiar stories like Cupid and Psyche, the Golden Fleece, Hercules, the Trojan War, the adventures of Odysseus and Aeneas, Midas, and other brief myths. There is also a short section at the end on Norse mythology. In addition, Hamilton authored two seminal works on ancient cultures, The Greek Way in 1930, and The Roman Way in 1932.As I have said before, homeschoolers are divided over studying the ancient Greek and Roman myths. Some feel that doing so somehow gives honor to pagan deities. Others believe that one can study the myths solely from a historical standpoint without giving any credence to their gods and, in fact, by so doing can find a clear distinction between idols and the one true God. My own view tends toward the latter. Even before I took Latin, I had always been interested in ancient mythology and read quite a few books or encyclopedia articles on the subject. Yet, I did not become a pagan. However, be forewarned. The Greek and Roman myths do contain a lot of immorality, as the ancients were well-equipped in making their gods in their own fallible image. With that understanding, those who wish to learn more about the Greek and Roman gods and heroes will find an excellent source of reading and study in Edith Hamilton's Mythology."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Mythology is classicist Edith Hamilton's book on Greek, Roman and Norse mythology, illustrated by Steele Savage (no kidding). The bulk of the work is devoted to the Greek, and the Norse is mentioned only in passing. Myths are arranged thematically, not chronologically (except for the initial creation), which is disruptive to the flow of the work.Hamilton does several things well. First, she gives history on the authors from whom these stories have descended, and differentiates between their styles. Second, she gives good insight into the character of the people of the time as well as into the character of the mythological figures. She obviously knows the material and cares about it.Mythology reads like a history book. Many stories get wrapped up too quickly, and quite a few are told too simplistically. Many details are left out. The writing is juvenile at times, and paragraph flow is occasionally an issue. This is almost a Cliff's Notes on mythology. Ultimately, Hamilton makes most of these myths boring. Others, with too many details cut out, the reader will find hard to get into.Mythology has some good things to offer, but on the whole, this is an inferior way to enjoy the myths. This book may be useful to some as a quick-reference guide, but that's about it.TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Hamilton's Mythology is frequently one of the first books on mythology that any young person encounters; in my case, I encountered it as a sophomore in high school in 1966. More than forty years later, I still find it fresh, informative, and entertaining.Edith Hamilton assembles her accounts from many different sources, sometimes choosing one, sometimes combining several, and always giving her reasons for her choices. The introductions listing the sources therefore serve as suggested reading for the student who wants more detail. Her prose is lively and, at times, wryly humorous.This isn't a book of intense, detailed scholarship, but it is an excellent introduction to the myths of the ancient Greeks and Romans and also a book to which the serious scholar of mythology can return time and time again for pleasure and perhaps even a fact or two that had escaped notice previously."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Ms. Hamilton is a world-renowned classicist who was born in Dresden, Germany. She put this book together hoping the reader would be able to distinguish between the different writers of Greek Mythology while gaining knowledge of these classic myths.Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes is organized into seven parts beginning with an introduction to Greek Mythology and to the Greek and Roman writers. This follows with The Gods, the Creation and the Earliest Heroes--Stories of Love and Adventure--The Great Heroes Before the Trojan War--The Heroes of the Trojan War--The Great Families of Mythology--The Less Important Myths and the Mythology of the Norsemen. Before each story, Ms. Hamilton adds an explanation of why she chose that particular version by that writer.What I like most about this book is that it is organized so that it is easy to read and understand. This is a great introduction to the Greek Myths and written in a style that makes it entertaining and not a chore to read. The only downside might be that this may not be the right book for those who want a more in-depth study of Greek Mythology, but for me it was an excellent introduction. I am giving it a high score because I feel it accomplishes what it was meant to do--introduce the Greek Myths to people who may not be familiar with them. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I came to love this book as a child, and I continue to enjoy it and benefit from it as a twentysomething adult. Understanding the root Greek and Roman stories can lead to a much fuller and richer understanding of Western culture, including literature, movies, art - even comic books and cartoons.This a great collection of stories (with wonderful illustrations) for students and others interested in getting a sense of various myths and stories - large one like the search for the Golden Fleece, the Trojan War, the wanderings of Ulysses, the labors of Hercules, and smaller ones like King Midas, Orpheus, etc. This book recounts the stories, but it doesn't seek to interpret them. You'll have to dig deeper for that, and Hamilton helps you on your way by providing her sources.If you enjoy this book, you may want to read the originals, such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Argonautika; the works of the Greek playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; and other works like Ovid's Metamorphoses and some the Norse and northern European epics and sagas - Beowulf, the Prose Edda, etc.This isn't a definitive reference or mythological encyclopedia; it's a starting place for a really wonderful trip. I encourage you to give it a try - and to give it as a gift to young people in your life."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Marvelous! This is, quite simply, the best book on ancient mythology available today. It has everything you could ask for; It's readable, erudite scholars tome this is not; it's comprehensive, covering every major myth you'll find allusions too in modern literature; it's not analytical, it presents the stories as they should be, beautiful in their simplicity, not awash in modern symbolism; and, most important of all, the book sparks an passion for mythology. After reading this book, instead of feeling like you know all there is to know about the ancients religion, you'll want to actually read Hamilton's original sources. It actually makes you want to read Hesiod, Homer, Herodotus, Euridpides, Sophocles, Virgil, and all the others in the great classical cannon. Truly, I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Ms. Hamilton's book, rightly considered a classic in its own right, is a quick, minimal no-nonsense retelling of Greek and Roman myths. I was surprised to see a small section at the end on Norse mythology; I thought it was entirely too brief to do the subject justice.Ms. Hamilton's greatest contribution in this work is her grouping of the myths in more-or-less logical sections -- for example, &quot;The Gods, the Creation and the Earliest Heroes,&quot; &quot;Stories of Love and Adventure,&quot; &quot;The Great Heroes of the Trojan War,&quot; and so on. She attempts to provide a framework for the myths to enable the reader to understand them in the context they were understood during their own time, and she does this very well.Another benefit Ms. Hamilton attempts to provide her readers is a clipping service of sorts, pulling her stories from a multitude of sources. While I found the constant switching between Greek and Roman names annoying, Ms. Hamilton remained true to her methodology of identifying the gods, goddesses and heroes based on the majority author from which she drew for a particular tale. I could have done without her editorializing on the readability of the authors from whom she drew, but that is a minor quibble.This book is most useful for someone for whom many years has passed since he or she has read their Greek and Roman mythology. It might also serve as an adequate primer for someone about to undertake a first reading of the subject as well. By itself, however, it loses much of the romance and excitement the fully developed stories themselves impart in the hands of a skilled storyteller. I was fortunate in that, even though I read most of my mythology before the age of ten, I had a wonderful resource at my disposal -- a 1930 edition of the Grolier Society's The Book of Knowledge, a twenty volume encyclopedia that undertook to impart a broad range of knowledge to its readers in an accessible and enjoyable manner. Having not read mythology since that time, Hamilton's brief retelling of the tales brought back many of them and the context she provided even enhanced my appreciation for some and cleared up misconceptions about others.One complaint, admittedly minute in importance: I found three typographical errors in the edition I read (Warner Books, 1999). While these in no way detracted from the work, it is nonetheless surprising to find such errors in a work that's been in print for sixty years."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"There simply is no better source of the classical mythos. Ms. Hamilton writes like no other, and infuses her subject with passion and love, and makes the immoratals live as passionately and as vividly as they did in the days of Homer and the other Greek greats. Sometimes criticized as juvenile and simplistic, Ms. Hamilton's work has withstood the &quot;whips and arrows&quot; of time and endures as the work on the myths and legends of antiquity, and as the scholarly approach to the subject. To read Ms. Hamilton's work is to go back thousands of years, and see the world as a place of wonder, a place where man created his gods in his own image. This is a book destined to become a family favorite! One merely hopes that since her death, Ms. Hamilton enjoys the ambrosia of Olympus, whose realms she brought so vividly to life. Buy the hardcover, for once read to the family, it's sure to become a favorite!"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I first read this book as a child and it was the first book I ever wore out. It relates all the key Graeco-Roman myths, with Norse myths treated perfunctorily at the end. Hamilton learned Greek and Latin as a little girl and wrote her books late in life; they read like the works of someone who spent a lifetime reading the classics for personal pleasure. Readers using this book as an introductory guide should be aware of Hamilton's prejudices: she prefers the Greeks to the Romans, and writers who believed in the stories to those who did not. As a result, you might be wrongly discouraged from classical authors such as Ovid (whom Hamilton seems to actively despise), even though Ovid's worldview is strikingly similar to our modern one and his writing vivid and enjoyable. But if you approach this book as an opinionated presentation by a genuine enthusiast, as opposed to an effort at scholarly objectivity, you will not likely regret being caught up in the passion the author brought to this material."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I recommend this book to everyone that has the slightest interest in Greek and Roman mythology. It is extremely informative and tells about the stories and legends of ancient times in great detail and in a way that is incredibly easy to follow along with. I personally like the story of Cupid and Psyche the best over all but every story in the book was captivating and informative. I could hardly put down the book and carried it everywhere I went. I would suggest buying the hard cover copy because I found that since the book was so good, it was opened and closed a lot and the front cover became frayed very quickly."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I am a student of English, and a favorite subject of mine is Classical Mythology. I find myself going back to this book time and again for most of my research needs on the subject. I was first introduced to mythology through this book. The clear descriptions sparked an intrest.

If you are a student doing research or a person who just wants to find out about Mythology, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Here is an inexpenive paperback that will give you a wonderful intro to the Greek Myths...the stories are weel presented and Hamilton tries to preserve the flavor of each individual Greek source...thus some stories here are more detailed, even gory; others read more like fairy tales...the author does have a strong bias towards using Roman sources which she finds overblown; thus she always steers the reader in the direction of the aesthetic simplicity of original Greek sources...I believe Bulfinch is a good alternate read if you want some of the Roman versions...but for the majority of us who don't have time to gather all the original but want to broaden our knowledge on Greek mythology, I can think of no better volume than this one...it is also an enjoyable read in of it's own"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's Mythology provides a large survey of almost every myth imaginable, but this is also where the text is lacking. Many of the tales are so abbreviated that they tend to read more like reference pieces than actual stories. As a high school English teacher, I found that my students found Hamilton's book challenging. They often did not understand the myth due to the lack of detail (the abbreviation) or due to the diction she chose in order to express the myth. Hamilton's Mythology is an excellent source and I will continue to use it, but if you're looking for a relatively easy read of Greek myths in story form, I would recommend Bernard Evslin's Heroes, Gods and Monsters of the Greek Myths. My students had no problem with this novel and I found it an extremely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Perhaps spirit is the wrong word. It is obvious by the late Miss Hamilton's writing that she harbors quite an affinity for the Grco-Roman/Norse myths and cultures. However knowledgeable and talented she is at non-fiction and discussion, the actual tellings of the myths emerge as dull and tedious. If the prospective reader is looking for a thorough and well-crafted reference guide with brief recounts of the myths with little poetry or other flairs for the dramatic, this book is a fine choice. On the other hand, if one wants a reference guide that is entertaining as well, they will be more satisfied with &quot;Bulfinch's Mythology&quot; as long as it has an index and glossary. If the reader desires not reference but pure entertainment value, and does not wish to read translated Homer, Virgil, Ovid, etc., I suggest &quot;Gods, Heroes, and Men of Ancient Greece,&quot; by W.H.D. Rouse. The book is written as a storyteller would deliver the myths."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I've done quite a bit of reading about greek (and roman) mythology and I still enjoyed this book. They way the myths are writen is so good that I could almost feel myself back in ancient Greece, observing the scenes. I also enjoyed the quotes from the original source where the myth was told (e.g. The Odyssey, The Illiad, etc). Overall this is a good basic classical mythology book. Even people who already know these myths should read this book if only for the delightful manner in which they are told. For someone who cannot match a roman god to his greek conterpart this might require flipping back to the first chapter. If you pay attention the first time you read it you shouldn't have any trouble with this.Near the end of the book there are a couple norse myths. That's it.

I know i was..."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"As a long-time student of mythology, I was generally disappointed with this book. It hardly appreciates the richness of Greek mythology; Hamilton rather plods through the stories in Greek mythology (the book ought to be called &quot;Greek and Roman Mythology,&quot; as it is mostly stories from ancient Greek culture, and its imitators, the Romans), except for that last chapter on Norse mythology. The only useful parts are the introductory chapters, which provide a nice overview of the themes of Greco-Roman mythology, how it came about, brief bios of major writers, etc, and the genealogical tables at the back of the book. For a better introduction to mythology, and a book that encompasses more than Greco-Roman mythology, read Michael Macrone's &quot;Brush Up Your Mythology.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's very popular 'Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes' is a very basic, very popular and very good text for the introduction of Greek and Roman mythology. This book by Hamilton, simply entitled 'Mythology' is an expansion of the material in the shorter book. Largely, however, it is a repetition of the same material.In our Western culture, the term 'mythology' is most often equated with these tales, and Hamilton, first writing before World War II, has helped to reinforce that equation with the current generations of readers.Those looking for the mythological stories of other cultures will be disappointed -- with the exception of a brief section on Norse mythology at the end (about five percent of the entire volume), it covers nothing outside the Greek and Roman pantheons. Of course, part of the difficulty of approaching mythology of other cultures is that, in many instances, it is not mythology to them; or, in the case of mythology, one needs a firmer grounding in the culture and religious aspects of that culture before the mythology becomes accessible.Hamilton (raised, as I was astonished to discover, in Indiana, where I currently reside) studied at Bryn Mawr, and had a distinguished teacher career in addition to writing this useful text. Hamilton's writing is not complicated and very easy to follow -- this has made her texts selected often for high school and undergraduate courses in Greek and Roman mythology, more frequently perhaps than any other text produced in this century.Hamilton begins the text with an essay giving an overview of what mythology is, and what the purpose of it was.'Through it,' she wrote, 'we can retrace the path from civilised man who lives so far from nature, to man who lived in close companionship with nature; and the real interest of the myths is that they lead us back to a time when the world was young and people had a connection with the earth, with trees and seas and flowers and hills, unlike anything we ourselves can feel.'She proceeds with a brief history of the development of Greek mythology, the origins of the stories lost in the mists of time. She tells of the influences of Greek thought on subsequent developments in thought and religion: 'Saint Paul said the invisible must be understood by the visible. That was not a Hebrew idea, it was Greek.' Unlike most religious constructs, the Greek mythological world tried to make sense of the greater life of the universe in terms that were very human indeed, with a minimum of mystery. 'The terrifying irrational has no place in classical mythology.'This is not to say, of course, that there were not terrible stories and fantastic creatures -- indeed, the mythological stories are full of them -- Gorgons and hydras and chimaeras dire. But these are mostly metaphorical (and were understood as such), and primarily used for a hero to be made (this same idea has pervaded to the most recent Mission Impossible movie).Hamilton proceeds after this essay to describe the members of the pantheon, the major and minor gods and goddesses, the ideas of creation, the heroes (human, semi-divine and divine), stories of love and devotion, justice and injustice, and, of course, of warfare, victory, defeat, and courage. Those heroes before the Trojan War, perhaps the Greek-mythological-equivalent of a world war, had battles and dire circumstances to fight and overcome. The Trojan War figured largely in the mythological frameworks of Greece and Rome -- all the gods and goddess were involved in this conflict, it seemed, as were many of the heroes of Greek mythology.Hamilton, writing in a fairly conservative period of time, and in a fairly conservative culture, sanitised the mythological stories to a large extent. The Greeks were a very human and often rather bawdy bunch; the Romans were even moreso. Much of the sexuality in the mythological stories is omitted, save to demonstrate the less-desirable aspects. Quite often, undergraduates who study mythology are astonished to discover, if they had used Hamilton's text in an earlier high school setting, that there is a lot more sex and violence in the 'real' stories than they had been previously exposed to.Of course, one of the primary aspects of the mythological tales was not to explain the cosmos or to build complex theological constructs (reason did these, often with help from the myths, but not using the myths as the basis), but rather the illustration of moral truths -- those of honesty, virtue, and courage as primarily valued in Greek and Roman society. Evil befalls those who do not lead a moral life; rewards come to those who do. Of course, there is a bit of whimsy in the cosmos -- bad things happen to good people, etc., even in ancient Greece. The fluctuating personalities of the gods (and the number of them) ultimately gives a satisfying explanation (if not a satisfying reason) why such things might occur."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This extremely handy reference book is ideal for browsing, or for using as a tool to assist in your academic readings. Hamilton goes through all of the great Greek mythological figures and tales, and explains them, using an unusual, but very entertaining, mixture of prose and excerpts. The book is masterful because a complete layman can start reading it, and yet get a flavor for the actual original texts. At the same time, someone who's reading a more involved text can turn to the appropriate section in the book to get a clear grasp of any particular story quickly, and to figure out who an individual is. My 1953 edition has some very nice illustrations by Steele Savage that capture the flavor of ancient greek carvings, but with a simplicity and flair that can be found in the best comic books. There's no wonder that this book has survived for so long in a field that has as many authors as students; for it's purpose, it is simply too good to be improved upon."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"\\"Mythology\\" covers all the major and most minor Greek, Norse and Roman gods, goddesses, stories and locales. Edith Hamilton makes no pretenses that this is all there is to say on mythology, but she gives a reader a fine start.Hamilton puts them into sensible structures so beginners can learn in a context which are easy to understand. She provides major section titles helping readers get straight to the required story, like \\"Stories of Love and Adventure\\" You'll find \\"Cupid and Psyche\\" as a chapter.Chapters are named mostly by story like, \\"The Trojan War.\\"She quotes from the sources, so the reader knows how it is she got her information.Character-driven in format, readers can look up a name, find the subtitle with that name, and read why that character matters. She writes narratively, sounding a little like \\"Cliff's Notes.\\" This is a good thing, because the poetry from which these myths are drawn can be overwhelming.Nicely organized is the geneological table section. It looks like a family tree, in a English royalty kind of way.As a writer, I use it for a quick reference guide. I usually only need a few nuggets of information, and she gives me plenty. I first acquired it high school, using it to get out of those tough jams when I did not understand books like \\"The Odyssey,\\" by Homer.More than mere reference, \\"Mythology\\" is good reading for no other purpose than serendipitous curiosity.I fully recommend it.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's &quot;Mythology&quot; tell the &quot;Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes&quot; of classical mythology and this volume, first written in 1942, is now a timeless classic itself. This was the first book of mythology that I ever read and it is still the best. When Hamilton retells the love story of Cupid and Psyche or the tragedy of Agamemnon and his children, she does so with a full sense of what it meant when first told by Apuleius or Aeschylus. These are not children's tales, but the heroic legends and religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Furthermore, the illustrations by Steele Savage have the elegance of wood block prints, which, for all I know, is exactly what they are. I appreciate Hamilton's choice to avoid relying on Ovid, for while the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the most comprehensive ancient text dealing with the classical myths, Ovid is an unbeliever. For Hamilton the writings of Homer, Hesiod and Pindar are more abbreviated in terms of providing details for the myths, but at least they take the tales seriously.Another strength of the book is how she organizes the myths in her seven parts: (1) Covers the complete pantheon of deities, including the lesser gods of Olympus and Earth and the later Roman additions, as well as the earliest heroes. (2) Retells the various tales of love, between mortals and the gods or each other, along with the Quest for the Golden Fleece and other early heroic adventures. (3) Focuses specifically on the greatest heroes, Perseus, Theseus and Hercules, with Atalanta thrown in the mix in a curious but understandable editorial decision by Hamilton. (4) Puts together Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid into a giant epic stretching from the Judgment of Paris to the founding of Roman, with the Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides. (5) Tells about the great mythological families, namely the House of Atreus (Agamemnon), the Royal House of Thebes (Oedipus and Antigone), and the Royal House of Athens. (6) Covers all of the lesser myths, most notably Midas. (7) Goes off in a new direction, providing a very brief introduction to Norse mythology that seems woefully inadequate given the comprehensive compilation of classical mythology that precedes it.I looked over other possibilities as a basic textbook for my Classical Greek &amp; Roman Mythology course (I know, it sounds redundant and repetitive to me too), but I selected this one as my basic text. If you want analysis of these myths, then you certainly want to look elsewhere. But if you want a solid retelling of virtually every tale of classical mythology, then Edith Hamilton's volume is still at the top of the list as far as I concerned."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Edith Hamilton's Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes is a very basic, very popular and very good text for the introduction of Greek and Roman mythology. In our Western culture, the term 'mythology' is most often equated with these tales, and this book, first written before World War II, has helped to reinforce that equation with the current generations of readers.Those looking for the mythological stories of other cultures will be disappointed -- with the exception of a brief section on Norse mythology at the end (about five percent of the entire volume), it covers nothing outside the Greek and Roman pantheons. Of course, part of the difficulty of approaching mythology of other cultures is that, in many instances, it is not mythology to them; or, in the case of mythology, one needs a firmer grounding in the culture and religious aspects of that culture before the mythology becomes accessible.Hamilton (raised, as I was astonished to discover, in Indiana, where I currently reside) studied at Bryn Mawr, and had a distinguished teacher career in addition to writing this useful text. Hamilton's writing is not complicated and very easy to follow -- this has made this text one used in high school and undergraduate courses in Greek and Roman mythology more frequently perhaps than any other text produced in this century.Hamilton begins the text with an essay giving an overview of what mythology is, and what the purpose of it was.'Through it,' she wrote, 'we can retrace the path from civilised man who lives so far from nature, to man who lived in close companionship with nature; and the real interest of the myths is that they lead us back to a time when the world was young and people had a connection with the earth, with trees and seas and flowers and hills, unlike anything we ourselves can feel.'She proceeds with a brief history of the development of Greek mythology, the origins of the stories lost in the mists of time. She tells of the influences of Greek thought on subsequent developments in thought and religion: 'Saint Paul said the invisible must be understood by the visible. That was not a Hebrew idea, it was Greek.' Unlike most religious constructs, the Greek mythological world tried to make sense of the greater life of the universe in terms that were very human indeed, with a minimum of mystery. 'The terrifying irrational has no place in classical mythology.'This is not to say, of course, that there were not terrible stories and fantastic creatures -- indeed, the mythological stories are full of them -- Gorgons and hydras and chimaeras dire. But these are mostly metaphorical (and were understood as such), and primarily used for a hero to be made (this same idea has pervaded to the most recent Mission Impossible movie).Hamilton proceeds after this essay to describe the members of the pantheon, the major and minor gods and goddesses, the ideas of creation, the heroes (human, semi-divine and divine), stories of love and devotion, justice and injustice, and, of course, of warfare, victory, defeat, and courage. Those heroes before the Trojan War, perhaps the Greek-mythological-equivalent of a world war, had battles and dire circumstances to fight and overcome. The Trojan War figured largely in the mythological frameworks of Greece and Rome -- all the gods and goddess were involved in this conflict, it seemed, as were many of the heroes of Greek mythology.Hamilton, writing in a fairly conservative period of time, and in a fairly conservative culture, sanitised the mythological stories to a large extent. The Greeks were a very human and often rather bawdy bunch; the Romans were even moreso. Much of the sexuality in the mythological stories is omitted, save to demonstrate the less-desirable aspects. Quite often, undergraduates who study mythology are astonished to discover, if they had used Hamilton's text in an earlier high school setting, that there is a lot more sex and violence in the 'real' stories than they had been previously exposed to.Of course, one of the primary aspects of the mythological tales was not to explain the cosmos or to build complex theological constructs (reason did these, often with help from the myths, but not using the myths as the basis), but rather the illustration of moral truths -- those of honesty, virtue, and courage as primarily valued in Greek and Roman society. Evil befalls those who do not lead a moral life; rewards come to those who do. Of course, there is a bit of whimsy in the cosmos -- bad things happen to good people, etc., even in ancient Greece. The fluctuating personalities of the gods (and the number of them) ultimately gives a satisfying explanation (if not a satisfying reason) why such things might occur.Hamilton's book is a good one to use in teaching, but it must not be considered the final authority on any of the topics it addresses. Nonetheless, it has earned its place in the pantheon of influential books, and will most likely continue to be so for some time to come."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"It was allright.

Just like some other reviewers, I don't suggest reading it unless it is required reading, which unfortunately it was for me. :( I had a lot of trouble understanding who was who due to the fact that characters were referred to by both their greek and roman names. I couldn't concentrate on the text for more than a minute at a time. I normally enjoy the majority of books, even when they are required. In fact, no matter how long a book is, even 400+ pages, I normally finish it in a day because I get sucked into it. Well, this book is definitly not one of the best books I have ever read.

Now I enjoy reading a good book now and then but the only reason that this is a bestseller is that all highschools across america must buy the book for summer reading every year.

It was about 500 pages of boredom, but if I had to pick a favorite part, it would be the part about the Trojan War. It was the most well-written and I found it interesting. There are so many myths, each with an individual main idea, that it would be impossible to describe all of them, so I won't. The author probably wrote so many myths to better inform the reader about Greeks and their history. Even so, she could have made it a lot more exciting. Overall I didn't like this book at all, but I would still recommend it to kids who like mythology and don't mind a boring book. A measly 1 star. -- Abby"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"I was required to read this book for summer reading as of going into ninth grade.

It is more or less designed to teach people how to fake their way through an interview and fool people into thinking that they actually have some idea of what they're talking about. Of course any interviewer worth their salt will be able to see right through some idiot trying to use buzzwords to look smart. I get no sense that the authors have actually ever had any success in any industry involving the Internet.

She believed that I would enjoy about anything the author had written, so I made my own choice of this particular title. Perhaps I might enjoy other books by this author more, or perhaps I am just not in tune with her style. I know that my friend admires Ms Holland's writing, but unfortunately I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Hail to the Chiefs: Presidential Mischief, Morals, and Malarkey from George W. to George W","review":"\\"The main cause of the Revolution, aside from all those Adamses, was the quantity of feisty, short-tempered people on this side of the Atlantic at the time, and the quantity of unusually bossy, fat-headed chumps on the other side, topped by poor George III, who suffered from funny feelings in his head.\\"Sarcastic references to the temperament of John Adams, his relatives, and assorted descendants, which pop up on a regular basis throughout this book, are among the multitude of laugh out loud moments packed into this clever \\"tell-all\\" about the lives, wives, dinner parties, dalliances, and various personal difficulties that characterized the forty-three great white leaders who have served as our nation's Chief Executive.\\"John Adams, back in the beginning of it all, had always felt that the Presidency should be, well, not exactly hereditary, which would be undemocratic, but just naturally reserved for a group of the right sort of families whose sons would be properly educated and trained up for public service, and dedicated to knowing what was best for the rest of us rabble.

The author notes of James Garfield (1881-1881):\\"Garfield was tall and handsome and genial and scholarly. He believed that strikers had a right to strike and black men to vote and might have been a historically Good President if he'd stuck around long enough.\\"The author goes on to talk about Garfield's shooting at the hands of a disaffected job-seeker who wanted to be the American consul in Paris:\\"Everyone thought Garfield was a goner, and [Vice President] Arthur was already testing out the mattresses and deciding which furniture to get rid of, but at four in the morning the President was actually quite chipper and telling funny stories. \\"The doctors rallied round and tried everything they could lay hands on to dig for the bullet. The bullet was minding its own business and not bothering anyone, comfortably lodged behind the pancreas out of harm's way, but the doctors couldn't rest till they'd excavated. \\"Dr. Bliss hauled in the big Nelaton Probe and shoved it into the wound and twisted it around and around, looking for a pathway that felt like a bullet track. It made some interesting tracks of its own, and got wedged in the broken bits of a rib and had to be wrenched back out, but it didn't find any bullet. Then Bliss poked around with his fingers for a while, and called more doctors in from all over the country to poke with their fingers too, and pretty soon Garfield was a maze of secret passageways, but the bullet stayed put. \\"Then Alexander Graham Bell had a better idea. He was so pleased with his telephone that he thought it could do anything, and he rigged up a receiver with a primary and secondary coil that he said would hum when it got near the bullet. He brought it around, and they rubbed it all over Garfield, and once they did hear it hum, or anyway, they thought they did. 6 Bell showed the doctors where to go in and dig deeper and wider holes, and they did, but still no luck. 76 Some claim it was confused by the metal bedsprings...7 The autopsy found it a good ten inches from where Bell said it was.\\"HAIL TO THE CHIEFS is chock full of log cabins, land grabs, liquor, liars, and levity.

She brilliantly brings the past presidents to life and pokes fun where sarcasm is due. Before reading her book I did not know that much about the lesser-known presidents- aka Martin Van Buren etc... but even for the boring presidents (Harrison's 30 days in office) she makes the history entertaining and lively.A must buy for any political science or history fan or even the casual reader interested in a good laugh tempered by true facts of our nation's past presidents."},{"Title":"Hail to the Chiefs: Presidential Mischief, Morals, and Malarkey from George W. to George W","review":"If you know your U.S. presidents as I do, having made a deep, extensive, and lifelong study of them, you'll likely enjoy this little book as a funny and lightweight diversion. This author is *hilarious*. I particularly love her wise-cracking footnotes. She gives unfortunately short-shrift to some weighty events and people, and sometimes has no sympathy in places where she should. But she can pack so many facts, figures, and personality types into a few pungent paragraphs that it makes the historian in me smile, knowing just how much data she has successfully summarized, with such panache. For a good example, try her chapter on William McKinley and the causes and effects of the Spanish-American war (with Teddy Roosevelt \\"jumping out of his skin with excitement\\"). After the war, \\"We paid Spain twenty million for the Philippines, and they threw in Guam for good measure...\\" (\\"Guam??\\" says the footnote -- hilarious).Her ending chapter on GW Bush might have seemed overly caustic in 2006, but reads as sadly prescient now. Her sarcasm is at its bitter best here."},{"Title":"Hail to the Chiefs: Presidential Mischief, Morals, and Malarkey from George W. to George W","review":"Readers of any political stripe should enjoy Holland's breezy, brief and irreverent takes on our presidents. From George Washington's preoccupation with mules to George W's fitness regime, she pokes fun at personal quirks while touching on the major historical moments in each administration and showing that however bad we think things are now, they've been worse. Campaigns, for instance, are models of honesty and restraint in comparison to the days when Adams was not only accused of listening to his wife but described in the newspapers as \\"old, querulous, blind, crippled, toothless.\\"These thumbnail sketches remind us not only of who all those middle-19th century one-term presidents were and when, but give us the firsts. New Hampshire's Franklin Pierce, for instance, was the first to have a Christmas tree in the White house and installed central heating too. Benjamin Harrison was the first to watch a professional baseball game And Andrew Jackson was the first \\"to decide that a President can veto a perfectly constitutional bill just because he doesn't like it, and he was like a kid with a new toy.\\"Most of the presidents known for freeing their slaves never did, but Robert E. Lee did and \\"he didn't wait till he was dead to do it, either.\\" Some presidents were more interesting for their wives - Holland gives most of Madison's space to Dolley and not just his space either. Taft's wife wanted the presidency more than he did and nudged him at conferences to stay awake while Pierce's wife was so unhappy at his election, she refused to attend the inauguration.There are scandals and wars and statesmanlike deeds, sure, but there are also pets and bratty children and fashion statements and swelled heads. A useful, funny and caustic book."},{"Title":"Hail to the Chiefs: Presidential Mischief, Morals, and Malarkey from George W. to George W","review":"I read this book alongside &quot;The Secret Lives of the U.S. Presidents&quot; by Cormac O'Brien (2004). The two books obviously have a lot in common, aiming as they do to reveal the &quot;secrets&quot; about our Chief Executives and demonstrate that they all have, or had, their flaws, their quirks, and probably more than their fair share of general weirdness. The two books tell many of the same stories, quote many of the same excerpts from the Nixon tapes, and even make the same obvious &quot;joke&quot; that James Monroe should have shown more originality than to die on July 4, since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson had already done that act. And they share the same People Magazine-style focus on personality and scandal ahead of questions of political or historical significance.However, two things make &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; a better book than &quot;Secret Lives...&quot;. One is Barbara Holland's ability as a writer. Her narrative style -- as opposed to O'Brien's short-attention-span-theater reliance on short sections, text boxes, and lots of subheads and pull quotes -- makes this a much easier book to really settle into and enjoy. Her reliance on clever comments in her footnotes suggests too much time spent reading Sellar and Yeatman, or perhaps Richard Armour, but this is something the reader can get used to.The other thing that makes this a much stronger book is illustrated by the discussion of allegations that Thomas Jefferson fathered children by his slave Sally Hemmings. This is one of those stories that &quot;everyone knows&quot; is true now, and O'Brien repeats it as a flat fact. Holland, however, devotes three whole pages to laying out the whole story, culminating in the truth that DNA testing in fact showed that while *some of* Hemmings' children were sired by *a* Jefferson male, they also explicitly proved that Thomas Jefferson himself *was not* the father. Holland, in short, seems to have a commitment not only to telling a good story, but also to getting the story straight. (Oddly, however, she seems to suggest that FDR used his wheelchair and his polio as campaign assets, though my understanding always was that those facts were largely kept from the American people, and certainly not emphasized for political purposes.)Unfortunately, Barbara Holland shares one final trait with Cormac O'Brien, and that's her inability to retain her breezy objectivity and sense of comic remove when it comes to modern presidents. Nixon sends her right off the rails, her discussion of Ford can be summed up with the words &quot;he's dumb,&quot; and, after starting by saying how much everyone loves Reagan, her summary of his term is over-the-top with mocking praise, filtered through the standard, predictable, &quot;he was an actor playing a president&quot; lens. The discussion of Bill Clinton is mostly about how much other people hated him, and how irrational they all were. You can imagine what she says about George W. Bush, and you'd probably be right.The final paragraph of my O'Brien review applies here too: Maybe this book is good for a laugh or two, and it's always nice to pare down the monarchical pretensions of the modern presidency (regardless of the occupant of the office or his party) a bit. But if you're looking for a real understanding of the men who have served as president and their impact, or lack of one, on history, I'd probably suggest about three dozen other titles ahead of this one."},{"Title":"Hail to the Chiefs: Presidential Mischief, Morals, and Malarkey from George W. to George W","review":"Even for people that aren't history or political buffs, this book is great!!! Barbara Holland's writing is always entertaining and this is one of her best."},{"Title":"Hail to the Chiefs: Presidential Mischief, Morals, and Malarkey from George W. to George W","review":"I picked up a paperback bargain-book copy of \\"Hail to the Chiefs\\" and admit that I did not expect to get much out of it. I ended up spending several evenings being kept very entertained by the book, and feeling rather sad when it was finished.I will not bother to repeat too much what others have said -- Holland is a witty writer, shares a glimpse of each president's personality, gives little tidbits about the political climate of each administration and who the main figures were, and in general makes the presidents seem more human than you're led to believe in high school. It's not a very deep read, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.Her \\"footnotes,\\" which can take up to a quarter of each page, are amusing but occasionally tiresome. Much of the time, the comments should simply have been included right in the paragraph, and other times, they are simply unnecessary, even as footnotes. She recycles a lot of the same jokes, but her writing style is enjoyable enough that you can overlook this for the most part.The main issue with \\"Hail to the Chiefs\\" is that, while Holland may go overboard with including every random thought she has had as a footnote, she also -- like many other pop culture generalists who don't specialize in any particular area -- includes absolutely no endnotes or sources. You are left at once delighted with all the new things you're learning, and also wondering if any of it's really accurate. Serious students of history, prepare to be frustrated. As a reader, you don't doubt she's making it up, but at the same time, you have no reason to believe she's right, either.Holland reminds the reader of that eccentric uncle who loves to tell wild stories that are probably mostly true, but who never says how they know any of it. As a result, she makes claims that can't easily be verified by the reader. This is particularly troublesome when she makes controversially definitive statements, seriously going so far as to say everyone else is wrong, about subjects like James Buchanan's sexuality and the Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemmings debate. She doesn't have the qualifications to back these assertions up -- actually, no one's really sure what her qualifications are -- and if she is so certain to be correct about things, why not prove that? She also gets some secondary names wrong, which is minor...but not really.\\"Hail to the Chiefs\\" is best with the pre-20th century presidencies. By the time she reaches Wilson, she starts losing her control; by the time she's at LBJ, you're skimming. Her commentary on these presidents seems to turn into the tabloid-style writing she manages to avoid prior to that. Holland seems to be writing her own observations on the most recent presidents rather than those of a historian. Her descriptions of Ford, Reagan, and Clinton are basically \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch caricatures in print.Then again, this isn't a serious history book, so what more can one expect. Holland has written for everyone from \\"Entertainment\\" to \\"Playboy\\" to \\"Cat Fancy,\\" so a generalist's take is as much as you can anticipate. \\"Hail to the Chiefs\\" isn't intended to go in-depth with any of the figures it discusses. It's intended to get you to smile.There's certainly more substance to the book than its main counterpart, Cormac O'Brien's \\"Secret Lives of the U.S. Presidents.\\" If you're looking for an actual read with some length to it, this is the one of the pair to select. Then again, if you want a serious examination of the American presidency and those who shaped it, \\"Hail to the Chiefs\\" is not for you at all. This book is for amusement and little more -- and that's fine if you anticipate it."},{"Title":"Hail to the Chiefs: Presidential Mischief, Morals, and Malarkey from George W. to George W","review":"HAIL TO THE CHIEFS is a wonderful overview of American history told through the actions of our Chief Executives. For me, the recent presidencies of Bush Sr, Bill Clinton and George Jr are particularly relevant. Barbara Holland's handling of our current leader is wonderfully on target, for she has the ability to strip away the his image and his posturing and cut to the core, thereby holding this President up to the ridicule he so richly deserves."},{"Title":"Hail to the Chiefs: Presidential Mischief, Morals, and Malarkey from George W. to George W","review":"Barbara Holland has tried to make history fun, a most laudable goal which more writers and historians should pursue. But she lost a little credibility to me with her comments about James Buchanan. Ms. Holland rather cluelessly maintains that Buchanan was not gay, while the evidence is overwhelmingly clear that he was. It concerned me that she would make such an erroneous judgement without knowing the facts. Buchanan lived with Rufus Devane King for over 20 years, yet Holland thinks that just because Buchanan once asked a woman to marry him, he was straight. She evidently never considered that virtually all gay men prior to the current generation asked women to marry them, and almost all married as well. The Buchanan-Rufus King relationship was no secret to anyone... Even Andrew Jackson, James Polk, and Dolley Madison referred to King as Buchanan's spouse, and the fanatical Sarah Knox Polk hatefully refused to let her nieces and nephews come in contact with Buchanan because he was gay - folks then harbored Falwellian notions about all gay people, though they did not have the concept of \\"gay persons\\" in their vocabularies yet. Ms. Holland further revealed her cluelessness when, at a book talk, she asked an audience member \\"How did they know he was homosexual? Did he wear a dress?\\" This kind of insulting and absurd comment does not speak well for the author, who is clearly unaware that only a tiny percentage of gay men have ever donned any kind of female attire, and that, in fact, straight men are far, far more likely to wear a dress than gay men are. Making such a comment is akin to asking about a black person with the question \\"How did you know he was black? Did he tap dance?\\" It's an unbelievable insult and it casts a shadow over the legitimacy of her book.Nevertheless, I think this is a worthwhile book. But take it with a grain of salt. Historians, please do more of this kind of book, so that our children will finally learn their history. History is incredibly interesting indeed if only teachers will tell the truth. And do their research."},{"Title":"Hail to the Chiefs: Presidential Mischief, Morals, and Malarkey from George W. to George W","review":"Here's a book that's a lot of fun to read.

Her characters speak the kinds of things that were spoken then--the Southerners and the Northerners, and the people (mainly Christians) who were from the South but sympathised with the North because they knew how immoral slavery was. The slaves speak in this book, too--not in one voice, but as individuals. In addition to that, the plot has some satisfying twists, and the romance is likewise very satisfying. Lots of Christian stuff, lots of scripture quoting, so if you don't like that, stay away or prepare yourself to push through it. I liked it--I kept having my thoughts influenced to remember God's presence as I was reading, and that was a great bonus.Oh, and the description of West Point, of the capitol, and of Americans staying abroad during the conflict, was interesting, as well as descriptions of the clothing of men and women and soldiers--all written from the perspective of a person living at that time. Most notable to me was the ferocity of many Southerners toward Northerners, the contempt with which they viewed the Union army, the certainty with which they viewed their victory, based on their confidence in their own superiority of courage and skill in fighting. Also, the blindness that many Southerners of otherwise splendid character had toward the true nature of slavery--because they had grown up accepting it and everyone around them accepted it. That's a warning to us. Things in our society that are dreadful tend to lose their dreadfulness if we have grown up with them and are surrounded by people who accept them (for example, how can we accept the fact that young men who go to prison routinely get raped? We even make jokes about it)."},{"Title":"The Silver Record (Werewolf: The Apocalypse)","review":"This is an excellent sourcebook for any devoted werewolf player.

The principal engineers of our professional engineering practice have used the techniques he describes in his book to structure proposals and firm deliverables that have: enhanced customer satisfaction, increased our repeat business from existing customers by more than 50%, and garnered over $1 million in design and project fees in the last 4 years.There are many marketing and professional practice books that present outstanding case study information on enhancing communication and marketing for engineering and design professionals. And they make for fine reading; however, Dr. Eckhouse's book shows you specifically how you can integrate his communication principles into any business you run today.I strongly recommend this book to any professional looking to differentiate themselves from their competition or increase project revenues."},{"Title":"The life of Pasteur,","review":"In the first half of the 19th Century if a surgical implement was dropped on the floor during a procedure, it was simply picked up and used again. It was this fatal carelessness that Louis Pasteur fought against during his lifelong studies of the dangers of contamination and the acceptance of sterilization. In his \\"The Life of Pasteur\\", Ren&eacute; Vallery-Radot (who was Pasteur's son-in-law), following the scientific struggle against diseases which made Pasteur a household name, wrote an excellent biography, translated by Mrs Devonshire, a French savante who in her youth married an Englishman. Pasteur's was not an easy struggle. The rejection of the theory of spontaneous generation and the advancement of vaccination, not to mention his experiments on animals, were vigorously debated, and the antagonism Pasteur received was not from the lay world only, but from the professional world also. Medical doctors resented what they considered the interference from a \\"mere chemist\\". His great achievements included the saving of the silkworm crop, essential to French economy, and the protection of cattle against the scourge of charbon (anthrax). On a lighter level he sought to make French beer as delicious as German beer, and you have to admire his persistence if not his patriotism. (The word \\"pasteurization\\" was first used for beer, not milk.) Only slowly, over decades, were Pasteur's theories accepted, but he never saw this as a personal triumph. Pasteur, according to his biographer, always thought of his successes as for la gloire, the esteem of France. (Incidently, though Pasteur lived through two-thirds of the 19th Century, this book does not offer an overall historical view. The Franco-Prussian War is naturally discussed in detail because it affected Pasteur's life so deeply, but the American Civil War is never mentioned.) As for survival itself, the speculation of life in that era is made obvious: the chance of surviving an amputation or the giving of birth was about 50-50, and of Pasteur's five children only two lived to adulthood. Pasteur himself at the age of forty-six suffered a stroke which nearly killed him, but of course all those hours of research were sedentary, and I don't get the impression he was taking long walks in the Bois. Probably the most famous period in Pasteur's life was his fight against rabies, which is here called hydrophobia, and his treatment of the nine-year old boy Joseph Meister. Pasteur was taking a gamble, because if Master Meister had died, Pasteur could have gone to prison. As it happened, his research and applications saved hundreds of lives; and by the time the Pasteur Institute had opened in 1888 he had become a national treasure. Actually,the fact is that at his death in 1895 he was considered not so much a hero as a saviour. Pasteur's professional courage and his personal merit, so well reflected in this biography, were summed up by his friend Dr Roux when he observed that one could admire Pasteur's works intellectually but that one had to be close to him in order to recognize \\"la bont&eacute; de son coeur\\"."},{"Title":"A Linguistics Workbook - 3rd Edition","review":"&quot;A Linguistics Wrokbook&quot; is a very well-organized workbook for students of linguistics to DO linguistics.

MPD or DID(Dissociative Identity Disorder) as it is now called remains a very controversial diagnosis. If you are interested in learning more about this bizarre condition and you are skeptical by nature you will enjoy this book. Nick was one of the most analytical and clear thinkers whom I have ever met and worked with. In this book, he systematically develops the argument that a variety of social, cognitive, and other psychological and situational factors account for how and why some people present this way and come to think of themselves as having multiple identities--rather than some kind of elusive dissociating of the mind.If you are tired of reading hocum and &quot;pop&quot; psychology and are looking for a truly scientific review of this phenomenon by one of the greatest and most prolific social psychologists who ever lived I highly recommend this book to you.Check out Nick's other work on hypnosis, witchcraft, and demonic possession. By the time of his death, Nick had developed an enormous bibliography of scientific articles, chapters, and books. Many of his research designs and methodologies were truly brilliant."},{"Title":"Multiple Identities and False Memories: A Sociocognitive Perspective","review":"Dr Nicholas P. Spanos was an excellent researcher, a prolific writer and an incredible scientist.

'''Most recent research on the dissociative disorders does not support (and in fact disconfirms) the sociocognitive model, and many inferences drawn from previous research appear unwarranted.'''

In this model, the often severe psychopathology associated with clinical MPD is minimized. Very recent studies suggest a possible neurobiological basis to MPD in at least certain MPD patients....It is clear that Spanos et al.'s 1985 conclusion that MPD is a role enactment based on their observation of role-playing subjects is based on circular logic: You ask a subject to pretend that he has alters and he complies; then you conclude that having alters is the product of role playing....Spanos's conclusion of the iatrogenic nature of MPD also suffers from an additional logical error. Even if it were true that MPD could be created iatrogenically, that does not prove that every case for noniatrogenic MPD cases....Situationally bound enactment of predefined secondary-personality roles presumes sufficient executive control to do it. Genuine MPD is defined in DSM as the loss of executive control...Genuine DID was defined in DSM-IV as the loss of a unified identity...Presumably none of Spanos's laboratory subjects suffered from a fundamental loss of a unified identity as a result of the experimental instructions....'''Genuine MPD is characterized by enduring alter-personality states that are defined by a relatively stable set of personality characteristics over time....The secondary-personality states reported by Spanos's subjects in the laboratory were very temporary role enactments....Spanos has seriously overgeneralized from the data of his 1985, 1986 and 1991 laboratory experiments that multiple personalities can be created in the laboratory.''' The more conservative interpretation merited by these data is that certain individuals with certain personality characteristics in a particular social context report temporary role enactments of different identities that are limited to the context of the experiment....Overall the Spanos data offer no evidence that either stable alter personalities or the range of clinical features typically associated with MPD can be created in the laboratory, and the data certainly offer no support whatsoever that MPD per se can be created through suggestive influences. At best, these data support the view that certain individuals in a high-demand context, and/or under extreme interview conditions wherein misinformation is systematically supplied, report temporary secondary-personality states....Overall, these data offer little evidence that the disorder MPD per se can be created through suggestive influences.\\""},{"Title":"Who Was Harriet Tubman?","review":"Yona Zeldis McDonough did a wonderful job describing \\"Who Was Harriet Tubman?

The first few chapters talk about the fundamental skills, such as controls, events, and functions, that are necessary for people who start learning VB6. In the middle parts of the book it starts using some complicated concepts, such as Decision and Repetition to solve some business related problems. This book also shows how VB6 can work with MS Access Database file since database and VB6 work together become a powerful application for business. It also mentions a little concepts on SQL and how SQL can be embeded inside the VB6. In the last few chapters of this book, the topic becomes more focus on the Data Error checking, Menu and Multiple Form Application, and Object Oriented Programming.Given that this is a textbook for business application using VB6, some of the examples in the book involves some accounting concepts and might make you feel hard to understand if you are not an Accounting major. However, it is a book focuing on the use of VB6 in business. I would recommend you to read this book if you really want to learn something in VB6 and business."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 6 Programming: Business Applications with a Design Perspective","review":"Jeff Tsay developed this book from his vast experience in both industry and as a college professor. This author possesses the real-world know-how of Visual Basic development as well as the ability to teach difficult topics to large audiences. I studied under this author in college. When I signed up for his class, I was already working in the industry with a little over two years experience as a programmer. This book, along with Jeff's expert instruction, advanced my career tremendously. I still refer to this book for expert advice. Jeff covers everything from the basics of VB programming to more advanced user interface development. He talks about algorithms and teaches optimized coding practices. He explores objects and classes, and ActiveX development. He talks at length about ADO and database connectivity. He even covers Win32 API programming. I can't possible list all of the features it offers. You will take from this book everything you need to become the Visual Basic developer that you've always dreamed. First-time programmers will appreciate Jeff's style and gain a solid foundation from which to grow. Advanced developers will acquire an edge that will differentiate them in the industry. The other VB books I've read are either too dull or don't cover anything beyond the basics. You will find no 'fluff' in this book. Jeff's book is expertly written, delivering the appropriate information in each chapter right when it's needed. I owe Jeff a debt of gratitude for what his instruction has done for my career and my pocketbook. Highly recommended by someone who has used it.

I've acquired all of the top 20 \\"bestsellers\\" on the subject but this stands apart from the rest. Author Tsay doesn't just know how to write code, as a teacher he appears to be extremely gifted. For example, his coverage of sorting algorithms and how they work is light years beyond what I've seen in the other VB books. The author has a knack for encapsulating his examples, providing small succinct chunks of knowledge and then making it all stick. Almost like making a sculpture out of clay he goes on to build upon that foundation incrementally to the point where you're fully able to get your head around what were previously considered (by me anyway) to be difficult subjects. Other authors would do well to emulate the techniques used by Mr. Tsay to impart his teaching in this book. Don't be put-off by the \\"Business\\" title either, if you're Beginner-Intermediate like me this book is exactly what you need. My only complaint would be internet transfers and such were not covered, but the VB6 language is so feature rich one can't expect a single book to do it all. This is a book you'll build a strong programming foundation with and that's a big key to longterm success, while reading it I almost felt like a private tutor was by my side.

The Music Together Singalong Storybooks do just that and more, especially in the short children's book, \\"She Sells Sea Shells.\\"This thirty-two page hardbound over-sized book has a drawing of a young barefoot girl running along a beach carrying sea shells with her dog trailing behind her. Each water color with colored pencil drawing by illustrator Bruno Merz covers two full open pages with big, easy to understand scenes. Some pictures have matching colored items that correspond to the song's wording along with detailed, fun little beach animals or birds. This book is geared for a parent or adult to read to a child from birth to six years old and includes several pages of instructions, suggestions on reading tips, singing and imaginative projects to do. There is nothing scary or unnerving in the book that would frighten a toddler or preschooler.Taken from Mary Anning's tongue twister from the early eighteen hundreds about a young girl who collects and sells sea shells on the beach, the song was written by Kenneth K. Guilmartin, who is also founder and director of Music Together. At the beginning of the book, there is a page explaining how to use the book and recording, a page dedicated to the international Music Together program, and a page about the song's history. One can go online and buy for ninety-nine cents an audible MP3 version to play along while reading the story.The creative yet simple illustrated works depict the girl waving good-bye to her sea captain father at the light house in the morning, collecting several different types of colored sea shells, rowing in her boat to another beach, selling them to the beach-goers, rowing back home and greeting her father again at night time. At the end of the book, there are two pages of suggested activities, a music sheet of the song, and how to purchase the song on their website.With this song that many older generation parents or grandparents remember, it is a marvelous interactive tool that not only connects with a young, innocent child, but one can remember the words and (if the audible song is needed) sing along. With all the negativity in the world today, Music Together does a delightful job convincing us that all children are musical with this nicely illustrated, innocuous children's book."},{"Title":"She Sells Seashells by the Seashore: A Tongue Twister Story (Hello Reader!

Apparently, this same gene or a kindred one creates an interest in tongue twisters. My daughter can't seem to get enough, and now the whole family sits around reading them and laughing ourselves silly.Thus, I am more enthusiastic about this book than the teacher-reviewer who gave it only three stars. While I agree with her that it's a challenge, it's such a fun and such a different sort of book from the usual ones, that I think it deserves four stars.Some of the tongue twisters included are: She Sells Seashells, Peter Piper (picks a peck), Woodchuck, Betty Botter (bough a bit of bitter butter), and a host of smaller ones like: Six Sick Sheep.The twist provided by this author is that she combines them into a single storyline. Thus Silly Sally (of seashell fame) has a picnic with Peter Piper where upon they see \\"Five Fat Frogs Flying Fast\\". Whether it really works as a literary device is besides the point; it provides words that children can either read themselves, or to which they can listen.Four Stars. Nice Read-aloud. Okay art.

This book because of it's tongue twister contents must be used with experienced, confident readers. This book uses letter repetition which combines single consonant sounds with blends.

For one thing, the novel is a narrated by fictitious narrator named Sir Walter Scott, honest, who stumbles into a private library salvaged from pre-revolutionary France; for another, its annotations reference sources which may or may not exist, but which the fictitious narrator claims he read in the private library referenced above. Further, with the exception of the heroine (dish-water dull, I agree), the characters all behave as modern people would. Yet, as far as I can tell, Borges never wrote about Sir Walter Scott. Go figure."},{"Title":"Quentin Durward (Waverley novels. Riverside ed)","review":"I believe that Sir Walter Scott was the man who invented the historical novel, and they say that this is one of his finest efforts. Certainly, it puts a lot of modern fiction into the shade, especially the sort of modern novel which amounts to prolonged gazing at one's own navel. (I haveThe Sense of an Ending (Borzoi Books)in mind...)But this is heresy! How can you possibly prefer clunky old Walter Scott (SO unfashionable!) to the winner of the Man Booker Prize (SO fashionable!). My only answer is that literary reputations come, and literary reputations go. Time was, when Sir Walter Scott was one of the best-read authors in history, but his reputation took a serious dive when \\"real writers\\" such as Ezra Pound and James Joyce came along.Nevertheless, \\"Quentin Durward\\" is very good reading. Not only is it a good story, you will actually gain some valuable knowledge about history, in particular the French king Louis XI, and the Duke of Burgundy.How about the style? Well, when I was in 8th grade I decided it was impenetrable, even yucky. But the decades passed (as they will) and now the style offers no impediment whatsoever.One very refreshing thing is that Quentin Durward is a Complete Pre-Feminist Male Hero. He is strong, valiant, a terrifying fighter, and extremely good-looking into the bargain. He respects women, and shows them every courtesy; in fact, at the end of the novel he almost surrenders his greatest love to rescue a Flemish girl who has been captured by a gang of soldiers with no good intentions. On top of that, he is nobly born, and expects that others treat him accordingly, mostly because he conducts himself according to a strict code of nobility.And all of these things are gone, gone with the wind -- if they ever really existed.I'm looking forward to reading more from this author, especially since you can get his complete works for the Kindle for almost nothing. :-)"},{"Title":"Quentin Durward (Waverley novels.

John Woo: Interviews is the best book on John Woo currently on the market. Michael Bliss' Between the Bullets has some interesting insights, but it was a collection of film essays, which focus more on academic, sociological and ideological interpretations of Woo's films rather than an aim at biographical detailing.John Woo: Interviews succeeds very well at portraying the shy, serious director by meticulous editing, mostly letting Woo's own syntax and verbal mannerisms come through with minimal tampering, and the interviews themselves delve into Woo's troubled relationship with Tsui Hark, his work with both Hong Kong and American film crews, his childhood in Hong Kong, and of course his quartet of Hong Kong classics: A Better Tomorrow, The Killer, Bullet in the Head, and Hard-Boiled. Myfavourite interviews are the ones with Hard Target director of photography Russell Carpenter, who goes into the nitty-gritties of working with such a visually meticulous director, and an extremely illuminating portion where Woo dissects the unique qualities of his various leading men -- Chow Yun-fat, John Travolta, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Nicolas Cage, and Tom Cruise.The editing is smartly done, making the interviews flow into an easy read, and each interview is documented so that we have some context for interpretation. I've been reading up on Woo for quite awhile, but I'd say this is the single most comprehensive, multi-angled and absorbing source of John Woo material yet. A great read for fans of Asian cinema, and filmmakers will especially find this book an invaluable source of information for Woo's unique cinematic magic."},{"Title":"The Little Disturbances of Man: Stories of Men and Women At Love","review":"These are stories of real-life love and relationships (ie: imperfect, strange and unexpected - not cheesy or sappy at all). Paley drops the reader into the heart of the character and creates for us a world so vivid, yet so different from what we know, that I felt dizzy the first time I read one of these stories. Her use of language is so perfect it makes me laugh out loud (on the subway) and I enjoy reading any given paragraph over several times. I use this book for inspiration every time I try (in vain) to write something creative myself... check it out!"},{"Title":"The Little Disturbances of Man: Stories of Men and Women At Love","review":"What makes Paley worth reading and important is her language, which is plain, simple english, but the order in which she places the words create sentences that burst with gut-life. Her sentences are like clever, immigrant hands--hard-won wisdom with an untiring lust for life. Most of the stories are set in a New York reminiscent of The Honeymooners, unfortunately due to my age my only point of reference. But ultimately, as the subtitle says, these are clear, gritty stories of men and women at love. This is writing that your mother would understand; and make you glad to be alive."},{"Title":"The Little Disturbances of Man: Stories of Men and Women At Love","review":"Grace Paley's stories are of a type--somewhat Jewish and feminist--but her style and wit is so sardonic and original that she escapes stereotyping.

Moreover, Virginia served as a gateway for the various migrations to the west, northwest, and southwest by early colonists, including the intrepid Scotch-Irish. By far the most authoritative and comprehensive account of the advance of the Virginia frontier in colonial times is Kegley's Virginia Frontier--a mammoth work detailing the social, religious, and family life in Southwest Virginia from 1730 to 1790.The importance of this extraordinary work to genealogists cannot be overstated. Kegley culled through a multitude of original records to ensure that his work would be the most reliable sourcebook available on this subject. To help the reader understand the migration into this new area, Kegley focuses particularly on the settlers themselves. He identifies each newcomer with his place of settlement, and then examines the pioneer's experiences and subsequent movements, using nearly three dozen maps to show more definitively the location of settlements and important homesteads. More than sixty additional illustrations further enhance and clarify the text.The narrative is divided into five parts: Part I covers the Virginia frontier from the beginning of the colony to 1740; Part II covers the period from 1740 to 1760; Part III tells the story of the Virginia frontier in the French and Indian War; Part IV covers the closing years of the war and the settlements from 1760 to the organization of Botetourt County in 1770; and Part V details the organization and development of Botetourt County from 1770 to 1783. Throughout each of these parts--in section after section--there are biographical sketches and countless lists of land grants and deeds of conveyance identifying thousands upon thousands of settlers and their family members. This documentary history is without a doubt the premier source of information on the pioneers of the Virginia frontier.\\"Henceforth [Kegley's Virginia Frontier] will be regarded and accepted as the one necessary and sufficient corner-stone in any collection of books dealing with the history of the Virginia frontier.\\"--Samuel M. Wilson"},{"Title":"Kegley's Virginia Frontier","review":"This is a classic piece of history, meticulously researched from available records. It is of particular importance and significance to those, like myself, who are researching family history of those ancestors who lived in this area of the Virginia frontier during the years 1740-1780."},{"Title":"Kegley's Virginia Frontier","review":"I was so happy to find this book at a reasonable price. This will be a great help with my genealogy. It's a wonderful addition to any library for those interested in Colonial American History, specially Virginia frontier."},{"Title":"Kegley's Virginia Frontier","review":"This enormous, chunky paperback is a reprint of Frederick Kegley's original 1938 book. The current book is published by The Genealogical Publishing Company, Baltimore, MD. While the title of the book may give you some idea that this is a work of narrative history, the current publisher's name should clarify exactly what this book is.It is a huge genealogical reference book, full of land grands, surveys, tax rolls, court records, local censuses, household inventories, etc... While the book is very good at recording the movements of people, it tells very little narrative history. Those bits of history that are included are there to explain the motivations for migration rather than an attempt to reconstruct past events.Another thing potential readers may want to know is that the region of coverage is frontier VIRGINIA, and should not be confused with Southwest Virginia. Essentially, this book tracks the migration of German and (mostly) Scots-Irish peoples to the West, over the Blue Ridge, from Staunton down to Roanoke. This is the story of Lexington and Lewisburg, of Moorefield and Union, of Bedford and Fincastle, NOT of Wytheville and Abingdon. The upper James and Roanoke rivers, Augusta and Botetourt counties are most emphasized, beginning with the earliest pioneer movements in the late 1720s. Daniel Boone is not really part of this story, his work being further south and west.There are many interesting black & white illustrations and maps in the book. Many of the old houses are shown, as are good maps of the frontier. All of the maps have been reduced down to fit on a single page, so they are frequently difficult to read.I recommend this book for genealogical researchers, but would stop short of recommending it for general historians. It's a good resource for local historians, and could also be useful for architectural historians.Readers interested in Southwest Virginia should consider Preston's equally huge Annals of Southwest Virginia."},{"Title":"Kegley's Virginia Frontier","review":"This is a VERY comprehensive book on the Virginia frontier in the 1700s. Reference is made to many, many records concerning the settlement of the lands in Augusta and Botetourt counties, although because of the changing of the county boundaries, some reference is made to Orange, Spotsylvania and Caroline counties. Identification of many prominent people and families are contained throughout as well as reference to many skirmishes with Indians and the fates, by named individual, of participants. This book is worth far, far more than it costs, as many tens of thousands of dollars in expenses would be required to gather this information beyond that of the value of your time in doing so."},{"Title":"Love & Rockets Vol. 10: Love and Rockets X","review":"One of my least favorite of these 15 incredible volumes -- why? Basically, there's a fine line between letting your characters have strong opinions and proselytizing through your characters -- in LOVE &amp; ROCKETS X, Senor Hernandez seems (unfortunately) rather too snug on the latter side of that boundary, and the work suffers for it. The diversity of the characters seems incredibly forced here -- he continually falls back on an extremely limited lexicon of cliches and racial stereotypes, the contrary result of which tends to be the obscuring and confounding of GH's own aims (namely, a noble, active tolerance and appreciation of the HUMAN, as opposed to the Caucasian or Latino or African-American or Gay/Lesbian, ad nauseum) -- but a little of that goes a very long way (likewise for overlong sociological Iggy Pop diatribes and the sort of musicological conversational asides which seem more like a vehicle for GH to brag about his record collection than anything else) and it times this book gets so supersaccharined with such unnecessities I had to restrain myself from hurling. The &quot;All the World's Problems Would Be Solved If We'd All Just Embrace Our Inherent Bisexuality (Not To Mention the Nearest Available Member of Your Own Gender, Though Preferably One of a Different Race Just To Make Absolutely Certain That Beto Hernandez's Message Is Not Lost On Anyone) and Flesh Out Our Record Collections With Old Germs 45s, etc.&quot; message, presented with all the subtlety of a Chick tract, ultimately estranges (read: nauseates) the reader. Crosby, Stills and Nash la-la-ing &quot;Love The One You're With&quot; elicits a similar reaction out of me as this book -- when the Hernandez's stuff works, it really works; but when it doesn't (as here it does not), it's as smarmily insufferable as being forced to watch &quot;The Big Chill&quot; alongside some overtalkative person who counts it among her top ten favorite films of all time...Secondly, it seemed to me, reading this particular story, that something which ought to have been intrinsic to the story seemed instead to have been lost on the artist: i.e., the fact that the set of unspoken rules which govern human relationships (govern them as the moon governs the tides) is not the same set in Palomar and in Los Angeles. And this should have been central to Riri and Maricela's running-away experience, but was hardly explored (that was to be left up to Steve Erickson, who copped/altered/fleshed out similar chemistries in his second novel &quot;Rubicon Beach&quot;). But -- more pertinently -- the story falls flat on its (admittedly quite attractive) face for the same reasons. Los Angeles ain't Palomar. Los Angeles is so apalomaric (sorry) it might as well be on another planet. I sort of got the feeling that he was jumping into brother Jaime's territory. Later work based around the LA-Palomar pipeline (I'm thinking specifially of the unbelievable &quot;Luba Conquers the World&quot; and of last year's &quot;New Love&quot; series) juggles all of these themes, characters, plots and conflicts admirably and successfully, so I imagine Gilbert eventually found his way through to the same clarified butter as the sorely missed Mr. Coltrane. But &quot;Love and Rockets X&quot; seems more to represent a sort of learning-through-mistakes..."},{"Title":"Psychology of Achievement: Six Keys to Personal Power","review":"\\"What one great thing would you dare to dream if you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that you absolutely could not fail? This is one of the most important questions of all, because what this says is that this is really your great dream and your great ambition in life, and if you can write the answer to this question it means that you can have it. The very fact that you can think clearly about what this answer might be, and that you can write the answer down on paper, means that you are capable of accomplishing it. Nature is not capricious, and Nature does not on the one hand give us the ability to clearly visualize and write down a goal without at the same time giving us the ability to realize it. This is one of the most exciting things about the human psyche - the very fact that you can crystallize your desire means that you can achieve it. The only question is, how badly do you want it, and are you willing to pay the price to get it? Because the only limitation is in your own mind, it is not contained in physical reality.\\"The above is Brian Tracy's central thesis in these six motivational cassettes. The material is classic Peale and Nightingale with considerable modern psychological research added (for example, the description of Johannes Shultz's autogenic conditioning of Olympic athletes to consistently enhance their performance). Although there is a plethora of such works, Tracy is a sincere and engaging speaker, and this upbeat material is a good reminder of the things winners never forget."},{"Title":"History of Jerusalem","review":"Over all, Karen has managed to write an excellent book on the history of the city of Jerusalem. Unlike other \\"historians\\" who's prejudice is clear in their work, especially on the Crusade histories, karen's book here is easily understood & far from bias. I find this book to be very objective in dealing with the various elements & people who came to that troubled city. For those who are looking to condemn & judge these by gone incidents should look for less credible writers to fill their thirst, as this book is about citing the incidents, battles & struggle history for the city of, ironically, peace."},{"Title":"History of Jerusalem","review":"Ms. Armstrong fails to fully disguise her pro-muslim bias in this history of Jerusalem. While it is true that atrocities were committed by all parties (Jews, Christians, Muslims and others) at different times during Jerusalem's long history, she focuses primarily on those inflicted upon the Muslims, ignoring the fact that the Christian crusades occured after more than 300 hundred years of Muslim invasions upon Christian, Jewish and pagan lands, often brutally, and with disastrous consequences.The \\"claim to Jerusalem\\", while a very touchy subject and one fraught with the landmines of what constitutes a claim, is presented with her usual bias towards Muslims, largely ignoring the very clear historical fact that it was the Jewish temples upon which all others were later built.Very readable and complete, worth adding to your library if you can take it for what it's worth and balance the information with other sources."},{"Title":"Theory and Practice of Psychiatry","review":"I have worked in Psychiatry for more than 35 years as a Psychiatric Nurse and have read many text books.

When somebody asked him about his twoheaded ugly women, he answered that it is art, because he can se the world this way. This way too, because he could see it in the conventional way too. And he then did draw a very classical act. I think that this anecdote is fictional because you can't to draw classically to be a modern painter. This wonderful, insightful and easy to understand book explains what is modern and what is esthetic in Piet Mondrian's abstract squares of colors and what differentiates them from the similarly fanciful work of a house painter."},{"Title":"Spokesmen for God","review":"Hamilton is most known for her works on the Greek and Roman Ways. Here she makes as her subject the other great foundationalal source of Western thought, the teaching of the Hebrew prophets. While it is possible to quarrel with certain parts of her presentation of Biblical development, her appreciation and understanding of the prophets is by and large sound. She writes with an elegant clarity.\\"The ways of God and the ways of men were equally interesting to the Hebrew writers and nothing else interested them at all. To the first they gave all their unsurpassed poetic power; to the other what was hardly less remarkable to them, their keenness of observation and penetration of judgment, solidly based upon that realistic view of life we call common sense , which was strong in every one of them.\\"Hamilton gives special emphasis to the teaching of the prophet Amos who gave preeminence to the idea of God, as God of Love. She sees the Prophets as great realists who do not let themselves escape into miracle and myth, but place supreme emphasis on ethical action. She makes a point which I think still applies today in relation to the people of Israel. She says that in no other place in the world could prophets have spoken so harshly against their own leaders and not have been silenced by force. She notes both the courage of the prophets in standing up for the weaker elements of the society, the poor, the widowed, the homeless, and the mindset which was capable of moving even leaders of the people to absorb these harsh messages and respond to them.A fine introductory work."},{"Title":"Spokesmen for God","review":"Easy read.

His book offers many useful tools, including a test to determine if you're suffering from burnout, a myriad of tips on selling more effectively (Shiffman's foremost area of expertise) and an appendix with advice for telemarketing sales operations. Schiffman includes scores of anti-burnout measures, ranging from diet to managing expectations to transforming stress into creative energy. Most chapters are only two to three pages long, which makes this book read at a practical pace for busy professionals, including sales managers, an audience Schiffman specifically addresses. His advice on burnout is sound and well founded, if not nearly as brilliant as his advice on the selling process itself. We recommend this book, although its impact on you will depend on your stress level, experience, personality and job circumstances. The section on how managers can minimize burnout will help you even before your team members get their copies. Reading this book may not prevent burnout, but at least you'll know how to douse it."},{"Title":"Nevada Dawn","review":"Nevada Dawn is Gentry's 11th romance western book in an interwoven series that is full of adventure, love, and well researched historical facts.

Comparing the two in &quot;Stand Fast I Must&quot;, John Updike said he found the latter edition &quot;ponderous and indiscriminate&quot;. In the new edition, Robinson, Frost and Stevens are parsed down to make way for new faces like Philip Pain, Phillis Wheatley, and Frederick Tuckerman - as well as to clear extra room for Edward Taylor (one poem added to Matthiessen's choices, making it eight in the new edition) and Emily Dickinson. I love Dickinson, but Ellman gives her an extra 23 poems (bringing it up to 70).Wallace Stevens loses 5 and H.D. gains 5, Amy Lowell goes from 3 to none, Marriane Moore goes from 16 to 13, and T.S. Eliot's 8 page &quot;Ash-Wednesday&quot; has been brought down to a snippet less than a page long. One of the few modern poets to benefit from the changes is Ezra Pound, who had 18 poems in the old edition and 23 in the new. Meanwhile, Thoreau remains the same but is completely (and perhaps unnecessarily) revamped. Tennyson, too, appears in a nearly new suit. I thought these changes were refreshing, but not quite as encompassing.

The most significant reality about Eclipse for a user is its long learning curve. There is so much in Eclipse, and just knowing what you can configure is a challenge. When I read Holzner's book last month, from the first chapter I kept bemoaning, \\"Why didn't I have this book a year ago?\\" I can recommend this book without reservation for anyone moving to Eclipse as a Java development environment. Many recent books focus specifically on writing plug-ins for Eclipse. Holzner covers writing a simple plug-in, but what he has written is a book for developers who want to use Eclipse to write and test real Java applications.Holzner's style is to cover a lot of ground without getting tediously deep into any single subject area. This is one reason his writing is so readable. In this book he has a very nice introduction to using the JUnit perspective for automated unit testing, a concise introduction to the debug perspective, a chapter on Ant for building projects, and integrating Eclipse with the CVS software repository.Holzner spends several chapters on GUI and web development, but don't look for detailed information on how to do Swing, or JSPs. Holzner's focus is on how Eclipse supports development in these areas. He has a chapter on Swing GUI application development, two chapters on SWT (IBM's Standard Widget Toolkit) development, and a very accessible chapter on using Eclipse for web development with JSPs, servlets, javabeans, and how to use the Sysdeo Tomcat plug-in to simplify your life. I was not aware of this plug-in until I read this book, and knowing about it was almost worth the price of the book. The chapter on Struts development was the least clear to me, only because I have not worked with Struts, but if you understand the Model-View-Controller architecture you will be able to get a good understanding in this chapter of what Struts is trying to provide, and how Eclipse will support you.Holzner offers two chapters on developing plug-ins, and I am impressed that he could convey so much in just two chapters. Plug-in development can be very complex, but Holzner presents the basic requirements very cogently. He closes out the book with a pro-spective on Eclipse 3.0, now finally available at eclipse.org.It was a fun, quick read, and even after more than a year of using Eclipse I learned some really nice things from this book."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"Holzner continues the O'Reilly tradition of concise books that span a subject. He has produced a How-To for Eclipse, geared towards the Java programmer. Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment that is free. IBM is reputed to have spent $40 million in its development, before putting it into open source. Since then, the enthusiastic response by programmers has led to even more improvements in its functionality.When Holzner calls Eclipse an IDE, he means more than just the ability to develop a standalone Java application. Some of you may have used IBM's Visual Age for Java. It was quite a nice IDE, and Eclipse is descended from it. But VAJ was really geared towards a standalone context. In contrast, these days you might have to build an application that will be used in a web server. Holzner shows how to do this, using Tomcat as the web container. Plus, if there will be several of you working on a project, and you need a version control system, he describes using CVS with Eclipse. Also, for an easy installation of your application, he gives examples of using Ant and Eclipse.These examples (Tomcat, CVS, Ant) were chosen deliberately. They are probably the most common tools/programs in their fields. And they are free.In this way, the \\"Integrated\\" in IDE takes on a powerful meaning to a Java programmer."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"Want to get up and running with Eclipse? This is your book.

I downloaded the CDT plug-in. My C programs look great in Eclipse from Visual Studio .Net. However, I am having a horrible time trying to connect a C/C++ compiler to Eclipse. I can edit right now but not compile. I also use ColdFusion. There is a plug-in for that. It looks great as well. I guess more books need to be written.

This book satisfies the need for a clear understandable how to manual of the basic functionality. Just think of it as the printed user manual for those who like to have a paper reference.The only criticism is that the cover reference to coverage of 3.0 is misleading because it is discussed in only 18 pages out of 295."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"Time has started to diminish the value of this book. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 deal with building GUIs using the V4ALL Eclipse plugin, which is now classified as Obsolete. Also with Eclipse 3.3 now available (the book focuses on Eclipse 3.0), a new edition of the book is definitely needed."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"The first couple of chapters provide a nice quick start. Although I've been using Eclipse for several months, I still learned quite a few new things here.Eclipse's JUnit integration is awesome and the chapter about it was equally good. I had no idea that Eclipse had such capabilities.The CVS integration chapter is OK, but I still don't fully understand the Synchronize functionality. More detail is needed.Similarly, the chapter on Ant is a bit light. It doesn't talk about how one can modify build.xml outside of the editor like in the Outline view. Maybe Eclipse doesn't have that functionality, but then that fact should be mentioned.The sections on applets and AWT, as well as Swing, could have been eliminated since there aren't any Eclipse helpers described. I was happy to see that there is a Swing GUI builder available (V4ALL), but the coverage isn't deep enough. The V4ALL-generated code fragments contained cryptic \\"user code\\" comments which are not described.If you intend to use SWT (instead of Swing), the chapters on SWT are good.The chapters on servlet, JSP coding and debugging, war deployment, and Struts introduced available plug-ins have just enough to get you started but it seems that there may be a lot more issues lurking below the covers. The Struts chapter should have started with the Easy Struts plug-in since one of the major features of Eclipse is its code templates. That would have eliminated the duplication of code fragments in this chapter. As one of the reviewers noted, this is *not* a book on Struts programming.The chapters on writing plug-ins seemed adequate.Things I would have liked to have seen in the chapter on 3.0: source formatting, import organization, key bindings, doing everything without a mouse, hovers.Finally, I care a lot about coding style. Books on XP say that a given codebase should like it was written by one person, and my experience has been that code written with this view is much easier to read, maintain, and use if this is the case. Sun has published a style guide, and Eclipse's default code formatting rules follow these guidelines, so I would have liked to have seen the book set a good example and use them as well (I'd also like to see all publishers of Java books make the Sun coding conventions part of their style guides). For example, the opening brace style varied throughout the book. Putting the opening brace on its own line would have made for a good example of how the code formatting function works, but the rest of the examples should have used the style of putting the brace on the end of the line that begins the compound statement. Furthermore, some class names had underscores.Despite the nits, I learned a lot from this book and would recommend it. A new edition written for version 3.1 which resolves the issues I raised would be most welcome!"},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"first of all the book i got (yes i checked the isbn)was only 317 pages and was not subtitled,&quot;A Java Developer's Guide&quot; but instead &quot;Programming Java Applications&quot;.There was less than 20 pages coverage of 3.0. very lightwieght.I wouldn't say this was a book for programmers, but the equivalent of a user's manual for eclipse(eclipse made EZ, or eclipse for VB programmers).The first two chapters(60 pages) is just telling you what the menu items do.

In my concurrent Java programming unit I continued to have problem in getting students to address all issues of import in their assignments. I thought that I should write a progressive series of programs to address one issue at a time. In class we were relying on command line compilation and execution of the Java programs.To develop Java programs, I downloaded Eclipse IDE and started to write programs one project for each set of progressed specifications. Soon I had some 10 projects with 10 sets of codes. Eclipse was great, it allowed me to debug and see activities even in multi-threaded execution of programs. However, I wanted to have some transition among my 10 projects to be smooth. I wanted to use consistent interfaces, shared code for classes and comments. I wanted to learn more on refactoring functionality of the IDE. I bought the book to fill this goal.Have not found much to help my goal but the book has exposed me GUI builder ideas V4ALL. But this project seem to be already gone. SWT was also a new exposure. I have not yet explored it but would it be acceptable replacement for Swing for a university course?Over all the book is nice and easy introduction to using Eclipse IDE but much of what it introduces can easily be learned from the Eclipse help, tutorials and commonsense. It is time that the author be magnanimous and put the book on Web for all Eclipse beginners to read and adapt the tool. Good book but I am not sure if I can ask my students to spend money on purchasing a copy. An update to reflect the current state of the IDE would also be welcome."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"One of the problems with Open Source software is getting good books describing it. Sure it's possible to get documentation on-line, but sometimes there is no substitute in having all the information in one convenient book.

Coverage includes: the Eclipse Java Development Tools and Workbench, Ant, CVS, building Swing apps, SWT, JSP along with a host of other topics."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"If only this book had stayed on course. Chapters one through three are a great introduction to installing Eclipse and using it to work with Java applications.

If I wanted a book on how to develop Struts I would buy Programming Jakarta Struts. I don't need chapter ten to give me a cursory glimpse into Struts programming. Only the first hundred pages are really about Eclipse. Which is a shame because there is so much to say about the Eclipse platform. I can't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"In preparation for a webcast I'm giving this month, I'm working through the book Eclipse by Steve Holzner (O'Reilly). While not perfect, it's a good tool for learning about the package.Chapter list: Essential Eclipse; Java Development; Testing and Debugging; Working in Teams; Building Eclipse Projects Using Ant; GUI Programming: From Applets to Swing; SWT: Buttons, Text, Labels, Lists, Layouts, and Events; SWT: Menus, Toolbars, Sliders, Trees, and Dialogs; Web Development; Developing Struts Applications with Eclipse; Developing a Plug-in: The Plug-in Development Environment, Manifests, and Extension Points; Developing a Plug-in: Creating Editors and Views; Eclipse 3.0; IndexFor the person new to Eclipse, this will do a decent job in getting you started. Up through the Using Ant chapter, the focus is primarily on Eclipse. The examples deal with the package, and that seems to be the primary focus. After that, the style seems to change a bit. The GUI development chapters seem to focus a lot on GUI programming, and then after that's finished, they show you how to do it in Eclipse. Mind you, it's good information, but the focus has shifted. The plug-in chapter gets back to Eclipse as the primary focus again. While there are entire books dedicated to plug-in development, this chapter will get you comfortable with the idea and concepts.So is the book perfect? No. I feel that the material could have been a bit more consistent as to what the foremost goal was... learning the Eclipse platform. But having said that, it still accomplishes the goal of teaching you how Eclipse works in different scenarios. I'd definitely recommend this as an initial Eclipse text for someone."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"Online documentation has its place, but I like books better for learning. I found Eclipse's online doc especially lacking when it comes to *learning* about this complex product. Sure there's a ton of stuff, but most of it just seems to describe the ten's of thousands of options that the tool provides. (Personal Rant: Do we really need all of these options? Can't anyone see that just because you can do something doesn't mean you always should? Can't anyone see that a lot of these options just get in the way of using the product?)There, I feel better now. So when it came time to learn about Eclipse I reached for a book. I can recommend this book because it is good but I can't recommend it because it is getting dated. And that's just the nature of the beast when you write a book about a product as opposed to a technology. (The latter also gets out of date, but not as quickly. Maybe it's because there are less screen shots of actual components.)For the most part the screen shots of the dialogs and menus are still useful, i.e. even though the product's UI has changed you can still easily go from the book to the component you are looking at on the screen. But... well, here are the versions of various products covered in the book versus the versions of these products today:Eclipse 2.1.1 vs. 3.1Ant 1.5.3 vs. 1.6.5Tomcat 4.1.29 vs. 5.5Struts 1.1 vs. 1.2.7Another thing I did not like: they used \\"poor programming practices\\" in their chapters on JSPs and servlets. For example, in JSPs they used scriptlets and in servlets they output a bunch of HTML. I don't like it when a book does stuff \\"we're not supposed to do anymore.\\""},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"I bought this book and have been making my way through it to teach myself about Eclipse. I did fine for the first five chapters, but after that the trail grows cold because the book is based on Eclipse prior to the 3.0 and later releases.

So I gave up after chapter five."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"If you use Eclipse or any of the expanding list of products based on Eclipse, this book should be on your short list. It is easy to read and follow as the author explains in detail each of the core features which are common across all derivations of Eclipse. The book is geared toward Java developers and will be of limited use to developers who wish to use Eclipse for other languages (which the author essentially admits on page one). It lives up to the claim found in the preface: &quot;It's a programmer-to-programmer book, written to bring you up to speed in Eclipse without wasting time.&quot;If you are new to Eclipse, I would definitely recommend this book. It's a great &quot;bring you up to speed&quot; book. There are a lot of screenshots and code examples to move you through each of the basic features: how to create, debug, test (with JUnit), use source control (with CVS) and build (with Ant).Depending on how familiar you are with Eclipse (I have been using Eclipse for a couple years), this may not be the book for you. The first hundred pages or so will likely not be anything new - although, I did have an &quot;Oh, yeah - Scrapbook Pages!&quot; moment. If you are interested in using SWT, Tomcat, Struts or Eclipse plug-in development, keep in mind this is more of a &quot;bring you up to speed&quot; than a detailed &quot;how to&quot; description of these topics."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"The first 3 chapters were quite good. It might be a good book if it was updated. There have been many changes since Eclipse 3.0 and the screens are different. Some of the stuff I could figure out and was stuck after that.

There are better free tutorials on the web."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"I've used big time and expensive IDEs in my time, Together Control Center to name just one, and I was excited to finally get Eclipse and begin learning it. I always look for an O'Reilly book on a subject first because they are usually really good. This book, although good, misses the point of the title of the book. It should have been titled \\"Intro to Web Programming with an Introduction to Eclipse\\".Another reviewer pointed out that the first three chapters covers how to use Eclipse. The rest concentrate on actually using Eclipse to do each chapter's small projects - GUI, Web, and plugins.I was looking for a book that covered Eclipse in total, how to use it, the neat stuff, everything that Eclipse has to offer. This book doesn't even tell me how to makea bookmark in Eclipse. I saw that in the Eclipse Cookbook TOC at O'Reilly.The 3.0 coverage is minimal. This book is not about 3.0. That is to be expected since software changes faster than authors can learn the new versions and write the words.This is a good book if you want a very gentle intro to Eclipse, but don't look to become an Eclipse GURU from it."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"I'm the type of guy who, until I read this book, used a text editor and the command line for all of my coding. I had never gotten to really know an IDE because of the documentation. Either the examples were too simple to hold my attention, or I gave up after not understanding what was going on. However, Steve Holzner's \\"Eclipse\\" was right on the money. The book flowed very well. Its pace seemed to be tailored to me.The book begins with the essentials of Eclipse. I really liked how the author explained what each component was before I actually ran the program and was bombarded with windows. Next the reader is taken on a guided journey though creating an Eclipse project. The goal was to make the classic \\"Hello, World!\\" program using Eclipse. Wonderful features were introduced in a logical, well thought out order that made writing the \\"Hello, World!\\" program seem exciting. The book also shows how to deal with typos and mistakes. The essential skills that followed are very useful in the day to day use of Eclipse.The debugging chapter was nice too. The reader is given a short program with a subtle bug in it. The reader is guided though the debugging process. There are many screen shots and code listings that make this chapter especially easy to follow along with. I found the chapter on web development interesting too. It went through all of the steps required to code, test, debug and deploy java servlets and java beans. It was very indepth and included some good example code as well.This review isn't all praise, there was one part of the book that I thought it could do without. I think that it could do without some of the sections on graphical user interfaces. The GUI programming chapter had some useful information about a plug-in for Eclipse that allows for visual GUI design, but it is preceded by 10 pages about using the AWT and swing. The book should be more about using Eclipse and less about using Java. The book also devotes a lot of paper to using the SWT.I really enjoyed reading this book. The writing style of the author was superb. I was never bored or lost while I was reading it. It definitely gave me the skills to effectively use Eclipse. The book also goes into areas of java that someone who has taken only one or two courses in Java would enjoy learning about such as debugging, GUI design, and web applications. I would recommend this book to anyone with at least 6 months of java experience."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"I was just dropped into a position where I'm using Eclipse, Java, and Tomcat, and this book is PERFECT.

It also has a good chapter on Ant (which is a &quot;make&quot; replacement) and a great chapter introducing Struts development. With this book I also learned how I can control the Tomcat server right from within Eclipse using a free plugin for Eclipse. If you're in a similar situation where you have a job where you need to learn Eclipse quickly, then this book is for you. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Eclipse","review":"Eclipse certainly breath new life into IDE based software development. Its capabilities are so impressive that even die-hard VIM developer like myself switch to use it as the main Java development tool. After using Eclipse for about a month, I am still running into new impressive functions. I wanted to find out all the cool stuffs Eclipse offers, thus I turned to this book by Steve Holzner.I would say that this book is most suitable for those who have heard of eclipse but never had a chance to really use it. The first 5 chapters cover the daily operations a Java developer would do: coding, testing, debugging, committing, and building. Reading these chapters the reader can get the basic idea of how Eclipse differs from traditional IDEs, especially how well Eclipse supports refactoring, unit testing, and team development. For me, having used Eclipse for a month, these are all essential stuffs that I have already mastered. I was hoping to find out more tricks and secrets that can further improving the development process. For instance, I discovered code template the other day, which allows you to insert frequently used code snippets very quickly. I later find that this useful feature was introduced in page 59 of the book, which out any headings.Chapters 6 up to 12 discuss specific development scenarios, including developing Swing applications, Struts applications, and plug-ins. These are interesting chapters to understand the concepts of plugins in Eclipse. They also introducted plugins that are quite useful, such as the V4ALL GUI designer, the Sysdeo Tomcat plugin, and the Easy Struts plugin. If you are planning to develop based on these frameworks, good for you. In addition, I would recommend trying the XML Buddy plugin (for editing XML files), Spindle (for developing Tapestry applications), and Jetty Launcher (for quick web application development).Overall, the book can be a good starting point if you cannot find any Eclipse users around you. Otherwise, spending some time watching your friend perform magic with Eclipse and then start doing it yourself!"},{"Title":"XSLT 2.0 Web Development","review":"If to try to classify this book, I would put it in 'how to's' category, rather than 'tutorials'. The book summarizes author's significant experience with building web sites that are sanely organized and easy to maintain. The approach he advocates is somewhat minimalist: XML to markup the content, XSLT to transform it into HTML and to perform other auxiliary tasks -- 'The Pragmatic Programmer' followers will appreciate this. It should be noted that the content is mostly static or treated as such; how to fetch data out of a database and to build an XML DOM/SAX representation is left for other numerous books to ponder. While XSLT is the main subject, the scope of the book is broader. It includes developing an XML vocabulary for the site, choosing a schema language and writing a schema (here Schematron gets special attention), designing stylesheets for transformation, including tasks like checking files existence and generating images via extension functions written in Java. Finally, there is a section about batch processing with XSLT for automatic generation/regeneration of the whole site. Every task is illustrated with examples, generic enough so that you can modify them for your own project.Orthogonal to what has been explained is the question of how it has been explained. The author's writing style is dense, even dry, the text is packed with information. It took me probably three times longer to read this book than it does usually, as there was no superfluous verbiage that could be quickly glanced over. The book doesn't make dull reading, though. Not only is it highly informative, it also gives aesthetical pleasure of a well-crafted work. The concepts are thoughtfully illustrated and made very clear; terminology is used precisely and consistently. Developers will appreciate an honest, 'no buzzwords, no marketing hype' approach, and accuracy in every small detail."},{"Title":"XSLT 2.0 Web Development","review":"There are numerous good books on XML, where often these pertain to using XML for data storage or interchange. But when one wants to derive browser viewable HTML from XML, then XSLT is used to make the transformation. For XSLT, there have also been books describing it. But thus far, most were about version 1.0. Plus, the HTML output might often be considered small scale. That is, a single page or a few pages.This book differs in two important ways. Firstly, Kirsanov deals with the recently approved XSLT 2.0 and the accompanying XPath 2.0. There have been many improvements in functionality, which he explains cogently.But, more importantly, he expands the scope of the discussion about the HTML output. No longer are we just designing a few pages. He imagines that we are now responsible for an entire website. It could be a personal one, or a corporate site of any size. This necessitates careful attention to designing the architecture of the site and the organising of the source XML documents. For example, he recommends always have a master document, listing all the pages of a site, a &quot;site directory&quot; in XML. Throughout the text, he gives numerous practical suggestions like this, that should be effective on any website.Just as valuable, and perhaps more so to some, are the copious code examples, liberally embedded in the narrative. Gives flesh to the ideas. You can take these as inspiration, or even as starting templates, for your own website."},{"Title":"XSLT 2.0 Web Development","review":"The &quot;XSLT 2.0&quot; is in the title (but only as an adjective, the noun being &quot;Web Development&quot;) because I use XSLT 2.0 idioms throughout - the book is filled with code examples that are only possible in 2.0. The book is not focused on XSLT 2.0 as such, it is focused on its practical use. I strived to present the right mix of theory and examples - the mix I would have enjoyed myself when I just started learning to use XSLT for web development."},{"Title":"XSLT 2.0 Web Development","review":"I bought this book, in part, based on the positive reviews I've read here. But in actually reading the book, I've found that far too much time is spent on the Schematron rule-based schema validation mechanism. Kirsanov evangelizes Schematron with the fervor of a religious zealot. By the middle of the second chapter (the chapters are long--that's okay) I was already tired of hearing how Schematron is the best thing since sliced bread. I'm not particularly interested in using Schematron (though I see how the hybrid XSDL/Schematron approach could be valuable) because I'm already committed to using XSDL schemas. Unfortunately, the examples in this book use Schematron rather than XSDL, so the value of the examples is limited.BTW, the schematron URL in the book (http://xml.ascc.net/xml/resource/schematron/schematron.net) is 404, but I found some stuff at http://xml.ascc.net/resource/schematron/schematron.html and http://www.schematron.com. Honestly the content there seemed pretty cheesy, despite the fact that ISO has supposedly approved Schematron as a standard."},{"Title":"XSLT 2.0 Web Development","review":"This book has been a very interesting reading for me since it covers a lot of topics in a different way than usual. It's not a book for beginners, it does not teach you how to use XSLT from scratch neither teaches you how to build a web application if you have never done one. This book serve for mid-expert web application designer and builder in understanding the beauty,and the need, to learn xml and xslt.By reading this book you learn to appreciate the importance of xml and how you can effectively use it in your web application. The book requires a basic knowledge of xml and xslt, but if you have already use it, even not much,you will learn that you cannot totally miss the knowledge of this important topic.While reading this book my feeling has been to run on a store andbuy more dedicated books of all the topics that are discussed throughout this book. Definitely what most have impressed me are three different topics well covered on this book: Schematron, XSLT java extension and Cocoon. I feel more confidentand sure that I need to get e dapper understanding of these three topics, and this book gave me the right flavour for them. I recommend this book for both developers but most for designers that need to migrate from traditional web applicationto a complete xml and xslt web applications.Max Pellizzarohttp://www.maxpellizzaro.com"},{"Title":"XSLT 2.0 Web Development","review":"XSLT 2.0 Web Development&quot; by Dmitry Kirsanov, teaches a system of transforming semantically structured content into browser-ready HTML, including the proper separation of content from presentation, structuring the content into &quot;cleanly separated semantic layers&quot;, developing a XML vocabulary for each layer, validating the XML and content structure, using XSLT to transform the XML content to HTML, and integrating the transformation system with web development frameworks and development tools.As described in the introduction, the author suggests readers should have a basic understanding of XML syntax and terms, as well as &quot;know some XSLT and especially XPath&quot;. Before reading this book, this reviwer was comfortable reading, editing and creating XML documents, but I couldn't (and still can't) write an XML DTD. Also, the only idea I had about XSLT was that it's used to transform XML documents into HTML. That's it. With those basic introductory understandings, I had no problems following the well-structured and well-explained lessons throughout the book, as well as applying those lessons while developing a real-life web site.This 406 page book consists of seven chapters containing plenty of well-organized and well-used text and diagrams, example code showing &quot;all aspects of an XML-to-HTML transformation&quot;, and plenty of screenshots. The contents also include a discussion of the basic premises of XML, explanations and examples of XML source definitions including schema and regulations, a Schematron schema for document validation, XSLT extensions including new additions to XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0, coverage of tools available to assist developers, and a chapter on integrating an XML/XSLT system into a web server setup, the bulk of which is devoted to Apache Cocoon.This book and the topics it teaches are not for the feeble minded. Reading it while falling asleep in bed is not recommended - you won't really get it. I would recommend this book to anyone concerned with organizing web site content into meaningful semantic layers, well-separated from presentation and business logic, while creating a system that is easier to understand and maintain than many web site projects I've run across."},{"Title":"XSLT 2.0 Web Development","review":"To get the most out of this book you need to ignore the 2.0 in the title. The book is only incidentally about XSLT 2.0, and it does a great job covering modern XSLT web development. I'm actually serious in my advice, if you just concentrate on the 2.0 portion of the book you will be disappointed. You need to assess the value of the book as a whole. And that value is great. Primarily because of chapters like the first chapter which dig into how XSLT can be used to revolutionize the generation of static and dynamic websites through XML data abstraction and the use of XSLT stylesheets.A couple of years back XSLT was the great hope for replacing JSP with an abstract interface that would generate code for both HTML and WAP. That never materialized, mainly because server side technologies were too slow and client side XSLT wasn't universally supported. In hindsight it's obvious that this JSP replacement mindset was in error. This book is a complete re-assesment of XSLT in the web development context and provides a number of options and architectures to address different performance and abstraction concerns.If you would consider yourself a 'web designer' I don't think this book is for you. It has too much about XML schema design and not enough about the mechanics of XSLT conversion. This book is better suited to senior developers and architects who want a novel and intelligent approach to construction of static and dynamic web sites, using XML and XSLT.For XSLT advocates who feel that their favorite technology was miscast and sent out to pasture years early, this book is for you. Let's hope Addison-Wesley marketing can find that sweet spot to get this book out there.

Each chapter is broken up into multiple \\"mini-chapters\\" that cover the subject matter quite well. Having said that, I think that it's important to know exactly what you're getting here. This is not a 1000 page tutorial and reference guide to all that is XML and XSLT. In fact, if this is your first exposure to XSLT technology, you might actually find yourself a bit frustrated. This is not so much of a \\"how to\\" as it is a \\"why to\\"...The author spends a lot of time explaining XML design and schemas, and how an accurate schema can make the difference between a good and bad application. Once the proper schema is established, then he covers how XSLT can make the XML transform into a clear and well-structured site. Really good stuff, but you probably won't learn all there is to know about XSLT by reading this book. I actually see this as a good \\"second\\" XSLT title for a developer once they have mastered the language and syntax fundamentals.If you're looking to learn XSLT, you may want to choose a different title.

There are additional bits ad pieces put in (in the book the son is gay, whereas in the film he is just a bit effeminate) which make it more thought-provoking, but not too serious.Marter skilfully captures the comedy and mayhem of the film, without losing pace.

For the death of Edmund Pargetter meant that Edmund's rogue of a cousin, Lucas would now be the new Marquess of Worthington. A bit of a rake, Lucas had been shipped off to the navy 11 years ago when his indiscretions became too much for the family and the little community of Four Corners. Now the gentleman, who has risen to the rank of captain by his own merits, has come home to a family in shambles and an estate in disrepair. Will Lucas be able to unite his family and turn the estate around? Or will he, too, turn out to be a scoundrel just like his cousin, Edmund? Penelope is all for giving Lucas a chance to prove that he has changed and to lend a helping hand in establishing him with his wary tenants and a gossip hungry community of, but is she willing to allow the rakish, handsome and charming man access to her heart? For Lucas shows every sign of being quite the interested parti, but can Penelope who has so many responsibilities (taking care of her nephew and niece, the estate and the tenants) afford to take a chance on a one time rogue?I really liked &quot;A Slight Change of Plans.&quot; The novel had two main subplots: Lucas's attempts to woo Penelope, and the murder investigation. And I thought that Glenda Garland did a rather good job of merging these two subplots so that they became one seamless whole, and for allowing both plots to develop at a more sedate speed. The more sedate pacing allowed for the authour to show readers why Penelope needed to be careful and wary about her feelings for Lucas in very credible manner, and also allowed for readers to get a wider picture of how things stood and unfolded in the small community of Four Corners where many villagers were related to each other in one way or the other. And while I did think that the resolution of the mystery subplot left a little something to be desired, I did like the quiet little romance that blossomed between Penelope and Lucas. &quot;A Slight Change of Plans&quot; may not be to everyone's taste, but I certainly enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"A Slight Change Of Plans (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Yes this first Regency by Glenda Garland was a pleasure - a balanced combination of romance and mystery.Penelope Lindon is sketching the apparently sleeping Edmund, Lord Worthington when she discovers he is in fact dead. Most unpleasant to say the least.Edmund's heir is his cousin Lucas, a naval Captain who had been forced into the service by his family, after some youthful wild oat sowing scandals in the neighbourhood. He did not want to be in the navy, but found his feet - now he does not want to be land-locked. He is especially hamstrung by the reputation of his youth, which has made him into a rake to be avoided at all costs. This is not helped by his cousin's own very slimy behaviour towards every female in the district, as well as his delinquencies regarding the estate. A tough introduction, especially when the neighbourhood gossips are out in full force!Penelope is by way of being his greatest help, very much against her will - but not her attraction to him. She has been allegedly mourning the death of her betrothed some years ago at Salamanca, while also looking after her dead sister's twins, ruthlessly left in her care by her brother-in-law. Her status as permanently bereaved is however a smokescreen to protect herself from men.These two are believable characters, drawn with enough depth to give us insight into them. Penelope is extremely wary of Lucas, due to his shockingly over the top reputation and her own resistance to the pull of his charm. Every woman appears to her to be all too easily mown down by his smile and easy manner.Their mutual game of one step forward and two steps back is not too overdone to become annoying.This is pulled along irresistably by the necessity of finding the murderer - as the neighbourhood has viciously decided Lucas is prime suspect (after all one vice muct breed all the rest).One oddity, however, was the way Penelope's parents were portayed. The father was not there at all, while the mother was presented as lost in a book all the time. Most odd - and made one wonder just how did Penelope grow up so sensibly in the first place.A good, pleasantly enjoyable read - not a nasty jolt anywhere regarding modernity."},{"Title":"A Slight Change Of Plans (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"There have been more than a few books bearing the category title of Romance published lately that combine other elements with the romance. A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS is one of the better examples of this trend, mixing a strong mystery plot along with a good bit of village life into the plot. I'd not read anything by this author previously, but will willingly read her other books.One forgets sometimes about the deadly effects of village gossip on the inhabitants of such a small geographical area, in the days before radio, television or telephone. Many a reputation was totally ruined by word-of-mouth, whether made-up or factual stories.If I had to find a quibble here, it might be that Penelope comes across as just too good and nice and sweet. Too nearly perfect. Of course, the cover is another problem, but that one isn't the author's fault!Neither of those comments should discourage any reader, however. This really is an excellent, well-written, interesting and enjoyable tale of everyday life in a small village and the surrounding areas, where an unlikeable man meets an untimely death, and what happens next to his family and his neighbors, in an attempt to find out who was responsible."},{"Title":"A Slight Change Of Plans (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Lucas Pargetter, former Naval Captain, is the newly appointed Lord Worthington.

She is also wary of Lucas (Lord Worthington to her) because of his tarnished reputation. Penelope was the one who discovered the dead body of the previous Lord Worthington.Of course, the story is much more in-depth than this. In fact, the &quot;mystery&quot; plot was rather entertaining. As a mystery, I'd give it 3 stars. There were plenty of twists, and Glenda Garland managed to bring some new things to the table. However, I thought the book was overloaded with characters. There were a few dialogue sessions where I thought I was reading a watered-down screenplay of Gosford Park. I lost interest a few times, and I had to re-read a few things.As a romance, this book falls short. There is little-to-no chemistry between the characters. Their dialogue has minimal spark. They had forged a solid friendship, but I don't know if it went much further than that.If you like mysteries, you might want to pick this up. However...

The area still is known for making baskets and pottery. Coiled or plaited or very old twined, the baskets take more time to make.They also are one of the strongest parts of southwestern cultures, now and back when. Specifically, Hopi indians draw on the oldest known tradition, going back 1,500 years. Generally, southwestern baskets have been popular outside the area, since 1821. The opening of the Santa Fe trail started up some heavy duty trading with the world outside the southwest.No energy- or time-saving equipment is used, not now or then. But some modern tools can be used. Helpers are tin lids, scissors, pruning shears, knives, fingernail clippers and awls.But baskets still are made from many of the same old plant parts. Some of the materials are yucca, horsehair or cattail stems for coiling; sunflower seeds for black dye; sumac bush for twining; kaolin clay for natural white to show better; and alder bark for tan, red or brown dyes. Finding them is getting harder, what with plants losing ground to highways, subdivisions and hard-to-predict weather.It impresses me that each southwestern culture keeps up a different way to start and end baskets. So finely twined baskets are western Apache. They still are needed in the sunrise ceremony, for a girl's coming-of-age. Red willow bowl baskets are made from sacred Rio Grande plants, for Pueblo basket dances. They often hang on the wall, as decoration, between uses. And sumac splints sewn on a triangular 3-rod foundation, with a false braid or herringbone finish, go into Navajo wedding baskets.Also interestingly, baskets, like other parts of southwestern cultures, tie past, present and future together. This happens with traditional designs. So one favorite design of first man placing stars keeps alive part of the Navajo Genesis. Likewise, another favorite design of a turtle surrounded by clouds and thunder calls to mind the highly successful Hopi rain ceremony.This well-written book gets to the point, with helpful comments from the artists and with pretty pictures. There's space for it on the shelf with Kathryn N Bernick's BASKETRY AND CORDAGE FROM HESQUIAT HARBOR, Mary Dodds Schlick's COLUMBIA RIVER BASKETRY, and Rachel Nash Law and Cynthia W Taylor's APPALACHIAN WHITE OAK BASKETMAKING."},{"Title":"Indian Basketry Artists of the Southwest: Deep Roots, New Growth (Contemporary Indian Artists)","review":"In 1997 the School of American Research organized a meeting in Santa Fe of ten currently-active basketmakers (8 women and 2 men), each of whom were also commissioned to make a basket for SAR's permanent collection.

One of SAR's Contemporary Indian Artists series, the book includes a nice capsule biography of each artist and photos of their work, including the commissioned basket.

It presents the theory that there was a child born to Adam and Eve prior to the Fall. It's a feasible idea: upon banishment from the Garden of Eden woman's misery in childbirth was said to be \\"increased,\\" which leaves it open as to whether Eve had had children without pain prior to that time. After banishment, a child remains in the Garden, unpunished for the sins of his parents. The message, I think, is that God is both punitive AND merciful. I, personally, love the idea. And I read the first part of this book with relish, absorbing the color of the words and the sweetness of the retelling and reshaping of this ages-old story.Sadly, however, once Part I is complete, the story becomes tedious, and the Traveler (the child of Eden) becomes preachy, all goodness and light, and syrupy. He travels through time trying to correct the hearts and minds of men, much the way Sam did in Quantum Leap....only the Traveler doesn't ever experience the real highs and lows of human life. And that can make a reader tired. His only drama is reinforcement of what one already knows....God is watching over you.I would have so much preferred that the story ended at the end of Part I. That first part made me THINK! It made me ask WHAT IF? And, as far as I've always heard, THAT'S where you want the book to end. You want to leave the reader wanting more."},{"Title":"Alone in Eden","review":"Reviewed by Jeanette Cain for Reader Views (7/06)\\"Alone in Eden\\" is a great adventure story made believable by the attention to details. The story begins in the beautifully serene Garden of Eden. A son of Adam and Eve named the 'traveler\\" and his dog Zas journey through generations of time. The pair witnesses the banishment of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. The traveler and his dog travel through wars and famine due to the horrific murder of Abel, by his brother Cain. An angel appears and speaks to the traveler. The angel warns of the future effects on the world many generations ahead, all starting with Cain's choice to follow evil. The story goes on with the traveler learning what good and evil does to man. The Faith of the traveler is tested throughout his journeys. Angels appear throughout the book. The angels help him understand the ways of human nature.I liked the smooth flow of the writing. I felt as if I was walking along with the traveler and his dog. I could clearly imagine the sights and sounds. I could feel the texture of the animals. Even when a storm was being described, I could hear the thunder. The best part of the book was the writing style of author, Stephen R. Pastore. The way many Bible stories were woven in was flawless. There are glimpses of many people from the Bible. The story includes the giants and angels that are found in the Bible.I recommend this book for young teens and adults. Although fictional, this book is a great help in understanding the Bible story of Cain and Abel. The ending is a must read. I will be looking forward to more books written by Stephen R. Pastore.Received book free of charge"},{"Title":"Alone in Eden","review":"Alone in Eden speculates on the life of a man known simply as the Traveler - Adam and Eve's first son. Pastore starts with the idea that Adam and Eve had a son before the Fall. And this makes sense. After all, there was the command to \\"be fruitful and multiply,\\" (Genesis 1:22, to be precise). Why should we think that they didn't do that before Eve decided to eat some forbidden fruit?And really, the only argument that can be made scripturally against this notion is the argument from silence -- there's no mention of a son before Cain and Abel. But there's an indication, however slight, that Eve knew something about childbirth before the Fall. God's curse to her doesn't say that childbirth will hurt; it says the pain in childbirth will be increased. So it is possible that Eve knew what childbirth was like before the fall.Of course, such speculation is interesting philosophically and theologically - was Adam and Eve's original sin shared by the son/daughter who was already there? If not, is there a race of \\"perfect men\\" that are descended from that offspring? AND is that offspring still alive today, having not been cursed with death? But does it work as fiction? Absolutely. The book is a fascinating look at mankind through the eyes of someone who did not sin - in fact, who seems to not have the capacity to sin.Theologically, I did have some disagreements with the book. I thought it ironic that the Traveler disobeys his father Adam very early in the book, but that is not considered a sin, while Adam and Eve's disobedience is sin. Pastore has a unique viewpoint of the stories in Genesis, one that Christians of most stripes will not necessarily share. I was at once relieved and disappointed that Pastore didn't choose to include any interaction with Christ in the book -- though, from a classic Christian perspective, the Traveler must be Christ -- the only sinless man. And the book concludes with a slight teaser, as if there may be more in the offering - \\"I have much to do.\\"The only real, major drawback to this book is the cover art. While those who are less prudish than I am may have no problem with the image of a nude, bound man, I found myself unable to take this one out in public. That aside, it's an outstanding book, and I found myself enjoying it tremendously - often in spite of myself."},{"Title":"Alone in Eden","review":"Pastore's Alone In Eden is sure to generate one of those cult followings. How could a book scrutinizing God's purpose and other events of the bible not? It's a bodl move, but done with extreme care for literature.In brief, Adam and his dog Zas walk though Eden meeting a large cast of characters (Cain and Abel, etc) and questioning their motivations--but with a sense of blissful ignorance that lends itself toward satire. Adam has a sort of clean slate here, so it's kind of like a child asking what death is. It may not work for the dvout, but I can'thelp but htink many have asked the same questions. Pastore obviously has studied history and religion to a large extent, maybe more than most people, and sees the contradictions inbetween the line.The writing itself is beautiful, fresh, and not dumbed down in any way. The descriptions of the lands--obviously generated from a combination of bible text and what pastore assumes Eden to look like (and it certaily comes off the page as somethign ethereal) are very vivid.This is a must for anyone who's every questioned just what all those stories in the bible really mean, and why so many of them contadict the others. Wait till the bible thumpers get wind of this one."},{"Title":"Alone in Eden","review":"A friend gave me this book. I had no idea what it was about. It's the story of Adam walking through Eden, reinventing and questioning sections of the bible. I admit I'm ignorant to some of what was being discussed, and who some of the people were, but it was fascinating. The language is poetic, the settings are vivid, and Adam and his little dog are more dimensional characters than in most books I've read. I can see this being a very controversial book in time, especially among people who read religious and spiritual stories. Although i should point out its not preachy in any way, is more satirical, and in fact is a moving story I could see made into a movie. I read Pastore's bio and apprently he is a leading expert on classic literature...and it shows. This is classically written."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"I have read - Otto of the Silver Hand - two times. Once to myself and then to my three oldest children ages 9,8,6. This book is as captivating and beautiful as a knight in shining armor tale can be. It's a tale of love, courage, good and evil. The love begins between husband and wife with as much fervor and honesty as is felt in the movie &quot;Braveheart&quot; (Mel Gibson). Conrad, the baron of the Castle Drakenhausen whose love is so great for the Baroness Matilda, takes their son Otto to the &quot;White Cross on the Hill&quot; soon after his birth. There his good, holy and wise Uncle Otto (Abbot Otto) resides. You see, Baroness Matilda has died at Otto's birth and Baron Conrad knows his cold castle and his bitter feudal world are not suited for the raising of his child. Young Otto developes a pure, simple and docile attitude in the 12 years he lives at the monastery. His father comes to reclaim him at this point and here the story begins to unfold.This is so beautifully written! It's wonderfully suspenceful (how Otto escapes from his cold, dark dungeon when he is near death; how his father gives his life in the end for that of his son and the &quot;faithful few&quot; who remained with him till the bitter end. I am reminded of a thought which often passes through my mind - No greater love has man than he who lays down his life for another-We do have one compliant about the telling of this tale...we wish there would have been more to the ending. It ended too abruptly in our opinion. We wanted more. However, we were left for many days reliving the book over and over in our thoughts and conversations. The spirit of great love from a man to his wife, a father to his son was refreshing. The story was indeed uplifting to the mind, heart and soul of myself and my children. What better tale to tell...to teach love in its sometimes harsh reality!! Death because of love!!This book is too beautiful to miss!!

Otto of the Silver Hand is no exception, and is rather a devation from his normal books. Unlike Robin Hood and His Merry Men, his King Arthur books, or Men in Iron, this book has few battle scenes and is mostly about character development and the setting of the Middle Ages. It tells the story of Otto, the young son of a robber baron, who grows up in a monestary and is thrust out into the world. He finds it a cruel place, and much evil comes to him. Meanwhile, Pyle is through the whole book trying to show that strength of character is stronger than strength of sword, and that the silver hand is more desirable than the iron fist. It is a wonderful book, with wonderful illustrations by Pyle himself. I definitely recommend this, as well as Pyle other works.Overall grade: A."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"Other copies have wonderful illustrations done by the author but this printing looks like it was done on a semi-pro press and there's none of the great illustrations by author Howard Pyle (we checked out a Dover edition from the library before we ordered this and our kids loved how the pictures dramatized the story as it unfolded).So, if you order the book that has the orange cover with the cheap looking illustration of a boy knight on a horse on the front, you are getting a quick print job with no illustrations! In our case, the cutting of the paper is off at the bottom as well. Not even a decent rectangle - instead of cutting it at a 90 degree angle, they thought 85-ish would be good.

However, I was unable to tell whether it was the time of Rudolph I (1273-1291) or Rudolph II (1576-1612). At first I thought that it might be the latter, but after reading the book I decided that it could be the former. Baron Conrad Vuelph of Castle Drachenhausen is one of the robber barons of medieval Germany who makes his living robbing the merchants who were passing through the forests near his land. For years, his family has been in a blood feud with that of Baron Frederick Roderburg from the nearby Castle Trutz-Drachen.One day, Baron Conrad takes his men out to raid a caravan. His wife, Baroness Mathilda, pleads with him not to do it but give up stealing from others. He almost listens but finally goes. Unfortunately, the merchants had asked for safety from Baron Frederick who gives Conrad what appears to be a mortal wound. When he is brought home for dead and seen by his wife, she faints and a little later, after giving birth to their child whom she names Otto after her brother, dies from the shock. But Conrad is not dead. After he recovers, he takes the child to the monastery of the White Cross at St. Michaelsburg, under the care of Abbott Otto, his brother-in-law, where the child spends the next twelve years.In the meantime, Conrad takes his revenge by killing Frederick. Then, when little Otto is twelve, his father comes to take him home and raise him to be his successor. However, when his father leaves to swear allegiance to the new Emperor Rudolph, Frederick's son, Baron Henry, attacks the castle and kidnaps Otto, cutting off his right hand so that he could never wield a sword against a Roderburg, to get back at Conrad. However, Henry's daughter Pauline falls in love with Otto and helps him escape. But Henry and his men give chase. Will he find safety? And, though fitted with a silver hand to replace the one he lost in captivity, will he grow up to continue the fighting or choose a different life?While this book was originally written in 1888 about a time several hundreds of years before, it is a timeless story that still has appeal for those who enjoy reading about the Middle Ages. Like those by G. A. Henty, Pyle's books emphasize the development of character in spite of difficult circumstances. The courage of the stern but loving father which allows Otto's safe return to the monks who place him under the emperor's protection and the loyalty of Conrad's men in risking their lives to help him save the boy are both very touching. Other editions of the book exist, but the one from Dover Publications includes the 55 original illustrations by the author.

This isn't it. If you want a fun story with swoopingly goopy prose and fantastic illustrations, this is it. I wouldn't call on Otto to save me from a burning building, but I like his drooling story and Howard Pyle's ridiculously awesome sketches."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"...but the story is boring. The best part about the book is the title. There are some good adventure bits, but Otto himself gets to do nothing but sit around and suffer, which is a shame since he has the coolest name. And then there are the tedious descriptions, which maybe seemed interesting to past generations who didn't know any better. I'm probably being too hard on Pyle, because I know he can do better than this. But in any event, trust me: you can safely skip this book."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"Otto of the Silver Hand is a very good book. It is about a boy named Otto, the son of Baron Conrad. The Baron is a very cruel ruler who, whenever the castle needs something, just gets some of his men and they raid the city stealing whatever they want or need. But after Otto's mother dies his father brings him to the monastery and gives him to the monks to bring little Otto up.In the monastery Otto lives an innocent and happy life. He does not know anything about life outside of the monastery. But when Otto is 12 his father comes back to claim him.Soon the baron's city is raided and Otto is captured! Will Otto get free and return to his father? But is his father even still alive? Read this book and find out!I would recommend this book to people that are 8 or older. It is pretty innocent although there are a couple battles, and it also has a kind of sad ending. But overall it is a very good book, especially if you are interested in the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"This book is an exciting glimpse into the time of robbers barons, when alliances were played out in the lives of people as the pawns in a game. Otto the son of Baron Conrad, loses his mother at birth and is taken by his father to live with the monks at Michaelsburg. Years later, when Baron Conrad retrieves Otto, the young Otto learns of the world, he who has lived his life behind the protective walls of the monastery, innocent to the violence & cruelty beyond those walls. Despite the brutality to which he is treated, his heart & soul adhere to the doctrines of grace and forgiveness, ultimately producing the new crest for his family which reads, \\"Better a hand of silver than a hand of iron\\".This is entirely appropriate to read to younger children as Howard Pyle is delicate with even the most brutal and distressing parts of the story. Something which more current authors oould learn from! Another great recommendation from Carole Joy Seid - thank you!Read and enjoy the fabulous illustrations. They are great to enlarge and have the children color with colored pencils."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"Otto of the Silver Hand was originally published in 1888 - and I am amazed that the content within this novel continues to be relevant in today's society. This story is set in medieval Germany when castles, feuds, barons, knights, kidnapping, soldiers, and rescues were common. Violence, revenge, hatred are all themes that continue to permeate within our society. Yet, in both the past and present we can also find humility, gentleness, love, sacrifice and forgiveness. The traits that little Otto possesses will encourage children to see the good and evil in their world and strive to have a positive outlook on life, even when experiencing turmoil within ourselves. Otto's gracious and forgiving nature will inspire the best in all who read this novel."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"This was a wonderful little book, beautifully written, and a wonderful redemptive story. I am only surprised that this is not commonly cited as a children's classic.

Makes me want to read more by Howard Pyle."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"I think that this book was very exciting and very fun to read. It had excitment and a very good plot too. But the book was too short and didn't enough detail to enjoy it very much. But this was an EXTREMLY good book. I think that some parts are a little bit gruesome for kids under 8 yrs of age."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"for the student that is studying middle ages. A story of loss, revenge, and forgiveness. We read this together as a family for our unit study on the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"I've seen Otto of the Silver Hand recommended by many who advocate \\"living books\\" or quality reading for children. But, I must say in the end I was underwhelmed. The story wasn't *bad*; I just didn't find it to be that engaging. It came across to me like a simplistic fairy tale (minus any magic), and those just aren't my style. I'm not a fan of melodrama: the wife that, seeing her injured husband badly injured and thinking him dead, lives just long enough to deliver their child before dying. Or the children (age 12ish) that meet a few times, vow to marry each other when they grow up, and then when they see each other again for the first time 8 years later, that's apparently still the intention. It just really does read like a fairy tale.Part of the simplistic, overly dramatic feel was probably also in part due to the fact that it's a rather short book. My book has 170 pages, but many of those are full-page illustrations (and the blank back side of the page), and the text is large and freely spaced. Without the illustrations, it could have comfortably been under 100 pages.Plus, Otto was a very meek character, and I don't mean that in a positive humble way but in a wishy-washy way. He comes across as ethereal, and like he's supposed to be too good for this cruel world and so on.Still, a child will learn a lot about how harsh life was during this time period and about monasteries and knights, and it's hard to find good books about the dark ages. If you can pick this book up used for several dollars, it's worth a homeschooling family's purchase. Or, if you like dramatic fairy tale-type stories, it might even be worth a bit more. I wouldn't, however, consider this book a must-read. I read Howard Pyle's Men of Iron a couple years back, and though I don't remember it exceedingly well, I know that I had a much better impression of it."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"I first read this story when I was in late high school, early uni. As an illustration student I was mightily intrigued by Pyle's Durer-esque artwork, especially as I was (and still am) a drawer of pen and ink knights in armour.Durer's influence is very strong here and if you know his work, you can play 'spot the engraving' all through the book. This is not to say Pyle was copying necessarily, it's more of a homage.As for the yarn, well, I was a bit disappointed. If like me, you love Conan the Barbarian stories, Fritz Leiber, grumpy old Michael Moorcock, or stories actually written back in the medieval day such as Le Morte d'Arthur, then sappy little Otto is going to be a bit of a let down. The knight characters are good fun, but Pyle keeps reminding you of his dissaproval of their godless ways in rather a preachy manner. This I think was rather typical of children's authors of the time. If you weren't bludgeoning your young audience with a moral message, you weren't doing your job.So, buy for the pictures (awesome), wake up for the swordfights, doze off during the sermons!"},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"There are many reviews that describe how wonderful this book is, which it truly is. However, there are phrases and words out of use, such words as dost, thou, weasand, and phrases such as \\"mare's egg\\". More importantly, there are many gaps in the book that all but the most precocious 8 year old reader will not be able to cross, leaving them lost in the story. It might work to read to younger children and explain the gaps, but certainly not to 4 year olds.I can only describe this book as being written out of love, though modern readers may object to absolute \\"goods\\" that are identified in the book. Two are the monastery and the King. The later is much the same as the Disney/Grim's fairy tales ilk.There is a fair amount of implied violence in the book, though only one explicit scene comes to mind, when the father, to save the life of his son, sacrifices himself to his arch enemy."},{"Title":"Otto of the Silver Hand (Looking Glass Library)","review":"I made the mistake of reading this aloud to my children based on the first 13 comments.I don't know what is so appealing to the reviewers who believe young children should be exposed to visions of a boy taken prisoner and having his hands chopped off. Yowza. Do you not realize the horrific violent messages this sends to young children?Honor and chivalry? Where? Was Otto's father honorable when he yanked his weak naive child from the monastery only to place him in danger because he had to \\"make a man out of him.\\"The story itself is whiny, boring, and sends no messages at all about chivalry or honor.If you're looking for immersion into the Middle Ages, this book isn't what your child needs."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Orwell's 1984","review":"As an English teacher, I really hate it when my students read the cliff notes instead of the book, but I do believe well-written Cliff notes can dramatically increase a student's understanding of a book by introducing ideas, concepts, and symbols the student might have missed and by presenting issues that help the student think about the book.

It is also very well-written, in language that even someone who hasn't already read 1984 would understand.

The story of a teenager's fascination with a rockstar-wannabee \\"Drumsticks Casey\\" in her North Carolina hometown has a nice flow. Evie Decker is the 17 year-old protagonist and she's just as bright and flawed as all the quirky characters we've come to know through Tyler's writing.

I agree with the reviewer (also in her thirties) who said that the book made her feel like a teenager when she was reading it. It does transport you right back there.A SLIPPING DOWN LIFE is Tyler's third published novel. If you come to it after reading ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, SAINT MAYBE, and other more recent novels, you may be disappointed--unless you read it without thinking of it as \\"An Anne Tyler Book.\\" When not standing side-by-side with these later books, A SLIPPING DOWN LIFE stands quite well on its own.It's an excellent book about a young woman on the cusp of adulthood who begins to take control of her life in the way that a seventeen-year-old with no mother and nearly absent (even when he's in the house with her) father might do. She learns from her actions and choices, however. The end is neither suprising nor sad; Evie grows up, and I have little doubt that she'll do much better in the rest of her adult life than she with the start of it."},{"Title":"A Slipping-Down Life","review":"I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one. Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer. While entertaining, the book seemed somewhat empty. I didn't find the characters' actions very believable, and the &quot;surprise&quot; ending did not follow from anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should). The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening. I do recommend Tyler's books &quot;A Patchwork Planet&quot; and &quot;Earthly Posessions.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Slipping-Down Life","review":"Evie was heavy, virtually friendless, and she listened to the radio.

She was told that would need a good plastic surgeon for her face. A photographer and the singer appeared at her bedside in the hospital. The nurse told her she was going to be famous.Anne Tyler writes of loyalty and steadfastness, a quality exhibited by Evie Decker in her pursuit of Drum Casey and his music. In time Drum moved to a better venue than the Unicorn, and Drum admitted that he hated seeing Evie's cut face. Unfortunately Drum did not measure-up and he was fired. Soon he was homeless.Secretly Drum slipped into Evie's house to sleep and eat. Evie and Drum married. Drum played again at the Unicorn on Saturday nights.

For all the trauma of being a teen she is accepting of her fate without whining or remorse. I had the feeling that her life was heading in more satisfactory directions at the end.

Its too bad that I had to choose the book I was to review before I read it. The author's style in this book is pathetic. The only thing I can say the author has going for her, judging souly on this book is that she is very good at characterization. Her characters are intended to be pathetic, and indeed, they are."},{"Title":"A Slipping-Down Life","review":"The third and last of her novels set in North Carolina, this coming-of-age story centers around the shy 17-year-old Evie Decker. Everyone around her basically ignores her, but she sets her eyes on rock-and-roll guitarist Drum Casey and begins doing things to attract his attention. One thing she does is carve his name into her forehead with scissors one night at the bar where Drum plays.Their relationship rollercoasters for a while until Drum proposes marriage and they elope. Things really start going bad for Drum, and Evie tries to help him out, to no avail - until she comes up with a brainstorm: Evie decides she will concoct a kidnapping of Drum by his fans, which ends up being a disaster (from bad to worse, as the book's title implies). Evie's father dies of a heart attack shortly after and then she discovers she's pregnant (even more slipping-down). She wants Drum to move into her father's house with her, but he refuses, and she dumps him.Although some of the scenes seem a bit far-fetched and unbelievable, Tyler's portrait of Evie is sincere and assertive. The most interesting theme for me involved the symbolic use of a mirror: when Evie carves her forehead near the beginning of the book, she steps through the mirror she is standing before - like Alice in Wonderland, stepping into a different life. At the end, when she tells Drum that it was other people who forcibly cut her forehead, she looks into a mirror again and steps back through it into \\"reality\\" again. The novel still has an apprentice feel to it, though Tyler by this stage is showing growth and maturity in her work."},{"Title":"A Slipping-Down Life","review":"This novel was horrible!!!!!

Little they did felt real; they were just unbelievable. Evie's behavior is never really explained either; her seeming obsession and devotion to this remote guitarist is rather implied.She has a turning point when he publicly insults her, even though he has allowed plenty of humiliation in the hopes it would help his career. While it seems like it will cause no lasting damage, she eventually makes some changes on her own.It's curious and disturbing. I'd like to say it ends hopeful, but I don't find myself necessarily pleased with Evie. I can see some similarities in Tyler's work from the movie The Accidental Tourist.

It is almost a novella exploring the lives of two lost young people. The girl, Evie, is plain, lonely and bored. The boy is arrogant, insouciant, and swirling in a haze of artistic yearning. He wants to be a red hot rock star. He wants to escape his uninspiring town and buy a house with white telephones and a swimming pool. She wants something to worship. Something to jolt her out of her catatonic life and give her a reason to exist. Anne Tyler is very adept at creating characters like these -- forlorn outcasts who are hopelessly damaged or simply desperate to be loved or liked or accepted. When Evie sees the boy one night singing at a nightclub she's mesmerized by his long greased hair, his black leather boots and his spangled guitar. If she could have that, if she could get his attention, maybe life would be worth it. The novel really becomes fascinating when Evie does the only thing she can do to get his attention -- which is carve his name in her forehead. This impetuous act somehow brings these two lost souls together and you stand there watching as they finally interact like someone eaves dropping in a hallway. This book is very visual -- Tyler's descriptions of nightclubs, old houses and hospitals burst like 3 dimensional images on a screen. You can smell the cut grass, the frying eggs and spilled beer. You can almost reach out and touch Evie's dull brown hair adorned with plastic headbands, rollers or flaking barrettes. A Slipping-Down Life is bleak and beautiful and these two heartbreaking young people are glorious to watch as they stumble and get up again in search for something to live for."},{"Title":"A Slipping-Down Life","review":"I found this book fascinating.

She has no social life to speak of and spends her evenings listening to the radio. This habit is what sets the plot into motion when she hears an interview on a local radio show hosted by an elderly DJ named Herbert:One evening in February there was a guest on the program. He came right after the &quot;News of the Hour.&quot;&quot;I have here a Mr. Bertram Casey,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;Better known as, known as Drumstrings.&quot; He coughed and shuffled some papers. &quot;It's an honor to have you with us, Mr. Casey.&quot; No one answered. Evie was sitting on the bed, twisting her hair into scratchy little pincurls. When the silence grew noticeable she took a bobby pin from her mouth and looked at the radio. All she heard was static. Finally Herbert said, &quot;Well. This is the beginning of a new feature on 'Sweetheart Time': interviews. May I ask if you are a native North Carolinian, Mr. Casey?&quot;Someone said, &quot;Not for long I won't be.&quot; His voice was cool and motionless, like a stone plunked into a pool. Herbert coughed again.&quot;Whereabouts in North Carolina?&quot; he asked.&quot;Farinia.&quot;&quot;Farinia, yes. Off of Highway--&quot;&quot;But I'm leaving there,&quot; said Drumstrings Casey.&quot;All right. Where is it you're going?&quot;&quot;A city, some city. It ain't quite clear yet. I aim to cut records and play night clubs, and if I once wiggle out of here I'm never coming back again, not even for Christmas. If my family gets to missing me they can come to where I'm at, I'll buy them a house with white telephones and a swimming pool.&quot;Evie is transfixed by this young man and shortly afterwards sees him perform live. Wanting something--anything--to make her life exciting, she ends up carving his name onto her forehead with nail scissors. This gets her the attention she wants, with very unlikely results.Drum and Evie's relationship forms the core of the book, and it's a penetrating look at the way two people can be together and even love each other without ever really knowing or understanding what the other person is all about. The ending is somewhat unsatisfying--it felt abrupt and hurried to me, as though Tyler had suddenly tired of writing the novel--but the book as a whole is a delight and every word rings true."},{"Title":"A Slipping-Down Life","review":"I found this book to be lacking.

It is scholarly, thorough, easy to read, and a worthy choice for any TESOL graduate program, but I'll have to admit that I didn't really enjoy using it. In Nunan's Second Language Teaching and Learning, which was published in 1999, we get to meet real students and hear humorous and occasionally humbling anecdotes. The Language Teaching Matrix, however, only talks of &quot;the teacher&quot; and &quot;the learner&quot;, and the materials that Richards develops and uses are invariably generic and lifeless to be beyond belief. But then again, if you are one of the world's most successful EFL textbook writers, why change anything? Buy this book only if you love Jack Richards' textbooks and want to emulate his undeniable professionalism. Otherwise, go for Nunan's SLTL, which I think is far more useful and interesting to read."},{"Title":"The Language Teaching Matrix (Cambridge Language Teaching Library)","review":"I'm nervous to comment on Professor Jack C.

You might think that a &quot;Munchkin&quot; is what used to be called a &quot;doughnut hole.&quot; You may think of Judy Garland only as Liza Minnelli's mother, and avoid prewar movies like the plague. Maybe you didn't feel that shock of recognition that &quot;Cora the Coffee Lady&quot; in Maxwell House TV commercials was none other than Margaret Hamilton, the green-faced Wicked Witch of the West.Of course, if you love &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; you've love THE MAKING OF THE WIZARD OF OZ all the more. I just read this book for the second time (the first upon its initial publication), and was astonished and pleased by how well it has held up. Author Aljean Harmetz has crafted a book relevant not only in terms of one particular &quot;prestige&quot; movie off the Hollywood assembly line; but indeed her insight, research and friendly presentation make the book stand as a metaphor of all Hollywood filmmaking during the height of the Studio Era, ca. 1940. Perhaps the late Irving Thalberg was one of the few Hollywood insiders who could &quot;keep the whole equation of pictures inside his head,&quot; but Ms. Harmetz opens up this world for us, and shows us both its realism and its wonder.We return to an era in which studio moguls were as eccentric and powerful as today's software barons, when studio hands were nonunionized yet intensely loyal to their studios, when no movie studio even thought about a future containing broadcast TV, when movie stars were better known than Presidents or Kings, and when Technicolor would give you any color except the one you wanted. Nonetheless, solving the creative problems inherent in bringing L. Frank Baum's novel &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; to the screen was seen as an invigorating set of challenges to be met and conquered.Back then, MGM had a real &quot;can-do&quot; attitude. So no one hadever created a moving tornado for a film? After two tries the MGM tech people got it right, and the depiction of that horrendous twister so set the tintype for what a tornado ought to look like that it persists in our collective consciousness today, despite today's ubiquitous video cameras.There were no tape recorders. How, then, to raise or lower voices artificially for dubbing? This book tells how. What happened when Buddy Ebsen almost died from an allergy to aluminum dust he had worn as the (originally intended) Tin Man? Why was Margaret Hamilton burned severely and ignored, yet Billie Burke turned an ankle and was whisked off the set in a white ambulance? Why did the film need four directors and half a dozen screenwriters, yet was fondly recalled as a labor of love by practically everyone except a prematurely embittered Judy Garland? Was the film the great commercial and critical success you might think it would be? And, by the way, what about those Munchkins' alleged sexual proclivities? Excellent answers provided by excellent research present a fully-formed world view, warts and all.THE MAKING OF THE WIZARD OF OZ would be a wonderful companion to the new restored DVD version of the film, which is so crisp you can count the gingham checkers on Dorothy's blue dress (which was actually violet, to fool the Technicolor process). How were the ruby slippers made? What about that poppy field? Read on. Some critics have said that Harmetz's later work is not as excruciatingly well researched as THE MAKING OF THE WIZARD OF OZ, but I don't care. This book and the movie are not only as much fun as ever, but a great education in the good old/bad old days of the Hollywood &quot;Dream Factory.&quot; Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Making of the Wizard of Oz: Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM","review":"&quot;The Making of the Wizard of Oz: Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM--And the Miracle of Production No 1060&quot; is just downright enthralling. It is an expose' that breaks down the machinery and the machinations of what it took to get a major movie made in the days of the autocratic studio heads. The book offers an entertaining and totally engrossing look at the legendary film. Judy, Ray, Jack, Bert, Margaret, and Toto, too, are all analyzed in this brilliant work. The songwriters, the respective directors, the many other craftsmen, as well as the &quot;little people,&quot; in more than the figurative sense, are all here. Vividly embellished with stills from the production, the book's text is just as captivating.

The one and only shortcoming of this book is to be found in the number of pictures, in my opinion there could have been more, otherwise it's a behind the scenes look that most OZ fans won't be disappointed with."},{"Title":"The Making of the Wizard of Oz: Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM","review":"The making of the Wizard of Oz is a wonderful book to anyone who has grown to love the Wizard of Oz. You don't even have to be an obsessive fan of the movie like myself to enjoy it. It is extremely well researched. If information is not known the author says it so and does not attempt to recreate history as some nonfiction works do.Perhaphs what makes the 1939 movie so wonderful is learning all the behind the scenes things that went into making it. This book gives respect and a knew sense of understanding as to what movie making was like in the biggest studio of that time. It is written so that it doesn't need to be read front to back. You can start in the special effects section and finish in the chapter about the script, or the music, or the directors (did you know there were four?).Did you know that the movie had the work of 10 writers or do you know how the surrender dorothy scene was done? Well, in this book you find out his and thousands more did you know facts to impress friends. I recommend this to anyone who has watched the Wizard of Oz.

And there's one incredible story about the Wizard's coat that still amazes me, years after first reading it. This is the classic book about the classic American movie, and it's the best possible example for anybody who ever wants to write about motion pictures or the motion picture industry. I intend to buy ten copies to give away as Christmas gifts."},{"Title":"The Making of the Wizard of Oz: Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM","review":"Almost as good as Round Up The Usual Subjects, Harmetz's book about the making of Casablanca, which is absolute magic.

In this case, the old axiom \\"the truth is better than fiction\\" proved to be true in spades.Put in the simplest terms, this is really the only \\"Making of Oz\\" book that ever needs to be produced. Why? Because it discusses EVERY SINGLE aspect of the film in detail that will likely never be matched. The key areas that this book focuses on include: Scripts, Music, Casting, Directors, Filming, Special Effects, and Critical Reception. In each one of those areas, author Aljean Harmetz does a truly remarkable job of understanding the \\"why\\" behind everything. Every decision made had a reason behind it, and Harmetz was extraordinarily successful at deciphering those reasons (whether person, political, or other).In fact, about the only \\"knock\\" I have on this book is that, at times, it would go into too much detail for just the casual \\"Oz\\" fan. For example, not only do we learn about how the four directors who worked on the picture did things differently while on the set, we also learn about their backgrounds going right back to childhood. Hard-core movie buffs will revel in this information, while others (like myself) might gloss over it a bit and again become engaged when Harmetz takes us back to the \\"Oz\\" angle.Also, the book (as the title indicates) not only gives a history of the film, but also a sort of de facto history about MGM Studios as a whole. Having never really studied filmmaking at that time, I found it to be quite interesting how, back in those days, actors were contracted to studios and only loaned out if it was financially suited to their \\"lender\\". In fact, most of the \\"Oz\\" cast was taken right from the MGM lot, so to speak! This is in stark contrast to today's filmmaking, where actors are \\"free agents\\" of sorts, signing with whoever will give them a star vehicle and the most money.Thus, I would recommend this book to anyone with even a passing interest in how \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" was created, from mind to page to screen. History buffs will savor every fact about the directors/actors pasts, while the casual fan (because of the way that book is paragraphed) can skip over some of that to get to the \\"Oz parts\\". So, don't waste your time with \\"Wicked\\" and its tangled philosophical/political web...this is the true history of Oz."},{"Title":"The Making of the Wizard of Oz: Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM","review":"Simply put,Harmetz's THE MAKING OF THE WIZARD OF OZ is as excellent a \\"making of\\" motion picture book as OZ is a cinematic masterpiece. The atmosphere created within it's pages places the reader into the 1930's Hollywood machine that was MGM and unfolds layer by layer the work and toil that went into creating what will stand forever as one of the most amazing filmatic achievements of all time. A CLASSIC book about Hollywood!"},{"Title":"The Making of the Wizard of Oz: Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM","review":"MGM's movie,based on the book by L. Frank Baum,\\"The Wizard of Oz,\\"is nearly 70 years old. But its stars, Judy Garland, Bert Lahr, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton, still shine brightly as ever, and the movie continues to be a particular favorite of young and old.Aljean Harmetz is the daughter of a woman who worked backstage at MGM. Harmetz's mother worked in the Wardrobe Department; she was able to estimate sewing costs on thousands of costumes, from 1937 to 1951 --including the nearly one thousand needed for \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\"alone.So starting from this birds' eye view, Harmetz is well able to explain how \\"movie magic and studio power in the prime of MGM\\" resulted in \\"the miracle of Production #1060.\\" To that end, she did hundreds of interviews, with actors, singers, songwriters, cameramen, screen writers, costumers, directors, and technicians. She succeeded in bringing the great glory days of MGM, under its sentimental czar L.B. Mayer, to technicolor life.Harmetz explains how the Emerald City was designed and built; how the cyclone was created. She tells us how Judy Garland's immortal \\"Over the Rainbow\\" was nearly lost, as envious, nitpicking producers responded after the film's first screening: \\"Why does she sing in a barnyard? Take it out!\\"The author gives us fine portraits of Margaret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch of the West--\\"she enjoyed every moment screaming about those slippers.\\" Binnie Barnes, who played the Good Witch Glinda, retiring to her pink and blue dressing room to await her next call. Bert Lahr creating the endearing cowardly lion-- his costume weighed over 50 pounds. \\"It was like carrying a mattress around with you,\\" he said. And he could only sip liquids once in full makeup. Ray Bolger, the dancer who created the Scarecrow, \\" I have no bones. I have nothing inside me. It's just the wind holding me up.\\" And Jack Haley who inherited the Tin Woodman's part after an allergic reaction to the aluminum paste makeup, put Buddy Ebsen, first cast for the part, in hospital.You should find you read these marvelously detailed pages with great enjoyment, and if you're as sentimental a fool as I can sometimes be, even with emotional involvement.

Their memories are a big part of the story, including all the conflicting memories that add spice.

If you're a fan of astrology, you will love this book.He talks about identifying your \\"true North\\" and what drags you into \\"going South\\" with your life... the hidden things that you think that nobody knows about, and nobody--including you, usually--really understands.Michael talks about cognitive changes that can turn your life around. He explains how to head back towards what you're supposed to be doing with your life: How to find your real path... the one that'll bring you deep-seated happiness.He also describes what sucks you into trouble, nine times out of ten because you seem to be so attracted to it (or perhaps it to you, if it's an irritation more than a siren song).Michael courageously goes out on a limb more than other astrologers, often with astonishing accuracy. I've seen that, even in his monthly column in Vanity Fair magazine.I bought SunShines as soon as I could, and started reading it immediately. I literally laughed out loud when Michael described my kind of Virgo as a \\"phobic slob.\\" Anyone who gets past the idea that all Virgos are perfectly organized and tidy... well, that put Michael on my list of favorites.You'll enjoy reading about friends & family in this book. If you know their birth dates, including the year, you can look them up in this book, too.SunShines is a great present for others, but it's an even better present for yourself. Few astrology books are this important; SunShines covers fresh ground and you'll refer to it often.

He focuses on the power of the Sun, the star that is the center of our planetary system. He looks at where true happiness lies for a person born under each Sun sign, what throws him/her off, and what gets him/her back on track. While initially appearing like a number of other books on astrology, with a cookbook format through the zodiac, its deeper focus promises more: to bring each reader to a greater ability to fulfill destiny, thus to be happy at last.There are some basic assumptions in this theory, specifically that the most of us are not happy, not living our destiny, not living to our fullest potential. If you know Michael Lutin's work at all, you know he is completely irreverent, challenging all basic assumptions from a depth that gets at the soul. He even promises that when you're done with his book, you'll be freer than when you began. But fear not! He includes instructions on how to read the book. After describing details on your Sun sign, he directs you to another section, one of 12 subdivisions of that Sun sign. He explains that this subdivision is based on where the South Node is located in the solar chart, during the year of birth. Here, he provides key words that describe two areas of concern that can become basic obsessions.Obsessions suggest a darker side, a deeper level of operating. They are related to the Lunar Node axis, where the paths of both the Sun and Moon's intersect. Lutin describes coping strategies for the obsessive desires that tend to serve as undoing. If lasting happiness is the ability to make the most of gifts, reduce negative traits, and increase positive ones, the Sun, as the heart and soul of everything, serves to center the psyche. As such, it is the container for the energy stimulated by the interrelationship with the Moon. The two become a dancing pair. At the deeper level, the Sun radiates the nodal authenticity, creating inner peace.Lutin guides the reader to face the self honestly, then he offers a way to deepen understanding and find \\"true north\\". He structures this section according to what gives great pleasure; what one might tell oneself; where one goes south; what major relationship struggle needs resolution, as well as other struggles that need attention, and he offers a possible past life scenario. He suggests ways to find true north and how to restore power. He offers some suggested paths to healing, as well as a final word of sage advice.Through his humor, Lutin reassures us that we're all struggling as humans together, but clearly, the process Lutin suggests is one of personal growth. It requires a letting go, a detachment, and movement towards things, relationships, ideas, and beliefs that bring lasting satisfaction. This is the work of astrology, applied positively."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"If you buy only one book this year, this is The One for the following reasons:* You definitely won't be the same person when you finish it as when you started it.* The power of Sunshines is never obscured for a single moment by metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and empty philosophy that bog down a lot of astrology books. Nor is it tripped up by technical astrological jargon.* The specifics of the Nodal dynamics at work and the illustrative examples are jaw-droppingly precise - and hilarious.Sunshines: The Astrology of Being Happy focuses on one of the least understood and most difficult parts of the horoscope to interpret: the Moon's North and South Nodes. If you don't know a node from a nadir, fear not: Lutin's trademark to-the-point-down-to-earth-in-plain-English style of presenting astrology is as crisp and sharp as ever.The first half of Sunshines addresses how the Nodes affect your sun sign, while the second half of the book covers the specific issues (and resolutions) particular to your nodal pairing. It is so intensely engrossing that you won't put it down to go to bed, even though you have to work the next day. (Call in late, take my word for it.) Not only won't you put it down, but you also won't read it once and then bury it on your bookshelf. On the contrary, you'll refer to it often, and probably for the rest of your life. You'll most certainly refer back to it as the nodes transit through your chart.Sunshines is definitely not a book for the superficial or the faint of heart--it absolutely and completely pulls back the rug we all sweep our lives under, and exposes those denied parts of ourselves that keep us unhappy and afraid to live. At times, Sunshines can be a painful mirror to look into, but Lutin's great gift--and the oft-obscured healing aspect of astrology--is the way he brings difficult issues to light with profound insight and even greater humor.The book was more than twenty years in the making and well worth the wait. You'll find tremendous revelation in each section--not just the ones that specifically pertain to you. Socrates once said that the unexamined life isn't worth living, and this book is the best tool anywhere to help you go as deep as you possibly can.

This book is for everyone. Regardless of who you are, you will get tremendous insight into yourself, your friends and family, and learn more than they would ever want you to know about them.A true classic, in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"I've been an astrology junkie for as long as I can remember. I never go a day without my Daily Fix (those of you who are familiar with Michael Lutin know what I'm talking about) and I always wait with anticipation for my Week in Review.I couldn't wait to buy this book - but I had no idea... NO idea... that Michael Lutin could see right into my soul. He nailed me right on the head - right down to all the things I thought were known to me, and me only. It wasn't all flattering... but I recognized myself on every page as I read about my True North and where I tend to Go South. What a relief to know that someone 'gets it.' And it's an even bigger relief to know that everyone has issues that drag them South.If you love astrology, and want to hear someone tell you (in a witty, irreverant way) who you really are and what you're really all about (c'mon... you know someone has to know your secret side) and how to make the most of the true gifts you hold inside, get this book. Don't wait one second.You'll have just as much fun looking up everyone you know, too. You'll be surprised, shocked, and in the end, relieved - everyone has their issues and you're not as crazy as you think.I've had the book for 10 days now, and it's dog-eared, the cover is bent and there's a coffee stain on page...? (can't tell - I'd be giving too much away...) - all signs of a well-loved book. I only wish I could meet Michael in person to thank him for his wit and wisdom (and to see if he'd know what my sign was after 5 minutes... something in me says he would)."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"And like Wilde, Mr. Lutin delivers insights with aplomb, wit, and spot on accuracy. Michael Lutin has the unique ability of making astrology accessible, entertaining, and more importantly-- he actually says something worth listening to. If there's any astrology book out there that's going to tell you like it is, then this one is it!!!!

Although I don't subscribe to Astrology 100%, most of the things he says are pretty close to right on. I read my mom's to her over the phone and she agreed to.The BEST part is, even if Astrology is BS, this book still has this going for it:1. Michael Lutin is FUNNY, you might just gets some abs from laughing so much2. Lutin points out celebs that share your sign. Now I know for sure that me and Brad Pitt share a chromosome. (Call me ladies)So buy this book and enjoy it on many levels. Despite your beliefs."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"I was very disappointed in this book -- so much so that I returned it which is something I rarely do. It just seemed superficial and glib to me and I was very surprised that it received such good reviews from professionals whose opinion I respect."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"don't get me wrong, i love michael lutin. i read his horoscopes every day and have even bought forecasts from his website. but this book is very superficial. first of all, i thought this was a book about the nodes but it only talks about sun signs. the nice thing is that he goes through those signs degree by degree; unfortunately the descriptions aren't very profound or interesting.the second portion of the book is even more non-specific. there are sections on things like wealth, relationships, etc and he talks about 'finding your true north' and 'where things go south'...but as far as i could tell this advice was not tailored to any given planet or node placements. not enough astrology, too many platitudes."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"Michael Lutin's Sunshines: the Astrology of Being Happy is his next book of insights into astrology that will deeply please anyone who is looking for more than the usual regurgitated astrological writings that are on sale. Lutin has a refreshing, original and at times startling way of writing that delves deep into a signs make-up that goes beyond the standard patter that seems to be cut and pasted in almost every single book that has been out in the market.The reader will not find the typical 'Cancers are home loving' and 'Virgos are dependable' in this book. Lutin has a wit and charm in his writing that not only entertains but causes the reader to be disarmed enough to get when he writes serious insights into the soul of each sign. Enough so that one is not offended when he writes about a signs true motives , something most people would rather not admit to, and then providing alternatives to patterns that may be holding one back from living a life of 'being happy' ."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"I was excited to read this book, but was quickly disappointed. I rarely return books, but after reading some of this book I couldn't continue because, try as I might, I couldn't relate to the majority of what I read. The author holds zealously negative views of people, it seems. I am very introspective, feel confident admitting my faults and make a life's work of searching for how to be a better person, including learning of more faults. I was born on the cusp, gemini/cancer, but am gemini. The description of gemini was so off the mark that I read cancer, but was almost as disappointed. As I continued reading specifics for birth year under each sign I gave up. It seems this author confidently sees the world as a place chock full of extremely problemed people with little going for them (or at least all geminis and cancers). Too bad."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"This work sets the mark for many years to come for the study of the human personality and relationships. One need not be a \\"believer\\" in astrology to benefit, simply read the \\"Going Deeper\\" section with its 12 chapters on Independence, Money, Communications, Security, Love, Control, Marriage, Sex, Religion, Recognition, Freedom and Escape, for as rich an understanding in psychology and philosophy as could be desired.I'm astounded by this work and I've been reading it off-and-on for two months now, skipping from section to section to discover about self, friends, family and acquaintances. Mr. Lutin never disappoints me. Certainly some paragraphs don't seem to immediately apply, but then I think of a friend, past or present, and I see how that condition was working in my environment.When I first saw this book in the bookstore, I put it back, feeling a bit misguided by the title. I'm not a big believer in human happiness -- more like sorrow and tragedy with occasional interludes of absurdity and contentment. I don't usually enjoy promoters of happiness per se, it seems so fleeting. Although, at 62, I have been extraordinarily happy for a good ten years now. That's part of the paradox that Michael Lutin is not afraid to address.Perhaps the book is mistitled? But what else would you call it? Life's answers to all your problems? That would sound awfully pompous. Yet Michael Lutin is a profoundly wise and compassionate human being, a true educator; he makes one work for the enlightenment in his revelations, and enjoy the work, for he's a most entertaining, witty and modern writer.All of this so far is not even to discuss the astrology, which for him is simply a tool, a language. His astrology is superb! I'm not a professional astrologer but have followed it off-and-on for over 40 years. This is the greatest book since Grant Lewi's Heaven Knows What."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"As a professional astrologer, I've never trusted solar houses for individual delineation, but this book has made me reconsider. He uses solar houses to add dimension to south node sign positions, and it seems to work. I still have to compare his insights to a few more charts, but so far this is inspired new information."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"Delighted to read this book, particularly the positive tone Mr. Lutin employs Additionally, my knowledge of charts compares with conclusions the author makes and broadens my thoughts of the individuals."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"That's what the book is full of: Tools you can use yourself to correct problems or obstacles you keep running into.Now, instead of saying, \\"Ah, here's that same old issue. What am I supposed to be learning from this?\\" as you pick your belongings out of the gutter one more time, you can instead turn to the book and go \\"Aha! That's what I was supposed to be learning\\" and then learn it, maybe before your stuff all goes in the gutter one more time.That's just an example. The book did not actually rescue me from a live gutter.It's not a book you can read in one setting and say, ah, that was a good read. It's more like a toolkit I will keep referring to in the next years. It's also freaking hilarious and you might just put it down after reading the whole thing, burp, and say \\"Ah, that was a good read!\\"Five enthusiastic thumbs way up for the latest life manual from America's sage."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"I have always loved Michael Lutin's soundbyte writing from his website, \\"Where's the Moon\\", so I was pleasantly surprised at the weightiness of the book. But what really inspired me is his combination of each Sun sign with the Moon's Nodes. So, essentially, you get 12 kinds of Capricorns (divided by the 12 nodes). I am not a professional astrologer, but have had a long and abiding interest in the subject, and the nodes, well, they are the lost child of the zodiac, and at this point, I look at them before I look at anything in a chart. They are my desert island pick from the vast and mind-boggling complexities of astro.I wish, though, that Lutin hadn't assigned numbers to the nodes, at least it seems that is what he has done. So say you are a Capricorn 5, which might translate into something like: Capricorn Sun, True Node Cancer. (I guess). Herein lies my criticism of the book, you look up your number in this chart that is rounded up to whole years, and yet the Nodes don't change by year like numerology, they change at anytime during a given year. So my particular nodal group appeared to be wrongly assigned into a following year. But who knows, I am guessing at his system, maybe someone can clarify."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"A bright and delightful book written in an easy to read style of witty banter with just enough dark sarcasm to make you exclaim, \\"Omigosh! Is that really me\\"? Easy to find profiles on all signs and a special bonus--an extra personal section based on the year you were born. This book has something new and a bit different--emphasizes that the moon, the lunar nodes, have as much to do with our lives as our sun sign and gives detailed explanation. Also includes suggestions on how to change our pathway of making repetitive poor choices (heading south) into choosing better choices for each of us (finding our true north). Makes a great book for personal reading, as a gift, for the coffee table, and would be excellent to find in a doctor's/dentist's office!"},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"Michael Lutin Rocks! Anything by him is always right on. I read his \\"daily\\" every day. Mind you, he writes just one horoscope for all signs and still hits it right on every time. It's almost spooky. If you only buy one book all year, make it this one. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"What a wonderful way to quickly get in touch with the stuff that can keepyou from being happy. If you can lower your defenses for a moment or two, you can begin to feel what Michael Lutin says is not only useful and true, but that his advice is positive and motivating. He has a wonderful sense of humor that helps take the edge off any painful self realizations. He gets to the heart of what's keeping you from feeling your absolute best. I've learned a lot so far from the book. It's a keeper."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"Michael's doing what most Astrologers have to (and should) struggle to do with their work - find a way to relate the cosmic-ness of it all, to mundane things...like people.The Nodes of our charts are left behind by many Astrologers but I make a habit of using these deeply in my own Readings at NewWorldAstrology and Michael does a fantastic job here. It's one thing to know your Astrology, another to be able to communicate it so effectively.Hopefully we can meet up finally when you're back in LA, in the meantime a big thumbs up this end!"},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"Michael Lutin's always on the money with his seriously funny inside info when little else makes sense.

And then he takes it even further, dividing each Sun sign into several, more specific categories, depending upon birth dates/years.

Mr. Lutin cuts straight to the point like a talented and very intuitive psychiatrist. If anyone is interested in self-improvement this is your best choice. Reading this book is like talking to someone who knows you best and you've avoided your problems for years and they \\"Tell it to you like it is.\\""},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"A happy looking cover masks this amazingly insightful staple to any Astro-enthusiast. I originally borrowed this from the library. After two renewals, decided to buy it because it will be one to come back to on a regular basis. I have studied astrology informally for nearly five years & have yet to find a more accurate depiction of specific strength/weeknesses, attributed to more than you coul ever wish for in any horoscope. -Moving, yet playful. If you only ever buy a single astrology book in your lifetime, this really should be it. It's easy to understand; no 'mumbo jumbo' and yet helpful in understanding yourself & others' motivations."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"This book is excellent! It was so hard for me to put it down last night and go to bed. Its amazing what this book tells you!"},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"Don't let the cover fool you! This book, on first glance, looks like it might be a bit of a light-hearted read, and that you could flip through in half an hour or so. I got hooked, not only by the down-to-earth language and style the material was presented in, but at the same time, the ease in which Lutin presents emotionally complex information.Being happy sounds simple enough, but as most of us know life can get pretty complex at times making it difficult to concentrate or achieve some of the simplest pleasures in life. \`SunShines' brings the focus back in on what is actually important to achieve happiness using a fairly simple, but powerful astrological technique. For those of you with as understanding of astrology, Lutin uses the Nodes as the basis for his book.The book is broken up into two parts: part one looks at the individual sun signs which are further broken down into subsections according to the year you were born (this will let you know which sections to look at in part two). Part two looks at the deeper issues that may need attention in order for you to understand the astrology of being happy. For example, you can find money, love, recognition and escape as part of the themes examined here. There is also an Appendix explaining the astrology in more detail behind the book for those, like me, who are astrologers.I must say that I am very impressed with the quality and content of this title, as it delivered much more than I expected: although it was very easy and fun to read, it was also deep in the information that was presented.In summary, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in self-improvement or in learning about themselves more - as well as those that are trying to find more happiness in their life! This is an excellent, easy to understand title. You don't need any astrological knowledge at all except to know the date of your birth - although people with a background in this subject will also get a lot of information out of it."},{"Title":"SunShines: The Astrology of Being Happy","review":"Michael Lutin does another great job making astrology simple enough for the laymen and soundly based for the knowledgeable astrologer. Michael's sense of humor engages the readier to laugh at his/her own foibles while at the same time challenging the reader to take on the business of making changes. The reader look up his/her Sun sign. Using a table unique to each sign, the reader is assigned a number that best describes the reader's personality. After reading that section, the reader is then directed to a second section which suggests how he/she could make changes. Of course one can look up the personality of family, friends, and co-workers. For the professional who does client work, the information provided can be useful in helping clients face their issues. The information is based on the relationship of the Sun and the Moon's nodes at the time of birth.

It was late, I was bored and the cover looked interesting. The book was a bit slow to start, but interesting once the pace increased. I found myself disappointed when I reached the last page because the job's library didn't have books two or three.What I liked:The characters were engaging:The Weave aliens behaved in an unexpected...but entirely understandable way to their new \\"Allies\\" the Humans. The \\"Bad Guys\\" in many ways mimic many of the loathesome qualities of many fictitious, and real life, antagonisitic forces all the while giving the overall impression of being beneficent.The struggle was believable and understandable:The \\"Bad Guys\\" seek to assimilate and redirect every species they encounter to the \\"Purpose\\". This is a common theme for a reason; humans are, by and large, fiercely individualistic. The Borg, the \\"Body Snatchers\\", Vampires, Zombies all have the underlying, if not primary, purpose of \\"Making you one of Them\\".Humans were not portrayed as weak or inferior:Though not superior in any given area, other than warfare and ferocity, humans were considered better than all of the allied and enemy races in that humans were exceptional, even the aged humans, in all of the desired areas (strength, reaction speed, endurance, eye sight, hearing etc). It was refreshing to not read about \\"Puny Humans\\".What I did not like:The Main Character:Though this may seem like a fatal flaw, it really isn't. What I didn't like about the Main character were his seemingly endless crys that humanity wants peace...even when the evidence of our blood thirstiness is staring him in the face. Now, I am all for peace, don't get me wrong, but I accept a few basic things about my brothers and sisters; we only really do two things REALLY well, kill each other and make babies. Were I put in the position of the main character, faced with probable genocide because Humans just couldn't cope with the rest of the universe's outlook on civilized behavior, I am sure that I would cry that we COULD learn to be peaceful, too.All in all, I really enjoyed this book, I have read it at least twice, and recommend it."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"A very good book, one of my all time favorites. Although, I somewhat disagree with Fosters recurrent theme of humanity's violent tendencies (presented a bit simplistic or naive in a way) it didn't keep me from enjoying this book. It is a great start to the series, and by far the best of the trilogy.There is also a little twist in the first contact theory. Humans carry some advantages that aren't often represented in most scifi stories. I also enjoyed the switching between POVs during the initial encounters, judgments that are made about each side."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"I'll be honest. Some of the ideas in this book are silly, such as Earth being tectonically active alone among thousands of inhabited planets, like one reviewer already pointed out. Never mind how the aliens are completely ignorant of tectonics despite all of their other wonderful science.The main reason I like the book is because it panders to biased view of humanity as princes among carbon-based lifeforms. I like the vision of humans being the strongest, fastest and most vicious species in the stars, and Foster did a good job of portraying the shock of the other races at this.I see more and more flaws in the plot as the years go by, but I gave it four stars because it's kept me thinking about the subject for such a long time."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"The Amplitur are a race of four-legged, tentacles-on-the-head telepaths that are out to get humanity and everything and everybody in the galaxy to serve the Purpose. They're locked in a centuries-long war with the Weave, a diverse coalition of free races who are opposed to being genetically re-engineered into leading Purpose-driven lives. Go figure.Enter humanity. When the Weave's exploratory ships discover Earth, they're amazed at our violent tendencies and capabilities. You see, most of the Weave's races - and the Amplitur and the allies too, for that matter - are incapable of violence or just very bad at it. So lucky us - we can be their new foot soldiers.Now, A Call To Arms isn't the first or the last to portray humans as having a small talent for war, but I think it has a fresh quality to it. The story is well-paced; it's a natural page-turner. There's little pseudo-scientific jargon. The author makes no attempt to introduce esoteric weapons or describe battle after battle. In fact, there's very little combat \\"stuff\\" until near the very end of the book.So it's difficult to categorize the book. It isn't one of those military science fiction novels like Weber's Insurrection where you're dealing with extensive battle descriptions. It's far-better written than Ringo's A Hymn Before Battle which is another military-focused intergalactic war novel. It's little like the Kzin stories or Saberhagen's Berserker fiction. Hmmm...How to determine if you'll like it? I don't know. I do think if you're seeking a novel containing plenty of combat with unique weapons lovingly described in detail, along with a battle every thirty pages or so, this is not it. It is, however, a story very clearly told, about how humanity's strength and competitive edge is also its weakness and burden.I enjoyed reading it, particularly if you're seeking some conflict-driven story without wanting to go to some starship soldier boot training indoctrination. I'm trying to say that young adults and up can get into this without feeling they have to keep their laser pistols handy."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"This was the first of Foster's books that I have read. I enjoyed it very much. Foster does a great job of illustrating the hypocrisy of modern man through the eyes of aliens. I was really surprised to see the change that Will undergoes after Caldaq leaves Earth, this was certainly an interesting twist. One word of caution I would offer to those that are thinking of reading this book is that it does not really end. It just sort of stops. It is part of a three part series and it seems that in order to find any resolution, the whole series is required reading. However, I found the book entertaining enough to warrant the reading of the next book, and would have no problem recommending it to any science fiction fan."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"I must have read this book six times and I never tire of it, Alan dean Foster's best book by far and I still haven't read a book by him that I did not like. His way of showing humanity from alien point of view is great and the design of the culters of these aliens and mental make-up is wonderfull."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"I'm truly surprised someone hasn't made a movie on this story. It's got everything an epic adventure needs.It was a page turner from beginning to end. Suffice it to say that by the end of the novel, neither the Weave, the Amplitur, nor the Earth, will ever be quite the same again.I'm off to pick up the second volume to see what happens next.I must say I loved the heavies, the Amplitur. Surrender to them is a fate worse than death as you'll find out in the novel. I think they were definately used as a model for future villain races in Star Trek and Bab5."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this story the plot, the varied and interesting characters were well done, I think I enjoyed reading the Alien view on what humans truely were, to all the pacifists out there, my apologies, but I tend to agree that humans are bloodthirsty and violent as individuals and as a group, our history proves that. The Alien point of view is enlightening maybe we should embrace our violent nature, and stop being in denial, but then again who would want to live in a utopia type setting, sounds boring!!!"},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"The idea that Earth's humanity is an inferior life form (physically and/or mentally) to other intelligent or aggressive types pervades science fiction and fantasy, yet there is no reason to presume that this would be the case. It is equally possible that humanity would be superior in many ways to other forms and this attitude has seldom been explored. Foster explores it in this book. Although exactly what is &quot;superior&quot; and what is &quot;inferior&quot; in moral terms is left open to question, the author leaves no doubt that humans are definitely unique to all other known forms in making war successfully. In addition, they appear to be stronger, more versatile and faster than the other intelligent types that are present. It's an interesting idea that should have come to maturity many years ago and finally has"},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"I am not typically a science fiction fan, but this series of books was suggested to me by my lifelong friend. After reading the entire series I have to say that in a addition to just being a good, fun read, it was refreshing.In this book there is the stereotypical conquering race, in this case a race of psychics who can bend others to their will, who want to conquer the universe. The lone force that stands in opposition to them is called the weave. The weave is your stereotypical multi-species federation that has banded together for numbers. All-in-all the basic outline presents a pretty clich&eacute; setting.The real difference between this series and other sci-fi stories is that unlike other stories where humans are typically outmatched in every way and only manage to hold onto their lives by sheer, dumb luck. In the series, The Damned, with the exception of obvious space faring technology, the human race meets or exceeds the abilities of the alien races in every way.In this series, humans are the weapons that turn the tide of battle. They are stronger, faster, more durable and completely resistant to mental control. Furthermore, human physiology is apparently very simple to repair to the sort of damage the alien weapons cause.This complete reversal of the \\"puny human\\" phenomenon that is so common in this genre provides for an endless supply of unexpected humor. There is one scene in the final book in fact, where an alien is being chased by a human. This race is typically considered one of the fastest in the universe, but is unable to shake the human. At one point it looks back and sees the human \\"bearing its teeth\\" and is so terrified by the presence of the human that it loses control of its bowels. It takes a moment in its terror to try and understand the cultural significance of the human bearing its teeth and then it remembers the human is smiling. It realizes this death machine is toying with it and it almost dies of fear.I highly suggest this series for someone who likes action filled sci-fi and wants to see humans finally get a little bit of retribution on those alien jerks. Also, keep in mind, this is the guy who wrote Stargate."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"I loved this book. I've read it several times, given copies away and then bought replacements. It's not particularly well written, nor is it badly written. The story is so-so. The main character is annoying. The few fights in it are under-described or only mentioned in passing. There are so many things NOT to like about this story. Yet somehow it stikes a chord in you as you read it. It triggers some kind of inheriant pride in being human that I just don't understand. It leaves you feeling good about the human race."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"Will Dulac needs to be punched in the mouth, repeatedly. His petulant insistence that \\"Humans are peaceful. We don't want war any more, and we certainly don't want any part of an interstellar conflict!\\" can be boiled down rather simply to: \\"I am a music professor from New Orleans who is suffering from writer's block. Somehow I was lucky enough for advanced alien species to contact ME, and therefore I am going to interject my personal prejudices and bias into their perception of humanity, and potentially GET MY WHOLE FRIGGIN' PLANET DESTROYED BY THE AMPLITUR BECAUSE *I* DON'T LIKE VIOLENCE SO OBVIOUSLY NO ONE ELSE DOES, EITHER!\\"I'm sure we can all agree that one pacifistic music professor-- currently not teaching and on sabbatical-- speaks for each of the six billion humans on earth, right?Will Dulac has no right to make decisions for us as a species. Anyone without the monstrous ego of a college professor would consider the decision whether or not to get humanity involved in an interstellar war would be a LITTLE above their pay grade.Not Will: \\"After all, he was a professor, an educated, sophisticated man. The so-called recruiters the aliens intended to use consisted of an old drunk, an ignorant fisherman, and some poor boys literally taken off the streets. The rest were little better. Whose influence was most likely to persuade, theirs or his?\\" (Chapter 15, electronic version)Well, Willie, considering that the people in question actually went interstellar and participated in the conflict while you sat safely on earth writing music, I'd have to argue that they are a lot more likely to persuade people like me than you ivory-tower morons living in the theoretical.While the book is well-written, particularly when it shifts to the point of view of the Amplitur, who really believe they are doing the right thing, Dulac's insufferable arrogance made wading through the rest of the book a chore. I found myself setting the book down for long stretches to avoid yelling at it, \\"Mankind has been fighting for the entirety of recorded history, you jacka$$!\\" or \\"Good grief, have you never seen a boxing match or watched a football game? Humanity LOVES violence! That's why action movies make ten times the money as art flicks! (or symphonies-- a fact of which you might expect a music professor writing one to be cogent.)Does Will take his blinders off? Does humanity join the fight? Do we get wiped out because one college professor (who doesn't even friggin' TEACH!) can't keep his mouth shut when he's in over his head?I recommend that you read it and discover for yourself.Oh, and the Weave, if you're out there and need my help.

However, best is really not that good, compared to works by other authors. Foster takes an interesting idea and tries to write something approximating military science fiction. But if you have read Pournelle, Weber, Stirling or Laumer, then Foster really does a mediocre job.In this book, the narrative is not bad and can capture the reader's interest. But towards the end, we see descriptions of actual battles. These do not match in drama or detail or intensity those you can often see in the other authors' writings.In the 2 subsequent books of this trilogy, we see a scenario of interstellar conflict between many races. But the descriptions of the futuristic weapons and tactics are rudimentary. Granted, Foster concentrates more on the politics. But the grand idea in the first book lacks something in its instantiation."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"Not bad, but sadly not really that good either. It isn't up to the standard that i've come to expect and have enjoyed from foster. Other reviewers have detailed the plot so i won't fill space with my own version. Basically the main character that foster creates wavers between utterly unlikeable to utterly unbelievable. His monotonous attempts to convince the aliens that humans are peace loving are so unconvincing and just so unrealistic that they don't ring true. Even presented with the evidence of humans fighting alongside the aliens and being devastatingly effective, he still petulantly clings to his own version of reality, until, of course, he decides to go off an kill aliens as well. Also, as other's have pointed out, there isn't enough \\"military\\" to make this an effective military sci-fi and there isn't enough of much else to make it really stand out in any other way. That said though, its well written and a good bit of light weekend reading if you find it cheap at the second hand bookshop."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"The premise of this book is humans are deadliest species in the galaxy, and bumbling aliens (inadvertently) come recruiting humanity. The first fifty pages are info-dumping sequences which introduce the nature of the Amplitur empire and their borg-like Purpose to the reader. I had a hard time picturing the 'good aliens' as anything other than slapstick sidekicks, like funny Yoda and clumsy Chewbacca. The middle of the book concentrates on the Weave, the alien good guys. The end is an above average space battle lacking in the 'military' aspects.The main character, William Dulac a misguided wimp who contradicts himself. Plot/characterization wise, first contact is made and philosophy is espoused. The concept of Aufheben, (uniting two contradictory ideas into a stronger, unified, whole with a higher level of understanding) is never mentioned, and I found this a glaring omission. Call to Arms isn't good military science fiction, and I found it philosophically incomplete.The space opera action itself? You won't like it if you read military science fiction. This book is more on the philosophy of battle. It lacks the lush descriptions of Foster's Flinx and Spellsinger series, so don't expect detailed settings or science (the plate tectonics explanation was even scientifically laughable). If you like speculative 'evolving beyond war' philosophical science fiction which highlight humanity's inherent violence, this is for you. One last thing, 'The Damned' in the title is misleading, no hellfires, religion, or brimstone in this work.Finally,The False Mirror: Book Two of the Damnedis better than book one, andThe Spoils of War (The Damned, Book 3)is a strong and much more focused conclusion. It's worth reading book one if you plan on sticking with this trilogy, which I why I can scrape up three stars for a substandard book."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"A very good book, one of my all time favorites.

I read it about once a year. The story isn't deep or profound, but it is a fun read. This is the first book in a group of three.The setting for this book is a universe where two groups of aliens have been fighting for thousands of years. One group is led by a race (the Amplitur) which has the ability to mentally control most other aliens. The Amplitur want everyone to join them, meaning being ruled by the Amplitur, for a \\"Grand and Glorious\\" purpose. They are opposed by a second group of aliens, The Weave. As civilized races no one in either organization likes to fight. Some races are completely incapable of fighting, as they become paralyzed when considering taking another being's life.The Weave stumbles across Earth. They encounter Will Dulac, a New Orleans composer. As Will learns about the war he tries to convince The Weave to leave humans alone. The Weave learns that not only do many humans like to fight, but they are very, very good at it.If you enjoy a good story in a science fiction setting, give this a try."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"This is a no-thinking, light read that has a great twist on first contact and a change on how humans are always the jack-of-all-trades in most sci-fi."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"Aliens land on Earth looking for help in an interstellar war. The first guy they contact is a Peace activist who tries to convince them that humans don't like to fight and are all peace-loving.I generally like Foster's work, especially his Flinx / Pip novels, but this one is much too long. Not that it's all that big, it's just that it should have been told using half the space. A lot of the story is repetition of what's gone before, but in slightly altered form. Unfortunately, I got bored with the story until it finally got moving again at the end."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"This was an interesting novel. I had the luxury of reading it within a couple of days travelling.Somewhere in the vast universe, there is an alien race known as the Amplitur. These have come upon something like a religion, which they call The Purpose. Their basic goal is to bring all sentient beings into The Purpose. This is basically fantaticism, or maybe something like communism. They feel they are entirely reasonable, and can't fathom how anyone would disagree, unless that is from ignorance.Somewhere else in the universe is an alliance of free aliens known as The Weave. They are fractuous, but are united in the goal of stopping the Amplitur. None of them want to be brought into this Purpose.There is a war between the two that has been going on for hundreds of years, as the Amplitur will find a new planet of sentients, go down to win them over into the Purpose. The Weave tries to prevent it, and gain the new people as allies in the Weave.The Weave comes at this more as a survival situation. This is because it is know that the Amplitur, once they've gained control of a people, genetically manipulate them, until a few generations later, they are basically mindless people for the Amplitur to control as they wish.This is the background. For now, i see this in a couple of ways. It comes across as both collectivism vs individuality, and also as a religious war, where one religion decimates the others.At some point, it becomes apparent to the Weave that they are going to lose the war. It may be hundreds or thousands of years, but they will end up losing it. So they decide to send out an expidition into some uncharted areas of space, to attempt to find some kind of allies to help them.At some point they find earth. It is entertaining how they go about trying to approach, communicate, and then explain the situation to humans. Most of the aliens races are fairly united among themselves, so they are astonished at how various human society is.And, as it turns out, humans are exponentially better warriors than any of the known alien races, much to all of their suprise.This being the first part of a trilogy, it lays the groundwork for the rest of the stories very well."},{"Title":"A Call to Arms","review":"There is so much to enjoy about this novel. In so many ways A Call To Arms is an absolute success. The narrative is smooth and engaging while remaining deep. You can tell Foster invested a considerable amount of thought and care into the races he has crafted. Their respective mannerisms and racial philosophies are thoroughly explored. Each race is distinctive and fascinating and it is here that Foster succeeds completely.Unfortunately this novel is not without it's problems. The main character can get a little preachy, at times the themes are extremely redundant and Foster tries to drive them home entirely too often. There is an entire section in the middle of the novel where essentially nothing of importance happens. The story comes to a grinding halt and the philosophical theme of the book is repeated over and over by every character possible multiple times without progressing whatsoever. You are forced to listen to everyone say pretty much the exact same thing a hundred times without expanding on the premise and without making any developmental headway. This part is rather a chore to get through.Also humanity acts a little bizarre at certain points and this begins to deteriorate the tale's believability, and at times the dialogue is dreadful. Some of the scientific concepts are a little suspect as well, especially regarding exogeology.All that aside, I would recommend this novel on the merit of it's interesting races alone.It's a good read; check it out."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"This story of a Tokyo dilettante (overused, but still best describes him), his country Geisha mistress and a mysterious young woman is considered one of the great works of Japanese nobel laureate Yasunari Kawabata. The title describes the nature of the mountain setting of the story, but could also tells of the nature of the relationships involved. TheIt is classic Japanese in highlighting the ephemeral nature of life and relationships. In another sense, the writer calls memories of Hemingway, as the prose is minimalist. Conversation is tight, and much has to be interpreted.Complaints have been made of the nature of the translation. I am certainly no expert. There is repetition of words, but perhaps that is symptomatic of the original. The message of the story still comes through. Kawabata must have been somewhat happy with his translator - he brought him to translate the Nobel speech as well. I certainly haven't \\"gotten\\" the entire story yet, but I think the fault lies in this reader, and not the translator."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"The plot is subtle, as it is was intended.

I found myself thinking about the characters and setting for days after I finished the book. This book tells the story of tragic and hopeless love through a very unique and heartbreaking approach.

Read it."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"The reviewers below who trashed this book have some good points. This one isn't going to make it into Oprah's Book Club anytime soon (i.e., the characters do not triumph over adversity). However, given the amount of ink American authors at the end of the 20th century spent romanticizing the Kyoto geisha life, Kawabata's 175-page vignette of the onsen-geisha life is a valuable tonic. Kawabata opens a window into a Japan that is hard to imagine from the usual tourist perspective."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Snow Country is the story of Shimamura, a wealthy Tokyo denizen who is unable to love and his trip to a hot spring in the snow country of Western Japan. There he meets a gesiha, Komako, who it seems has nothing better to do than spend all her waking hours with him. But, they never become intimate, Shimamura cannot give himself to her. They just talk and get to know each other, however we learn much more about her life than we do about Shimamura's. Snow Country is ably translated, there is beautiful imagery in the pages. Kawabata wrote a short novel, but it isn't a quick read. Give yourself time to ponder what meanings there are in the everyday events, and to savor the beautiful images presented. Dialogue is hard to follow because Kawabata does not identify the speaker, so the reader must infer from what is said who the speaker is."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Snow country is a very tender and gentle story of love and fixation. My interest in Geishas started with Goldbloom's THE MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and after reading that book, I went out and searched for as much information and books on geishas I could find. Snow Country is a different kind of love, compared to what you find in other books, this one is of a new and fresh experience, dried out after the marriage type of love. Very refreshing to read, I found this book to be less complicated as MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, but just as heartbreaking."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Great service. Condition of book was stellar and it was delivered in a very timely manner."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Snow Country, probably the most famous of Yasunari Kawabata's classical Japanese novels, is the story of a love affair doomed from the very start.Set on the snowy, mountainous slopes of Western Japan, Snow Country tells the story of Komako, a hot springs geisha and Shimamura, a wealthy Tokyo dilettante who works as an expert on occidental ballet. The focus of the novel is on three visits to Komako from Shimamura and their changing relationship as well as Yoko, a maid at the inn where Shimamura chooses to stay while in the snow country. Each of these three characters is searching for love, yet finds himself (or herself) incapable of fully experiencing it.Throughout Snow Country, Kawabata utilizes the changing of the seasons as a metaphor for the changing relationship between Komako and Shimamura. Meeting in the spring, Shimamura sees Komako as an &quot;amateur,&quot; a mere girl, and feels the need to protect her, much as one would protect a growing seedling. The relationship thus begins in genuine friendship and under the protection of Shimamura, Komako grows and matures.Shimamura's second visit takes place in the fall and Komako, who has matured into a woman, finds that her relationship with Shimamura has changed; she no longer views him as her protector and finds that the friendship the two once shared has now become a struggling romance. Komako, who emotionally, has moved beyond the superficial Shimamura, now views him with a mixture of passion and contempt.Winter brings yet another change to this enigmatic relationship as Komako and Shimamura begin to argue and grow further and further apart. Shimamura finds himself attracted to Yoko, but it is an attraction that can only end in tragedy for all concerned. Although the ending of the novel may be confusing for some, it does effectively sever any ties that Komako and Shimamura may have had.Although lyrically beautiful, the novel is almost painful to read as the characters struggle to keep their dignity intact in the face of their disintegrating relationship. Kawabata's writing is gorgeous and poetic and the book embodies the juxtaposition of his signature themes of beauty and sorrow. The narrative is minimal, as it should be, emphasizing the three characters' inability to love and live life to the fullest.Kawabata uses subtle, yet rich, imagery instead of a dense and complex narrative. &quot;...insects smaller than moths gathered on the thick white powder of her neck. Some of them died there as Shimamura watched.&quot; Kawabata wisely gives us only the beautiful essentials, existing largely in the conversations of the characters. The haiku-like images that make up their surroundings also lends insight into their character. This is an novel of nuance and atmosphere, of bare essentials and hidden meaning, of spaces and silences and hanging threads.Delineating the effects of desire on a man and loneliness on a woman, Snow Country is ultimately a book about love and the loss of love. Although bare and skeletal in some respects, it is still a classical story that burns with the fire of passion and then grows as cold as the snowy climate in which it is set."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Unless you are familiar with Japanese culture and language, you will find Snow Country different from most any novel you may have read. Read superficially the novel appears to follow a simple plot and structure. Yet, its intensity and beauty lies in the lyrical imagery of landscape and evocation of the protagonists' complex psyche and their relationships. The novel can be compared to a Japanese brushstroke painting, economic and suggestive, where the observant eye is able to complete the picture or the story. To fully appreciate Kawabata's prose in English, newcomers are well advised to empty their minds of other, mainly western, literary experiences and expectations and open up to a different world. Snow Country has to be read at a very slow pace. Every word has importance, with sometimes more than one meaning. With these preparations and attitude of mind, Snow Country is an enriching experience that will linger on long after reading it.Kawabata tells the story of Shimamura, a wealthy man of leisure who's visiting a hot springs mountain resort to meet the local geisha, Komako. He comes for distraction and out of boredom with his real life in Tokyo. Komako is a reluctant geisha, but has resigned herself to her role, while hoping for some other life. The contrast between what they are and what they would like to be is played out in their interactions. Shimamura is drawn to the unreal or the unlikely or impossible. He wants to remain \\"just friends\\" with Komako. Her chatty and highly emotional outbursts leave him somewhat amused and bored, yet he misses her when away from her. She does not behave like a real mountain geisha. His room is like a refuge from that life, a place where she can literally let her hair down. Shimamura's attraction for the other young girl, Yoko, a friend and rival to Komako, is as contradictory. In her shyness and reserve she is desirable. She appears to him beautiful and pure, a delicate reflection in the window against the mountain landscape.Nature and landscape are of great importance to Kawabata and articulated through Shimamura. Nature's beauty is felt more intensely by him than anything else. When he and Komako find themselves outdoors, they have nothing to say to each other. Yet even nature provokes contradictory emotions in Shimamura. \\"...he looked upon mountain climbing as almost a model of wasted effort. For that very reason it pulled at him with the attraction of the unreal.\\"Kawabata was one of Japan's most famous writers. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968. His Nobel Lecture elucidates his deep affinity to and understanding of classical haiku poetry. Haiku represents a fundamental element of Japanese culture then and now. Snow Country has been described as haiku in prose. Kawabata uses a shorthand style for his descriptions, evoking simultaneously multiple senses, like colour and temperature, stillness and motion, attraction and rejection. Nature is all encompassing with people one component of the wider picture.The novel is rich in symbolism and references to Japanese traditions and mythology. However, some are easier to identify than others. While accepting that the English language reader will miss some of the deeper meanings and connotations, Snow Country is a novel that opens a fascinating world and deservedly has an enviable place in international literature. It is difficult to comment on the quality of Seidensticker's translation. Still, as others have expressed, one wonders whether the translation could have contributed more to the novel's appreciation by the reader. 4.5 stars [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Kawabata is one of Japan's most respected authors, and &quot;Snow Country&quot; is his masterpiece. However, that does not mean that this is a book for everyone, or that everyone will necessarily understand or enjoy the novel. In fact, I got my copy as a cast-off from a friend who said it was incredibly boring and he didn't want to keep it.It is a demanding read, one that expects the reader to be able to catch the substance of the unsaid, the implied. Almost nothing is spoon-fed. There is no action, no crisis, nothing that most literary traditions has lead readers to expect from a novel. It demands patience, even though it is a slender volume.Personally, I found it captivating, and intensely deep and moving. Having read other Kawabata, I was prepared for the subtlety of style and the sparseness of language and story that is his trademark. He is the inheritor of the Haiku, which implies with as few words as necessary. The emotional depth of the novel is incredibly deep, much deeper than many novels I have read who express with much more fanciful language. The Geisha and the Dilettante, the one who affects love but cannot know true love, and the one who gives herself to love even though she knows it cannot be. It is a passionless affair, yet intense. Like the snow country itself, the landscape of their hearts is sparse, yet life lies under the surface covering of insulation.I did find the translation annoying and disappointing, and I was surprised to find such a lackluster translation on one of Japan's premier novels. The constant use of quotations for &quot;mountain trousers,&quot; for instance, instead of just naming it once and using the Japanese term. I am sure that a better translation could capture the novel even better, and perhaps transport it for a new audience.All in all, one of the best Japanese novels that I have read. Simply incredible, and worth the time. But remember your patience."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"I studied Japanese for four years in college and as a senior, more years ago than I care to count, I read this novel in Japanese, one of only two I ever made it through. Recently, having forgotten everything about the novel and because I have forgotten too many characters to read in Japanese anymore, I re-read it in English. SNOW COUNTRY is nothing if not a strange work. At the risk of sounding snobbish or whatever, I have to say that it is stranger in English than in Japanese. Japanese allows for a great deal of vagueness and reading between the lines. English prefers definite words about definite events. So, as I read the novel again, I did wonder why I had found it so enthralling the first time and concluded that language had something to do with it. Nothing is definite. As usual, Kawabata is not strong on plot. An idle playboy-type (we never learn where his money comes from) visits a resort in the mountains of Western Japan, facing the Japan Sea, the snowiest region of the world. He meets an offbeat sort of geisha, Komako. He rather likes her: she likes him, maybe more than that, but the relationship is touchy. Everything is extremely vague, the surroundings are beautiful, and as always, the reader can enjoy the Japanese fascination with the tiniest details of the natural world. Komako, available and prone to drink, is contrasted to the distant Yoko, a pure girl, with a beautiful voice, who shows devotion to one man and to duty. The end perhaps underlines Kawabata's view of postwar society, his disappointment at what Japan had become. If you have read \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", this might be a satisfactory antidote---not that the former was bad, but it is an American viewpoint. This completely Japanese view of a geisha could be more realistic in terms of what the average geisha's life would have been like in the provinces, far from the splendid inns of Kyoto and Tokyo. If you like haiku, Mondrian, minimalist photography, you would like this novel. If however, your taste is Faulkner, Zola, Balzac, the Russians, then I doubt if you would enjoy SNOW COUNTRY."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"After completely hating (and saying so in a previous review) Kawabata's Sound of the Mountain, I wanted to find out why he was selected for the Nobel Prize in Literature. I was not disappointed again. Snow Country is a deep, multi-themed, and ultimately satisfying novella.Kawabata tells the story of Shimamura, a married Tokyo denizen whose passion for the ballet and western dance is so strong that to actually behold a real performance would shatter the pristine dream he has imagined it to be, who travels to Japan's &quot;snow country&quot; and has a relationship with Komako, a young Geisha.I imagine that I'm stretching the analogy, but the Buddhist teachings of impermanence and suffering are an overarching theme of this story. Everything changes. To resist that change is to bring suffering. Yet, throughout the story, every character seeks some comfort in holding onto the past, the ideal dream. When Komako realizes she is aging and the flower of youth is passing from her, she suffers greatly. When Yoko yearns for a lost love, she goes insane. Only Shimamura, who does not seem to desire the past but is satisfied with the present seems to come through this unscathed.I'm not doing Snow Country justice by such a shallow interpretation, though.Even knowing the whole of this story from the outset would not diminish the pleasure of reading this book. 5 stars, without any reservations."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"SNOW COUNTRY, the masterpiece of 1968 Nobel laureate Yasunari Kawabata, deserves its place among the finest novels of the 20th century. A tale of a heart-wrenching love affair between a wandering playboy and a geisha in a remote hot spring in Japan's northwest, SNOW COUNTRY quickly becomes more than it seems with the addition of a strange other girl, omnipresent even when she is offstage.Kawabata maintains an element of mystery among each character, especially the enigmatic Yoko about whom even the careful reader can find out little until it all clicks in the end. But in spite of the complexity of their personalities, the characters do come alive and in the end their actions make total sense, even if the reader was baffled in the pages before. Make no mistake, SNOW COUNTRY is a difficult work, especially in translation, but its ending, involving a glorious epiphany for its protagonist, is transcendent and mystically beautiful.In spite of the pains of confused love which forever torment Simamura and Komako, SNOW COUNTRY is full everywhere of beauty, especially the pure white landscape which is perpetually in the background. Kawabata presents such powerful images: Yoko reflected in the train window super-imposed on the blur of the countryside, moths dying in droves in the autumn, the fire consuming the theatre, and finally perhaps the most important scene in the novel, the \\"Heavenly River\\" descending from the sky straight into Simamura's soul. Kawabata writes with such precision and uses not a single unecessary word that it is as if this slim volume holds an entire world within it.Regrettably this translation, the only one available in English, is incredibly poor. Edward Seidensicker is know for the quantity of his translations from Japanese, he tackled a ton of Japanese classics from authors as diverse as Kawabata and Lady Murasaki. He is not known for the quality of his translations. Case in a point, the ending: Seidensticker translates Komako's wail as \\"She's crazy\\", whereas in at least the Russian translation and the Esperanto translation it's rendered as \\"She'll go crazy\\" (future tense), which is important because it makes a reference to an earlier part of the novel. As Simamura is jostled in the crowd, slips, and has his rendevous with destiny, Seidensticker translates this section in an almost comical fashion, as if Simamura was a cartoon character slipping on a banana peel. Seidensticker wasn't really capable of translating a novel such as SNOW COUNTRY, which was written in a very austere and frigid style befitting its setting, because he couldn't help trying to add unnecessary warmth and texture to Kawabata's novel. I first read SNOW COUNTRY in the translation into Esperanto by Konisi Gaku, and I would in fact recommend that for Westerners. If English is one's only language, however, Seidensticker's translation, poor as it may be, is unfortunately the only option.Independent of which translation one reads, it does bear saying that, just as with every other creation of the Japanese language, SNOW COUNTRY undoubtedly loses some of its essence in translation. Also, Japanese etiquette may seem nonsensical to Westerners. I notice I wasn't the only one driven mad by Komako saying \\"I'm going now,\\" Simamura responding \\"Ok, fine, go,\\" and then \\"She sat down.\\" or Komako retorting \\"No, I'm staying.\\" Nonetheless, these are no reasons not to experience this jewel of world literature.I wholeheartedly recommend SNOW COUNTRY and truly hope that it becomes better known in the West. This novel leaves an indelible mark in one's soul, and its tragic passion juxtaposed with an uplifiting glimpse of higher reality stay with the reader long after Simamura is left under the Milky Way."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"It has often been said Yasanuri Kawabata's books read like beautiful poems.

Kawabata uses beautiful images to illustrate simple truths about love, loneliness and the fragility of our existence. This theme seems to resonate in one of his opening scenes. Shimamure, one of the main characters looks at the reflection of a lovely woman's face on the window of a train traveling through the icy landscape of the &quot;Snow County&quot;. Her reflection, floating above images of the passing, white, snow covered mountains reminds the reader of the fragility of beauty and the truth of life's fleeting nature. Kawabata's poignant images and his subtle character studies are pure genius.The winter snow of the countryside seems to be a metaphor for Shinamura - the city gentleman - cold and sterile. Shinamura's hollow relationship with Komako - an &quot;innocent&quot; country geisha - is a modern tragedy. Komako willingness to freely offer her affections to the distant Shinamura is touching. However, Shinamura seems no more able to feel for Komako than he does for the &quot;kotatsu&quot; which warms his room. This bittersweet story about the relationship between the cold Shimura and the simple mountain geisha, komako is truly timeless. It is no wonder this author earned himself a Nobel Prize."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Yasunaki Kawabata was the first Japanese novelist to win the Nobel Prize for literature. He is not as good a novelist as his contemporary Juchiro Tanizaki or his predecessor Natsume Soseki (1867-1916). He was a extreme right-winger who committed suicide, not unlike his protege Mishima. His most famous work, the House of Sleeping Beauties, deal with an old impotent man who is introduced to a special sort of brothel filled with beautiful, drugged sleeping women. (Oddly enough, elements of this novel later appeared in a pornographic movie of the early nineties with the same name).Snow Country is an interesting novel. The protagonist Shimamura is a married man and a dilettante, who has become an expert on the European ballet without actually ever seeing one. On a visit to the Snow Country he meets two beautiful young women; one is Yoko whom he sees on a train, the other is a geisha named Komako. He and Komako start on a relationship which both know will only last a few months. And so they do. Shimamura shows little passion, shows something more but not much more than polite concern, though he obviously sleeps with her. Komako clearly shows something different (\\"She walked ahead of him [to the bath] with her eyes on the floor, like a criminal being led away. As the bath warmed her, however, she became strangely gay and winsome, and sleep was out of the question.)It is this deliberately ephemeral relationship which attracts Kawabata's interest, and it attracts ours. It is written in a typically austere and severe style, concentrating on a hypostatized Nature which does not relish in gross physical detail. Consider this description of a teakettle: \\"skillfully inlaid in silver with flowers and birds, and from it came the sound of wind in the pines. He could make out two pine breezes, as a matter of fact, a near one and a far one. Just beyond the far breeze he heard faintly the tinkling of a bell.\\" This makes those details which do appear particularly striking: \\"Insects smaller than moths gathered on the thick white powder at her neck. Some of them died there as Shimamura watched.\\" The novel ends with an image of nature. During a climatic fire Shimamura falls and sees the Milky May in the sky above him.What is interesting in this novel is how Kawabata combines the tropes of classical Japanese literature, such as the aforementioned terseness and emphasis on an abstracted Nature, with a more modern interest in individual character. Obviously there is a gap between the Japanese and European right on the propriety of having mistresses, but in Kawabata there is no clear moral alternative mentioned to Shimamura's ultimately loveless behavior. Although Kawabata mentions the ideals of rural Japan existing the same time with time of modern tourism, this book does not obviously present an organic conservative ideal. The dialogue is terse, often unemotional. Like Jane Austen, it is a romance of pleasure, some desire, but little yearning and limited tenderness. As a portrait of cool if not cold lovelessness it is worthy of our attention."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"I am always impressed when writers successfully lets a character form and grow as the story goes, just using dialogue, events and some trains of thought. Kawabata lets you catch glimpse after glimpse of the characters in this novel and by the end you have a more or less sharp image of what they really are like. The beauty of it, I think, is that this image is neither complete nor directly incomplete, but more like a pond (if I may be so poetic), that is; you see the moving surface, you see the reflections and you sense the depth and maybe the distorted layers underneath. He gives you a chance to understand the characters but not the right to judge them."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"\\"Snow Country\\", by Yasunari Kawabata, translated by Edward Seidensticker, is the first book by this Japanese Nobel Prize winner that I have read.I mention the translator because a non-Japanese speaker is totally dependent on the skill of the translator to capture the atmosphere, the nuances and the unspoken cultural aspects of the original Japanese. It goes without saying that a straightforward translation of words and grammar would most likely be very inadequate. This is true of any translation of fiction, not only this book.With that caveat, I was struck with the simplicity of language and \\"spareness\\" of the writing. There is hardly a superfluous word, and very few adjectives or adverbs. I was reminded of the economy of Haiku and the simplicity of traditional Japanese gardens.The story is simple in the extreme. A wealthy Japanese sophisticate and dilettante, Shimamura, spends his holidays in a hot springs inn in the \\"snow country\\" of western Japan. The \\"snow country\\" setting would have special resonances for Japanese readers and the translator explains its significance and other important cultural aspects (eg the hot springs inn and the geisha) to help the English reader get into the mind of a Japanese reader. Of course, this is almost a futile exercise, but the attempt is worth making.Shimamura gets involved with a local geisha, Komako, who becomes very attached to him, although he does not reciprocate. Komako is a forlorn but appealing figure who is forced to make her own way in life as a hot springs geisha, bereft of family. Shimamura is married with children but he takes his holidays alone in the snow country.There is no happy ending and no unhappy ending - although the book ends in tragedy. The ending, like much of the narrative, is ambiguous.It is a book of great sadness in its human relationships and wasted love - and great beauty in its depiction of the physical landscape in the snow country. Imagery has great significance and the reader gets as much enjoyment from his impressions and intuitions as from the explicit text itself. This is the mark of a great writer.Like all truly great books, you could read Snow Country several times and gain fresh insights and pleasures with each reading."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Kawabata writes of one of the great themes, the connection or lack of, between people. In doing so he describes the smallest things that make up our lives, and lets the tiny detail stand for the whole in a beautiful poetic way."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"A strange tale, full of contrast. Kawabata's writing is, without doubt, capable of great beauty. The descriptions of the imagery framed by the train carriage window as it travels into the snow country, mirroring the secret beauty within the carriage against the landscape drifting by in the half-light - this is the wonderful prose I anticipated from this book. In the same vein, the descriptions of light, shade, mountains, stars and constellations can send the senses soaring. Some examples - \\"Black though the mountains were, they seemed at that moment brilliant with the colour of the snow. They seemed to him somehow transparent, somehow lonely\\" and \\"Insects smaller than moths gathered on the thick white powder at her neck. Some of them died there as Shimamura watched.\\" But all too often the reader is brought crashing back to earth by the dull dialogue of the tale's capricious (feckless?) geisha. And our protagonist, Shimamura, is sadly at best an unlikeable chauvinist and at worst, a thin caricature, without depth or substance. Aspects of the translation also grate, particularly the all too frequent references to \`mountain trousers' - whatever the Japanese word is would have been preferable.There is much to enjoy, but this is spoilt by too many annoying aspects which left me keen to finish the book ASAP and move on."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Snow Country looks like a sculpture of ice, a sort of statue of two lovers carved in crystal, strangely cold and gloomy, though beautiful. It's like if winter and the winter landscape, in all their scintillating beauty, in all its smell of fresh ice and pine-tree essences, was captured by the hands of Kawabata, to be concentrated and shaped in a very brief history. The words of the great critic and writer, Anthony Burgess, about Shakespeare's play, Twelfth Night, also apply to this book: \\"a strangely melancholy tapestry.\\"But if there is something warm, something human, somethig pulsign with life and blood, beneath that adamantine and icy covered landscape of Kawabata's novel, this heat, this fire heart, this life is called Komako. She is one of the three main characters of the novel (along with Yoko and Shimamura), but is by far the most complete of the three. She is one of the feminine figures that I love the most in all my readings; for me she is one of the most perfect characterizations of a woman in love, or rather a woman who suffers because of love that hurts her, a love that doesn't becomes absolute, a love which does not reach the climax she desires, that she hungers for.I am a little suspect to talk. I always had a special passion for Japanese women. I just love them: I find them beautiful, desirable, fragile, innocent, needy ... all this at the same time. How to resist to their little children's faces that seem to call for care, to beg for attention; their body skin as white as ivory, as it was dissolved to model them; their rosy cheeks, which crown their faces of perfectly clean and smooth skin; their breasts and hips so proportionate and elegant; their black hair, as if night was unwoven especially to weave them? There is no way to resist. Furthermore, Japanese women have a style, a culture, a delicacy: they are so refined that they look like real angels. It's like if we would check their bare backs, we will find the marcs of angel wings that were ripped off.Returning to Snow Country, I fell that the figure of Shimamura is not precisely delineated. In fact, he appears to be little more than a Playboy with some culture and money, but that cannot hide his own mediocrity and lack of the spice of personality. Yoko is somewhat distant, and is always shrouded in a kind of fog, always inscrutable. But if this fog was suddenly dissolved, I do not believe she would prove nothing more than a normal girl, a young woman like any other. These characters, Yoko and Shimamura, seem to be more ornaments and additions to the winter landscape than truly significant characters. The same cannot be said about Komako.Komako is femininity in all its grace and warmth, all its strength and frailty, turned into flesh, molded into a character. She is outlined and drawn in a lot of subtle touches, so many that now I cannot remind myself of all. She is not a kind of book character that is alive especially for the things she says (as Shakespeare's characters in his plays), but by the descriptions of her gestures, her way of walking, her way of drinking sake and kissing, by the expression on her face in moments of sadness and joy, of anger and serenity.She loves Shimamura, and when she is around him, nested in his chest, she is, at first, coy, needy, and extremely loving: her words sound almost like a purr. She is also very careful: arranges everything around, and seems to feel nervous when the room is messy.However Komako is not just a submissive geisha, a girl desperately in need of care. She loves also in a fierce, wild way, and when Shimamura makes comments that are displeasing, comments that sound snobbish, she yells at him, and offends him with the strength of a lion. If Shimamura is cold; if he is afraid to give himself completely, Komako will explore every inch of her heart, every little piece of it: her love is complete, ardent - it seems she cannot breathe when she is away from her loved, as if she does not seem able to think of nothing but him.Many of the visits of Komako to Shimamura occur when she is drunk, and it is painful to contemplate how she loss's control of her emotions; it is painful to see that she loves this man so much that when alcohol breaks down her defenses (her shyness and pride ), she cannot keep out of his room. Whoever loved and was not fully loved in return will understand the pain that is expressed in these scenes, that universal pain that is created when the lover humiliates and degrades himself, burning and destroying whatever dignity he can find, if he can win only some small scraps of attention from the beloved, only mere crumbs of his company.Komako also tells stories of other men to Shimamura, and in some parts of the book it's shown in the company of these, laughing loudly, drinking and talking as if she were extremely excited and happy. But we know all along that these are acts of desperation, a way in which a creature who was wounded by love, bleeding a sadness that cannot be hold within itself, seeks to strike the one who hurt her, the one who has make her fell so much pain. Komako tries, through other adventures, to make Shimamura fell jealous. All she wants, it seems, is to be loved by this man, so she can give him all the love that chokes her, that burns her, that makes her flesh a flame in the midst of the snowy mountain village.Well, I cannot describe Komako fairly: there are so many details, so many touches, that just reading entire the book is to make justice to her. I confess that during the reading I wanted to go into the book, push Shimamura away, and get Komako to myself. I dreamed of building a cabin in the mountains, to live together with her, spending cold nights embraced under the covers, while outside the wind will coldly howl. I dreamed of having coffee with her on the porch, under the early morning sun, chatting and laughing merrily. I dreamed about the caresses I will love to do on a young woman so beautiful and so full of warmth (and on top of it, Japanese!). Jokes aside, I confess that Komako is one of the few characters in which I really fell in love.I cannot fail to briefly describe also the fourth character in the book: the landscape. If works like that of Dostoyevsky are not concerned with the description of landscapes, but with the interior of the human soul, Kawabata's books are wonderful paintings. In the Snow Country we have a wonderful icy mountain, with the smell of pine resin, with its hot springs breathing hot steam, with insects buzzing in the air, and starry skies where the Milky Way dances and parades. It is within this world that the destinies of the characters move, in a cold atmosphere that at the same time seems to sweat sorrow, to shed a ghostly mist of melancholy over the villages and mountains.Snow Country is like a poem: each of its pages exudes a taste of unrivaled beauty. It's small, brief, yes, but wonderful: it is like a jewel, a diamond created with the odd carbon compound of words.Note: Sorry for my bad english; I am Brazilian, and so my native language is portuguese"},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"This is one of my favorite Kawabata novels. Each time I read it I am struck by its elegiac, elegant prose and by moments of startling intensity."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"\`Snow Country' is a beautiful novel from the Nobel prize winning novelist Yasunari Kawabata. It follows Shimamura who spends his vacation time at a isolated mountain hot spring and Komako, a geisha who works there and entertains the guests who visit to ski and soak in the springs. Kawabata's style is deceptively simple and it reminded me at times of Hemingways writing. They both write with simple, almost terse, sentences and yet they both impart a wealth of emotion and imagery that cuts to your core with minimal effort. At it's heart this story is about a doomed love affair that can never be fully realised and yet it seems to be about so much more. You are quickly drawn into the lives of the two main characters and feel their confusions along with them. The descriptions of Japanese countryside are rich and evocative and conjure up vivid images, like the snowflakes described as falling like peonies. This book has a brief introduction that puts some of the scenes into greater context for western readers and is very well translated throughout. I enjoyed this book immensely and although it is short, it is perfectly crafted and extremely beautiful. This is well worth reading at some point.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Shimamuru, a man of leisure with a superficial-though feted- knowledge and interest in the arts,makes regular trips to the hot springs in the Snow Country where he seeks the pleasure of Komako, a Geisha,who adores him. But their passion is futile and wasted....A story very Japanese in it analogies and literary allusions which Kawabata uses to enhance his themes of wasted beauty and love. The introduction is good to read in order to appreciate the book all the more. Often I felt the translation and the story tended to 'jump'a bit; for example in one sentence Shimamura would be looking out of the window and the scene before him would be described then-seemlessly-in the next sentence he would be IN the country or Komako's Town, and it took a double take!But the whole book-as so often is said of Japanese writing-is a work of art; each scene poetic and as if painted on a canvas. Even read 'neat'-without knowing the literary allusions and allowing for the 'jumps'-this still reads well and is a great book."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata's best known novel paints the human condition and the Japanese landscape in mournful hues as he constructs this tragically beautiful work. The story follows Shimamura, a Tokyo diletante, and his trips to the snow country as he searches for himself in the landscape and in his affair with a enchanting and tragic geisha, Komako.It is in the subtlety of the narrative and lushness of description that Kawabata stands out from other Japanese authors such as Oe and Endo. The reader is softly, lightly, wisked along through the novel, as if a drifting snowflake, and more absorbs than directly obtains the meaning of this fantasitic novel."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"I read this English translation and the story was hard to follow and boring at times. My wife, who owns the same novel but in a Spanish version translated by C&eacute;sar Duran, was delighted with the story. Then she read it in English and told me that while at the most basic level the development of the novel was similar the English version seemed to her lacking poetic flow while the Spanish one was pure beauty.I found this fascinating!To think that a foreign author can be so differently understood by all of us simply because of who translates the work. I wish I understood Japanese."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"This is an incredibly beautiful novel written by the Laureate in literature Yasunari Kawabata. It depicts the relation between Shimamura, a wealthy man and the geisha, Komako.In the beginning of the story, Shimamura leaves his real life in Tokyo in order to meet his mistress in the hot spring town of Yuzawa.The relationship is however not a satisfying one. Shimamura is bored by Komako's highly emotional outbursts and longs for what is impossible and unreal. He is therefore attracted by the shy and reserved Yoko whom he saw in the train. It was mostly her delicate, beautiful and almost surrealistic reflection in the window against the mountain landscape which moved him.This is how Kawabata describes this appearance:\\"Particularly when a light out in the mountains shone in the center of the girl's face, Shimamura felt his chest rise at the inexpressible beauty of it.\\"The novel is rich in images and metaphors and opens a fascinating poetical world about relations which will linger for a long time in the reader's mind."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Snow Country was the first book i read from Kawabata. To me, his writing style resembles the making of a painting. Kawabata uses seemingly simple words to visualize the story; the result is a rich, velvetly, image that floats in the mind of the reader. You can almost touch it. His descriptions on the environment and the characters are extremely detailed. However, feelings are unclear, and thats that keeps the reader guessing and assuming. Interesting enough is to ralize that he describes the Geisha in the same manner as the snow covered landscape."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"As a teacher of comparative and literature (with a focus on poetry, but the novel as well), I feel confident in saying that Kawabata is a writer of such brilliant painterly effects (by which I mean I visual and emotional evocations), that I rank him at the very top of twentieth century writers in the world."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Snow Country is about a man who takes regular trips away from the city &amp; goes to a little town in the &quot;snow country&quot; in northern Japan to have sexual affairs with the local geisha. On one of his trips, he sees a young woman &amp; becomes attracted to her. The book has some beautiful imagry that makes me see the sights, hear the sounds &amp; smell the smells of the snow country. But the book just doesn't have the ability to really draw me in to the character's lives. Instead of fascination, I'm only mildly interested. While the sensual imagry is beautiful, it's not masterful, as in a work like People In The Summer Night. I've read another work by this author, Thousand Cranes, and enjoyed it much more. I was really drawn into the world of the characters in that novel, but not here. Overall, I felt that this book, for the author &amp; classic Japanese literature as well, was a letdown."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Story was alright, a little long winded at times.

It is a good read, especially if you are into sexual tension. :) Anyways, pick it up if you have the chance."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Spare, easy-to-read prose. It goes by very quickly. The story is heartbreaking but the tone is cool and detached. The translation feels very modern (the book was written in the 20s) and dialogue the attitudes of the characters can be abrupt and surprising. I liked it because the tone, the characters, the style were all unexpectedly entertaining."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"In spite of all the professional reviews singing the praises of this book I found it difficult to read. The characters are tragic individuals caught up in a state of existance that is pathetic at best. Yasunari Kawabata uses a mirroring technique in the dialogue between the two protagonists that dulled my senses. For example, &quot;I am going out&quot;. &quot;You are leaving&quot;? This is often followed by a paradoxical response, &quot;No, I am staying&quot;. This was most difficult for me to appreciate.Kawabata does a wonderful job describing various nuances of life in the mountains and the life of one Geisha. He makes the scenery tangible and the people visible to the readers eye.I had to make a commitment to the book in order to read it through to completion; and, by the time I was finished, I was depressed."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"I was greatly disappointed by this book. I found the main character, Shimamaru, difficult at times to identify with, mostly because of his insentivity to the things going on around him. In fact, I feel as if the book rambles on more about the scenes in nature (i.e. the mountains, the valley entrenched in snow several feet deep, the cedar groves) than about actual plotline or characters, who are only skeletally delineated. While reading this book, I experienced a stern coldness from Kawabata, as though he were purposefully trying to alienate the reader from an experience that could be told with so much more warmth, and depth.The story itself, although somewhat interesting at first glance, is nothing more than the tedium of a love tryst. Perhaps Kawabata wants us to have pity for these mountainfolk who seem entrapped in this type of isolated lifestyle (certainly inferior to that of Tokyo, although it has its own naturalistic charm), but what this book lacks the most of is emotion, or specifically, the evocation of emotion from us as readers. I felt almost nothing as I read about the lives of these characters. Despite the fact that certain passages do evoke a sense of beauty and let the imagination soar along the mountain ranges and the picturesque snow scenery, these elements about the setting cannot make up for the severe lack of characterization and depth in plot. Indeed, at the very end, when we come upon the death of a secondary character at the end, we don't feel the &quot;connection&quot; that somehow should be attributed to a role character's death in a novel; I was frustrated by this all throughout the novel, and I think it should be avoided at all costs, lest you waste your time on a story that probably wasn't worth the telling, and whose pictorial descriptions of the Occidental should be left to some outside textbook.What is perhaps the only saving grace of this novel (and which probably explains a lot of the &quot;I don't care, nothing matters,&quot; mentality) is a possible appeal to Buddhist thought, and that somehow the way in which things die (e.g., dragonflies, moths, bees, human beings) is part of some natural order of things, and that the line between life and death is very tenuous indeed. All throughout the book there is countless imagery of natural objects moving in repetitive motions (e.g., cedar brushes flapping back and forth in the wind, a bee wagging its tail in a dance, a dead moth sailing to the ground like a leaf swaying from side to side) which hints at an intended circularity in the work, a line of thought also found in Buddhist scripture. Also, the use of the colors white, black, and red have special significance in this work. The white/black might obviously signify a type of &quot;yin-yang,&quot; or the union of life and death in a circular cycle of things. The effulgent reds that appear in the novel may be symbols for the blood of life, not necessarily in man, but in nature itself, driving on natural processes in the same cyclical fashion, from day-to-night, and also day-after-day."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Kawabata's 'Snow Country' is a geisha story.One of the main characters of the book, Komako, had to sell herself in order to pay the medical costs needed for the treatment of her lover's illness.One of her clients is the rich good-for-nothing Shimamura.They are attracted to each other, but love or even genuine human contact seems impossible for them.All those facts are told more or less indirectly between poetic and melancholic descriptions of snow landscapes.This novel was first published as a newspaper serial and contains some unnecessary repetitions. Also, the end is not convincing with a fire as a deus ex machina.I found this novel too vague, too impressionistic and too loose.For a more moving and realistic portrait of a geisha I recommend 'Autobiography of a Geisha' by Sayo Masuda."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"As the so-caled masterpiece of one of Japan's most renowned writer, and one of the only two who have been awared a Nobel prize for literature (so far), I had pretty high expectations for this book. Neverthless, no sooner had I started reading than I found myself stuck into a nondescript, monotonous narrative.Throughout the book I've been kept on hold for some action or event that never really happened (except maybe the fire at the end).For a Nobelist, Kawabata lacks a talent for rich, vivid and accurate descriptions of his own country, in a way that Alan Booth could capture so perfectly in \\"The Roads to Sata\\" or \\"Looking for the Lost\\".The plot, which is based on a romance and geisha atmosphere, leaves a lot to be desired, especially compared to the superb and gripping \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" by Arthur Golden.This book has disappointed me. If even Western writers can depict better Japanese landscapes and traditional lifestyles, or render the spirit of time and people in a more emotionally compulsive way than this giant of Japanese literature, the problem might just reside in the translation itself. Seidensticker is, however, one of the most famous translator of Japanese literature into English. I'll have to read the Japanese version to tell. But the story is so basic and boring that it can hardly be much better. If you are to read it in English, you'd as well give it a miss, except if you want to say you've read Kawabata...NB : Some readers have found the story interesting because of sort of secret affair going one between a married man (Shimamura) and a geisha (Komako). However, this was and still is tacitly acceptable in Japanese society. As Seidensticker puts it in the introduction, \\"The special delights of the hot spring are for the unaccompanied gentleman. No prosperous hotspring is without its geisha and its compliant hotel maids.\\"Nothing is said regarding the two having sex, but every Japanese would understand it implicitly. Japanese are much less ashamed of sex as Judeo-Christian morals haven't penetrated their society. They have a more matter-of-fact approach, and Japanese men aren't known for being romantic. Traditionally, getting married is more of an alliance between families or a business to make and raise children in a common house than a love affair. The big gap with Western mentality is that once a woman has children her husband doesn't regard her as a woman any more, but a mother. As she will usually turn all her affection to her child(ren), the man is understood to be free to play around, or at least being entertained by other women, be them geishas, or nowadays hostesses. Not unlike with Shimamura, men will not necessarily seek love, but just a feminine presence that care about and praise them. Both geishas and hostesses have the choice to have sex with their customers or not like any single ordinary woman. As Komako says : \\"No one forces a geisha to do what she doesn't want to. It's entirely up the the geisha herself\\".Without knowing these aspects of Japanese culture, the book might be misunderstood by an outsider. However, once you know about this, that makes the book even more unexceptional and banal for any Japanese could have written a similar story - at least anybody from Kawabata's generation."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"I didn't really care about the characters nor the love story. The implied passion was just that, more implied than revealed through the actions of the characters. I was excited when I picked this book and disappointed when I finished it because my expectations were high. Maybe too high.Do not read the introduction which spoils the conclusion of the novel. Just a heads up."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Ok, being fluent in Japanese and familiar with Japanese culture, I can see how this book (and style of writing) may be considered &quot;of literary significance&quot; in Japanese. Rendered in English, it is simply dull. For students of Japanese literature and writing styles, it may be worth &quot;research&quot; or &quot;study&quot; time, but it is not something the average English reader would pick up for entertainment value. The premise of the book seems to be based on &quot;painting&quot; the atomosphere around the characters, in all the drawn-out details. In Japanese, there would probably be a lot more significance in the descriptions and words, simply due to the underlying subleties of the language. However, in English, it's simply boring."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"I will admit that when I finished the book, my first thought was something along the lines of &quot;What? That's the end?!?&quot; But when I thought about it, the beauty of the ending matches the beauty of Snow Country, where what is left unsaid is often just as important as what is said. To wrap up Snow Country with a more concrete, definite resolution would be an injustice in my opinion.Kawabata's aptitude for description is amazing. I could picture Yoko's reflection on Shimamura's train window, Komako's flushed cheeks, even Yoko's sadly beautiful voice with perfect clarity. The storyline is no less beautiful. Thinking of Komako and Yoko being left behind in that harsh but beautiful land, surrounded by nothing but the mountains, snow, and their complex pasts, and Shimamura returning to his spoiled idleness in Tokyo, is enough to sadden anyone. I wonder if Shimamura will ever look back at his time in the Snow Country and regret what he has lost.The only bad thing about Snow Country is that the English translation is not very good, although a good effort was made. Unlike earlier Japanese novelists like Natsume Souseki, whose writing was heavily influenced by the West, Kawabata uses the full range of wordsmanship possible in his native Japanese language. I would highly recommend the original Japanese version to anyone who has the time/ability to read it (it's &quot;Yukiguni&quot; in Japanese). Snow Country is truly a modern masterpiece, a deserving recipient of the praise it has been given."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"There are no revelations, no unwindings, no developments present in this book. Other than the change of season marked by two visits of the male protagonist Shimamura to the snow country, there isn't even a sense of time. Instead offered is a collection of beautiful, serene, _static_ images. Alongside the somewhat monotone dialogues between Shimamura and Komako, images of the Japanese countryside are \\"displayed\\" rather than \\"described.\\"Characters in this novel are, so to say, lost (the Japanese have a long tradition of writing about lost characters, Murakami Haruki being the one of the latest of such authors). Komako, being a geisha and understanding that Shimamura is already married, cannot do anything. Shimamura, even after realizing he is in love with Komako, doesn't do anything. The beauty of their relationship lies in their inaction, indulgence, and pensiveness. These attributes were frozen into colorful yet subtle moments. I enjoyed such images."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"During the time that this book was written many people believed that becoming a modern, industrialized, country meant loneliness and detachment for the people of Japan, which is the main theme of the Snow Country. This theme of melancholy is portrayed through the love affair between an onsen geisha named Komako and a Japanese businessman named Shimamura. I believe that Komako and the snow country represents the old Japan, the one with traditional values such as Shintoism, Confucian hierarchy, and the traditional role of women. While Shimamura and technology represents the modern Japan because Shimamura is a business man, he rides a train to and from his home in Tokyo, and the use of telegraph systems in the snow country. Modern technology can also be seen as killing the old Japan because a movie projector burns down a silkworm cocoon storage barn and possibly kills one of the main characters.Honestly, I kind of had a hard time with this book, even though it is a very easy read, only 192 pages. The storyline is very confusing and time will fast forward without much warning. I was also really disappointed with the ending, it is way to abrupt and has no sense of closure, I turned the last page and thought \\"really that's it?\\". Although in my history class we decided this was the author's way to take another jab at western culture because western books spelled everything out for the reader and he wanted his readers to think for themselves. Over time I did start to gain a soft spot for Komako even though she did come off as a bit crazy and an alcoholic, but I was unable to feel anything for Shimamura who was remained cold and detached throughout the whole book.I would only recommend this book to people who already posses a knowledge about Japanese culture and history or posses an extreme love of Japan. I think one of the main reasons I was able to gain anything from this book is because it was assigned in a history of Japan class and I had the teacher for guidance."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet like the novel. It's been brought up constantly that the prose is akin to a haiku in its simplicity yet depth of meaning and that's a perfect way to look at what is known as the masterpiece of this Nobel Prize winner's wonderful career. At the heart of the story is an ill-fated love affair between two people who know that it can never work out. Somehow, the backdrop, what gives the book its name, becomes another character in this tale that often reminded me of Ha Jin's \\"Waiting\\" and to a certain extent, \\"Kokoro.\\" This is the type of book that has to be digested slowly as you are apt to miss much of what is going on if you zip through it the way I did the first time I read it. Once you have a second go you can see the intricacies of the love affair and the way that Kawabata deftly presents each of his characters. Don't read this on the subway - relish every moment sitting back during a long cold night."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"This haunting book must reverberate inside any still-beating heart with the troubling pang of recognition.The circumstances of one's cultural background (say, maybe you are not Japanese...) will not forbid you entry into this world.

Even if you don't like him, you will understand something of his disaffected life. You come from the book feeling that you have visited a real place, and that you are haunted by it.

One does not have to belong to japanese culture to fully understand the character's predicaments."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"This story surrounds an arrogant, idealistic man, Shimamura, who is completely cut off from his true feelings. He uses a young prostitute, 20 year-old Komako, in the snow country of Japan to connect to his rigid ideals of love and beauty. She realizes the reason for his affections but allows herself to fall in love with him anyway. Twisted into this tale is another young girl, Yoko(not a prostitute), who also meets the main character's ideals. Symbolically, Yoko represents Komako's inner self. This is exemplified in Yoko's flaming death at the end of the novel. Yoko is Komako herself, burned and destroyed in the flames of her futile love for Shimamura. The story sounds powerful, and it is, but a great deal is lost in Seidensticker's translation."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"I read the novel Snow country by Kawabata in both Japanese and in English almost simultaneously. Upon doing this however, I found that some parts of the book were poorly translated, some even giving it a different meaning. So if you do get a chance to read the book I highly recommend reading it in its original language. I am not discouraging anyone from reading the book for it was beautifully composed in it giving a very sensational and descriptive tone to the book, which is a very evident character in Kawabata's books."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Snow Country, Nobel winner Yasunari Kawabata's masterpiece, is about a love affair between a wealthy Tokyo dilettante and a hot springs geisha. The affair occurs over the course of the man's three visits to the hot springs town in the extreme cold northwest of Japan, thus the title. What would be understood to a reader who understands historical Japanese social lines but not by others is that hot springs geishas were considered lower class than the more culturally refined geishas of Tokyo and Kyoto. These towns were not like hot springs towns in the west, where men and women and families went to rest and recuperate. In Japan, these towns were essentially playgrounds for men. Thus the social and cultural backdrop of this novels set-up implies that this affair is doomed from the start. Our jobs as readers then is to observe the often subtle interplay between the two as their relationship unfolds.This book is indeed very subtly portrayed. Relationships are introduced, but not explained. We are shown many images left to our own interpretations. One might even need to read the book twice to get that there's a love affair going on at all. Komako, the geisha, shows us the passion she feels for Shimamura, her lover, through crazed and often indecipherable rants. She is in love, kicking against the restraints that refuse her love true fulfillment. But Shimamura is cold, and often frustrated with Komako's tirades. We have to trust that he loves her because, as he says, \\"Why else would anyone come to such a place in December?\\" Finally another woman, Yoko, further draws his attention away from Komako.Kawabata is writing with haiku in mind, both in his austere prose and his use of nature--the changes in seasons as a metaphor for the changing relationship, for example. Like haiku, his writing is rich in its imagery, and realizations come in flashes, such as when Shimamura recognizes love transience from his contemplation of the sturdy Chijimi linen made in the region.The novel effectively ends upon Shimamura's subtle transformation, yet it is Komako's constant degradation that keeps our hearts engaged throughout. Her position has changed for the worse with each of Shimamura's visits. We know that even though she's young, it has already been determined that her life will not be joyful. Shimamura often observes that Komako is wasting time with many of her hobbies, such as writing in her diary. But his whole life is a waste. He writes about dances he's never seen, for fun. And it's her wasted love that will most affect the reader.Snow Country is a difficult book. Not difficult in the Ulysses sense, but difficult in its subtlety. It will require multiple readings to tease out its secrets. Luckily, it's short and beautifully written. And it leaves the aftertaste of a work that's hiding things worth finding, so most readers will want to read it again anyway."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Kawabata's Snow Country is a small masterpiece, a love story that is as subtle as it is intense. It takes place in a remote hot springs in western Japan and centers around a romance between the morose Shimamura and the world-weary Komako. This takes place over a few visits during several months, and as the novel reaches its conclusion both characters are filled with deep feelings for the other as dense as the all-covering snow that continually falls and seems to lock them in further confusion and torment. Kawabata sets a perfect pitch here, with the right amount of imagery and action, all while maintaining a delicate balance of emotion and restraint. Nuanced scenes follow one after the other, each one raising the stakes and further deepening the connection between these people who you get to care about because of how sparingly they are portrayed. The subjective ending feels just right, and is a fitting final note to such a haunting story. This is a book to take in slowly, ideally in a late winter's night."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Simply put, Snow Country is an incomplete work which tiptoes around the weakly-told tale of a vacationing husband and his relationship with an atypical geisha."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"I'm being generous with the one star rating. I would've given it a zero but a rating that low is impossible. There was no plot to this book. The action is so subtle that it is impossible to follow. And the ending with the observations of the Milky Way, what was that all about? It made absolutely no sense. There was no point to this book and I must say that reading it was the biggest waste of my time. There's several hours of my life I'll never get back..."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Kawabata is a master at images. He is able to bring readers to tears and emotional highs with exquisite composition of words. Snow Country is a sad story of wasted emotions and inescapable lives, and Kawabata's writing fits perfectly with the gloomy moods of the plot. The snow, mountains, indoor furnitures, clothes, sounds,and facial description of characters are so brilliantly written that it leaves the readers in awe. Kawabata, whose lyricism is so vivid and exquisite, can only be paralleled by F. Scott Fitzgerald in the contemporary era."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"A very symbolic and psychological novel in which nature is a very important backdrop. I felt a plane of silence, the silence of snow, throughout the novel. I felt the internal bleakness of the characters. Komako is the representation of beauty and love going to waste. She shows that both love and beauty are transient. She lives in the snow country, but she is always beautifully red. This shows her desperation and the love which she is denied. Both women are symbolic of beauty and love, but they will both go to decay in the snow country. They are like their images on glass, which are transient things."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Yasunari Kawabata won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1968. In 1972 he was found dead, allegedly by suicide. But what he left us with was a rich and wonderful collection of literature that will be read and enjoyed for decades.While he professedPalm-of-the-Hand Storiesto be his greatest and most rewarding works over his career andThe Master of Goto be his favorite novel (though based closely on real events), the world at large considers Snow Country to be his true masterpiece.This is not written like a traditional novel. The plot moves slowly and meanders. Paragraphs are often written in a very musical style, almost Haiku like in flow. Rather than describe every minute action, Kawabata describes scenes or emotions. The reader, if patient, is richly rewarded. Especially with multiple readings. We follow Shimamura and Komaka along their ill fated romance. Though the story is of overall importance, it is my humble opinion that the scenes and feelings evoked by the description of these scenes is the most important aspect of this novel.The novel is short (170 pages or so in my copy), and even with a slow reading it doesn't take too long to complete. I read it first over the course of a couple of afternoons, then re-read it slowly over the course of a few weeks, while reading other works in between. Both times were rewarding in their own way.It's not a huge commitment to read this, being that it is kind of short, so I recommend taking the time to explore this author and this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"This 1956 Nobel Prize winning book has become a classic. It is set in the snow country of Japan, an area which is cold and frosty for most of the year. This of course is a metaphor for the relationship between two lovers. The man is a wealthy businessman from Tokyo who leaves his wife and children several times a year to visit the snow country where he spends his time enjoying the baths. The woman is a young geisha who has to go to parties and entertain men but falls in love with the businessman. Often, she is drunk. Always she is needy. However, he does not return her passion.This book gives the reader a sense of a time and a place and a social contract that has gone on in Japan for centuries. Throughout, there is a feeling of sadness and despair. I felt very sorry for the geisha and was not surprised at the unhappy ending.However, this book is a classic and I am glad that I read it. It introduced me to a time and place and a way of life that unfortunately still exists. It is a tale told with subtlety and a command of language that makes this story all too real."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"In Japanese the term \\"Yukiguni\\", or \\"Snow Country\\", is used to describe those areas of western Honshu, between the mountains and the Sea of Japan, which receive large amounts of snow in winter, and it is in this area that the novel is set. The action takes place during the 1930s. Shimamura, a wealthy man from Tokyo, arrives in a remote hot spring resort in the mountains, where he engages in an affair with Komako, a local geisha.The resort in this book is not a typical family holiday resort in the sense that Westerners would understand the term. The tradition in Japan appears to have been for hot springs in the Snow Country to cater for male travellers travelling alone in search of female companionship. The geishas found in such resorts were different to the geishas found in major cities, who are primarily entertainers. Hot spring geishas were expected to \\"entertain\\" their male patrons in both senses of that verb, and, as the translator Edward Seidensticker points out in his introduction, the pretence that she was an artist and not a prostitute was often a thin one indeed. The romance (if it deserves that name) between Komako and Shimamura is therefore a doomed one; she is in love with him, but not vice-versa. He may be in love with her beauty, and her arts, but that is not the same thing. Kawabata paints Shimamura as a shallow dilettante and playboy; the most telling detail about his character is that although he claims to be an expert on Western ballet his knowledge of it is derived entirely from books. He has never actually seen a ballet in his life- a detail symbolising his distancing of himself from life.The fact that Yasunari Kawabata won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1968 suggests that his work has been appreciated in the West as well as in his native country, but he strikes me as being a writer who is stylistically and aesthetically quite different to most Western novelists, more different than other Japanese writers I have read such as Shusaku Endo and Haruki Murakami. (Kawabata appears to have been part of a movement which rejected Western literary influences, unlike some of his contemporaries who were greatly influenced by European Naturalism). I did, however, derive some assistance from Seidensticker's useful introduction. One point the translator makes is that Kawabata was influenced by the Japanese tradition of haiku poetry. These very brief 17-syllable poems may seem as different from the novel as it is possible for a literary form to be, but Seidensticker points out that in \\"Snow Country\\" Kawabata makes use of some of the characteristics of the haiku, such as sudden sensory impressions giving rise to an awareness of beauty.Another Japanese cultural characteristic present in the work is what has been called \\"mono no aware\\", or \\"the sadness of things\\"- a sense of wistfulness at the transience and impermanence of all earthly things. Seidensticker describes the geisha Komako herself as \\"a particularly poignant symbol of wasted, decaying beauty\\", but many of the natural phenomena mentioned are also things noted for their fleeting, transient character, such as the autumn leaves or the snow itself.My main difficulty with this book was that of trying to overcome my own cultural expectations and trying to enter into the author's very different world. Certainly, if one tries to read this as a Western-style novel it is likely to prove a disappointment- the plot, particularly the ending, is rather enigmatic and the characterisation is not very deep. It does, however, hold interest for a Western readership in the insights it gives us into another culture, not only though the descriptions of Japanese life contained in the text but also through its revelation of a cultural aesthetic quite different to our own."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Kawabata's novels retain timeless appeal for their lyricism, his aesthetic discourse over beauty, and his characters' inner struggles with human longing. In his classic Yukiguni (Snow Country), he paints a story of a discontent city-dweller who finds solace in a maiden's simple beauty and sporadic love for her temporary guest, which are only magnified by the harshness of a cold countryside tinged with icicles and a closed society's wrath. In what some may call the Japanese fashion, Kawabata invites the reader to imagine great depths of human emotion without using so many words."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Published in 1957 this work is reminiscent of Thomas Mann in that its lead character Shimamura is an aesthete and one with plenty of free time on his hands. Unlike Mann's characters, however, who never indulge themselves in the earthen paradise of the senses Kawabatas characters do. Are they better off for it? Hard to say. This book is Shimamura's sensual vacation but still he remains at a distance even while his every sense is indulged by the geisha Komako who seems to be offering him something more than the usual host of pleasures. The writing is poetic describing the snow covered mountains but like the mountains one senses there is something strangely remote about Shimamura as well. It is never quite clear just what until the end. Several possibilities will gently rest on the mind as one reads this mystery which I am quite sure Mann himself would have admired."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"I can't believe it's over. The most perfect book I've ever read, and an unmitigated 5 stars. Kawabata's use of imagery and metaphor is unsurpassed, and the book is almost overwhelmingly sensory. Beautiful, just beautiful."},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"So Poetic, so descriptive, so full of little details in every page that you can almost feel the snow !"},{"Title":"Snow Country","review":"Snow Country is an oddly written stark work, economical in how it's written, it is also etherial, something beyond the human reach, especially for the protagonist Shimamura, a married man and a kind of self proclaimed \\"expert\\" in the art of a particular form of Japanese ballet; he's rather apathetic towards his work, almost dismissive, although he does have a noted reputation in the field. Yet, he wants to get out and goes to the hot springs of Snow Country. While there, he meets a Westernized geisha by the name of Komako, almost a pouty, childlike girl rather than a refined and reserved geisha. She does not fit the typical profile of a geisha. She parties, gets drunk, has temper tantrums, uses sheet music to play the traditional Japanese musical instrument, and by all accounts, is devoted to Shimamura. She hangs around him and enters and leaves his bedroom whenever she feels like it. She does this much to the dismay of Yoko, a kind of geisha house mother who oversees the inn where the guests stay.The lives of these three individuals get entwined at the latter part of the novel as to make it quite shocking, at least for me. The love of Komako and Shimamura could obviously never be, primarily because Shimamura is a married man, and a relationship with a geisha would be next to impossible. The relationship was doomed before it really ever had the opportunity to bloom. The destruction of the relationship explodes, but in a way that readers will not fully expect, especially when they get to the latter half of the novel, whereby things really get ahead. Snow Country may seem simple, especially in the short and sweet way that it is written, like a haiku format, it is not as easy as one would think. I actually had to put the book down a couple of times in order to try and truly absorb what Kawabata was trying to convey. Off and on, I could understand the dynamics between Komako, Shimamura and Yoko, and it made the ending really powerful and eye-opening. I can understand why it took Kawabata such a long time to write this novel, for it is pretty intense and laborious, never mind for the reader but for the author to think in such a way. Lastly, this book may not be for everybody, for Japanese, Chinese and Asian writing in general is truly a unique reading experience in the annals of global literature. Some readers may be put off and others may think they died and went to reading Heaven. If you are hesitant, definitely get it from the library. Snow Country was a fulfilling read for me, albeit different and unusual."},{"Title":"A Face First","review":"I thought this book was absolutely wonderful.

One of the main flaws I noticed was that the author never gives the reader a reason to care for the main character At certain times, especially near the end of the book, the focus would shift between characters, making it more and more evident that the author had very little (if anything) to write about. Leah was the main character for a few pages. So was Kelley's mother at one point. Another flaw, which demonstrated the author's lack of mental effort and perhaps interest in her own book was her constant inclusion of facts that had no relevance to the main plot whatsoever. As far as I'm concerned, going to the store to buy mayonnaise, removing a baby bird from a parking lot, and an older sister's boyfriend have absolutely nothing to do with recovering from a burn wound. Facts like this were repeatedly included in the book, squeezed between incorrect punctuation and placed in poorly worded sentences. I even noticed a chapter which seemed to have no ending. These elements of the story caused me, rather than a feeling of empathy, a feeling of disgust, disrespect and hatred for the main character.The whole hospital saga, which should have been summarized in 10 pages or less is dragged on for around 100 pages. In this half of the book, the main character encounters a thoughtful nurse and goes through her operations. It is at first quite interesting but then takes an enourmous plunge into a bottomless pit of wasted time and boredom for the reader. There is a tedious cycle that is repeated again and again for an uneventful 100+ pages of the book. Kelly gets letters, a visit from mom, a call from her sister and a visit from the nurse again and again throughout her stay in the hospital and Priscilla Cummings actually has the nerve to make us read through this same set of events repeatedly. Other than surgeries every 3 chapters, there are no other events worth knowing about that occur in the hospital.After the hospital saga comes another. It is more eventful but less important. I found that I was suddenly reading about normal people living a normal life. This half of the book included many pointless events in which the main characters do normal things. For the reader, it seems as though they are suddenly on the set of an MTV reality show in which a random person is being filmed while sitting on a couch, reading a book, watching TV, going to an art gallery, doing school work or some other activity in which you are thoroughly uninterested.For my brain, the experience of reading this book was like plowing through a ten-foot-high pile of snow in a Volks Wagon beetle convertible."},{"Title":"The Queen of the Sixth Grade (Kennedy School Kids)","review":"The Book I have been reading for the past few weeks is Queen of the Sixth Grade by Ilene Cooper.The book is about a 12 year old girl named Robin and her best friend Veronica.

Ghostwritten by minister and former editor of the Bristol Herald Courier Howard Taylor, Griffin's story starts in late 1951 when he decides to drop out of high school, join the Army, serve in Korea, return home and his subsequent search for the boy 20 years later.As exciting as the premise is, there's not much meat to this story, unfortunately. Upon a routine supply stop in Seoul, Griffin stumbles upon a young shoeshine boy named Ko Yong Jae and, feeling an instant sense of trust in him, hires him, nicknames him \\"Butch\\" and takes him back to the camp. After managing to allow the boy to stay so long as he stays out of trouble, Butch earns his keep by becoming the houseboy for Griffin and several other soldiers. They endure a few hardships together but above all, they become close friends despite a language barrier. About a year later, after their friendship developed into a surrogate father-son relationship, Griffin rotates back to the states and loses touch with Butch. Griffin struggles with PTSD back home and frantically opens his own service station and even marries a nice, church-going local girl. From here on the book loses it's mainstream appeal.This book is saturated with Christian doctrine and religious references that tend to alienate the reader. It slows down the narrative. It's also frightfully repetitive. Not only does the tale of searching for the houseboy get retold five times before the first chapter even starts (counting the cover, back cover, foreword, preface, and prologue), many of the same Bible verses are quoted throughout the story in vaguely inopportune times; Matthew chapter 6 verse 33 is listed at least three times. While I certainly have no qualms with a man's religious faith and the strength that one gathers from it, this book's story is bogged down by it's choice of literary detours.After a bumpy middle, the story resumes with Griffin suddenly inventing those cardboard floor mats you might have seen at the car dealership. You know, those temporary mats that keep your car's carpet clean from the service technician? Griffin invented that.Flash forward to sudden wealth, Griffin contemplates going back to Korea to find Butch. After a hesitate travel commitment, he joins a group of religious tourists who plan on visiting East Asian churches. Griffin agrees to come along as a motivational speaker but he also has personal plans to find Butch, despite so many telling him the impossibility of doing so.Anticlimactically, Griffin convinces a local paper to run a short piece about his plea, Butch's cousin reads it and within a day, they are reunited. Not much of a search, really. Butch has done well for his family and drives a taxicab. The two are reunited. No canvasing the streets. No private detective. Just a small story in an even smaller newspaper.This part of the tale happens just past the halfway point in the book and yet nothing much else progresses past this point. Butch is elated to be reunited with the former soldier who showed him kindness and Griffin is simply amazed at Butch's presence. That's what gets repeated over. Griffin can't believe Butch is here. He can't believe he's back in Korea. He can't believe this is where such and such happened. The author assumes entirely too much background information and leaves the reader wishing that he were in on the excitement. It's hard to relate to Griffin's nostalgia of being back in Korea because he indulged so little in the beginning of the story. It doesn't have that certain empathetic emotional connection that a good story should have. There are moments that were surely emotional for the two men but because the reader hadn't had a chance to get to know the key players well enough, you end up not really caring that they are visiting some obscure village that you didn't know about. Despite a satisfying amount of personal photographs help to accompany the story, I never really got the chance to feel attached to anyone.A curious oversight is the age of the two men. Griffin was either 18 or 19 when he met Butch and sized him up at around 10. However, the Korean newspaper listed Butch as being 15 at the time. That only makes them a few years apart when they assumed a father-son type relationship. When they meet up again in 1974, their lack of real age gap shows. I wonder why this wasn't addressed?Impressively, this vanity publishing has gone through several editions. The most current edition that I could find is from 1986 but the original story was written and published in 1974. Each addition has added another chapter to the epilogue but sadly, there weren't many revelations. True stories certainly don't have Hollywood endings and here is proof.Ultimately, it's a short, forgettable true story that can be finished in one sitting. I really wanted to like this, but in the end, it felt like an elongated newspaper article soaked in Christian rhetoric. It's a touching story that should have been told by someone else."},{"Title":"Assessing Writing Across the Curriculum: Diverse Approaches and Practices (Perspectives on Writing)","review":"This book applied very on target approaches for integrating writing across the curriculum.

I feel compelled to comment upon the extreme coincidence, not only of finding this book but of a circumstance which is even stranger yet: Inside the book were some very old but unused postcards of the Olsson Motel -- ironically, this is where my wife and I spent the night, off the beaten path and many miles from Bellingrath, on the night of our own stay in that region. I laughed as I saw, on the postcard, the newly-planted trees in front of the motel which are now huge old shade-makers, dominating the property's landscape!That little story being out of the way, I can suggest with confidence that anyone interested in either travel or botanical gardens (or arboretums) will much enjoy this 7 1/2\\" x 9,\\" 50-page hardcover \\"coffee table\\" book, (the pages are not numbered.) My copy is the 1958 one (a First Edition, unstated) and the Bellingrath Gardens has not changed a great deal since that time -- the property, formerly the home of Walter D. Bellingrath, (1869-1955 and founder of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company), is just spectacular.The book is bulging with superb color photographs of the many magical spots throughout the gardens which are located alongside of the Isle Aux-Oies River. The photos were taken by Bill Shrout, William W. Lavendar, and Fred W. Holder. There's not a lot of text in this book but it does include a brief history of the property, a biography of Walter D. Bellingrath, and a color map of the estate grounds. About half of the photos are dedicated to the home interior and its impedimenta, the latter ranging from the crystal and silver room to beautiful examples of French and English bisque.Nicely bound with a sturdy black cover, try to obtain a copy with the green dust jacket with a photograph of the reflecting pool on the front.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Reading to Tonbridge line (Locomotion papers)","review":"This is an excellent and informative introduction to the subject, and is recommended for anyone interested in the history of minor British railways. This edition is 72 pages with 16 pages of photographs included in the page numbering, and with maps and track plans in the text. It is No. 79 in the Oakwood Press' Locomotion Papers, from 1974.From the Introduction -\\"The Reading to Tonbridge line has many unusual features. The eastern portion of it was amongst the first railways to be constructed and for nearly thirty years ranked amongst the main lines, carrying the highest in the land on their trips to and from the continent. The western portion on the other hand was a rather messy conception, using in part another company's lines, and extending to an area in which a company entitled the South Eastern Railway had no business to be. There can be no doubt that the eastern arm would not have been built if Parliament had granted to the SER any of the earlier-planned routes to Dover and the western arm would not have been purchased at all had saner considerations ruled. Not surprisingly, in its later days the line was only grudgingly kept in use and it did not attain the status of \`The Reading-Tonbridge Line' until 1965, when the authorities finally accepted that the various portions of it could not be closed, and altered the passenger time-table to present the line as a unit.\\"The Contents are -P02: IntroductionP03: Planning and Construction - Tonbridge LineP06: The Reading BranchP10: The Route DescribedP21: From South Eastern to British RailP29-44: PhotographsP45: Train Services [with sample timetables]P57: LocomotivesP61: Rolling Stock (Steam)P64: DMU StockP65: SignallingP66: AccidentsP67: Betchworth QuarriesP70: Conclusion; Bibliography; Acknowledgements"},{"Title":"The New Magdalen","review":"I love this book!

Beginning with his mother, Glenn chronologically informs the reader of his experiences with women. He uses a no holds barred approach and tells it all-the good, the bad, and the ugly. The work, as the author describes, is \\"a book of poetry with a story in between,\\" meaning that after each chapter, the author presents a correlating poetic work.While reading What Women Teach, I was hoping that the author showed more insight as to what he learned from the women in his life. The book began and ended with this premise; however, the bulk of the book only tells of how Glenn exploited and used women. A self-proclaimed narcissist, Glenn at times seems proud of his philandering and \\"player\\" ways. Although at the end he seemed to truly be repentant for all of his wrongdoings, I felt as though he should have put much more emphasis on the knowledge that he acquired as opposed to all of his drama. Overall, the book was an average read, although I enjoyed the commentary Glenn provided on his views of the family and the state of the Black family. For this reviewer, it was his poetry that definitely enhanced the work as a whole.Reviewed by Latoya Carter-QawiyyAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"What Women Teach: One Man's Journey","review":"From the passage about his temptation with Basil, I found Patrick Glenn to be a fornicator and a liar. I had to examine the impetus behind this book from the escapades he describes and found that the hypocrisy is so stark, that is dominates and casts a gloomy shadow in his real life. I found this memoir the saga of a serial killer, \\"a womanizer\\", who abuses women through their integral vulnerabilities, the sex and their baby.One Sunday afternoon when I was three months pregnant with my first child, Patrick Glenn told me \\"I will never leave you.\\" I am 25 years old and Patrick exploited me, leaving me without any support by the time we were 5 months into our pregnancy. If you read this autobiographical piece, you must evaluate the author's character.I can't imagine how many tears and how brutal his relationship with his first wife's was, and this is what he did to me."},{"Title":"What Women Teach: One Man's Journey","review":"I really enjoyed Mr. Glenn's book.I found it interesting.

The larger the better, though smaller print is acceptable in most classical and earlier pieces and a few Romantic pieces. Not so in Mahler's gigantic symphonies. I feel that the score should be the full size of some of scores of his later symphonies (Dover). There were times where I had to squint or look twice to see the score properly.That is my only problem with the score.

The pastorale first movement of the Symphony No.1 in D Major, the Titan, is particularly noteworthy in the way Mahler paints with music. The movement slowly builds to a thunderous climax when the brass enter with resplendent glory. This is followed by two movements that are reminiscient of folk melodies--including the inverted, minor-mode theme from Fr&egrave;re Jacques. It is concluded with a thunderous finale. The second symphony in c minor continues a powerful motif that now adds the power of the human voice. The thunderous finale of this symphony brings together a massive orchestra with chorus. Imagine 10 French horns, 8 trumpets, 4 trombones and a tuba proclaiming a glorius finish.

Jonathan Edwards' famous sermon,"},{"Title":"Biscuit Bliss: 101 Foolproof Recipes for Fresh and Fluffy Biscuits in Just Minutes","review":"James Villas is an old school culinary writer. He was a friend and confidant of both James Beard and Craig Claiborne. He was born and raised in North Carolina and many of his books have featured Southern cooking subjects and styles. This book is no exception.The book is an almost perfect follow-up to his last effort, \`Crazy About Casseroles' in that both books deal with a single subject which is at the core of both Southern and American cooking styles. I am especially fond of single subject cookbooks, whether the subject is a style of dish like gratins and casseroles or an ingredient like potatoes or eggs. Therefore, the score of this book starts with a score in my mind of four (4) stars instead of three (3) before I even read the first page.The book's subject can be divided into two major topics. The first topic is basic biscuit techniques, covering all the variations in flour, leavening, fat, oven temperature, and dough versus batter. The second topic deals with how to apply all those various techniques to sweet and savory additions.Techniques are covered in Chapters on \`Biscuit Basics', \`Plain Raised Biscuits', and \`Drop Biscuits'. The greatest virtue of basic biscuit technique is its simplicity. This does not mean a person can make good biscuits, much less make good biscuits on the first try, after reading a single recipe that gives no insight into biscuit subtleties. The first batch of biscuits I made a few years ago was from Jim Villas' mother's recipes he published in his memoir \`Between Bites'. I confess that the process had me puzzled, sticky, and a bit disappointed, even though I am sure I followed the instructions to a tee.Part of the puzzle may be due to the fact that making biscuits is a lot more like making pastry than it is like making bread. While bread is vigorously kneaded to develop gluten and the starting mix of ingredients is often warm to accommodate the yeast or other organic starter, biscuits are worked with cold ingredients and low protein (soft) flour. The dough is worked hardly at all and is cut into disks while the fat is still in oatmeal flaked globs. Sounds like pastry to me.As I have had a fair amount of experience with various recipes from both Southern bakers and baking experts, I can say with confidence that Mr. Villas knows his stuff when it comes to biscuits. I thoroughly endorse his recommendation to use a brand of Southern soft flour such as White Lily. I only have two disappointments with the discussion of techniques. First, Villas describes a classic Southern method of biscuit making wherein the cook empties an entire 5 pound bag of flour into a bowl, adds wet ingredients, salt, and leavenings, and creates a ball of dough in a depression in the dough. Yet, Villas does not give us the recipe for this technique. He doesn't even explain why he doesn't give a recipe. I know there are still serious Southern cooks who use this technique, as I saw one demonstrate the technique on Martha Stewart's show about a year ago. The second disappointment is that he has no basic recipe where the only fat is butter. I have used such a recipe by Nick Malgieri with White Lily flour and buttermilk, and I find it as good or better than Villas' mother's recipe. Otherwise, I think the coverage of biscuit techniques is tiptop. Were I writing the same thing, I may have included a table comparing the recipes. This may facilitate one's personal experiments in the technique. I would also argue that basic biscuit technique is a better starting point for adolescent bakers than the drop biscuit technique. I don't think drop biscuit technique is easier and the basic technique is more versatile.The second main subject of the book is what you can do with biscuits and biscuit dough. This can be divided roughly into four areas: sweet additions, savory additions, scones, and biscuits as pastry. Appropriate to the title of this review, the range of variations possible in biscuits gives me the idea that a home entertainer can give all their books on French and Spanish and Italian and Greek \`little bites' recipes a rest and spend several months experimenting with hors d'ourves / antipasti / tapas / Mezes based on biscuits. As soon as I write this, I confess that even the lightest biscuits may be a bit heavy to stand alone among the martinis and margaritas, but I do suggest that you give the pizza and foccacia a rest and give these recipes a try. As biscuits, like chowder, are very close to being a true American invention, they are perfect as part of American cooking menus.While I am often surprised at how new many kitchen techniques such as baking powder are, I am also often surprised at how old some methods are. Many techniques such as cooking in a bag and using packaged dough as stew topping are touted as new ideas based on marketed products, when actually the techniques are centuries old. Such is the case with using biscuits as a topping for pot pies and casseroles. Villas raises the veil from our eyes in revealing the historical sources for these old biscuit techniques.I liked this book a lot and I recommend it to anyone who wishes to master biscuits and who may find a gold mine of quick, relatively easy recipes with a big \`wow' factor.Highly recommended. Intermediate skill level."},{"Title":"Biscuit Bliss: 101 Foolproof Recipes for Fresh and Fluffy Biscuits in Just Minutes","review":"Why would I go out to buy a whole book, even if it's a fairly small book, just on something so simple as how to make biscuits.Because I've never been happy with the biscuits that I've made. The ones made by my grandmother, let alone the ones made by the grandmother of a friend of mine, are so much better than the ones I've been able to make.I found though, that Mr. Villas has the same problem. In his case it was a great-aunt. She threw in a little of this, a little of that, put them in the oven, and then without even looking to see if they were ready, she'd take them out -- perfect biscuits. ==Instead, the rest of us have to follow recipes, try this, try that and finally come up with biscuits that at least begin to approach grandmothers.Here in this book is several pages of what you might call biscuit lore -- what kind of fat, yeast, flour (where do you get Southern flour made from soft winter wheat). Well you can order it through the mail, but you pay $7 for shipping $2 worth of flour -- that's OK, it's worth it, after all, that's the way you have to order good quality grits.I haven't tried all 101 'foolproof' recipes in the book.

It was a complete success. My boyfriend couldn't stop eating them. Then I made the oatmeal raisin biscuits. Also a complete success. Needless to say, I have made biscuits 4 times since I bought the book. I have turned into a biscuit making fool, and I haven't even had the book a week yet. If your skeptical, don't be. This book is GREAT. I am even able to adapt the recipes. I make frosting for my biscuits. I must warn you in advance- make a lot of biscuits, because if your feeding a family, they are gone quickly.

There are even a few recipes that use whole-grain flours such as whole wheat. Many of the recipes include historical or personal notes that are fun to read and add interesting background to the process. Helpful hints include tips on freezing biscuits, as well as the all-important note for Northerners that finally saved my biscuit attempts when Alton shared it: if you use hard Northern flour, substitute cake flour for some of it.The book includes plain raised biscuits, flavored biscuits, drop biscuits, cocktail and tea biscuits, scones, and recipes that allow you to cook with biscuits. There are plenty of hearty recipes in here such as biscuits with bacon and cheese in them (one of my favorites). There are also more subtly-flavored choices such as the parmesan-herb drop biscuits and the sweet potato biscuits (which work surprisingly well with canned pumpkin). The scones are far better than any commercial scones I've had before--not too sweet, not too dry.Whether you want to go all-out with biscuits fried in lard on the top of the stove or make something out of buttermilk or whole grains; whether you prefer traditional favorites or unusual combinations such as parmesan and chutney--you'll find the perfect never-fail biscuit recipe in here.

I was a bit skeptical: Depending on how the recipe directions are portrayed/explained, he is capable of reading things into them or out of them--as in ingredients added in, ingredients left out, amounts read incorrectly. Sound familiar?Well, here I am--a month or so down the road and many, many biscuits in the tummy--to claim that this book turned us into biscuit-making fools. The recipes are easy to read, laid out in such a way as to be easy to interpret and understand, and provide plenty of variety.This is not just a Southern biscuit book; there are representations from all over.

I recommend this for volume for: folks who love to eat biscuits; those who love Southern regional food; cookbook collectors; and anyone who wants to master the art of biscuit making from scratch. (You'll never want to mess with canned biscuits again.)Now I admit, I'm prejudiced in Mr. Villas' favor. This makes the fifth cookbook of his I own.

He is thorough here, giving all the information required as far as the why and wherefore of ingredients (including where to obtain them if you're outside the South, but wanting to experience the \\"real deal\\"). He'll tell you about equipment, biscuit history, and how to obtain perfection in your biscuits. If he left anything out, I didn't notice. But, even if you never bake a single pan of biscuits, this is a fun read for foodies.FYI I offer this information about my favorite James Villas cookbook, written with and from the recipe collection of his mother, Martha Pearl Villas entitled : \\"MY MOTHER'S SOUTHERN KITCHEN, Recipes and Reminicences.\\" It is apparently out of print at this time, although I can't imagine why. I have an embarassingly huge collection of Southern cookbooks and many favorites among them. However, if I had to give them all away but one, \\"My Mother's Southern Kitchen\\" would be that ultimate \\"keeper\\". This is the cooking that I grew up with, that my Gran and her sisters taught me, and that they served up every day of their lives.There are very few recipes in this cookbook which do not have an introduction, a special technique or suggestion, or a little story attached. (I love this kind of stuff.) I have similar cookbooks in my collection, but nothing written with the clarity and charm of this one. Every recipe I've made from Martha Pearl (there are two other volumes as well, one on entertaining and another on desserts) has been totally successful and not only a feast for the belly, but the spirit as well.So, if you run across this Villas collaboration at a used book or trader's store, find it on Ebay, or at a flea market, whereever, just snap it up. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Biscuit Bliss: 101 Foolproof Recipes for Fresh and Fluffy Biscuits in Just Minutes","review":"Bought this for my grown daughter who wanted to start baking biscuits.

The recipes looked great and so I tried the Mother's Buttermilk Biscuit recipe . I deviated a little by adding a 1/4 of tsp of vanilla extract to my butter milk and used 1/2 cup chilled butter flavor shortening rather than 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon sugar but things came out great! The flavor was awesome! I could have stood a lil more rise but that may have to do with the amount of shortening I added, making them a lil heavier than normal? IDK...I'll have to experiment. And they weren't too sweet either. I'll have to experiment! I so loved the texture! Wooohooo!! I also made a cream cheese spread to slather on top of the biscuits with maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract and a lil lemon juice for brightness. OMG!

It is as an accessible introduction to postmodernism and theology as I have seen. This book would be useful as a discussion text for an educated adult Sunday School class, who would find it useful, tough and rewarding. It is an excellent book for pastors who wonder what all this &quot;postmodernism&quot; stuff is all about and how it relates to them. It has a point of view---in defining the Enlightenment as the &quot;Age of Reasoned Criticism&quot; rather than the &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, Riggs is able to link postmodernism not as the &quot;post modern&quot; but in David Ray Griffin's apt term, the &quot;most modern.&quot; While this is a legitimate criticism of postmodern theorists, in the hands of process theologians like Riggs this opens the door for the argument that process theology is &quot;really post-modern,&quot; an argument that only seems convincing to process theologians. Process thought is a totalizing schema and thus is inherently modernist and antithetical to postmodernism. That being said, &quot;Postmodern Christianity&quot; is a valuable book for pastors, interested and educated Christians and students."},{"Title":"Postmodern Christianity: Doing Theology in the Contemporary World","review":"An impressive body of work by John W. Riggs (Associate Professor of Historical Theology and Church History at Eden Theological Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri), Postmodern Christianity: Doing Theology In The Contemporary World offers the proposition that postmodernism and Christianity both have much to offer one another, and should scrutinize one another while avoiding complete acceptance or rejection. A thoughtful analysis of the common ground between philosophy and theology, Postmodern Christianity is a timely and welcome addition to Christian Theological Studies reference collections and personal reading lists."},{"Title":"The Violent Land (Large Print Western)","review":"This novel won the 1954 Spur Award for best western novel of the year.

Dan, who is alienated with his father, goes to work for a local, and powerful, cattleman. He soon finds himself caught in a feud between the cattleman and the settlers. He is also caught between his affections for a young woman, who is believed to be of ill repute, and his own upbringing.

They are grittier and more true to life than early Heilein and far more violent than anything but Starship Troopers, but the violence moves the plot and is for a reason. These books are for adults (though the sex when there is any is far less detailed than the adverage bodice ripper) due to the graphic nature of the violence and the adult situtation. This is my favorite SF series and my favorite SF character. The author takes Heinlein-like grasp of physics and then places it in a real and gritty setting. The results are a modern classic."},{"Title":"Rebel Dynasty, Vol. 1 (Star Rebel & Rebel's Quest)","review":"We first met Bran Tregare in the Rissa Kerguelen trilogy (&quot;Young Rissa,&quot; &quot;Rissa and Tregare,&quot; and &quot;The Long View&quot;).

This book can be read independently of the other books with no trouble ... but re-read it after you read the Rissa saga and you have much more insight into the storyline and where it will eventually go.

Mishaps, inside jokes, the pressure of deadlines, meticulous attention to detail, the intricate choreography of the space battles and duels, and how those fabulous special effects are done are almost as exciting as the finished product. The demands placed upon the actors, who must \\"interact\\" convincingly with characters and weaponry that isn't even there (added later by special effects artists and computer animators) is astounding. The reader gains a new appreciation for the genius of George Lucas and crew...as well as a hope that this won't REALLY be the last of this magnificent saga. I also recommend the excellent \\"Once Upon a Galaxy\\" which is the making of \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\""},{"Title":"The Making of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith","review":"If you're the type of person who enjoys the behind-the-scenes documentaries of moviemaking, this book will make you feel like a Hollywood insider. Regardless of your opinion of the movie itself, most can successfully argue George Lucas has once again managed to raise the bar in the realm of visual effects and digital production.You may be surprised to know the entire movie was shot in less than two months. The book is laid out like a diary, with day-by-day discussions of the various scenes and what the actors and crew were going through as the movie was being shot. Considering over half the movie was digitally animated, the book is also chock full of art and photographs from initial concept to finished product.Beware, this book covers the movie inside and out, so there are plenty of spoilers. However, once you've seen the movie, this book will likely make you want to see it again to catch everything you missed."},{"Title":"The Making of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith","review":"Like everyone else has written, this book is just so full of great things related to Star Wars, not just Episode 3.George Lucas will always be \\"The Man\\" who got me into filmaking(Robert Rodriguez is a close second), and its great to read about his thought process of concluding the Star Wars saga and the saga as a whole. I love the excerpt when he said something to the extent of Hollywood would never let Episode I be Episode I, but Episode I be made like Episode III for 3 WHOLE MOVIES. As much as unpopular Episode I was, he stood by his conviction of telling the first 3 stories the way they had to be told, arm-chair quarterbacks and critics who will never have 1/1000th of his success, be damned.Written in logs, this book is a diary of the start to finish of making Episode 3, along with side notes, trivia, conceptual art, etc. What I like most about the book, is that I learned more about filmaking from an on-set insider POV with all parties involved(Lucas himself, Cinematographers, Producers, Assistants, Art Teams, Actors, Editors, etc.)than reading \\"filmaking\\" books or taking film classes.I'm not really fickle about spoilers, but keep in mind this book has many. If you want to get the book AFTER watching the movie, by all means, do that, just get the book!! Just when you want to put the book down, you find something new and interesting!!"},{"Title":"The Making of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith","review":"you really have to give George Lucas a lot of credit. I mean maybe he's just looking at more dollar signs but he, and many other filmmakers, are doing a great job these days in documenting the making of their films from day one. Whether it be for a making of book like this or for extras on the eventual DVD release, I think it's wonderful that they are taking fans into consideration. This book isn't just some fluff piece like some others that's desgigned to make a few bucks. This is a comprehensive, daily journal book written by Mr. Rinzler who was along for the entire movie-making process from the creation of storyboards and animatics to post-production editing and final touches. Rinzler lets readers become a fly on the wall to watch the entire creative process unfold. You'll see first hand the hard work and incredible pressure placed on everyone involved to not only get the movie completed, but to get it done right since this will be the last chance (as far as we know). Throughout the book there are behind the scenes photographs and conceptual drawings showing the development of various characters from initial renderings to the final, on-screen look. This is just a fascinating look inside movie-making, well worth it for Star Wars fans or anyone interested in working in film."},{"Title":"The Making of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith","review":"A very exhaustive, orderly and fact-filled book.

It begins with the artists in the attic. A talented group of young people worked at Skywalker ranch to put George Lucas's visions to paper. Boga, the lizard, Alderaan and Mustafar were on Lucas's mind very early on and the imagination of the artists was put to the test. Next come the actors. The reader is already aquainted with McGregor, Portman and Christensen and so Jonathan Rinzler is free to write about the other cast and crew members and their impressions and various journies to Star Wars. The artist who did the stunning toasty Anakin makeup had actually been dreaming about this job since he was a teenager. Some of the stunt men and sword masters had pasts that were so intriguing that I would've loved to have read more.The details of how hard Samuel L. Jackson (who looks like he had a ball) had to work to get that duel with Palpatine on film is very interesting as is the section of working with Christopher Lee. Finally, the book discusses the part that Lucas clearly loves the most: going back to the \\"lab\\" and adding the special effects, cutting and editing and tinkering with the film.There are some wonderful photos in the book. In one Lucas is talking to two Jedis. They look real. He looks like a photoshop add in. The pictures of the sets and how certain things were done were fascinating. And in the middle of this huge production real life is going on. Lucas and McCallum have families who float in and out. The set nurse and the cafeteria workers play an important role and everyone knows that the set carpenters are geniuses.If you specialize in Star Wars books your collection won't be complete without this one."},{"Title":"The Making of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith","review":"Spoilers all over the place in this one!!

Really, this book has it all!In \\"Part 1\\" it shows original drawings and rough drafts of the script. In \\"Part 2\\" it shows what they filmed every day, and even has quotes straight from Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, and Ewan McGregor. You can read about the problems they would go through on a day-to-day basis.In \\"Part 3\\" it mostly talks about adding in those special effects that make the movie what it is today. Plus, there are a few pages about those Wookiees!If that isn't enough, almost every page has 3-6 crystal clear, candid photos. And I just want to mention that there are more than 220 pages. Small font is used in order to fit in more information.This book tells a whole lot more than the special features on the DVD do. I'm serious, this is a must-have for any Star Wars fan. Even if you're not obsessed like some people, I think everyone will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Making of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith","review":"I was hoping this book would provide information on the various 'film codes' used in the film (such as colour and shot symbolism, style of music, frame composition, costume etc) and how they enhanced the actual story. There is none of that in this book; however, it does provide 'a fly on the wall' insight into the production of the film. It relays conversations between Lucas and his producer, as well as recreates dialogue between Lucas and his actors as they move through the filming process. Glorious pictures, but you can get the same images from the net if that's what you're after. The book didn't provide me with what I wanted, but the Star Wars nerd in me liked it nevertheless."},{"Title":"The Making of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith","review":"There were a lot of details in the book that were not in the movie.

If you buy this book the final chapter must to be downloaded as a 56-page .pdf (complete with ads for other Del Ray Star Wars products) from www.readstarwars.com. This is a decent book, but it's really bothersome that it was published well before the movie was even completed!The information in the book, presented diary style, ends in the summer of 2004 with months of post-production work still to be done on Episode III. (The online chapter ends at the end of February 2005.) Unless you download the final chapter you will not be able to read about such \\"minor\\" things as John Williams musical score, final effects work, sound design, and editing the final film.Sorry, but this book was a rush job. A \`making of' book should take the reader right up through a films completion, not leave them hanging somewhere in the middle.What is there is well done and the first chapter that documents the artists designing new characters, vehicles, and entire worlds before Lucas even supplies a rough draft of the script is very interesting. Throughout the book there are nice on-set photos and artwork from the production. The diary entries will most definitely give the reader an insiders' view of what its like to work on a Star Wars film.There are some amazing artists that bring these films to the screen, too bad this book stops short of giving us the complete picture. I'd rather spend a few more dollars for a completed book than have to waste the time (and the ink in my printer) to get what should have been included to begin with.If the final chapter were included, this is a four or five star review."},{"Title":"The Making of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book is really awesome!

It really gives you an insight to the behind the scenes of what it takes to make a movie."},{"Title":"The Making of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith","review":"Well, it's been about 30 years in the making but the Star Wars saga finally came to an end with the release of Revenge of the Sith. This book is about all the hard work, both in front of and behind the camera, that made the final film possible. As with the DVDS I felt that too much time was spent on the \\"technical\\" aspects of the film and not enough was spent on the actors, the scriptwriting process, and the themes of the work as a whole. I guess what I'm trying to say is that Star Wars films and this book's problem is that there is an obsession with \\"design\\" instead of the emotional content or the plot. Instead of obsessing about the look of each and every laser gun, Lucas should have filled us in about plot holes and told us why Qui-Gon couldn't have communicated with Yoda and said \\"Palpatine is the Sith Lord\\"! and saved the whole universe with those words. There are some entertaining and insightful looks into the psychology of the characters, especially in the 1st drafts of the script in which Lucas envisioned Palpatine as the person that conceived Anakin through his control of the Force, which would make him Anakin's father in a way, and Luke and Leia's grandpa! The other negative thing about this book is that you become more conscious of the trickery used in Episode 3. When you read about all the digital head-swapping, especially of Palpatine and Christopher Lee, when you view the film, you start to notice the slightly different looking heads during the duels. It also made me disillusioned to find out that at the beginning of the film when Anakin and Obi-Wan face Dooku, Christopher Lee was not even on the same set with them. So I don't know, this book really revealed all fakery that I believe is so responsible for people's unease with the prequels. Movies like Sin City which were completely digital made no pretensions to look real, but Lucas tries so hard to make Episodes I-III look authentic that somehow everything seems bogus. If you read this book, you will probably never view the film the same, and I mean that in a negative way."},{"Title":"The Fiery Ring (The House of Winslow #28)","review":"While this is not my favorite House of Winslow story, it's still a good story overall.

Musical theatre fans will always recognize the last lines of the 11 o'clock number from A Chorus Line. The show, returning to Broadway this month in it's first revival since it closed there after 6,137 performances in 1990, starred Donna McKechnie. In her autobio, co-authored by Greg Lawrence, who wrote Dancing with Demons, the definitive bio of Jerome Robbins, there is much to like. The book, however, is not without a few jarringly uncomfortable moments.McKechnie discusses in painful detail her brief marriage to genius director-choreographer wunderkind Michael Bennett. Bennett was gay, and was self-centered in a way mere mortals can only think about. Words like \`manipulative,' \`duplicitous,' \`greedy,' \`ambitious,' not to say \`cruel,' \`evil,' \`mean' and \`without conscience' litter remembrances of Bennett. McKechnie explains she married him, thinking, in a musical comedy ing&eacute;nue kind of way, that he would change--she had known him a long time before they married, having done three Broadway hits with him, but then tells the reader entirely too much about this horrible, painful and demeaning relationship.She recounts her battle with crippling arthritis in vivid and moving terms. Imagine being one of the most celebrated dancers in the world, then being told that not only would you never dance again, but very possibly that you'd not be able to even walk within a year. Her triumph in this battle, using traditional and holistic medicine, faith and unfailing determination, is the high point in the book. The authors try to cram as many names in as few pages as possible, and sections read like a theatre program of professionals from the last 50 years. However, in the end, it becomes a sweet, lovely show-biz bio with a measure of style, wit and grace. The satisfaction and pride McKechnie has achieved in her life and career is evident throughout the book. It's interesting that McKechnie has played, in revivals, all three female leads in Follies; her autobiography keenly illustrates that, like Carlotta, Lord knows she was there, and she's still here."},{"Title":"Time Steps","review":"This is a wonderful read. Broadway and musical fans will be thrilled to hear the insider stories, but also saddened that a woman as talented and driven as Donna McKechnie never became a household name. Unflinchingly honest, almost painful at times. I practically inhaled the book and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Time Steps","review":"Broadway stars don't get the recognition that movie stars get, but so far as Broadway stars go, Donna McKechnie is pretty well up there. After all, winning a Tony goes a long way to separate the stars from the wanna be's.In Broadway acting there's a balance between the capabilities of the star and the play that doesn't seem to be as strong as it is in movies. Every Broadway actor has a series of talents in some combination of singing, dancing and acting. The key to success is for that actor to find a position in a play that exactly matches the mix of these talents. For Ms McKechnie that came together in 'A Chorus Line.'This book has a lot about 'A Chorus Line.' But it's from a personal side. How do you take the talents you have, get them in front of the people making the decision about who to hire and get the job. Then what do you do afterward. How do you handle the problems that life brings you. And why does it seem that those who rise to great heights offten have problems more severe than the rest of us, try to imagine what rheumatoid arthritis does to a professional dancer. After a lifetime of working to be a dancer, to be told you will will never dance again, indeed may not be able to walk.As has been said before, actors don't do acting because they want to, they do it because they have to. Ms. McKechnie probably has to do walk this line, but she's also doing exactly what she wants to do."},{"Title":"Time Steps","review":"a true indispensable treasure of information for a lover of american musical shows.simple in the text, rich in the content"},{"Title":"Time Steps","review":"When Donna McKechnie received her Tony for best actress in the musical Chorus Line, she bask in the glow of fame, success, and reaching the pinnacle recognition within the theatre world. However, up to that point and thereafter, there were many highs and lows.Being a dancer, actress, and singer is much more than talent, it is the inner drive to become that character. Mikhail Baryshnikov best describes it as he states \\"When a dancer comes onstage, he is not just a blank slate that the choreographer has written on. Behind him he has all the decisions he has made in his life... each time he has chosen, and in what he is onstage, you see the result of those choices. You are looking at the person he is, the person who, at this point, he cannot help but be.\\"In Time Steps: My Musical Comedy Life by Donna McKechnie, this extraordinary performer candidly shares her life's story. You realize that the glamorous life is full of hard work mixed in with a few tears.Literally running away from home at sixteen, McKechnie pushed through many obstacles to live her dream of becoming a star.If theatre mirrors life, then Donna McKechnie is the embodiment of the story within Chorus Line, a dancer who has big dreams to make it and eventually does.Time Steps: My Musical Comedy Life by Donna McKechnie will give you great insight into the hard work and dedication that it takes to bring to life a fantastic show."},{"Title":"Time Steps","review":"As a theater person I always wondered why we have so little video or TV record of this amazing actress.

McKechnie's story is a very interesting one on many levels. She ran away from home as a teenager and managed to carve out a career for herself as a professional dancer. Her big break came when she auditioned for producer Cy Feuer who hired her for the chorus of his new Broadway show HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING when she was still a teenager. For several heady years she went from one hit show to another, including her breakthrough moment in PROMISES, PROMISES and her spectacular turn in Stephen Sondheim's COMPANY, culminating in her triumphant Tony-wining performance in the revolutionary Michael Bennett musical A CHORUS LINE. But that turned out to be her last real hit. The next thirty years would not be so easy. She not only battled a dead-end career, but also struggled with a severely debilitating physical illness, a failed marriage, family problems and emotional misery. It's the story of a survivor, but it's not a particularly happy one. McKechnie obviously wanted to be in the spotlight an awful lot to go through this kind of life.Although the first part of the book is quite gripping, it bogs down in the middle as McKechnie is forced to look inward to solve her unhappiness. Introspection is usually far more interesting to oneself than to others. Even though the book is ultimately more disturbing than uplifting, I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone considering a career in the performing arts. It reveals the grim reality of trying to make a living as a performer, even for someone as beautiful, talented, respected and beloved as Donna McKechnie."},{"Title":"Time Steps","review":"This talented actress who worked with some of th great directors, composers and performers focusses on her rather neurotic personal life with coutless highs/lows, illnesses, failed romances and marriage.

As politicians like Kirchner, Morales and Chavez to a certain degree argue against what they see as the social cost of privatization, this book clearly shows that if the goal is to have increased state revenues aimed at social spending, privatization will more likely than nationalization bring that about through increased tax revenues (private companies in general pay more taxes than state companies), sustained job creation and reduced liabilities such as public debt accumulated by inefficient money-losing state companies.The authors and editors deserve praise for having produced a well-written book on the topic, with ample documentation and no political agenda beyond looking at the myths and reality of privatization in Latin America.(This is an excerpt of a longer review I wrote in Latin Business Chronicle, March 2006)."},{"Title":"Extreme God Chasers","review":"This book is great for anyone seeking the face of God and &quot;not just His hands.&quot; It will inspire you to seek out God's manifest presence, and discover what He is doing NOW, not just where He's been.

Cathy Sultan relates her experiences with vivid honesty.In 1964 Cathy is drawn to the exotic culture of her soon to be husband, a Lebanese medical student. After their marriage and his residency, ignoring her family's apprehension and paying little attention to world politics, she and her husband move to Beirut with their two young children.In 1975, after six delight-filled years war erupts, neighbors and life-long friends turn on each other, her neighborhood becomes a war zone and Cathy's life is irreversibly changed.As she attempts to provide a secure home environment for her family, the dichotomy of trying to maintain a normal routine and a secure home environment for her family--while adjusting to newly acquired survival skills--doesn't escape her!But, this is much more than a story of survival through war, it's about a family who discovers they are more alike than different, it's about their finding freedom to express themselves in their politics, their profession and their religion in the country they least wanted to identify with.Armchair Interviews says: Very interesting perspective on cultural issues."},{"Title":"A Beirut Heart: One Woman's War","review":"This book by an American who married a Lebanese doctor and lived in Beirut as the Lebanese civil war began and raged, describes in detail how people survived. The war was not constant; it flared violently for days and weeks and then lulled for days and weeks. Throughout her story, you are struck by the tragic and surreal aspects of it.Sultan also describes the political machinations of Lebanon, and how each of the groups protected its own and came to hate the other groups. You also read stories that are very similar to what is now happening in Iraq. One group kills members of another group and then the other group retaliates. People are brutally tortured to death for nothing other than being in another sect or religion.Sultan is hard on most of the groups who were politically involved in Lebanon. She strongly criticizes the Palestinians, Syrians, and Israelis and speaks about how simple the American thinking was. Lebanon was then and remains now a proxy battlefield where stronger nations pursue their interests.The most disturbing part of the book is when she meets a French mercenary. Full of manners, he discloses that he has been hired as a sniper to randomly shoot people. His comment that it is nothing more than \\"a well-paying job\\" is unnerving. He has no political motives at all; his goal is to kill unknown innocents in order to satisfy the blood lust of his employer. The fact that the people he is currently talking to could be in his gun sights tomorrow seem to be inconsequential. I could not help thinking that as long as there are people with his attitude, war will never disappear.The civil war in Lebanon was a tragedy, but it was also a precursor to what is now happening in Iraq. Large numbers of people are being killed as a consequence of the people splitting into factions, and right now there appears to be no end in sight. Read this book and learn how people try to cope with daily bombings and shootings and the occasional senseless death of a friend."},{"Title":"A Beirut Heart: One Woman's War","review":"Cathy Sultan has given a glimpse of what life was like living through civil war in Lebanon. Like her, I am an American married to a Lebanese-born doctor. I have traveled to Lebanon many times since the war and I too am in love with this magical country. Unfortunately, I never knew the pre-war Lebanon. Reading this book gave me an idea of what life was like before the civil war. It gives the reader incite not only of the country and its' complicated political issues but also the spirit of the people during a civil war- good and bad. I loved this book!"},{"Title":"A Beirut Heart: One Woman's War","review":"If you want to feel what it feels like to be a family in the Middle East as war creeps in around you, this is the book. Intimately detailed, we live with the Sultan family as they escape their apartment in Beurut to sleep in the hallways during a bombing raid. We zoom through the streets with the author as she races across town to pick her children up from school with bombs chasing their car like lightening bolts zapping at the bumper. Throughout, we get a real-life point-of-view on how one mother tries to maintain a sense of normalcy when senselessness blasts out the windows...again."},{"Title":"A Beirut Heart: One Woman's War","review":"Cathy Sultan offers a personal account that looks more like a biography. Since Sultan had spent most of her life in Beirut and remains nostalgic to that Middle Eastern city, the book is misleadingly called Beirut's Heart.Sultan, an American who married a Lebanese studying in the US at young age and went to Beirut where she lived with him and his family, records her experience from days of her adolescence. Sultan was as rebellious as all young people her age at the time. When she married Sultan, she accompanied him on a new adventure as she went and lived in Beirut.Shortly after she arrived, the Lebanese civil war started in 1975 and soon the country was divided into East Beirut and West Beirut. Cathy was living in the Eastern side.Even though the book is a memoir, Cathy's style enriches it and makes of it a beautiful novel especially with her meticulous description of Lebanese items, food, lifestyle and other issues.The book is entertaining yet it could have been much better had Cathy paid attention more to the political details and made sure to put each one of the horrible experiences that she told that she lived during the civil war in its political and historic context."},{"Title":"Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice : The DSM-IV Edition","review":"I teach those evil, mean behavioral and cognitive courses that all of you hate. Bwaaahahahahaaaaah. Even so...Add me to the list of people who heartily endorse this new edition of a classic. I use it as a teaching tool and as a reference, and clinical psychology students generally rave about it. A book like this one is essential at a time when psychodynamic approaches are fighting for their proverbial lives. It keeps pace with the DSM-IV-TR, and with rapid advances in neuroscience and clinical research. As before, it is enormously practical. It continues to provide clinical examples, insight, and wisdom related to each DSM diagnosis. As before, its style is accessible to students and clinicians alike, including those who are not psychodynamically oriented. If I was teaching an introductory course on psychdynamic psychology, this is the text I would use.Gabbard's book contains the following: (1) A lucid introduction to the foundations of dynamic psychiatry. Topics covered include the patient's subjective experience, the role of the unconscious, psychic determinism, expression of the past in the present, resistance, and the role of neurobiology; (2) An introduction to theory, including ego psychology, object relations theory, self psychology, and attachment theory; (3) A multi-chapter discussion of clinical assessment and treatment, including sections on psychodynamic considerations of medication and hospitalization; (4) Coverage of Axis I disorders (schizophrenia, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, sexual dysfunctions, substance-related disorders and eating disorders, and cognitive disorders); (5) Coverage of Axis II disorders, with emphasis on the cluster B This is disorders. There are separate chapters for borderline, narcissistic, antisocial, and hysterical-histrionic disorders. The clinical chapters begin by discussing presentation as it relates to the 4 major dynamic schools, and then discuss assessment, and management. In this new edition, relevant biological research is integrated into the discussion. My kind of book: it takes old-time theories, case studies, and new research, and integrates them in a way that enhances clinical practice."},{"Title":"Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice : The DSM-IV Edition","review":"As a third year resident in psychiatry, the utilization of dynamic therapy in the treatment of my patients was daunting. To fully understanding them, would I need to read all of the works of Freud and Jung (and numerous other masters in the field).

The only unfortunate thing about this book is that a third edition is arriving in stores soon."},{"Title":"Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice : The DSM-IV Edition","review":"this is a wonderful book. it is well-organized and puts the often elusive concept of psychodynamic theory into real, practical considerations and methods. it includes basic principles, information on defense mechanisms (very useful), and a great deal of information on various psychodynamic theoretical perspectives. the chapters on understanding and treating personality disorders were my favorite, and the author spent a great deal of time on cluster b personality disorders, probably the most often seen and difficult to treat of the personality disorders. i particularly liked the chapter on borderline personality disorder. throughout the book, the theory and concepts are easy to read and understand, and the interventions are practical and well-explained."},{"Title":"Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice : The DSM-IV Edition","review":"Gabbard's Third Edition of Psychodynamic Psychiatry keeps an already classic psychodynamic analysis of the DSM IV up to date with the lastest revisions of the DSM IV.

I typically find reading information about diagnoses dry and fairly meaningless. Gabbard is able to keep my attention and help me to understand a person's character structure from a less medical-model point of view."},{"Title":"Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice : The DSM-IV Edition","review":"It's readable, engaging and all about psychodynamic practice. It's by far the best book I've read in this field."},{"Title":"Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice : The DSM-IV Edition","review":"Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice is a very dense book. A considerable amount of material is covered in the 630 pages. Basic principles of dynamic therapy, the basic theories of psychodynamics, and forms and adaptations of psychodynamic treatment are covered in the opening chapters. Following that, each major disorder area (mood, psychotic, anxiety, dissociative, substance, paraphilia, personality) are covered in a similar, logical format: introduction of disorder, historical background, theoretical formulations (psychological and biological), treatment considerations. The book is well researched and well written.So what's to criticize?Dr. Gabbard has, in this most recent edition, incorporated a considerable number of findings from neuroscience and it makes this book a valuable resource on integration of factors leading to psychiatric problems. Where it falls short for me, is that the integration is not complete (likely more related to the research in the area) and that muddies the discussion of the understanding of some disorders. For example, in the discussion of borderline personality disorder, a large amount of the text is devoted to citing studies in neuroimaging (which, make no mistake, is cutting edge and furthers our understanding of the disorder). Later, a portion of the text deals with the historical, psychoanalytic understanding of borderline personality disorder. However, these areas, for me, were not linked and didn't provide an integrated theoretical understanding of what causes these disorders and that is where the book fell short. Earlier editions, while less up to date in terms of research, were far easier to integrate and understand.So, in my opinion, this book is a great resource for the current state of research, less so for clinical understanding of patients."},{"Title":"Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice : The DSM-IV Edition","review":"TITLE| Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical PracticeAUTHOR| Glen O.

He also explores, in outline, the general economic rise of Europe after the year 1000, culminating in medieval high point of the mid-Fourteenth Century and the sort of stability that lasted from that period (1350) until the Age of Exploration began and radically altered everything again. It was in the Low Countries and Italy that \\"capitalism\\" and the first industrial revolution really began and Pirenne shows how and why this occurred.In this day and age where most people's image of the Middle Ages, if they have one, is based on movies like Kevin Costner's godawful &quot;Robin Hood&quot; and the fun, but totally make-believe, &quot;A Knight's Tale&quot; this book sets forth, concisely, the fascinating complexity of the age that established Christianity as the faith of Europe and the political-social system that ruled 3/4s of the Earth's surface until 1918 and whose vestiges we can still see in the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands, et al.Educated people have taken Gibbon's dismissive derision of the Middle Ages as a period of nothing but violence, superstition and stagnation. Pirenne demolishes Gibbon's amazingly shallow view with a wealth of detail and vivid, easily readable narrative. Although not the masterpiece of literature that Gibbon produced, this volume avoids the joyful boredom that so many writers of economic history seem to delight in inflicting upon their readers.The translation from the French by I.E. Clegg is smooth and idiomatic. Pirenne, who apparently spoke English fluently, helped to prepare the translation.The only irritating part of the book is the presence of several large blocks of untranslated Latin and Old French. Given the general ignorance of Latin (and I am one of the ignorant, I am ashamed to say), Clegg or Pirenne should have translated it for the benefit of the Latinless. Although I read French with some ability, the Old French (pre-1300) uses spellings and some words that I simply can't understand. Modern French dictionaries are useless. Harcourt-Brace should find some present-day academic to &quot;edit&quot; a new edition and translate these passages! A smoother typeface than the ancient &quot;Times-Roman&quot; would also be nice.All in all, if you have any interest in medieval history (especially if you are of European descent) or wish to understand how the market system of economics took form, I highly, highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Economic and social history of medieval Europe","review":"Pirenne's book first appeared in print in 1933, so I have to admit I was a little leery about reading it even though I have an interest in feudal economics. I was concerned that it would be a stuffy tome that was written in a dense and archaic academic style. To my surprise, this book is an extraordinarily good read, most interesting, and very informative. And unlike many books on this subject, a casual reader can be assured that a master's level background on the subject is not necessary to read this book.Picking up at the end of the Roman Empire and running through approximately the middle 1500s, Pirenne tackles the full spectrum of economic and sociological issues as they evolved throughout the Middle Ages in Europe. Specifically, he relates how commerce was revived after the break-up of the economic and cultural stability that existed in the ancient world. Concepts such as the re-issuance of a currency, the rebirth of a money economy, rediscovery of credit, and how urban industry developed are covered and explained in detail. This is a very complete picture of economic and sociological circumstances that existed during the middle ages, as you are likely to see.Pirenne takes the reader on a journey that attempts to plug the Medieval Period knowledge gap with a detailed explanation of economic development. Geographically (and culturally) he is able to discuss developments throughout all of Europe, from the Mediterranean to the North Sea.

The population is a fraction of what it is today and yet people can't grow enough food to feed themselves. Kings are caught up in endless fighting among themselves, and the clergy, as with the serfs, are merely trying to survive. Europe is poor, ignorant, divided, and easy prey for the next band of barbarians who happen along.Jump ahead three-hundred years, and Europe is the most prosperous place on Earth, with abundant food, a wealth of luxuries, universities, soaring cathedrals, incredible art, and no longer prey but a predator looking to colonize distant lands.What happened?Commerce. The rise of trade -- the import and export of not just goods, but ideas. For example, algebra was an import, and the writing of Plato and the Greek philosophers and playwrights. It was commerce that dramatically increased the production and variety of food, raised the standard of living, fostered reading, writing and arithmatic, financed the Renaissance, built the gothic cathedrals, eliminated slavery in Europe, created the middle class, created cities, and brought some semblance of peace. The merchant class, the men of trade, of money and banking, in going about their business, invented the corporation, created capitalism, fostered a spirit of tolerance and pluralism, and ruled democratically. Kings ruled the country, but the merchant class ran the cities. If you were a runaway serf, you found refuge--and a better job--in the city. The expression \\"the air breathes freer in the cities\\" is from this time.Kings and clergy did nothing to bring this about. They never do. If anything, they tried to stop it. So the merchants bought them off. They paid them with gold and jewels and fine silks and art and spices and all the things they were importing from the east. Mind you, the castles and churches were cold, stark places until the merchants filled them with tapestries and art and gold to prevent kings and clergy from meddling in their affairs. It was a bargain, too.Henri Pirenne's wonderful book is what they don't teach you in Econ 101. It aught to be part of the basic curriculum if for no other reason than to offset the fuzzy socialism that was all the rage when I was in college. Also highly recommended -- Robert S.

This short introduction is concise and easy to understand, without being 'dumbed down'. The scores themselves are clear (though not always with enough room for my own scribbly notes), and have useful notes and commentaries on each piece that are extensive and unobtrusive to the score.My favorite part of the book is it's strivings to keep close to the originals, offering alternatives and the interpretations of other musicians.

So far, I've been concentrating on the E-minor lute suite and it will take me year, I suspect. I find the performance notes interesting and useful. The page layout and binding are really excellent. In places where the original notes are impossible on the modern guitar, such as playing bass E and G# at the same time, he provides alternative inversions from which to choose. It's important to remember that no modern edit is holy writ, and if you want to go back to the originals or near-originals, facsimiles are provided. For me, these versions are certainly close enough."},{"Title":"The Solo Lute Works of Johann Sebastian Bach: Edited for Guitar by Frank Koonce","review":"Una de las mejores ediciones de la obra de Bach para laud en guitarra.

This book has very clear and easy to follow examples that you can immediately use in real world applications. For example I was able to use the Webservices code in the chapter on SOAP and WebObjects to build a small application at work that takes advantage of a Webservice created in ColdFusion by a co-worker. I have all of the currently shipping WebObjects books and I can say without a doubt that this one is the best! If you have a good understanding of OO programming you should be able to use the hands on examples from this book to develop WebObjects applications. If you are a Mac Programmer this book and Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X by Aaron Hillegas are two books you'll want to read."},{"Title":"WebObjects Developer's Guide","review":"I'm about 70% through this book, purchased on Amazon.com last week, and have some comments to share:So far the entire text has been pretty much a directed tutorial. The book does little to explain concepts, preferring to direct procedurally instead. This tends to make subjects more cryptic, and at times it is difficult to understand the author's objective/message in a chapter until you've struggled through it. (I'm someone who *enjoyed* the Sendmail book with the bat on the cover, so not too hard to please).It is impossible to read and understand this book without actually sitting in front of ProjectBuilder with it; this is not an 'enjoyable' read. If you're looking for a conceptual book about WebObjects, keep looking - this one leaves you dry and perhaps even more confused if you don't have the time to 'read and do'.Notwithstanding style, the technical content is good and eventually you arrive at the end of a section and it's like a lightbulb has been switched on - 'ahhh; now I see what he has been driving at', so I would still recommend the book given the dearth available on this subject. Also, to give due credit, it does cover some material that Apple's own doc does not.The #2 issue I have is the amount of tedious typing of example material. This is not a high school textbook and there are no prizes for the fastest typist - in order to get through the material quickly all code passages should be provided as text files or, optimally, in project files.If you are going to write a 400 page tutorial, at least provide the sample projects and source code referred to on CD - or, even better, a PDF copy of the book online. There is some material provided (basically image files) on the publisher's website, but it's inadequate to say the least.I initially felt that the book was very sparse for a (Canadian) $77 pricetag, but now realise that just a few pages can result in several hours with Project Builder!If you're a fan of the O'Reilly technical books that offer wit and humor to lighten a dry subject, you'll hate this book. Tim, what's happening on the WebObjects front please?"},{"Title":"WebObjects Developer's Guide","review":"A programming environment is much like writing a book or painting a picture. You can be shown step-by-step how to write a specific paragraph or paint a specific object, and make them with little variation... or you can be taught the concepts behind them, and use those concepts to make your painting, writing, or program actually your own.Ravi Mendis takes the step-by-step approach to show you how to make something, without spending any time to explain the concepts behind what its being shown. In my opinion, this 'teaching' style is little more useful than just giving people a CD full of code for completed projects. If you're not going to explain what the code does, why it does what it does, and how to use it, how are you going to know how to use it?Also, this book is poorly edited: sentence fragments litter the book, as well as spelling errors. At times, it can be very difficult to read."},{"Title":"Language","review":"So what if it was published in 1935? Bloomfield's &quot;Language&quot; was perhaps the first work of linguistics I ever read, and the principles laid down in it are good and enduring. For linguistics, it's even relatively easy to read, which is saying quite a bit. The emphasis on Amerindian languages may date the text for some readers. I've read the book a number of times, and never without marveling at the treasure house of knowledge it contains. If you have even a passing interest in languages and their development, you should read at least some of Bloomfield."},{"Title":"Language","review":"It's in very good condition when it arrived. I really like it. It is exactly as the picture shows and meets my expectations perfectly."},{"Title":"Language","review":"This book is a true classic, and anyone interested in linguistics and language should have a copy. It should be noted that since it was originally published in the 1930s, some of the information may be out of date, but most of it isn't. The field of linguistics has expanded since then, but this book is still very relevant, especially the parts relating to borrowing, language change, philology, etc. This book is also great in its scope. It's detailed and gives examples, but it reads well and gives a good introduction to a broad field."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"These tapes cost too much for what they deliver. I love the Pimsleur method of teaching and have used their French tapes with much success. However, the speakers on these Portuguese tapes sound bored, the vocabulary is extremely limited, and unfortunately, you are not at all ready to use the language as a traveler when done with these tapes. I would love to see Pimsleur do justice to continental Portuguese."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"The Pimsleur method itself is really quite good. I used the comprehensive Italian course and was quite pleased with my results. The problem with the &quot;compact course&quot; is that there really isn't enough &quot;meat&quot;. By the end of this course I was quite comfortable asking &quot; Do you speak Portuguese?&quot; &quot;Would you like something to eat?&quot; and &quot;Do you have escudos?&quot; That, however is about the extent of the vocabulary one will pick up from this course. Really not worth 70 dollars."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"I bought the Pimsleur European Portuguese system about four weeks before a trip to Mozambique. It contains 10 lessons, each about 25 minutes long. All but the first lesson is followed by a five-minute reading lesson where words or short phrases are repeated. It was helpful in some ways and limited in others. I do find myself using the information, but I wonder if it could have been more efficiently presented.The strength of this system is that it is audio only; it forces me to learn Portuguese as it is spoken, rather than from a book where I learn to speak Portuguese words with American pronunciation. The speakers spoke clearly and slowly enough to follow easily, and the repetition was sufficient for memorization.However, I found the audio-only approach limiting in that it doesn't help with reading. I have some minor hearing loss and it would have been helpful to have a script/workbook. The reading lessons in the packet (lists of about 15 words, many of which do not appear in the lesson just completed) are not very helpful.A feature that I found infuriating was that they start you off using one form of \\"you\\" (the formal form: o senhor/a senhora - which I'm told nobody uses, not even in Portugal) then halfway through introduce the more common \\"voc^e.\\" They also interchange the words for \\"something\\" and \\"anything,\\" which I found distracting as I tried to repeat after the speakers.Overall, the system is helpful, but I am glad I had other books (Bilingual Books \\"Portuguese in 10 Minutes a Day\\" and Lonely Planet's Portuguese Phrasebook)."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"After going through volumes one and two of Pimsleur's Portuguese--roughly two months of work--I did learn enough Portuguese to actually function in Brazil. Mind you, I wasn't fluent, having the skills, comprehension, and vocabulary of a 2-3 year old, but I was able to order in restaurants, speak with cab drivers, ask directions, purchase items, and so on. In other words, I learned enough to survive there. If you can handle the cost (which keeps me from giving five stars), consider this course."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"I love the method that Pimsleur employs to make a new language stick to the grey matter between my ears. The CD says the words in English and then in Portuguese, with careful pronounciation. There are nice, long pauses to repeat the words aloud. As the lessons progress, the prompts vary from just a translation to things like \\"Say 'good morning, miss'\\". It teaches a few phrases, then adds a few more, then goes back to prompt you to recall what you learned a lesson ago and combines it with the new phrases. I hope to visit Portugal someday, and Pimsleur will help me function as a tourist!"},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"This is an excellent follow-up to Brazilian I. It continues to expand content at a good pace - not too fast or too slow. I've tried everything to learn a language - books, classes, other tapes. But the Pimsleur approach is far and away the most effective method I've found."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"I found this CD series VERY helpful for the preparation of our recent trip to Portugal. It should be stressed, however, that this is indeed for European Portuguese, not Brazilian.Although I also speak Spanish, and expected there to be many similarities, I was surprised that there are substantial differences. The cognates are certainly there, but often the pronunciation is radically different. I especially found it interesting that the pronunciation for \\"rr\\" and an initial \\"r\\" in Portuguese is usually pronounced somewhat like an english 'H' or Spanish \\"J\\". \\"Restaurant\\" sounds kind of like \\"HEES-too-rant\\"... \\"carro\\" sounds like \\"CA-ho\\" in english or \\"cajo\\" in Spanish.Anyway, I am very pleased with this program. I wish an advanced Pimsleur European Portuguese was also available."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"I am planning on going to Portugal at the end of this year to stay for a year so I needed to find a way to learn the essentials of this language. These CD's have been fantastic - I now feel confident about being about to get myself around Portugal! As the Portuguese is spoken by native Portuguese speakers there is no worries of picking up an accent other than a Portuguese one :)They are obviously aimed at the American market however, as I am now able to say with great ease \\"I am from the United States\\"!"},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"I've learned Spanish via the Living Language series, followed by Berlitz Advanced tapes. Pimsleur seems far superior, and the &quot;all audio&quot; approach fits my long commute better than the ones that require access to a book along with the tapes. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"As someone who has been teaching herself Portuguese at home with various materials I have found it difficult to find any sources on European Portuguese. Every course I have come across deals only with Brazilian Portuguese. Infact, the home course I am taking is in the Brazilian dialect. However, the difference in accents between the two dialects are considerably different to the non-native ear. I live in Ireland and although I love speaking Brazilian Portuguese the chances of me getting to go to Brazil to use it are a lot smaller than my chances of going to Portugal! So I needed some source material to get the hang of the accent.This product deals primarily in the Lisbon accent and I found it to be a great help. By the end of the first two hours of study I was able to watch Portuguese television and understand the native speakers a great deal better. Now, I had been studying Brazilian Portuguese for a few months beforehand, I'm not saying I understood TV instantly! I just mean that when I used Pimsleur European Portuguese it was like a veil had been lifted and I understood the Lisbon accent a whole lot better.On the flip side if you are a holidaymaker and you wish to go to Portugual on a trip, this audio is quite contrived and geared towards someone who would be taking a business trip rather than a tourist. But, I found it helpful for the use I needed from it. I think it depends what you are looking for, whether you would find this useful or not."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"The lessons taught on these Pimsleur CD's are fine, but the delivery time was completely unacceptable. I will never buy any such item online again. Why would I? It took nearly 4 weeks to deliver an item I could have gone to Barnes and Noble and had (certainly similar) same day. This is the reason people are dissatisfied with online purchases. Service sucks...and when it is good the expectation is for a 5 star review. I am not a hard critic, but I do know what 5 star service is and it was not associated with this purchase."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"First, this is still the best audio method you can buy. Others are chaos compared. You will learn, and remember what you learn, tho Pimsleur is no substitute for using the language with what manifestations your own will would interact with Others in real life.THe problem with Pimsleur, at least the Brazilian, is inconsistency. For example, when the word \\"faz\\" is used, at first it is pronounced, in English phonemics (an oxymoron if ever), \\"fahs\\". Without warning, that is, without an explanation that there is an alternate, and probably more frequently used pronouncing of the same word in this conjugation--the native speakers begin saying the word as, \\"fize\\". As in: \\"O que o senhor faz? (fize)\\"There are several other such inconsistencies. THe strict Pimsleur formula, in part generated by the amount of time the CD medium has to offer, seems to prohibit a brief, but to me, necessary explanation, that other pronouncings are in the script. I'd like to think the actors are not merely lapsing. Another example: \\"a esposa dele\\". THis is pronounced by the female instructor, \\"aye eesposa' While the elision of a and e can result in an \\"aye\\" sound, or, in Portuguese, ai, many Pimsleurites, and I'm one, who try to visualize the actual written content would come up with, \\"ai esposa\\". If I seem picky, yeah, rite. I think one, and only one way of pronouncing your new language shoud be learned, and this will, when the time comes, greatly help fluency."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"I had 6 months to learn enough Portuguese before my trip to Mozambique, Africa. Pimsleur's program has given me a great beginning to the basics. My daughter (living in Africa) shares that my dialect is spot on. She is very impressed with how far I've come with no background in the language. I am on the last CD in the program with 5 months of time to absorb more. This finds me needing an intermediate to advanced program. This is the only short-coming I can find. I also found myself craving a workbook. However, I would recommend this for anyone who has not studied the language. The audio is extremely effective and really gets the dialect inside your head. They say speaking is 20 times more effective than reading. I think it is a positive that it has left me wanting more."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"I do like the audio focus of these lessons. Since it doesn't rely on a booklet for you to refer to, it makes it easy to learn while driving in your car or exercising. The pronunciation is clear and articulate, and the repetition of phrases from one lesson to the next helps to reinforce what you've learned.Although the audio-only lessons make it convenient, it would be nice to have additional reading lessons that accompany the CD so that you can become more familiar with reading Portuguese. Also, I wish the breadth of dialogs and conversations were broader. It seems the focus of these lessons were more tailored towards a business man visiting Portugal. But I think this is a good series to begin your lessons."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"I bought Brazilian Portuguese Part II after listening to Brazilian Portuguese Part I.

Over the course of 10 1/2-hour lessons on 5 CDs, you are drilled ad nauseam on a very few words and phrases, only a few of which were actually helpful when I traveled to Portugal. Amazingly, you only get to numbers higher than five after something like 6 lessons have gone by. Moreover, the pathetic \\"booklet\\" that accompanies the CD only offers 10 pages of words that the speaker reads on the CD and you just passively listen. That's it. Except for the plus that the repetition of the words and phrases did provide some benefit in preparing for my trip, there is little else to recommend here. I would suggest that someone wanting to learn basic Portuguese get something more substantial."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) II , Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs","review":"This program is good. There is not a lot of variety in European Portuguese language-learning programs but this is one of the better ones I've tried.

A very tiny booklet with about 10 vocabulary words per lesson to pronounce, but NO indication on the book or tape what the word means. Why learn to say how to say a word if I have no clue what the word signifies?There are no clues given, though from listening (I've completed 3 lessons), I figured out that if a word ends in \\"o\\", I should pronounce it like a US \\"u\\", an \\"e\\" ending sounds like \\"eh\\" and \\"m\\" is \\"n\\". You would think they might explain these a bit.The male has sloppy pronunciation. He'll say \\"entendeh\\", or even \\"Entend\\" and she'll say \\"Entiendeh\\". So which is it? The man often drops the final syllable on words, which might be common on the street, but doesn't help me understand how verbs are formed or to picture the word properly. I have enough Spanish background that I would opt to follow her speech patterns, which seem less lazy.There is a huge set of Beginner and Intermediate Brazilian Pimsleur CDs at our library, but we are going to the Azores, Lisboa and Oporto, so I thought this would be more useful. There are some language books, but after years of Spanish, I needed to hear the spoken language so I could hear the differences.I'm going to supplement this course with the other books, and maybe try some of the Brazilian CDs, but I'm pretty underwhelmed.

While researching the book he uncovered more material on other horoscopes and almanacs written by Nostradamus, which unfortunately this book does not cover.
