Pleased to find this book on Amazon at such a good price. And, thank you for your good service and fast shipment."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"'Inspiring' and 'spiritual' are insufficient to describe this extraordinary book. The 'two listeners' seem to tune in to God's wavelength and offer Him an instrument for His divine compassion. They channel the Trinity - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - with encouragements, blessings, and Bible verses that are simple to appreciate yet profoundly deep in meaning. That our Lord and Master should speak through the 'two listeners' and that those conversations should be recorded in an easy-to-read, 193-page book suggests His presence can manifest in any form.God's love is unmistakable in this version edited by A.J. Russell. Available after many printings dating to 1932 and written as a daily devotional, God Calling offers companionship and succor to the troubled and the downtrodden, the meek and the forlorn, and the hopeless and the desperate. We are quite simply uplifted by these timeless and beautiful words of hope and inspiration. They calm us and pacify us. They leave us breathless and craving more. They are food for our souls and seemingly float on cottony white clouds in the ever darkening sky of our sometimes lives.Keep listening for the \\"still small voice\\"If you are weary on life's road;The Lord will make your heart rejoiceIf you will let Him take your load.--HessGod Calling, for me, amplifies that \\"still small voice.\\"This book is heaven-sent insight and worth reading over and over until one has internalized His enduring empathy. These words are a source of great strength that restores our faith and renews our serenity. They are intended to not just be consumed but to be lived and turned toward others.God calls us to serve. God Calling inspires us to serve with a smile on our faces.And as Christ taught us through His sterling example, we release our own burdens by relieving others of theirs.Ethereal and uplifting! A Must Read if You Are Weary and Burdened!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"If you answered your phone and realized God was on the other end, what do you think He would say to you? God Calling, is a daily devotional that has been cherished by my family since I was a child. Somehow reading the daily \\"letters\\" from God (derived from His Word) never gets old. Each letter has a way of encouraging your heart and helping you fall more deeply in love with the Lord.I recommend God Calling to anyone who wants to hear God's Word directed to them personally. Each daily devotion consists of scripture, exhortations, and encouraging words of promise. This book is a daily faith builder. After all, faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.Stacy Padula, Author ofMontgomery Lake High #1: The Right Person"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"An awesome book, that takes more than one reading in order to begin to understand the depth of what is being said each day!

Great gift for anyone - also seeGod Calling Music"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I ordered three of the books God Calling. They all arrived promptly and I was impressed by the service provided by Amazon as this was my first purchase with them. I gave one copy to my Minister to read and approve. When he said it was inspiring I then gave the other two copies to ladies in the Church who were going through bad experiences. This book is truly inspirational."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This set of daily messages received from two people who prayed together is quite inspiring. Each day seems to bring a message that one needs to hear. Sometimes it's about having faith, other times about not being afraid, others about healing and what it takes, drawing closer to the Lord, how his mercy is so abundant and so much more. This is my second book because the first one is getting worn out from daily use for the past 3 years. It never grows old and each time I read a daily message, I get something new out of it. I would recommend it for your first read in the morning or your last read at night. Nice short little paragraphs give one the uplift necessary to carry on with life."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"In 1982, my freshman college roommate saw that I was going through a rough time, and bought a copy of &quot;God Calling&quot; for me (I had been reading hers). I have turned to this devotional book constantly for more than 22 years! I have given copies to my sister and to my mother, when they were facing difficulties in their lives. Whenever the need to hear God's voice arises, I say a prayer and open this book. I often feel that God is talking directly to me through the words that I find in &quot;God Calling&quot;. The encouragement and assurance offered in this book has carried me through many ups and downs. I will continue to share &quot;God Calling&quot; with anyone whom I feel is in a &quot;place&quot; in their lives to accept God into their hearts.

My old little hard cover (1953)is precious to me; I underline, put in dates relevant to the message and my own Scripture references. This book is meant to put be away with grandma's gilded family Bible. It is a padded hardcover with gold-edged pages; you can't write on the slick pages and if there were any room they fill it with scrolls, curly-q's, added Scripture (don't need that, have my own Bible-several), poetry (??), thoughts to consider (again, I have my own), and then they tell you what to pray. Seriously?? What was simple and sincere, they have made an embellished, pompous and useless book, unless, of course, you want that kind of thing: beauty over function. Certainly not the gift for I intended for a male friend. I don't even want it."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This book is dangerous in the way that it purports to be channeled revelation from Jesus. Accepting this extreme claim leads people away from studying Scripture and into a search for subjective personal revelation. The book sounds very good in many parts, but a closer reading reveals the shallowness of what is actually taught. For example, March 13 says, \\"Spiritualism is wrong. No man should ever be a medium for any spirit, other than Mine.\\" Yet the \\"Listeners\\" were anonymous mediums, who sat with paper and pen and wrote what \\"came to them!\\" This book gives no credentials as to why we should believe that the \\"spirit\\" they wrote for is the Holy Spirit. Technically, we have no proof that the \\"two women\\" even existed, let alone that they were Christians. We are simply asked to take this on A. J. Russell's word. (He helped found the Oxford Movement, which became the Moral Rearmament Movement, known today as the \\"Initiatives for Change.\\" This quasi-religious international group pursues world transformation through steps like: \\"A daily time of silence where we listen to our conscience or 'inner voice'- for people of faith, the leading of God - for direction and correction.\\" Not exactly Jesus' mission program, is it?)March 16 says \\"Do you realize that I am telling you truths, revealing them, not repeating oft-told facts? . . . All down the ages, men have been too eager to say what they thought about My truth, and so doing, they have grievously erred . . My words need none of man's explanation. I can explain to each heart . . .\\" This directly contradicts the Bible, which says that God gave pastors and teachers to the church to help equip the saints for the work of the ministry. We're supposed to take the edited words of two unknown women as perfectly from Christ and avoid \\"man's explanation?\\" Sounds like an open door to any number of cults to me. Another line from March 16 - \\"To lead a soul to Me is one thing, to seek to stay with it to interpret, mars the first great act.\\" This is contrary to Biblical commands to \\"make disciples\\" by \\"teaching,\\" \\"doctrine,\\" \\"reproof,\\" and \\"exhortation.\\" The New Testament is filled with commands to teach new believers to study the Bible and interpret it.Another point - the \\"Jesus\\" of this book doesn't have the facts about His own birth right. December 24 says that the Magi visited Christ in \\"the Bethlehem Stable.\\" Funny - \\"Jesus\\" should have known that the Magi visited the Child in a \\"house,\\" according to Matthew!I agree with Steven Tsoukalas, who says of \\"God's Calling,\\" - \\"The popularity of this book is a symptom of what ails the Church today-virtually no discernment, no deep biblical knowledge, a sugar-coated view of God, and a desire for the what-can-I-get-out-of-God rather than a desire to know God more deeply through the study of His Word.\\"Don't wander after shortcuts.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Many Christians have felt blessed by \\"God Calling\\", so we must treat this matter in Truth out of love for them, for my opinion does not matter, but only God's truth revealed in the Bible. \\"God Calling\\" is filled with encouragements that seem \\"godly\\" and well-meaning, but we need to understand the controversy that arises when the two \\"listeners\\" claim these messages were given to them by Jesus Himself. When a Christian writes a book they would never claim their writings to be a direct revelation from God. If they did then their revelation would have to be viewed as Scripture [inerrant and infallible]. This is what Joseph Smith claimed about the extra biblical Book of Mormon.Dear reader, please pray for wisdom before reading further. [James 1:5]\\"But with my friend a very wonderful thing happened. From the first, beautiful messages were given to her FROM THE LORD HIMSELF, and every day from then these messages have never failed us. We felt all unworthy and overwhelmed my the wonder of it,and could hardly realize that we were being taught, trained and encouraged day by day BY HIM PERSONALLY,when millions of souls who are far worthier, had to be content with guidance from the Bible, sermons, their Churches, books and other sources.\\" \\"God Calling\\" Page 11-12THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CLAIM. She's claiming that her friend penned the very words of Christ through her. This means that the book \\"God Calling\\" would have equal authority with the Bible. Do we believe this? Or is the listener unaware that she is channeling a message from a seducing spirit via automatic writing? Does the message line up with Scripture?Ther is an unorthodox use of \\"Power\\" that is more consistent with the Occult than Christianity. In fact, the writer capitalizes \\"P\\" in power. We will copy the entire paragraph so the message will not be taken out of context:\\"Discipline and perfect yourselves at all costs. Do this for soon every fleeting thought will be answered, every wish gratified, every deed used. It is a fearful Power, almighty Power. Oh! Be careful that you ask nothing amiss-nothing that is not according to My Spirit. All thoughts harmful must be turned out. Miracle-working power can become WITCHERY in the wrong hands. See how necessary I have made the purity and goodness of your own lives to you. This is why. Soon, very soon, you shall ask and at once it will come. Welcome the training, Without it I dare not give you this Power. IT WOULD DO HARM.\\" January 6THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE STATEMENT. That any \\"Power\\" supposedly derived from the Holy, Pure and Sinless Lord could DO HARM OR BE WITCHERY? If this ONE statement is flawed and untrue the entire idea of the book being written or inspired by the true Jesus must be thrown out. And further begs the question, just what spirit whispered in the silence?"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"A friend gave this book to my sister during a trying time in her life.

However, when I am confused, down, struggling, etc, God Calling gives me encouragement, guidance and reminder.Indeed, when you read God Calling in conjunction with the Bible in every morning (though this is not really easy to achieve), it gives you momentum to practise God's Words in your daily life.The only complaint I would make is that the English in this book is too old. I will hestitate in recommending it to my friends who may need encouragement but who are not very good in English.I really hope that it will be rewritten in contemporary English so that those who need this book but speak English as the second language will understand it and find it helpful and inspiring."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I was pleased with the accurate information about the book's condition, the prompt mailing, and the cost!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"If you read the two prefaces carefully, you will note that the second one refers to the &quot;two listeners&quot; receiving physic messages through automatic writing or channeling!

If you are a Christian or even believe in a Higher Power this book is for you! I happened onto it thru my '24 hr a Day' book which takes meditations from \\"God Calling\\". One day (30 yrs. later} it occurred to me to look up the original book and I'm so grateful I did. Keep plenty in stock 'cause I'm sure I'll be back for more! Thank You 'Two Listeners' and Amazon.com!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Thank You Lord Jesus Christ for coming through these two anonymous women and speaking to them and writing this book. I was led to this book by the Lord January 8th of this year. It has literally been my personal letter from Him every day so far since, speaking so personally to me. He really was calling me when he led me to this book, especially when I dropped it in the book store, and picked it up by the side to see my last name on the side of it \\"Russell.\\" He will speak to you clearly too through these heartfelt words. I wish I could personally thank the two women who He spoke through or A.J. Russell for compiling this book. But since I can not, Thank you Lord!!!!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"In my search for an inspirational book, I came across this one. In its pages I find His message to the world in today's language. His message was delivered to 2 women that chose to remain anonymous but to share the love that our Savior has for us. When I am down or not feeling any hope, I thumb through the pages and where I stop I find the words I need to hear. The same thing happens when I am feeling great, I find a message that brightens my day even more. His messages to us are all about His love for us and this book puts them into words that I can hear. They say if you speak from the heart, you will touch a heart. This has come from the heart of our Savior."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This is a very special daily reflection book.Most days reflection is a couple of paragraphs, but thought provoking.Highly recomend."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This is a great journal.

It's straight from the heart of God and has given me hope for many situations I've faced. The daily devotional almost always fits my need exactly. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I started using this devotional when I was college. I love the way it reveals scripture, putting it to you in very straight-forward, useful language. I love the perspective of God speaking directly to me, the way the Word of God is intended. I have challenged beliefs, I have learned truths I hadn't even considered and I have been overwhelmed at the love of God I have experienced daily through this guide. I currently use the journal version of this book, being careful to put the year on any comments I may have concerning my reaction to each selection. To re-read my journey of faith through the years, only strengthens my faith and trust in Jesus.

Jesus said \\"He who has ears\\" will hear. He also said to be cautious of words that \\"tickle the ear\\".Skip this \\"fluff devotional\\" full of \\"feel good stuff\\". Read the Word itself.If one considers this book \\"inspired\\", then any book out there can be considered the \\"inspired word of God\\" and we are left with no authoratative word. Christians should be cautious in reading this book."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I've been comforted by this \\"journal\\" of meditations for 10 years and continue to take refuge in its words.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Looking back over my spiritual journey, which began in earnest more than 30 years ago, I can whole-heartedly say that this little book of reflections was a catalyst and one of the most important tools in deepening my spiritual connection.With great humility and devotion, I did one complete year of these daily reflections as presented in the book. Then I joyfully took my spiritual formation to a more profound level by doing them again for a second year.Recently I was having a conversation with my brother in which he indicated that he was open to this endeavor.

I would recommend it to anyone of any religious viewpoint."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I remembered when I was at my lowest ebb, and did not know what to do, I was in the library and found this book. It was almost 35 yrs ago. On that day I was so blessed to have checked it out. I read it and learned how to listen and hear what God is saying to me. I began to keep a journal and the Lord spoke to me. I was so encouraged by what the Lord said to me. Just like the two ladies in the book. Their true story is set in the second world war they would get together daily and listen for the Lord to talk to them, and write it down. It is a lovely book. The ladies got healed, they were encouraged, and they met the risen Christ. I cannot think of anything more important then that.A must read. A Classic for sure."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I am loving every day. I look forward to reading it. It always seems to be just what I need. Each day is short enough yet long enough.

I have turned to this devotional book constantly for more than 22 years! I have given copies to my sister and to my mother, when they were facing difficulties in their lives. Whenever the need to hear God's voice arises, I say a prayer and open this book. I often feel that God is talking directly to me through the words that I find in &quot;God Calling&quot;. The encouragement and assurance offered in this book has carried me through many ups and downs. I will continue to share &quot;God Calling&quot; with anyone whom I feel is in a &quot;place&quot; in their lives to accept God into their hearts. If you wish to hear God's voice, you will find it within this book."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have read 'God Calling' every day for years -- it is one of my favorite daily devotional books. I have an old, old paperback edition and I have highlighted, underlined, marked all my favorites -- they are really ALL my favorites!! I treated myself to this new expanded book and I love it!! It is so beautiful -- visually and to the touch! I highly recommend it!! The words, of course, are as wonderful as in my old book but there are additions of Scripture and each day has it's own page -- it gives me even more joy just to open it and see those cherished words of 'God Calling' displayed so beautifully."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I initially bought this journal for two prayer partners for a Christmas gift. Upon browsing through it, I discovered it to be not just a journal and immediately returned to the store in search of another. It is the best thing I have ever bought. The entries by the two listeners line up with the word of God. This journal is truly annointed and could not be understood by the spiritually dead. It speaks to you in ways only God could...it speaks to the heart."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Excellent little daily readings to go along with daily Bible readings. No one could have made this up -- the truths are just too awesome. These words make you think and want to follow Jesus' way of life for us."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I had no experience with \\"God Calling\\" until I read this, the expanded edition. The only devotional that I could commit myself to in the past was \\"My Utmost\\" by Oswald Chambers. But this devotional is honest and easy to find myself lost in.The book is written from the perspective of God talking to His children. I've read another book recently that was written in the same way, and felt disappointed by the misuse of scripture in that one. THIS BOOK, however does not misuse scripture, but opens your heart so that God can speak right to it.I enjoyed the added scripture references, and sometimes the poetry/song lyrics were dead on. Other times, I could have done without them.Even though the devotionals are short, they are to the point and dive down deep into your soul. I am so happy that I chose this book to give a chance. I recieved this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"God Calling seems to speak directly to the reader about Jesus's love and faithfulness to us.

I kept asking her where could I find one. She thought it was out of print. I took the information from the book and tried to order it for myself.

If I had the money, I would give one to everyone I met.Brooklyn, New York"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Chronically ill with a degenerative bone disease, I was depressed and beyound hope. Nothing held meaning for me. The Bible seemed too harsh and I had a hard time relating to it. Then a friend gave me a copy of this book, and it has completely turned my life around. I have given away dozens of copies to friends and family. And they all constantly tell me how much it has meant to them and also buy copies for their friends! If you are looking for a book to nurture your spiritual growth, this is it! It is my all time favorite book!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"My boss gave this to me after my mother unexpectantly passed away. By reading and journaling my feelings these thoughts and words helped me through a very tough time. It also prepared me for a spiritual daily retreat."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I was given this jewel from a friend last year. Little did I know then it would see me through one of the hardest years of my life. When I read my daily devotional I truly feel God speaking directly to me. Of the several devotionals I have read over the years, this one is the most powerful. It has become my favorite gift to those I know and love. My readings are my daily gift to me."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I received this book about 15 or so years ago from a dear friend. I was going through a rough patch and this book really provided me with comfort and strength to face the day. The book is set up as a daily devotional, a short brief meditation for the day. My copy is falling apart and one day I will have to replace it. This book has deep sentimental value to me."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"God Calling is a wonderfully inspired book. I've been reading and re-reading it for years. But I'm angry to discover that the version I've been reading is not complete. I found an old edition and compared it to mine and discovered the original text was longer. There have been entire paragraphs deleted from some of the messages. Look for an old edition. Don't by the Barbour Books edition that I have."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This uplifting little book has become a regular part of my devotions for the last six years. In addition, I have bought many of them to give to friends and family."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This book was passed on to me many years ago. I've read it off and on for twenty something years and always find it new each time I pick it up. I thought it was out of print by now, but recently ran across it on Amazon, deciding to send it to a friend who was hurting in life trials and tribulations. I started reading it again finding I was the one who needed it now.It's a daily word book, written to two women from God. A long time ago I thought it applied to my life when I was forty years old. Now, at 60 plus I find it still applies, but this time I'm going to try hard to live by it's 'calling'. Recommended to everyone who's trying to figure out their life."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This daily devotional is the one I use consistently. Each day, a concise, inspirational message is delivered in minimal words, making it easy to adopt this into your routine.

I have used it on and off for over three years now and I am constantly amazed at how God affirms and confirms His leading in my life through it! Time and time again the daily reading is exactly what I needed to hear. I thank God for His love in the lives of the two women who He spoke to, and that the rest of us can partake of the wonder!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"The book is very inspirational, however, it leads readers to believe that the book is inspired by God. The book writes as if it is God's perspective and words, when it is really two listeners receiving messages. I found that kind of disturbing when I was reading and constantly had to remind myself that these are not God's words. I would recommend it to read because it is inspirational, but use your judgement, and know that these words are not from God but are from two ordinary people. This book should not be an excuse not to read the bible, as those words are from Jesus and are reliable."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"He will talk to you if you read this book everyday! I take the book; open it to just any page, read where my eyes land and I promise you, almost every time what you read is just what you need to hear God say to you!!!! It's the most precious book you will ever own...or least it is for me! Read it more than once a day, it will lift your spirits, soothe your soul, and give you just what you need.

I gave a copy to a well-to-do friend and between us we have givenaway at least 100 copies over the years. It is so uplifting and inspirationalbecause it really makes you aware of the kindness and love of God. It brings it home to you that He loves YOU and wants you to love Him just as you want your children to love you. Every year you are in a different place on yourjourney through life, therefore you'll get a fresh new insight to each reading year after year.

This journal has been such a source of encouragement to him and he revisits it often! The two listeners are 2 women who seem to really be in touch with God's heart. They use God's Word, but the way they convey His principles . . . it is so easy to comprehend. The journal is beautiful and the words are so encouraging and meaningful. We purchased a replacement copy for my husband - FINALLY! - and purchased 2 more for dear friends who are going through difficult times in their lives. This journal is a must-have and has been such a source of encouragement and truth!!!

It's amazing."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This book is like no other. I purchase paper-book copies and give them away. I leave them in hotel rooms, hospitals, doctors office, prisons, etc. You may scoff, but I do believe this book to be divinely inspired. I came across this book about 20 years ago. It was not written by Mr. Russell, he is only the editor. Be sure to read the introduction. The authors or receivers of the messages wished to remain anonymous, and no doubt are no longer living since the messages came around 1930 I believe. Read \\"Savanah\\"s comments. I agree with her 100 % for I have found everything she said to be true for me also. I have probably bought over 100 copies and am now ordering 10 more as I am out of stock. I always order at least enough to qualify for the free shipping which is nice. Other \\"inspirational\\" books pale next to this. As for myself, I cant believe these two women made this up, there is too much truth and beauty in the \\"messages\\".

I have been reading it for 4 or more years now - lost track. This year I read the reading on February 25 and March 23.

I made those 2 day's readings into a confession - wow!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This version of &#34;God Calling&#34; - the expanded version - is a treat. The quality of the actual materials used to make the pages, the cover and binding... along with the scripture and additional notes are well-worth the cost. Partly because of this detail, the book has become a morning favorite of mine. I can't say enough about the book, the authors, the publisher...and of course, the words of encouragement that flow from it on a daily basis. I do not see ever throwing this book away - and it's designed for several generations to use without falling apart."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"The spiritual guidance to be found in this little book has been some of the best I have ever encountered. Both my husband and myself have found this book a source of great strength in difficult times. What isso absolutely amazing about it is that we have found time and again that the problem we have been wrestling with is answered the very next morning in the daily meditation. We have given God Calling to many people for whom it has also been a book in a class of its own. The fact that it was written by two ordinary, poverty-stricken elderly women, one of whom endured continuous ill-health, makes it even more valuable. One recognizes the spirit of God speaking from these pages and can only be grateful that the perserverance of these two believers have so enriched the lives of countless others."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"way nicer than I expected beautiful design very manly too.Would recomend this purchase to other women who might want a nice gift for their man."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have purchased them for family and friends... they make them for kids, teens, et al.

I never travel without it. So often it has reassured me of God's love, reminded me of his promises, or renewed in me a sense of His deep power and infinite grace in the exact way and with the exact words I needed at that time.I have given it as a gift to many people, especially when they are either renewing their faith or struggling with maintaining their hope in times of distress. The book offers words of comfort, hope, and assurance. It speaks of God's infinite love, His unimaginable power, His unending grace and kindness to us.I love that it is written in \\"first person,\\" as if directly from God. I believe in the faith of The Two Listeners, and so I do believe these words were directly inspired by God.But just as importantly, this book reminds me that I need to be a Listener, too. It reminds me that it is not enough to be a petitioner in my prayers -- that listening for God's voice is just as important -- if not more important -- when praying.Sometimes, I will use other devotionals -- My Utmost for His Highest is another favorite -- but in times of distress and great need, this is the devotional I keep coming back to. It is one of my most treasured possession, and it is one of my greatest weapons against fear, anger, and despair. I can not recommend it more highly."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend and became very concerned about the content of the book when I read the statements in the preface by one of the &quot;two listeners&quot;. The statements were as follows, &quot;We were being taught, trained and encouraged day by day by HIM personally, when millions of souls, far worthier, had to be content with guidance from the Bible, sermons, their churches, books and other sources.&quot; &quot;So to us this book, which we believe has been guided by our Lord Himself, is no ordinary book.&quot; I read a review of God Calling from the Christian Research Journal, Summer 1998, that said, &quot;If you accept these statements as true, the implications are immense. That would be saying that personal guidance is better than the Bible and that God Calling has more actual words of Christ than the Bible. There is no denying that many statements in the book are inspiring. Scripture is often quoted in God Calling. But cultic literature often quotes Scripture. Reading Scripture wherever it may be found and being blessed by it does not automatically legitimize the publication in which it is included.&quot; There is much more information in this review by the Christian Research Journal that I think any discerning Christian should read before they decide to use this book or recommend it to their friends and family."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"My mother gave me my first copy of \\"God Calling\\" over 30 years ago. I passed my treasured copy on to an old friend and bought a new one, which is now falling apart. It puts life simply in perspective and is such a blessing. There is a short reading for each day. I find it goes along well with what Holy Scripture says. It is a compliation of what Jesus had to say to two women each day who were seeking him. I start at the beginning January 1 each year and it continues to minister to me."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I heard of this book from my mother originally. It was gifted to me by someone I briefly met in a prayer group. Since then I have found that none of the entries conflict with Scriptures, nor with my personal religious faith, Catholicism. I am a minister to children at a local Juvenile Hall. And I have found that these young men and women have been drawn very deeply to the words of comfort and peace in this book. It speaks of patience, diligence, rest, strength, joy and doing little tasks for Christ. All of us have our own prisons, and we all need this book as part of our daily spiritual exercises."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"If this is not a life-changing book for you then I doubt there is any book that could be.

What is so unique about it, I think, is that it is written as if Jesus is speaking to you personally. Once you sense that and begin to flow with it I have found that it has a special kind of power to it. Of course, it is a daily devotional so I combine it with a few others for my morning routine. It usually adds a special insight due to its perspective."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have found God Calling a masterpiece. It is the book I read daily, give to others, and cherish.

Now I want you to know, I'm not taking away from His words in the Holy Bible. For I love the Holy Bible also. I encourage you to get this journal so you will know what I'm telling you is the truth.

I just recieved this book and after only reading a few insights from the Lord, I knew this to be the real deal. I am a fundamental Christian who is skeptical toward outside sources other than the bible and this not only correlates with scripture, it seems to fill in some of the cracks I had regarding my faith. I believe the Holy Spirit lead me to this book at a much needed time in my life.

I like having a few copies on hand at all times to give to new friends I haven't met yet because I want to share this book with everyone I care about. The daily readings are short and oh so inspirational. I have been reading it since 1993. My personal belief is that the ladies who wrote it were in direct contact with Jesus. But even if one does not choose to believe that, the information inside is uplifting in itself and helps answer some of life's most difficult questions."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I first bought this at Walmart and there were plenty of them.

There were none left at Walmart, then I thought of Amazon, and ordered as many as were available, which was not enough.The expanded edition is incredible. I can not possibly explain in words, except to say, just buy it. It has a devotion, etc. for every day, but I read one day and end up reading ten days at a time. Be care ful that you are buying the genuine article if in a dept.store;there are many inspirationals by nearly the same name. Best buy is on amazon..I rec'd mine in less than three days!!

I must tell you honestly, as a long term student of the Course in Miracles, this book has taken equal status. I do not start my day without it. How profound to hear the words that go immediately about their job of opening my heart and helping me to listen to the wisdom , not just listen but to feel it.

The closest one can get to listening to God and hearing His encouragement and reminders of His love for each of us. A true daily walk with Him."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"In 1932, life was harsh and difficult for two anonymous women, so much so that one considered suicide. But as they prayed together, they were comforted with simple, yet heart warming, insights and inspirations. God undoubtedly spoke to these women, as He speaks to anyone who takes the time to listen. But as all of us often do, they filtered out what they didn't want to hear. The Word of God is like a sword with two edges. One edge is receiving comfort and healing for oneself. \\"Come unto Me, and I will give you rest\\" (Matt. 11:28). The other is giving comfort and healing to others. \\"Take my yoke upon you\\" (Matt. 11:29). The \\"Listeners\\" enthusiastically embraced the first edge, but only superficially acknowledged the second. They couldn't understand why their Savior would ask them, already crushed by their own burdens, to take on a spiritual burden for somebody else. They didn't see that Jesus powerfully transforms us and our circumstances when we take our eyes off ourselves, even if only for a moment, and look to help somebody else who is hurting even more than we are. I recommend this book. It genuinely reflects the Father's warmth and tenderness. But be careful! In isolation, it can lead to spirituality that is outwardly blissful and euphoric, but inwardly selfish and self-centered. For a balanced spiritual diet, read \\"God Calling\\" along side other books that teach how to \\"be there\\" for others, through intercessory prayer, Christian community and the Spirit's gifts for ministry."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"If you could read only one book in your entire life, this should be the one. If your needs are emotional,financial, or physical...or if your question is as simple and complex as finding the meaning of life...you will find the answers in this book. But, don't expect easy answers. Don't confuse simplicity, with ease. This book will challenge you to grow, and remind you that no growth process is ever easy. Yet, in its pages you will find a tenderness, love, and support that will move you to tears. Read it daily, and listen with your heart, and you will hear God calling...you."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"there are no words in the English language to describe how this book changed my life.you do not have be in a paticular religion,for this book to talk to you.yes i mean talk to you! i have had my book for many years and still to this day this book takes my breath away."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This book is a series of devotionals written by a woman during a daily prayer time with a friend. As they met to pray each day, the Holy Spirit gave one of them a message and those daily messages make up this book. As God says in His Word, \\"Where two or three are gathered in My name, I AM there in the midst of them.\\" The ladies wanted no recognition because they wanted God to receive all the praise and honor. I have been blessed and believe that you will as well.

I highly recommend this book for people who are trying not to &quot;lean on their own understanding&quot; and want to learn how to trust God."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This book is based on \\"revelations\\" given to two women that were reported to the author. The author and the women considered them to be direct revelations from God, so the passages are made to sound like they are authoritative as if from scripture. There are examples in almost every passage. For ex, today (April 14):\\"My Children, I guide you always. The walking in the way may not be always carried out, but the guiding is always so sure.\\"This book is the height of presumption- as if these words are God's words. Typical of most mass media protestants, he says things that sound good at first pass if you are predisposed to like it; but if you reflect on what he says it often doesn't mean anything and when it does, it's not very deep or thought provoking.The author and the receivers of these revelations needed a dose of humility."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This is such a wonderful and heartfelt book that touches your spirit...when you need words of encouragement/comfort.

I'm giving Barbour Publishing, and any other publisher that is printing edited down versions of this book 1 star or less. I have a paperback edition that was printed by Jove Books in 1978. I just got a new hardcover edition printed by Barbour in 2000. I was going to throw out my tattered paperback, but I did a coursory comparison of a couple entries and discovered the new Barbour hardback entries all had entire paragraphs removed. And from a spritual point of view, they were VERY IMPORTANT paragraphs. Upon investigating, MANY of them have had sentances and paragraphs removed. You're better off going to a book store, and looking for an edition that that says \\"this book contains the complete text of the original hard cover...\\". The passages have completely new meanings when you read the full text as God intended.

I have been reading it on a daily basis for five consecutive years and cannot imagine starting my day without it. It was given to me as a gift by me wonderful sister, Mary Lou.The book, based on apparitions of our Lord to two women living together in England in the 1930s, is organized by month and day with a daily message from God (through the apparition of Jesus) on how to live our life. A.J. Russell helped in the organization and editing of the book. What has been accomplished is superb as one cannot help but feel that God is calling him/her to meditation, love, and/or action.God Calling has been vetted by the Anglican Church to insure Scripture accuracy and adherence.I have given God Calling to many friends who were either searching for a good devotional or had become stumped spiritually. I have recommended it to many more. I know that I am not alone in my feelings for this book since most that received it or purchased a copy also begin their day with God Calling to them."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I came across this book by accident at the bookstore. There it sat, one lonely copy with an intriguing title. The daily words of inspiration seemed to speak directly to me. With uncanny precision it has constantly provided me with support during difficult as well as happy times in my life. After owning this book for 4 years and reading it daily, I now know that it was no accident that the only copy left at the bookstore was meant for me. Buy this book....I doubt you will ever regret it."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I just submitted a review and I should have read the &quot;example customer reviews&quot; before writing my first one. To anyone who would question the motive of the &quot;two listeners&quot; or A.J. Russell, I would encourage you to get a copy of the journal edition that includes at least one scripture related to each day's devotion. It is inferred in the book's introduction that it was through the studying of the Word of God on a daily basis that these two women grasped the insight found in God Calling. It is a supernatural event when our limited human minds take hold of divine truth, when we are given &quot;revelations&quot; concerning that which we formerly did not understand, that which we have not been formally educated concerning. This is not cultish or pagan mysticism at work. This is the grace of God to us who believe. If it was evil, it seems to me that another &quot;fruit&quot; of that evil would be for worldly fame and recognition for such profound writing. Instead, all we know is that 2 women faithfully and humbly took God at His Word that He would guide them into all truth and teach them all things and that a publisher, who loves God, decided to let the world enjoy the fruit of these women's faith. I thank God for all three of these people and I am challenged to read the Word of God for myself DAILY that I, too, may know God more fully and intimately. I applaud the attempt at warning all of us against being led astray by mystic sentiment but this book does nothing but support the foundation of solid, Biblical principals. If it repeatedly celebrates and admonishes fruits of the Spirit- LOVE, JOY, PEACE, PATIENCE, KINDNESS, GOODNESS, FAITHFULNESS, GENTLENESS, SELF-CONTROL- reason tells me that it is indeed, FRUIT of the Spirit of God Himself. Remember, even Jesus said, &quot;for the tree is known by it's fruit&quot; (Matt. 12:33)when He was accused of being in league with satan. This book edifies God, encourages further study of the Word of God, and had the potential to transform my mind and heart to more closely resemble that of God the Father, Jesus the Son &amp; Savior, and of the Spirit, Who is our Guide into all truth.(John 14:26) God bless all of you who are earnestly seeking Him!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have read this devotional every day for the past seven years. I have found this book to be inspirational and helpful in keeping me focused on my daily walk with Christ. This book comes to us from two &quot;Listeners&quot;. It occurred to me that it doesn't really matter how these God-inspired messages came about, it only matters that these messages lead others to God's love. A truly comforting and uplifting source of peace."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"In 1935, two women who remain anonymous and wanted to be known simply as \\"Two Listeners\\", have been given these messages from the living Christ. These messages give hope, comfort, wisdom, challenges and most of all love to it's readers. In the midst of poverty and disillusionment these two women were able to find comfort from words spoken in the depths of their hearts. We too can find wisdom if we listen with an open mind and heart, Christ will speak to us and lead us on our way to becoming our other self, with hearts renewed by Christ himself. God Calling and God at Eventide are daily meditations that can be read each day.

It then remained tucked away and forgotten until recently when I began searching for spiritual comfort, growth, and guidance. How powerful it still is! I didn't just find it something to soothe my hurts. I found it to be challenging and downright confrontational on occasion. I needed that!The &quot;two listeners&quot; are not psychics, but two women wished to share with others some of the lessons God taught them in their journey together with Him.As a means of deepening my daily devotionals, I have chosen to use a concordance and my Bible to locate the scriptures which deal with the daily topics. The &quot;Two Listeners&quot; CAN be validated by scripture. I would challenge their skeptics to use God's Word for proof."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I too have been reading this for about 20 years and it's been a lifesaver for me. I've purchased and given so many away that I really couldn't say how many over the years.Before this book, I had so many pre-conceived ideas about who Jesus was by all the things I had learned as a child. This book has allowed me to know Him in such an intimate way. I was so wrong about EVERYTHING! Matter of fact, I've discovered that most of the things I learned about him were 'exactly' the opposite of who He really is. Every day I learn something new about Him or myself or others I'm dealing with, by reading that days message. Even though I've been through the book so many times, I find I understand things I didn't in the years before. I attribute that to spiritual grown and understanding.It doesn't get old. You just find out more and more about who you are and who He is. To me that is the key to life.I've taught those who have received this from me not to look ahead because it could discourage you thinking 'Next Tuesday looks scary as He's talking about the hardship you are going through.' Yikes!!I've discovered from this book that when you listen to the birds song, it actually imprints Joy on your soul. A bank if you will to be used during times of sorrow or heartache. What a gift huh? I learned that when you look at a flower, it's beauty is imprinted on your soul and comes back into the world as a smile or a cheer for others. What a guy to think of all these ways to concur evil.I recomend this book to all who question the reality of God or His Son. See if you can find all of the times He says \\"FEAR NOT\\" in this book. It's amazing that it's probably the most used word He spoke and yet we that proclaim to have Faith, never heard it or don't believe it.This book has been the lifeline to overcoming hardships, finding Hope when I thought all Hope was lost, hanging on in His Strength when I couldn't hang on another minute, but most of all, this book has introduced me to the guy I've always been looking for. A very human Jesus."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I've always wondered why many Christians seem so stressed and burdened that all the JOY seems sapped from their lives, like the saving work of Grace was all up to THEM and the effort required just tired all the joy right out of them. Well, this powerful little book reverberates with the truth of Jesus' redemptive works: \\"Not I, but the Father who dwelleth in Me doeth the work.\\" The desire to know and live in harmony with the Will of God is kindled in the reader and the resultant JOY is restored directly to the believing heart. It doesn't matter what you are going through, whether times of joy or times of trial: \\"Your faith and MY Power - the only two essentials. Nothing else is needed.\\" (Feb.3 - If Men Oppose). Stop eating spiritual \\"crumbs\\" and begin feasting on the spiritual banquet testified to within the pages of this powerful, life-changing book. It will satisfy your soul."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"i would just like to say, the lord jesus christ has blessed me so much with this book,it is a pricless blessing of my life,the lord knows i was going through a very hard and difficult time in me life,and he knew what i needed most the lord is my shepard i shall not want,there was alot of things in the bible i did not understand,in his word he said when he was alone with his disciples he explained to them,and that it what i feel he has done with me in this book and more,the lord jesus is so good!!i cant even explain all that it has helped me,it even helped me to read the bible more,well because the lord nows what i go through oh he has really helped me so much,to wonderful to even explain,i did pray to the lord about this book,because the lord knows i only want his truth,and he has confirmed to me time and time again that this is from him,its just so amazing and exciting.so yes to be skeptical is okcause the lord wants us to be diserning,he also wants us to have a chid like faith,and trust him,simple trust he wont fail us,and he will lead us in all truth its a promise he will never leave us or forsake us is a promise!i would recomend this book {blessing} to everyone!!!!i also think its neat that the two listeners wanted to be anomenus,cause they were not looking for praise for thierselves and they could have,cause in john chap.7 verse18 the lord showed me it says,thosewho present thier own ideas are looking for praise for themselves,but those who seek to honer the one who sent them are good and genuine i believe we should never limit his word,where he says where two or more are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them, thy word is a lamp unto my feet,and a light unto my path.\\"and the word was made flesh and dwelt amoung us.and jesus is the same yesterday,today and forever.if he did it for his disciples he will truley do it for us,i just want to say jesus is awsome and his name alone is excellent!!!!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This little book has gotten me through all the ups and very downs of an ordinary life. This is a daily reader, and the topic always hits the mark, as though it's written to me alone. It is Christian based, but, it doesn't really matter what you call yourself, the only important message is your relationship with God.I never seem to connect with God, even in prayer or meditation, at least in any way that I recognize, but this book does that for me- helps me connect. I understand God now in a completely different and personal way.I'm not sure how this book came to me, but since I have read it (daily for about 2 years), I have bought it (and it's very inexpensive)and given it to friends who have bought it and given it to friends...."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have had this journal for the last year, and no matter what day I picked it up, it has applied to whatever might have been going on in my life. It is thought inspirationsonal, sometimes if I did it at night I really had to re read in the am or several times to make sure what I was getting out of it, was what I thought at first. I bless these two women that made this together, as I am sure the Lord had made them an equality that shares in voices. The scriptures and most of all the space to enter notes, were just fantastic. I have so many devotionals but kept coming back to this one, as it does have the journal part. You can enter either what you thought or processed this or you could just enter what was going on in your life that day, and then sometimes I correlated the two. I think that it made it an extraordinary devotional journal as I did not ever just put it down. IT was a well traveled book and so helpful in all areas of my life. I knew that I could continue to just keep it and go over it day after day this year, but wanted a fresh one to start over. It was not easy to find, therefore I came to Amazon and here it was. I bought at Sam's last year with the intention of giving it away, but found myself using it. I could not find it at Sam's this year. Thank you Amazon.

I answered \\"No,\\" and she left it with me. On returning home, I bought a copy for myself. I was curiously affected by the book and felt that I wanted all my friends to read it immediately, and actually made out a list of over a hundred people to whom I should have liked to have sent it. Not being rich, this desire had to be content with two copies, which I lent to various people, on whom it seemed to make little effect. A few months later I read it again. It was then that there came a persistent desire to try to see whether I could get guidance such as A. J. Russell reported, through sharing a quiet time with the friend with whom I was then living. She was a deeply spiritual woman with unwavering faith in the goodness of God and a devout believer in prayer, although her life had not been an easy one.I was rather skeptical, but, as she agreed, we sat down, pencils and paper in hand and waiting. This was in December 1932. My results were entirely negative. Portions of texts came and went, then my mind wandered to ordinary topics. I brought it back again and again, but with no success. To this day, I cannot get guidance in this way alone.But with my friend a very wonderful thing happened. From the first, beautiful messages were given to her by our Lord Himself, and every day from then these messages have never failed us....... So I've been told, this is considered an occultic practice of \\"journaling\\" or \\"channeling\\" and is what many New Age teachers use and recommend. They sit and write down or journal the thoughts that come into their heads. That's the technique New Age leader Neale Donald Walsh used to write the entire \\"Conversations with God\\" series. This is NOT Christian. To me, this also sounds similar to the occultic Seth books from wikipedia: \\"In late 1963, Roberts and her husband, Robert F. Butts, experimented with a Ouija board as part of Roberts' research for a book on extra-sensory perception. According to Roberts and Butts, on December 2, 1963 they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality who eventually identified himself as Seth. Soon after, Roberts reported that she was hearing the messages in her head. She began to dictate the messages instead of using the Ouija board, and she eventually abandoned the board.\\"One BIG clue that this book is communicating with a spirit being is that they do not use the normal Christian terms. If you are at all familiar with New Age, occult or Word Faith, they like to change the names. They speak of \\"the power\\" \\"the force\\" and in this book \\"the Great Friend\\" and \\"The Master\\" and \\"The Great Companion and Guide.\\" Yes, a spirit guide. Not Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"In 1982, my freshman college roommate saw that I was going through a rough time, and bought a copy of &quot;God Calling&quot; for me (I had been reading hers).

It is a daily reminder that God's intention is to inspire and guide us in a very loving and personal way. The first person delivery of the message in \\"God Calling\\" lets each reader know that God, or in this Christian presentation, Jesus Christ, is a wise friend who cares very deeply for each of His children. It is a message we all need, but few are open enough to receive.On a personal level, I wondered if the message conveyed through the \\"Two Listerners\\" in \\"God Calling\\" could be received by me. I began to practice daily guidance and found that it worked. The message, although written down in language I typically use, is nonetheless as pure and loving as that which came through the \\"Two Listeners.\\" As a result, my relationship with God has soared to a new level of intimacy and understanding.

When it was written in 1993 the conflict still raged and disclosures of systematic government-ordered rapes primarily against Muslim women by Serbs were new and shocking to most readers. Now five years later the crimes still shock, but by their magnitude and not their novelty. This book is still a powerful witness to the rapes, but more importantly it provides a legal, psychological, and historic framework for coming to an understanding which is necessary if we are to try to prevent more such horrors in the future, or at least to provide a timely intervention and vigorous prosecution of the perpetrators.Stiglmayer's own pair of essays are the most useful and interesting. Her first piece is an absorbing history of the Balkans that concisely untangles the web of hatreds and violence which have plagued the area for millennia and which are still powerfully germane. Her second piece constitutes the heart of the book. In it she dramatically and persuasively demonstrates that the rapes in Bosnia are not &quot;typical&quot; rapes, even by wartime standards, but are a tool systematically employed by the Serb leadership to pursue its genocidal campaign of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;. Her interviews illustrate that the rapes are about the humiliation of women, but they are also directed at the Bosnian Muslim population as a whole as a tactical means to accomplish the evacuation by the Muslims of large swaths of Bosnian territory.In other essays, Paul Parin offers some ideas on the psychology of the rapes. He doesn't claim to have all the answers, but his essay is thought-provoking. Rhonda Copelon provides a considered analysis of the state of international law and its applicability to the Bosnian horrors. Her otherwise sound piece is marred by her lawyerly/academic tendency to misuse words (&quot;surface&quot; as a transitive verb meaning &quot;bring to light&quot;; &quot;intersectional&quot; where she means &quot;intersecting&quot;) and her occasional unlawyerly hyperbole (she notes on p.198 that a midday women's talk show opened with the script, &quot;In Bosnia, they are raping the enemy's women&quot;. Two pages later this has turned into the assertion that the media &quot;often refer to the mass rape in Bosnia as the rape of the \`enemy's women'&quot;).Surprisingly, the most disappointing essays are those by the best-known authors. The first of Catharine MacKinnon's two pieces is a reprint of a 1993 Ms. Magazine article. She gets in some obligatory feminist chops, pokes at Gloria Steinem, equates the Third Reich with Penthouse, and moans about American women in porn films, in brothels, and in slavery. She slips in a couple of gratuitous anecdotes, and that's it. No analysis, no nothing. It reads as though she wrote it on a train with a short deadline and did her research by cell-phone. Her second piece is marginally better, but her point is a weak one. She is horrified by the crimes against women, yet she wants to pile every insult and irritation ever suffered by woman under the umbrella of human rights violation. In one breathless sentence (p.185) she says &quot;...UN troops were targeting women: \`In the streets of Zagreb, UN troops often ask local women how much they cost'&quot;. Her whining about merely boorish behavior undermines her credibility and belittles the plight of women who suffered grievously in the wars. MacKinnon is exasperating, yet passionate, but ultimately her pieces fail because of her unsupported allegations and the scattered and distracting nature of her attacks on anything that pops into her head.Similarly, Susan Brownmiller spends her essay slamming men as warrior animals. So much so that she entirely misses the point that these rapists were not beasts out of control, but were entirely under control and following their leaders' war plans to a tee. Brownmiller is not a scholar of Balkan history with any depth or understanding. She doesn't have Stiglmayer's innovative perceptions of the war. The Brownmiller piece offers no value added, it is mere filler.Overall the book is excellent. Although, now, five years later, Stiglmayer could well give it another update, in addition to the changes she has made for this English edition. The wars have reached a precarious end, the ICTY war crimes trials are underway. There is another chapter to be added to the book, one can only hope that Stiglmayer will provide it, so that this work can remain fresh for many more years."},{"Title":"Mass Rape: The War Against Women in Bosnia-Herzegovina","review":"This was a decent grouping of articles relating to the mass rapes occuring in Bosnia. Including interviews with the women themselves, as well as some of the rapists, it paints a vivid picture of these troubling events.

Also, more information on where officials in Bosnia stand on this issue. This book could have been more well-rounded analytically."},{"Title":"Mass Rape: The War Against Women in Bosnia-Herzegovina","review":"I read the book.

I'm not sure if that is the complete set or not, but they are great. Written for the very young (K-2nd gr.), they are packed with info that even an older child could benefit from. For example: \\"Why is the grass green?\\" The question is asked by a field mouse. The animals find a cow, and the cow explains in simple language with the help of picture inserts why the grass is green. She tells them about chlorophyll, sunlight, water, carbon dioxide and then sums it up with photosynthesis and how the plant gives off a gas we need to survive-oxygen. Sounds too deep, not at all. The pictures are very colorful and the words are caption style, like a cartoon, without being confusing. My children have read them over and over. Recently, I was going to sell the set, thinking they may have outgrown them. My 7 yr. old son, (who reads on a 6th gr. level-not to bragg), wouldn't hear of it & begged me to keep them. I would highly recommend this set. My set includes: Why is the grass green, Why do leaves change color?, What is an ocean?, What is a river?, What is an iceberg?, What is a wave?, What is an island?, Why is the sky blue?, What is a cloud?, Why does it rain?, Why does it snow?, Why do birds sing?, Why do birds fly south?, What is a fruit?, What is a vegetable?, What are seasons?, Why does it fly?, Why does it float?, What is electricity?, Why does it thunder and lightning?, What is a volcano?, What is a mountain?, What is a desert?, What is a farm?, What is a star?, What is the moon?, What is a butterfly?, What is a rainbow?, What is a jungle?, Why is it hot?, Why is it cold?, Why do animals sleep through winter?, What makes day & night?, What is gravity?"},{"Title":"A Just Ask Book Set (JUST ASK)","review":"I had this set as a child and wish that we had kept them (probably sold them in a yard sale!)

This book offers alternatives to that strategy allowing you to prosper in any kind of market.This is the first book that I have read on stocks that goes along with my logic and common sense. Each book/Author sets different guidelines to follow, many of which seem quite illogical to me. It is not that I didn't comprehend what these books were saying, I just couldn't fathom how this information could help me choose great stocks.This should not be the first book that you read on the stock market, but it could very well be the most important.

But by Dec 1998 he made back all he loses and then some.OK. but the only explanation Cramer gives for being down $90,000,000 is because he was not disciplined. But then his wifetold Cramer he was not being disciplined and then he becomes disciplined. And then Cramer was able to erase his $90,000,000 in losses.Wow, that really explained nothing to me. I not a professionalhedge fund manager like Cramer was, but I have bought and soldabout $10,000,000 (notional amount) of money in personal account. And in late January 2000 I was down 50% year to date in my account and by March 2000 I was up 60% year to date in my account. It's called having bad luck and then having really good luck. Imagine if I told anyone the reason I went from being down 50% to being up over %60 is because my wife camein the room and told me I need to be disciplined - they would think I was a little wacko.If you really want to read about how to invest then you should look at the reading material required by the CFA institute to become a Charted Financial Analyst.After I try to stomach some more of this book I'll give more feedback..."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I really like this book.

He did direct the reader to \\"thestreet.com/under10\\", which costs money to see a list of companies that have postential of making money. I think the book offers enough information for the reader to find those stocks on their own.I would like the book better if there was a workbook stock analyzer with it using his rules to pick stocks. I don't think it will be that difficult to make one myself. I also would've liked charts showing what happens to different stocks when the fed changes interest rates and other factors that affect stocks. I went back and looked myself for those historical charts online and didn't see a strong correlation, but I'm just getting started.Bottom line, this is a good beginner book and he does give you some different advice and some really good insight on how the market works. I liked it and think a newer investor would benefit from it. I don't think you should use it as your only book, though."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim Cramer's new book was a pleasure to read and I would recommend it anyone. Many of the reviewers on this board have stated the book is for beginners or it contains no unique or complex trading strategies. I disagree. Jim shows that there is no excuse for not doing homework on a stock and you HAVE to understand the basic financials of a company and understand some of the basic sectors and how they move with seasonal economic cycles. This sounds so basic in the eyes of many people but few follow his sound rules.The bottom line here is that you must do research on companies you want to invest in and you need to stick to some simple, commen sense trading strategies. One of the hardest things to do with individual stock investments is knowing when to sell, and Cramer drills this into your head and makes you aware that there are circumstances when you must take your profits or cut your losses and move on. His explanations and real-world examples are hilarious and informative, just like his TV show. Don't be afraid to buy this book, its great and you just might rediscover some of the most important and basic fundamentals that you have forgotten over the years."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I found this book very entertaining. For those that listen to Mr. Cramer on the radio, the book reads exactly as he sounds on his radio show 'Real Money'.The book takes you by the hand and introduces you to the general ideas of trading and investing. However, Mr. Cramer's target audience is not the seasoned investor but rather beginners and the mainstream retail trader/investor. This doesn't mean that a seasoned investor can not read the book. I actually find that the book is funny and, if you happen to enjoy Jim's way of expressing himself, you'll find the book interesting.In my opinion, Mr. Cramer accomplishes 3 objectives on this book:* it opens the appetite for those who are new to the game* stablishes rules for those who are new, starting or casual investors* lays down a foundation about investingMr. Cramer does not deliver on this book secrets about the stock market nor techniques for trading/investing.The book is intended to be an \\"starter\\"."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"The book is a brisk read...no doubt thanks to a LOT of professional writing help.

You will always learn something from Jim's writings, but you must use the book (and his columns) as study guides if you are serious about improving your investing skill. Read and reread Jim's advice on \\"buy and homework\\". My work has improved immensely under Jim's tutelage because the amount of effort I am expending weekly is a lot higher! This book will teach you a good way to evaluate your decisions and give you a disciplined approach to making money (primarily by teaching you to be careful about LOSING it).In addition to this book being a fun as well as instructive read; I am going to promote the value of the subscription services of TheStreet.com. It is worth every penny!There are numerous excellent teachers of the financial world that write frequently on the website and they generously share their insights with the readers. The book will provide you extra value when used in conjunction with TheStreet.com (kudos to ActionAlerts Plus and Stocks under $10).I'm obviously a big fan; but my investment returns over the last 5 years are the reason. Great work JJC!!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I'm reading a lot of investment books right now, and let me just say that Cramer's holds up better to an overall scrutiny than most, if not all, the ones I've encountered lately. There seems to be a spectrum in investment type books. On one extreme are the pep talk type you-can-do-anything-if-you-just-believe books, which often contain very little information but a lot of hype. These books will often try to convince you that you can be rich, but will do very little to teach you how to actually do so. At the other end of the spectrum are the magic formula types, books that often present an over-simplistic idea of investing which is then backed up by hand picked charts and examples. I believe Cramer's intent was to hit the middle of the spectrum--to show you how to invest (and to convince you that you can do it yourself), but also to alert you to the fact that it will require some effort on your part.Investing is not easy. I wish it were--I wish I could believe that it was possible to throw darts at investments and have them pay off. But I believe it requires work, and that is why I'm so impressed with Cramer's work. He preaches homework--putting the effort into learning about the companies behind the ticker symbols both before you buy and while you hold. To me this is Cramer at his best, a rolling-up of the sleeves as he shows readers how he made his money, and his basis for picking the stocks he follows on his radio and TV shows, and in his public portfolio.There is a lot of \\"meat\\" in this book--it's full of sound advice and chock full of investment strategies that can help both the casual investor and more serious traders in their work. I am not, however, in the camp that believes Cramer is the last word. I believe in exposing myself to as many investment strategies as possible. But I also have to admit that I'm a Cramerholic, and that his techniques have proven to be of more worth to me as as individual investor than anything else I've yet come across.There are, of course, naysayers--there always are. But, again, Cramer has worked for me. And his charisma has been responsible for helping countless people get interested in the market and in investing and taking care of their money."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Having been in the market during the dot-com boom, and that experience being my first exposure to trading, I have to say that Jim's explanation of basic market concepts (of which I was largely unaware) have not only opened my eyes, but have given me a method for pulling out my old trades and figuring out where I went wrong. Examples of such information one can glean from this book (or audiobook!) include the formula used to determine multiples, comparison of PE ratios, the importance of news in both sector and industy, and the cyclical nature of the market's ups and downs... and that's not even scratching the sufrace.If you fancy yourself a trader or an investor, whether you speculate with short term options or buy-and-homework transactions (Jim's upgrade of the old 'buy-and-hold' mentality) or think that randomly buying only familiar names of companies you patronize is a 'good strategy', there's something for you in this book. I cannot stress highly enough: this man has a method to his mad-money, and it's largely based on tracking your prospective buys before, during, and after the purchase. His emphasis is on selling more than on buying, and this book actively illustrates in a step-by-step process using everyday analogies exactly what to look for in both winners and losers.Whether you're a Bull or a Bear, or even know what those terms mean, this is a book for anyone who instinctinvely understands that one can use money to make money, even if you can devote only minimal attention to your investments."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing In An Insane World, is the book you should turn to before investing your hard earned money in the stock market.

There are many stock behavior insights in this book that experienced stock investors/speculators can utilize. The material is not systematically organized, so you just have to look for the nuggets. You won't get a thorough detailed approach to use Mr. Cramer's methods. If you read this book with the intention of buying his low priced stock tip service, be careful. The stocks he promotes typically have meager numbers of shares available (small float). They can be dangerously volatile. They can go up initially just because they've been promoted by Mr. Cramer and then tank quickly afterwards. Notwithstanding my negative comments, this book is a lively read that can give some useful ideas you might want to kick around if you have the time to do a little speculating with a modest portion of your investment capital."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"The book is a great read.

OK, so how the heck does your average mortal take advantage of this fact? Maybe you're wondering why anyone would choose to make their own investment choices rather than turn their money over to a mutual fund. Maybe you're wondering what a dividend is, and would like a gentle starter guide. If any of this sounds like something that would interest you, buy this book.The book demystifies the workings of the stock market. It takes you through a series of real life lessons learned the hard way. Jim Cramer has had plenty of success and made plenty of mistakes. This book allows you to learn from both. After reading this book you will have a clear idea of how to start investing in stocks. You will be armed with the same investing guidelines that professionals use to lock in profits and limit losses. You will understand what makes for a good investment, and what homework you will need to do to stay on top of the constantly changing market. In the end you will learn what it takes to be successful in the stock market, and you might even discover that you don't have what it takes. This is fine too, and can be the most money saving lesson out there. In this case the book shows you what to look for in a good mutual fund and how to be a good client. Whether you or someone else runs your money, knowledge is power, and will make you money.The last reason to buy this book is because the education doesn't stop at the book. The author has a daily radio and TV show, as well as a free and pay web site. The education and lessons learned from this book are discussed every day during Jim's Real Money radio show. I've found that the combination of text book and daily classroom has really helped me become a better investor. I'm confidant it will work for you too.

Get the book and read it, then watch his show and do the opposite."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"When I first saw Cramer on television, I was sceptical about the quality of his advice. His screaming act was hard to take and did not appeal to me. But, as he had been a successful hedge fund manager, I figured he knew more than me.I have learned a lot from Jim Cramer, who I now view as a sincere, brilliant man. Cramer's book is excellent. You can't build a fortune on a shaky foundation, and Cramer's advice is foundational. Cramer is an optimal thinker (a mature optimal realist) who is conservative when it comes to money. He checks hope at the door, and tells you that if you don't do your homework you should give your portfolio to a professional. If you want an education in investing basics, buy this book. Check out Optimal Thinking-How to Be Your Best Self as well, so that you make optimal choices, master emotions and do not self-sabotage."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Well, if you want an uplifting read about the Street on a long flight or a cruise, then this book will do an alright job, if you can stand Cramer's ever-present self-praise and egoisms.The book, in all honesty, may even present some very GENERAL investing strategy for an average person. The problem is that the average person will probably not have the patience to go through 400 pages worth of \\"ego dump\\" to extract less than 50 pages worth of practical information onto their laptops.I am sure that Cramer is a successful investor and he is the one that has made quite a bit of money, not me, but this book and any other of his books will not teach you how. Bottom line, Cramer can't teach you his \\"tricks\\" very well.You might be better off by actually paying the $399/year subscription to his site (actionalertplus.com) and mirror his portfolio, rather than spending $20 bucks on ANY of his books.If you want a real book o read, buy Martin Zweig's Winning on Wall Street."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"You see Cramer on TV and wonder if he knows what he's doing. Based on this solid book, Yes! Cramer lays out in simple terms what you need to know and do to become an individual investor with some chance of winning.He is strongest in describing how institutions really work, rather than repeating the academic finance that can be found in a textbook. You'll learn about: trading versus investing, price equals earnings time the multiple, sector rotation, business cycles, interest rates, relatively inefficient markets, IPOs, stock analysts, discipline, taxes, rational decision making, holding cash, prioritizing options, and the portfolio effect.Cramer also makes clear that you need to either be in or out as an investor. If you don't have money which can be lost (non-retirement) and time to make up for losses, you should not invest. Similarly, he recommends one hour per week for each stock holding for general and specific research as a minimum.This book prepares the reader to have a decent chance to make money investing in individual stocks. It emphasizes the discipline needed to cut losses and ride gains. It provides a subjective multi-factor method to the difficult choices of timing, selection and valuation. The tone of the book is direct, but not overbearing like the TV show. This was a good investment of a few hours of time."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I am a professional investor and I truly admire what Jim Cramer does for the average investor. In this book, Cramer says that unless you have time and dedication, you should not be picking stocks and managing your money. But if you are willing to do the work, here is what you need to do:* Listen to conference calls* Read articles* Read annual and quarterly statements and reports and UNDERSTAND themI cannot overemphasize the \\"UNDERSTAND\\" part of reading the reports. If you don't understand a company, don't buy it. Not understanding does not mean that you are not intelligent. Warren Buffett once said that he doesn't understand 90 percent of businesses. Luckily, he understands 10 percent. I don't know anyone questioning Mr. Buffett's intelligence.The second very important point Jim makes is that you need to spend a minimum of one hour per position per week doing research. Jim insists to have at least five positions to be diversified. So if you do not have five hours per week, let someone else manage your money.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in managing their own money.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

The key to getting this book is understanding that Jim is giving you a shotgun approach to investing. He's giving you about 20 different tools to use in different market environments and different trading styles. Many people will employ, at most, half of the strategies depending on their risk tolerance and their time to invest in doing the homework.A lot of what Jim tries to teach in the book is an understanding of market forces, market cycles, how the big guys play in the market, and how the individual must understand all these in order to navigate the market's waters. He also tries to teach you how to do your homework. This is key to his approach. Without your homework you might as well park your money in mutual funds.For me this is a great primer to investing but it's not the only book you should be reading. The classic Peter Lynch books are a good place to start reading further. I would also recommend perusing the many investment sites like [...] (Jim founded and still owns this site), [...] are just a few of the more well known sites.You will likely run across people who say Jim is just trying to make money for his big hedge fund buddies, or Jim knows full well that you can't make any money using his ideas - he just wants to sell more books, or you can't make money like Jim unless you are a day trader.

This is because jim tells you to buy stocks depending on the federal reserve rates and GDP. He analyzes which stocks to own depending on where the federal interest rates are as described on page 115. He tells u to own secular stocks when interest rates are at its peak & own retail,banks etc when interest rates are low as to intice consumer spending. The Cons ARe that Jim explains how to evaluate P/E by his equation EXM=P...However he tries to explain the growth rate and a few other technical analysis with-out providing Elementary abc insights, where he uses his \\"wall-street Gibberish\\" For Instance He says Dont buy stocks with High Earnings Multiples But Jim Leaves this out,=(He explains that to get earnings you would need to divide the outstanding shares divided by the revenue, OK fine. What is ambiquous and missing is that as the price of the stock increases The multiple increases because as the earnings stays the same U are know dividing earnings into a bigger stock price so obviously the multiple will increase. He doe not explain that as new earnings are announced and the company reports larger earnings, that if the stock price is high and U are now dividing a larger earning into a high stock price that the earnings will decrease? Or that if the company reports smaller earnings than the previous quarter with a high stock price that the earnings will still increase due to dividing a high stock price into smaller earnings that would increase the multiple. There are some technical analysis that he could explain in simpler elementary examples. Also he does not explain in great detail the how to derive growth rate.

If you are trying to find the great fund managers who will out perform in the future ask yourself: what am I going to do differently in terms of identifying the future winning fund managers, than did the pension plans and their advisors?

I've always wanted to get my feet wet in the stock market, but never felt confident enough. Now I'm swimming with the big fish! Buy this book."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim Cramer's book is full of usefull and sound advice about investing in stocks. All his rules make common sense and should be easy for anyone to apply in thier own investing. Discipline is the key, and he stresses that. He didn't become a multi-millionaire and get his own show on CNBC by being a dummy. No one can be right all the time, and Cramer is no exception, but he is right much more than he is wrong. And that is all you need to make alot of money on Wall Street. Dont listen to the Cramer haters out there, THEY KNOW NOTHING!!! and will never come close to duplicating Cramer's investing success."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This book is a must for the avid investor or anyone looking to get involved in the stock market. This book keeps you reading because you know Cramer can help you make millions in the stock market. Cramer also keeps you interested by using a creative styling of writing that is not normally seen in the stock market, He grabs your attention with phrases like \\"I want you to be rich\\" and \\"my goal is to make you rich\\". I don't know a person on Earth who wouldn't read this book after hearing that the whole point of Cramer's book is to make you rich. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to make money in the stock market because it is the best available that will teach you how to get rich for the stock market."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Book was jammed packed full of facts, and was an interesting read.

As a professional trader who had read tens of trading books, I enjoyed and learnt from his previous book much more than this. Though the author emphasized his book's (and his own) differences with and superiority over others, I am obliged to say that there are many better alternatives (of very similar writing style, context and by more successful traders/investors) out there. Two great examples are Bernard Baruch's \\"My own story\\" and William Gann's \\"Forty-five years in Wall Street\\". Both of them laid down rules, as well. It's so easy to tell which ones are better.p.s. Sorry to say that I still did not learn from the book how the author did his turnaround trade near the end of 1998 (to win back the 90 millions loss from the first three quarters). He said he had simply returned to the fundamentals under the supervision of his wife in about two months. Dont kid me!

Jim Cramer is a \\"fundamentalist,\\" in that he evaluates stocks according to his view of the internal strengthe of the company and what he thinks is happening in the economy, rather than by technical analysis. So, sometimes, his timing is not precise. The technical charts don't always support his recommendations in the short term. Nevertheless, he wants to help the public learn the basics, and his intentions are entirely benevolent. Unlike a lot of others, he is not trying to sell us something.

I have made significant profits from following Mr. Cramer and his book only lets you know that you cannot listen to one man but that the investing is up to you and your knowledge of the subject matter.

After finishing his biography (which was excellent) I quickly scooped up his book on investing. Ever since the dot com craze I'd lost interest in the stock market, but Cramer's historical record of success piqued my curiosity in the market again.The book dispenses a lot of useful advice. It starts from scratch, and in the beginning the book seemed a little too basic even for an amateur such as myself. However, after a couple of introductory chapters the book dispensed some useful wisdom about how to evaluate stocks and companies and some more useful information about where your money should be placed depending on what phase of the economy we're in.I told my friend, who is a wise man and a studious investor, that I was a big Cramer fanatic and he laughed at me. \\"He's a buffoon.

Kramer is one of the world's biggest idiots. I am, unfortunately, the world's greater idiot for listening to him time and again... not believing exactly that he knew what he was talking about, but for believing that other people would follow his advice, resulting in a stock going up or down. I have lost many thousands of dollars taking his advice. He has far too much power for his limited intellect; and his bulldog rants move stocks for all the wrong reasons. In my humble opinion, Eliott Spitzer should investigate him."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I bought this book for my boyfriend who started watching Jim Cramer's show.

However, Jim Cramer has lost me and others in my family a ton of money. On his show he recommended Cheasepeake Energy, Encana etc. We all bought many of his stocks and years later have lost our shirts. Therefore, I say buy low and sell high and looks at the fundamentals.

He knows how difficult it is to make money from the stock market. And he knows it is much easier to make money from selling dreams to suckers.

This is a good book to learn to manage one's asset on one's own for the novice. Anyone can do it with a commitment to homework and how to do the homework is what this book is about."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Most information in the book is basic in nature for the beginner. I will however point to a couple of things I picked up and thought were useful.One important quote from the book that I think every investor should pay attention to is\\"Fundamentals of a company play only a part in what moves the stock up or down, ie there is little relation between the health of a company and that of the stock\\" . With average holding time of an investor of 12 -18 months this is more true than ever. This is why technical analysis and other factors enter into the equation in a big way.Another concept that I was able to translate into profitable trades is the following. To identify stocks that are game breakers set to explode you need to pay attention to the following: 40% management,30% fundamentals, 15% technicals, 15% special factors.What I found most applicable to short term trading are these special factors. A stock between $1 and $15 with low float and low capitalization .The high demand with low float create sort of a short squeeze ie more demand than there is float supply. This is one version of a short squeeze where investors are buying into a company with low float and there are not enough shares to go around. Plan to get out when the volume starts becoming so high that the stock found a level where everyone wants to get out. This usually happens after splits and secondary offerings.By reading some other books that are more technically oriented I was able to translate this idea into a money making trading approach by focusing on a different type short squeezes.The one where the stock has a high volume of shorted shares but the technicals of the stock are strong. When the shorts try to cover there are just not enough holders willing to sell, the price gets bid up to tempt holders to sell and the stock takes off."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I bought this book for my husband for xmas.

I like Cramer in all of his obnoxiousness. If you are reading the book to gain great insight, you will probably be disappointed. Jim's experiences do not really relate to the everyday investor and his story is hard to gain a lesson from. His writing is quite terse / verbose in places where it should be concise.His map of building a portfolio is clear and well written, but the subject of options at the end will probably lose you if you have not traded options before and will probably leave you flat if you have. The discussion is too general and doesn't discuss the way options work for you even when you don't hit the 'strike' price, which is a critical point.Some of his life stories, intended as examples, are very entertaining and have some message behind them. This is the reason to read the book.It is not a recipe for success, there are just too many details left out. I think the ideas are right but a couple of the explanations leave out definitions of terms just introduced.He promises to close the loop somewhere in the book but it never happens.Buy it to enjoy the story, not to elevate your awareness..."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"...but not of Cramer.Excellent book for beginner to intermediate investors. Cramer is a good story-teller which is helpful in understanding some of the more complex concepts. It is a good idea to examine many different viewpoints on investing because to make truly informed investment decisions, you have to know two things:1. What's in it for the person giving the viewpoint? (ie. what are they trying to sell you - buyer beware)2. Does the viewpoint ring true?On score 1 it is quite clear Cramer would like to sell you stuff (the content he offers through TV, Radio, Internet and Writings), however the good news is he is not a broker or agent and has rules in place to prevent fraud (besides the fact the industry is highly regulated and he is a public figure). That is not to say public figures or regulated industry are immune to fraud! Like Cramers says, you have to do the homework yourself.On score 2, in my opinion his book rings true. He does a good job of grounding himself by his own mistakes and telling you how to learn from them, though unfortunately there is no substitute better than your own mistakes. The stock market is more unpredictable than the weather and Cramer brings to light most of the factors that can impact the market. He also acknowledges the fact that investing is very much like gambling - case in point? - he recommends a handicapping book over any other investing book to help pick stocks!Bottom line is... this book is a great addition to a personal investment book library."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim Cramer's Real Money is the book designed for people who were always interested in investing, but were too scared to risk it. Cramer has a style that makes everyone believe that they can do it. His optimism is infectious, and his rules are easy to follow. This is not a blueprint on what to buy and sell. It is a rulebook on how to spot stocks that should make you money. One important detail: he stresses repeatedly that you must have the time and inclination to do the homework. At least 1 hour per week for every company you own stock in must be spent doing research. No exceptions; no excuses! He also stresses that this must only be discretionary funds, not retirement funds. Cramer tries to stay away from what he calls \\"Wall Street Gibberish\\", and use regular English to get his point across.If you have no interest in investing, don't bother with this book, but even if you've just thought of dabbling in the market, this book will give you a kick start to jump in."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"In Law School, you learn the Law, but you also learn how to Think like a Lawyer. If you want your hand held and told which stock you would Never lose money in..then this book is not for you. But if you want to Learn how to think and analyze like a Pro...then this is the Best Book ever written on this Subject (sorry Benjamin Graham). Reading this book, I was amazed to find so many things Mr. Cramer and the Great Mr. Buffet share in common.. from their thought, anaylsis to their overall personality. Neither one believes in holding more then 15 different companies, both live for Homework and both LOVE a bargain...be it a Stock or shopping at Target or finding a really good price on a Case of Coke (men after my heart). Neither Man waste money or are flashy with their wealth...and I think that is the greatest lesson that these Men (and this Book) can teach our status seeking society. I also suggest that you read this book before you read his first book, Confessions of a Street Addict...because once you have taken Cramer 101, you can truly enjoy Confessions....including the Horror of the $50,000.00 Desk...do you Know HOW much Sears Holding you can buy with that!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I am a 22 year old college student who started investing in the stock market at age 20. I learned from my father that waiting until you are 40 to do anything is a bad idea -- especially investing.From age 15 on I heard about the tech boom and specifically one name: Jim Cramer. My dad talked to me about Cramer every day of my life until I left for school... then we talked about him on the phone. To say the least, I have grown up hearing second hand the ideology that this man (Cramer) possesses when it comes to trading securities.Cramer is more than a money manager -- his energy and style motivate you to see through the bad in any macro situation and steer clear with your plans. His writing style is so uplifting you will find yourself thinking about the stock market 3x what you did before reading his texts. Cramer is a man that has capitalism running through him -- and he is not ashamed to show it.So, to boost the book: using Cramer's tips/ my own stock picks my first year of investing I was able to net ~20% return. I contribute much of this success to learning two key lessons from his teachings:1) Don't be afraid to cut your losers2) You have never taken a loss in the market unless YOU are lost in the market.Specifically on #2 -- Cramer's book takes direct aim and nails common fundamental analysis and ideas any stock investor should have in mind when analyzing potential companies. Even after my business school education it was a great refresher to hear some strategies again.To anyone that has the backbone to withstand losses and then will to stick to a core set of beliefs, get this book now."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"James J. Cramer is the darling of the television investment community. His book, \\"Real Money; Sane Investing in an Insane World,\\" is his \\"how-to\\" guide for investing. In a nutshell, the author is a master of both simplicity and complexity.On a simple level Mr. Cramer offers a prudent \\"buy and do your homework,\\" investment doctrine. On a much more complex basis the author is an irreverent whirling dervish who is smart, knowledgeable, hard-working, funny, humble, cocky and above all...entertaining. Overall, it is important to take this man very seriously. He offers pragmatic advice and sincerely wants to foster a better understanding of how equities are priced.The Harvard educated third generation investor clearly wants to help ordinary people. He warns against a \\"buy and hold,\\" investment mentality. He mocks the strategy and considers it downright foolish. Instead he instructs the reader to do hours of weekly homework. He urges readers to study a firm's debt, measure its growth, monitor interest rates, read the papers and be a dedicated supply and demand fundamentalist. He also advocates a healthy respect for technical considerations.For the most part the author is sensible and his instructive narrative is filled with humility. However, he toots his horn too much about his ability to pick bottoms...and starts oozing an irritating and needless cockiness. NO ONE...is that good. Repeat...NO ONE...is that good. Cramer should know better...Wall Street is littered with the bodies of bottom pickers.Moreover, the author does a disservice to the small investor when he tells them never to enter a market order. Small investors do not have the sophistication to trade a market as he does. Yes, institutional currency traders, arbitrage traders and commodity traders are careful with market orders because of the size orders they muscle the market with. Small investors could very well miss a market opportunity if they obey Cramer. A mature writer would have advised the investment community to find a good broker who can be trusted to give timely and objective feedback.Still and all, this is a very good book filled with investment gems. The author offers extremely valuable insights on the importance of diversification...taking profits...and taking losses. Cramer is an honest man, a respected Wall Street maverick...and does a commendable job of taking ownership of market mistakes. Recommended.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"The most important take-away from this book is how Jim breaks down the Business Cycle into the various phases. It culminates in one simple yet masterful stroke of genius: an entire sector-by-sector cyclical wave is graphed for the readers across 2 full pages. This is known as 'the gameplan' and on a very basic level, lets you know what forces will be acting against your stocks at any given time. Invaluable."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"He was not always the smiling friendly guy that he looks like (and it's possible that in reality he still isn't). He was a screaming, cursing, jerk and lunatic. According to the author, Cramer was only about making money and no person or laws or ethics were more important to him than making money. As he says now at the opening of his Mad Money show, \\"Other people want to make friends; I just want to make money\\". Well, this can be revised. \\"I only want to make friends if they can help me make money\\" is what we actually see in this book as Cramer exploits every tidbit of information (legally gained or not), exploits every relationship he has, burns bridges, and illegally influences the movement of stocks through starting rumors that will benefit his current position in the stock in question. We see that twice he allegedly (the SEC investigated but never charged him) tried to pump up stocks that he owned in columns that he wrote, without disclosing his ownership of said stocks (and this guy is good friends with Elliott Spitzer? amazing). If you believe that he has no agenda on his current show, I think you also believe that a leopard can change its spots. Jim Cramer is all about himself; he fooled people in the 90's and he's fooling them again now. BTW, don't buy his 'everyday guy' image; some basic calculations from info. in the book tells me that Cramer is probably worth about $200 million right now. And you think he cares about helping you? His current show and all the praise you viewers heap upon him is just another big ego boost for someone who clearly does not need a bigger ego."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Much of this book is devoted to Cramer's endless pontificating and war storying about how much of a genius he supposedly was at doing this and that.I found little in the way of actionable, usable advice.Clearly the man is a stock picker and trader. He might be good it (where's the proof?) but he is unable to teach what he does.Rule 23 (his) is not to believe Wall Street hype but he engages in p-l-e-n-t-y."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Here are some of the rules that we are pummeled with again:Cramer's 25 rules:RULES:1.

Buy damaged stocks, not damaged companies.Buy value5. Diversify to control riskDiversify, diversity, diversify - if you don't have a clue what you are investing in.6.

Don't forget bonds.As set allocation and diversify, diversify, diversify.23. Beware of Wall Street hype.Agreed.\\"Wall Street is the only place I know where people drive Rolls Royces and give money to people to invest who take the subway to work.\\" --Warren Buffet.An important piece of advice for me is to just 'cut the loser.' If something has been a dog for a sooooo long, sell it, and move on. How many people just sit and look at a declining chart, and just do nothing? Would you buy it now? If not, then jettison the dog.Jim Cramer is entertaining. In subject matter such as quarterly reports and balance sheets, his energy, enthusiasm, and eccentricity is needed and welcomed. Otherwise, we might fall asleep. We need a good balance of a hype : substance ratio.\\"Confessions of a Street Addict,\\" was enthralling, and Cramer is one of those \\"experts,\\" who has proven himself being a top-end trader and extremely successful hedge fund manager. This said, today is today and his picks for the future in the year 2000 were of companies that have collapsed: they are gone. Don't even exist.However, what I like in his latest book here, is that he bucks (a little) the safe, boring, and potentially lethal strategy of \\"buy and hold\\" (forever). If a broker or trader is good, they don't buy and hold, they buy right, sell right, and sit on growth right.This book is marketed with some \\"RA-RA\\" and toward people who want to learn how to calculate a P/E ratio. He does advocate spending one hour a week studying each company that you hold stock in. However, this book is not for those who want to \\"learn\\" how to invest or pick stocks and mutual funds better. It's interesting for those that are interested in the market, even if occasionally, as well as the people in it, and the stories behind it."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This book is an outstanding example of how to apply logic to a confusing stock market.

With a captivating opening, \\"I want you to be rich,\\" Cramer promotes his business ventures perpetually and brags about his high trading days in this book which reads more like a fisherman handing out fishing techniques in a BBQ party. In the page 146, he notes, \\"because you have bought this book I will give you this URL__. It allows you to participate for free in a service that isolates the potential next 10xers.\\" While I give 2 stars for mild entertainment in his anecdotes, I feel perplexed by finding that the web site the author mentioned above is in fact free trial/subscription base.

We have a fetish for believing in fairy tales that starts almost at birth and continues into old age. Jim Cramer's REAL MONEY is a first of its kind in my costly, informed opinion. A realistic and commonsensical tool to develop an investment strategy, this hands-on approach to stocks and the market will quickly tell you how to avoid being sheared quarterly. To be sure, Cramer's way is 50% research and 50% luck but the \\"luck\\" part is based in knowledge of how brokers and analysts work in a pre-, during-, and after-hours market. This book should be required reading in every high school."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"If you trade in the stock market, you should read this book!It's worth the price fifty times over just for Jim's 25 stock picking rules to live by.I recently inherited a large amount of money that would have been 100% larger if it handn't been handled by Merrill Lynch and Legg Mason from 2000-2002. Thanks to Jim's street.com advice, I've fired the so-called \\"professionals\\" and run the money myself for the past two years. What a difference! I've made back all the money the brokers lost and much, much more.Jim is absolutely right when he says a strategy of \\"buy and hold\\" should be thrown out with last week's trash. No matter what Merrill,Lynch tells you, don't listen. It's suicidal!Jim may have compromised his soul a bit running a hedge fund for billionaires in the 90's, but whatever you did, Jim, you've more than redeemed yourself with REAL MONEY.

First, the substance/hype ratio is better than most investment books. Second, it is realisitic in that it manages to lay out in explicit detail how to analyze stocks, but maintains throughout the need to do ALL of the work on your own. You simply cannot put the strategies in this book into action without being dedicated - it's a terrific litmus test: Don't buy the book unless you are willing to do a significant amount of work on your own. This book simply distills the process.One of the most helpful portions of the book was the discussion throughout concerning how to speculate through a clear lense. That is, to understand WHAT is happening, WHAT to be looking for, and then - only then - WHAT to do. Too many investment books, while replete with this and that strategy, still leave one feeling woefully inadequate and that one is still missing a piece of the puzzle. Cramer's strategies simply frame one's thoughts and leave considerable room for subjectivity. Some will love this - others will not. You really need to be intelligent, or at least intuitive, to begin with if you are to find value in this book."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I was hesitant to buy this book after seeing a bit of Cramer on TV and I should have trusted my instincts. While filled with egotistical statements and boasting, you will be able to use little of this in the real world.I've read and very much like Eric Tyson's Investing for Dummies and his Mind Over Money which helped me identify my bad habits - some of which Cramer's book actually encouraged! I also have liked Siegel and Malkiel's books on investing."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim Cramer of Mad Money (on MSNBC) fame was once a hedge fund manager trading stocks and made his investors tons of money. He's retired from that business nowadays and goes more the route of advising people through his radio show, TV show, and website. In this book, he describes the ins and outs of investing and trading on the stock market and strategies for playing the cycles of the market.One of his rules is that if you are going to invest in individual stocks, you need to spend at least an hour per week keeping up to speed on it. He also recommends diversification by having a minimum of 5 stocks in a variety of businesses sectors such technology, health care, oil, grocery/consumer goods, financial companies such as banks, among others.He makes clear that he does not advise nearly as aggressive a strategy when looking at retirement versus more discretionary income. Mutual funds are definitely the way to go for a vast majority of people who don't have the time or inclination to truly research and investigate the fundamentals and news of a stock. He provides advice on good mutual fund managers if one wants to go more that route.I enjoyed the stories from his days as a hedge fund manager also told in his bookConfessions of a Street Addict. These helped illustrate lots of his points and rules to live by when trading/investing in the stock market.Overall, he does a good job at helping the reader to understand the nuances of the stock market which can be esoteric to those not in the know or who don't do it professionally."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I enjoy his show, but, like his show, this book has a lot of fluff in it. While he give some excellent advice, he takes page after page to get his point across. The first 6 chapters could be consolidated down to one easily. If you're looking for hard advice, not endless rambling, this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This book explains how to invest in stocks very well.... but there is only ONE problem... his rules are based upon a multimillion dollar investment strategy.If you have upwards of 50,000+ of available cash to spend on stocks, then this book will truly make you money. However, the problem with the 'rules' of buying and selling do NOT account for the costs of your commission.His advice recommends to 'take a little off the top' as your stock increases in value. Rememeber though... 'a little off the top' means to sell about 200 shares in Cramerica... for the rest of us, a little off the top may only represent 5-10 shares, which may not be worth it (as your commission cost will offset any gains you make)For the rest of us who only have about $5000-10,000 to spend on stocks, his strategy will never truly make your portfolio profitable.His books are very entertaining, and also have some knowledge behind the words... but the absolute truth is that you need to be able to comfortably afford to buy $70 stocks by the hundreds, and still only have that represent 20% of your protfolio.On a final note... don't expect to make money in the stock market unless you wait it out for nearly a year.I recommend this book ONLY to get you interested in learning more about the stock market... DO NOT use this book as a manual on how to invest unless you have $50,000+ to spend!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This book does a tremendous job explaining how to make money. Great read, good tips, excellent read."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This is really a stellar book. Although it doesn't give you many numbers or outline how to interpret financial statements, the information it does contain is priceless. If you want numbers, I would suggest you read Real Money first and then pick up Penman's Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation. Both books have specific purposes. Penman's is a textbook, but it is very readable and one of the best out there. It will give you the mechanics of reading and interpreting financial statements. Cramer's book is more theoretical, it will teach you how to process that information in the real world and how the mind of a great investor actually works. I highly suggest reading Cramer before you read Penman which may sound strange, but you are much less likely to get bogged down in the information put forth by Penman if you know what skills you're after and why you need to know them. Real Money is exceptional and realistic. Cramer doesn't cut corners when it comes to explaining how he understands and conceptualizes the market. It is a top notch resource worthy of any investment library."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"For a book that is supposed to be informative and educational Jim does a good job covering a spectrum of trading. But while he tells you what to do, he seldom explains how to do it.

Overall I give the book five stars out of a possible five stars.I know many people do not like Cramer's style. And that is fine. But I personally like what he has accomplished to help educate people with regard to the stock market. Through his radio and television shows, he has taught people to be diversified and to do homework. In his latest book, he emphasizes homework repeatedly. If you are unable or unwilling to spend one hour per week per stock, then you do not have sufficient time to stay on top of your investments, and you are better off to turn your money over to a mutual fund. But those that are able and want to devote time to studying their stocks, Cramer provides excellent information.What I appreciated most was reading how imperfect the markets are and how the markets do not behave in a textbook like fashion. I also enjoyed reading his comments about to tell when a stock is bottoming or topping. Moreover, I completely agree with his advice never to short a stock based upon valuation alone. Unlike many, if not all, advisers, Cramer does encourage speculation-to a point. He advises to keep your speculation to less than twenty percent of your portfolio.Given Cramer's enviable record of success as a hedge fund manager, you know that he has earned his stripes and able to write with authority. That alone separates Cramer from many other authors who purport to help you manage your money.Should this one book be sufficient to launch you in your investing career? No, not by a long shot. Instead, I view Cramer's book as helping those with limited investment experience begin to learn how to invest as well as helping those with strong investment experience sharpen their game. For example, Cramer discusses options, both puts and calls. This information will be new and helpful to novice investors but his coverage is very elementary to experienced investors. For those with more investment experience, I believe his stock picking rules and methods for spotting tops and bottoms will be helpful.No one book will ever provide the all the knowledge and wisdom to succeed in the stock markets. Instead, each good investment book will add incrementally to your overall knowledge. And nothing can replace good solid homework coupled with experience.Overall, I give Cramer's book a five star rating because it does provide useful information to both inexperienced and experienced investors alike. It is easy to read and understand. And while Cramer does discuss investments in an interesting and entertaining way, he does stress the importance of homework. I highly recommend Cramer's book."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I started listening to Jim Cramer about a decade ago when I was still living in South-East Austin. There was a 50,000 watt AM station (WOAI) being broadcast out of San Antonio that was somehow able to get coverage all the way to me, some 80 miles away. As I drove around town I would listen intently as Jim would invite me and my leaky 1989 Ford escort to join him in a piece of the action. He was exciting, motivating, and usually right. Cramer was my first real glimpse into the finance world, and ten years later I still listen to him with just as much interest, (no pun intended). I can't help but think that in some small way, the years of enthusiasm Cramer has given me in regards to the market is most likely one of the reasons I will begin work on a Master's degree in Finance this coming year..After many moons of listening to Jim on the radio and then his television show, \\"Mad Money\\" over on MSNBC, I decided to take the time to read one of his books. He's written several, but I chose, \\"Real Money - sane investing in an insane world.\\" I wanted to read this introductory book on the stock market because I had questions; questions so embarrassingly simple that only a conversation between me and Jim's silent text could provide the privacy I needed while overcoming the learning curve. Jim came through for me big time. I was baffled before I had bought the book as to why if you buy a stock from a company, and the company won't buy it back nor pay you dividends, that it is worth anything at all... I was baffled as to what use the P/E ratio was to me, or why do some investors tell you to keep your money in the market even when everything is falling. The answer to those and dozens of other obtuse and seemingly simple questions are cleverly sorted out in Jim's book. Because of that, this is a must read for any novice or intermediate investor.Cramer's Twenty-five Rules for Investing1. Bulls, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered.2. It's OK to pay the taxes.3.

I liked him on TV so much I went back to the beginning to read his first book detailing how he got into Wall Street, of which I have also reviewed and highly recommend. Since reading the book I have started trading options on many of my positions, as Jim says you need to \\"GET IN THE GAME\\". I also learned a lot about \\"cheap\\" stocks. I always wanted to buy Sun Microsystems because it hung out around $4 so I thought it was cheap. However, after reading the book I now understand that the stock's price is essentially meaningless. I now understand P/E ratio is much more important metric to pay attention too. P/E ratio is like the line in sports betting. It lets you see how much investors are willing to pay for each $1 a company earns.While there is some broad theory in Real Money there are some actual steps you can take away, this is not just a story like \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" I'd put it more along the lines of \\"Multiple Streams of Income\\" where the author says do this, and then gives concrete examples. The common theme among all the books listed above is that there is no short cut to riches. Jim hates \\"buy and hold\\" strategy, but loves \\"buy and homework\\" advising you to put at least an hour of work into each stock you pick and try to stay around 5 stocks for an average investor to have a balanced portfolio. He advises you to not hand your money over to a broker unless you have a 1/4 of a million otherwise they are just not setup to manage it effectively. Most brokers get paid based on how much they manage not how much they make their clients. Another tip is to always be looking at growth, if a company isn't growing the market will not respond favorably.Understanding Sector Rotation is brought up on multiple occasions. In fact I liked the chart on Page 114 about sector rotation so much I made a copy and put it next to my desk so I could keep an eye on it every day. I can't state enough how great this book is and wish someone would have given it to me five years ago as this knowledge is very valuable. Plus it was easy to read as Jim comes from a journalism background, making many easy to follow analogies to sports and everyday living. I look forward to his follow up that just came outJim Cramer's Getting Back to Even. No one will ever care as much about your money as you, so pick up this book you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Solid advice that can put you on the right track as a new investor. You have to balance what Cramer recommends in his books and on TV with additional research and your own experience. Over the past year, I've found that you should really take Jim's advice to ignore the short-term gains in the stocks that he recommends on TV (the \\"Cramer\\" Effect). In most cases, you can wait and get a much better entry point."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"First of all, I tend to be bullish on anything that people recommend to me. My dad recommended this and I liked it. I learned a lot. My education has been primarily in sciences, and I didn't know much about anything financial. I read this book a week ago, and I can already tell my understanding has increased when I read articles in the Wall Street Journal. I think he gives brilliant insight into the stock market. Someone is always making money, whether the market is up or down, and Cramer reveals rules on how they do it. I have read other books on personal success, and most are purely motivational. This book is a technical piece on how to actually operate. I heard Cramer say on his show, that this book was a manual he gave to employees at his hedge fund, and I believe it. One thing that really sticks out is his insistence on homework. He does not even propose that managing stocks is an easy way to make money. He states, don't do it unless you can spend at least five hours a week. He also acknowledges, that in order spend this time, one must love it. I love learning about businesses, learning about economics cycles, learning how Fed decisions affect stocks and different sectors. If you have a love for learning, this book gives you avenues to pursue. This is a great introduction."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"As someone who has some investment money in the stock market I have a vested interest in learning everything I can about how to invest and how to make money. Using a variety of sources I have kept myself earning money at a rate better than the S&P; 500 index. Jim Cramer has been a huge influence and is probably one of the main reasons I have been (modestly) beating the market over the last year since I started watching his shows and reading his books.I use plenty of other sources too, Fast Money on CNBC is just as important to me as Cramer's show and I dilligently read everything I can get my hands on when it comes to my money. In the end, Caveat Emptor, I knowingly put my money into the market and I understand the consequences if I screw up.There are no easy answers to investing in the stock market, it's a lot of work. Cramer admits that and he warns people they have to put in the effort to do the homework and make the right moves to maximize your opportunities for making money.For writing a clear and very readable guide to making investments Cramer deserves a lot of respect. Reading this book has allowed me make smart decisions with my money and it has also allowed me to better understand the strange group psychology of \\"The Street\\" and not to get frustrated with its fickleness.If you have money in the stock market and if you make control how that moeny is invested than you must learn as much about stock investing as possible from a bunch of different sources to make educated decisions about your investments. Thus why Cramer's books are a necessary read even if you are a skeptic of Jim Cramer's methods. Be skeptical but don't allow skepticism to get between you and learning."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I enjoyed the book and agree with or considered all he wrote about. What I got out of this book is that I need to educate mayself more about the macro economics of the market. I liked the information in the book about the cycles that play out in the market. The book is upbeat and the stories are interesting, but I don't agree that I should have a portion of my investments in risky, fly by night stocks. I'll take a smaller gain on MSFT or PFE anyday rather than exceed my risk/reward comfort level. But that's me. A good read to add to your many other investment books. It seems like his wife should have co-authored the book since she seems to be the one to keep Mr. Cramer grounded. I was surprised that he did not touch on the power of ETF's for investors.I read one review here from \\"Jim Pumperhater\\" and took his advice and read the article, \\"the winners of the new world\\" by Mr. Cramer. I have to say, Mr. Cramer's ten picks where down right laughable, but those where the overheated times then, and we all learned a lot from the bear market.I watch Mr. Cramer's \\"Mad Money\\" show and enjoy it much, but mainly for entertainment. I mean, if a guy taking a \\"random walk down wall street\\" was hosting the show, how exciting would that be?"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Now, keep your laptop near by if you are the type of stockpicker who never looks at stock details. Various terms will be introduced and you might need to look those terms up as you read. However, Cramer's theory appears understandable. In summary, you must always 1. be diversified, 2. be aware of market conditions (no each company you invest in), 3. be aware of the price and earnings, but more importantly the multiples, 4. watch the fed and stay ahead, 5. keep your eyes open in the consumer market place, and 6. be aware of GDP. Cramer at last allows for speculation. All this can be done with 5 simple stock picks and money can be made. I continue to read more details and hope Mr. Cramer knows what he is talking about. However, logic 101 states: \\"Always know who your sources are.\\" I have watched Mr. Cramer on TV and know he has made much money. Therefore, it is better to bet on him than many other talking heads you encounter. Mr. Cramer, one reader is listening and willing to trust you as my source for picking the winners and well as the long shots."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I think this book was a great read. Excellent for beginners.I might add that when investing short term one needs to realize that the stock market can present us with a lot of hot stocks every day.Most of them may seem promising, but the truth is that a good number of these trading & investing opportunities might not be as profitable as one might think. That's why it's very important to know how to choose them especially if you plan to take advantage of them on a daily or weekly basis.One site that I recommend is MomentumStockTrading com. They have a pretty clear way for trading hot stocks with momentum using easy to understand strategies.

Plus, unlike other books where they say \\"Start with a solid plan\\" and then don't elaborate on that theme, Cramer says \\"Start with a solid plan . . . \\" and gives some very concrete things to do to get started and maintain discipline. Not specific stocks to buy -- that's a moving target always, but more toward how to judge a stock both on its own merits and in the context of the larger market, and how to stay diversified, and how to speculate with discipline."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Ritalin-Jim does his best to objectify his investing style and tells some interesting stories here and there with an overall difficult-to-read writing style, all while trying to maintain appeal to wannabee-rich suburbanites and frat-boys. Basically, Mr. Cramer performs better than he writes. If one were to condense the actual investing strategies and concrete advice provided within, this book would be about 15 pages in length.It is interesting to note that Mr. Cramer goes out of his way to bash other Wall Street pundits for their \\"advice-only-to-line-my-pockets\\" logic while he himself exudes the same logic. Cramer's book is full of plugs for his other investing services (ActionAlertsPlus etc.) which lure you in with a short free trial period, then automatically charge your credit card afterward.What you have here is a true-blue Yankee hustler. BOOOOYAAAAAAAAHHHH. Wanna bet who's making the most money off all this? One guess, not you."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I decided to read this book after watching Jim Cramer on his show \\"Mad Money,\\" which is entertaining, almost like watching a \\"yell and sell\\" infomercial for get-rich schemes or miracle mops.Cramer comes off as one of these squirrelly investment advisers who has an answer for everything, especially if it's an opportunity to brag about his stock-picking genius. The pitfall is that if you follow some of his advice, such as \\"doubling down\\" on a stock that has gotten beaten down in the market (so much that even the company's CEO can't explain it), then you could end up the proud owner of shares in the next WorldCom collapse.This book is oftentimes rambling in its basic explanations of stock valuation, but its message of \\"buy and homework\\" is important--basically, an investor needs to stay active in the market and keep abreast of breaking news to profit. Cramer recommends spending an hour a week of homework for each stock a person owns. That seems like a lot of work, especially when a person could devote the extra time to advancing in a profession or to starting a business, which is how most people become millionaires (according to the book \\"The Millionaire Next Door,\\" anyway).I'm not completely convinced with Cramer's method of investing in cyclical stocks, which involves trading in and out of different sectors during different stages of the Fed's rate easing and tightening cycles. If it's so easy to beat the market this way, why doesn't every hedge fund do it? The returns from such a method should dwindle (if they haven't already) as more people figure out how to time the market this way. Additionally, I've found it difficult to get clear opinions about what the Fed is going to do with rates, because such opinions are as varied as bearish and bullish chatter about the market's direction."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"The how's, why's, and wherefores of how the market REALLY works.

This definitely stresses upon the time and commitments that have to be devoted into staying updated on the stocks that you own. However, aside from reading the headlines and listening to conference call, Jim does not disect company's income statements as I wish he could have. I guess for this task, I will have to find another book. But overall a very insightful book. Another thing I like about reading his book is that I get to listen to him on his radio, to see him in action.

A great book!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This is truly one of the best books on investment. Why? Cramer goes beyond the usual platitudes and implied mysteries of investment gurus to get to the heart of investment strategies. Perhaps one of the strongest aspects of the book is the clarity with which he provides information -- for example, in his 10 commandments of trading and his 25 rules of investing; but instead of a laundry list, Cramer provides a sense of how one should go about creating a strategy, including a very informed and active form of speculation. All in all, this is a useful (indeed, profitable) book whether one is a beginner or a seasoned pro."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim has provided an easy read that covers the basic evaluation of stocks and guidence in setting up a portfolio regardless of networth. Great book for new investors."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim Cramer doesn't know much about modern-day trading or investing although he claims he does. He makes virtually all his money with his TV show and book sales, but doesn't make money in the market. His stories about him being once a hedge-fund manager are questionable. As an example Jim Cramer doesn't recommend leveraged ETFs for trading, but instead attacks these valuable vehicles constantly, even though e.g. the FAS had appreciated by 658% from the March '09 lows to the September '09 tops.Although Cramer has a following of unprofessional hobby traders, rarely anyone can make money with the sum of Jim Cramer's highly questionable stock picks, ... not even he himself makes money with it. So don't get fooled thinking you're getting fresh revelations in his books that haven't been already shared over and over again in tons of other books. The key in the stock market is to make money and not to waste your money and time on foolish concepts that don't work. Learn from the professionals and from folks who put their money where their mouth is and don't listen to guys like Cramer who just have a big mouth trying to sell books and are constantly exalting themselves, and who have been wrong regarding every major market move for years."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This book is a great place to start for a new investor.

I enjoyed the different topics presented in the 10 chapters and found them to be very informational. As with all of Cramer's books he preaches homework which I do not think is something any level of investor should ignore. I also like how he establishes benchmarks for when you have enough to invest and what you need to do until you reach the $10,000 minimum. Chapter 6 is a very good one that has the 10 Commandments for Trading and 25 Investment Rules which are not bad to incorporate into you investment strategies. The chapter on spotting stock bottoms was entertaining and if anyone other than Cramer had written it I would approach it with skepticism."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Very informative easy for a novice to understand takes the fear out of investing and makes you want to get in the game."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Cannot put this book down.

I would recommend this to everyone."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim Cramer is a former Hedge Fund manager that decided to \\"go public\\" with much of what he knows about the stock market. His thesis is that most folks who buy and ignore their IRA's and 401K's would do much better by managing the portfolio themselves. \\"Real Money\\" is the distillation of his investment techniques, with Cramer as cheerleader, clown-prince, and educator.For those that think Cramer is little more than another \\"talking head\\" on cable television, I strongly suggest that you take a closer look at both this book, and his CNBC television show, \\"Mad Money\\". This guy is the real deal. He will tell you what you are doing right, and he will clearly direct you to what is wrong. He cuts through the complexity of finance, and often simplifies difficult concepts into small bites. Simply put, Cramer works for the \\"regular guys (and gals)\\" of this world.If you have ANY interest in managing your portfolio, I strongly suggest that you read this book. Jim Cramer manages to instruct and entertain, while removing much of the complexity of the stock market. Simply put, I've made money employing the DISCIPLINE that Cramer delineates, and I genuinely believe that he has done more for the \\"middle class\\" than any politician in recent memory. If you are fascinated with the stock market, and want to learn more- Jim Cramer is your guy. Regardless of what you know about investing, \\"Real Money\\" will leave you a more educated and disciplined investor."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"The book arrived on time and we are very happy with it... we learned several key points regarding stock buy/sell considerations."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Great book definitely for beginner investors and even amateurs can learn from it.he teaches ways to value companies that may be undervalued, and alsointroduces finding growth stocks and speculative investing.

He also uses good humor throughout the book and refersto how he was down 90 MILLION DOLLARS at one point in his hedge fund. Which goes to showeveryone isn't perfect in investing u can lose money.

Jim Cramer's energetic rants, often stupid jokes and general craziness keep you just interested enough to not get bored. He has incredibly insightful advice about the things you should focus on if you want to become a disciplined \\"buy and homework\\" investor. However, before you buy the book, I recommend you first watch his show on CNBC once or twice or watch video clips of his show on [...]. Some people find him incredibly irritating. I don't, although I do feel the \\"boo-yah\\" thing is played out. So make sure you can handle his personality, because the book is written AND READ by him."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"AN EASY READ, INFORMATIVE, GOOD SOLID INFORMATION AND A FORMULA TO FOLLOW.

It's an updated version of his earlier books. Good, quick read for those who enjoy financial trading, stocks, etc."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim's promise to make you rich if you follow his guidance is enticing. I doubt most of us will have the discipline or the inclination to follow his guidance as ardently as is necessary to see double digit returns for the remainder of our investing future. Even so, this is an excellent book. He is very honest and open about how much work is involved. Even if you don't dedicate yourself to the rigorous homework, there are a lot of gems in the text. Like, never use a market order with a broker. That more than paid for the book on the next order I placed. I was ready to hear that message and corresponding explanation because I had been wondering why my orders often were filled at prices slightly higher(or lower in the case of shorts) than the market was trading at the moment I placed the order. Jim shares the lessons he has learned and provides insight that I doubt I would have gotten any other way. Being an occasional viewer of his television show, I think the show borders on contradicting some of the advice he gives in the book. It would be interesting to hear him reconcile the two. Perhaps he is relying on the rather long disclaimer that is read every show. The bottom line for me is, reading this book has improved my knowledge and understanding of the equities game and it has already improved my results."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Real Money is a great title for this book. Here Cramer tells in a very readable, enjoyable way how he trained people to work at his hedge fund. I had read a few \\"beginner books\\" that mostly explained in general terms how the market operates and how to invest in that usual ultra-conservative way barely better than the bond market. But Real Money shows with some rigor how to go about finding and researching winners.I had actually bought and read his newer book, Mad Money, before purchasing this one. It was such a great book that I had to read Real Money, and I'm so glad I did. Although Cramer does update a few of his methods a bit in Mad Money, they are still built on the basics of Real Money. It might be better to read them in order, but I didn't lose anything by reading them in reverse.Cramer's methods are very logical and they work. My husband and I really studied both books, and now we never miss his nightly show \\"Mad Money\\" on CNBC. Since we began this, we have made at least three times as much money as we did using the Morningstar type of stock-picking. More important, we have not had any big losses because of Cramer's \\"buy and homework\\" rule, which requires spending one hour per week for each stock held.Cramer's anecdotes are downright funny, and his analogies help to simplify more complex subjects such as shorting and trading options. He is not a purely growth invester nor just a trader. He applies both growth and value investing methods and differentiates between an investment and a trade. There is nothing reckless about Cramer's system.Real Money is a fantastic book. If I had to pick one thing in it that has had the greatest value for us, it would be how to research sectors and stocks in a logical, systematic way both before and after picking a stock. In short, (or long), I heartily recommend Real Money. Or in other words, BOOYAH!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"First, Jim honestly wants to help the average person realize their financial goals. He does give some good pointers as to how to better understand the stock market and how to be a better investor. I have several concepts, passages and pages highlighted for future reference.However, the problem with the book is two-fold. First, Jim wants to make us experts like him. He says, \\"this book is a distillation of everything I have learned.\\" I find it hard to believe that Jim can make us such savvy investors in this 286 page book. Secondly, Jim's writing style is annoying and frustrating. He writes like he talks, which makes for wordy sentences. Also he repeats himself, constantly. As a result, the book was not enjoyable to me. I had to fight to finish it.In all, you can get the same information elsewhere, probably with less frustration."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Unlike Cramer's Mad Money TV show, Cramer's Real Money is a little slow to get started. However,like many other books, you have to slog through the \\"where-I've-been-and-how-I-got-to-where-I-am-today\\" portion to more appreciate what he has to say when he gets to the meat of the book. Cramer offers an interesting perspective from the \\"inside\\", possibly revealing more than some Wallstreeters would prefer, and demonstrates he is not just another financial \\"talking head\\". His book is definately a \\"must read\\" for anyone in the market today."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I've read a lot of books on investing and trading. As a day trader myself, I've taken tips and knowledge, a bit by bit, from each book. Eventually, I've created my own system and put it through trial-and-error before becoming perfect. Then, I had to create my own set of disciplines and rules and forced myself to adhere to them at all cost. In a result, I've become a very successful day trader, consistently making profits. I must admit, I am very new to Jim Cramer (exactly the reason I just picked up his book now) because I regarded, and still do, him as another guy on TV. I know that he is a very intelligent guy, but it's very hard for me to listen to him on TV. A lot of things he says is already commonsense to me, so usually, I don't watch his show at all. When I did, three things immediately come to my mind. One, he is a professional pumper-and-dumper. That's inherently obvious to me regardless of his best intentions. Two, he caters to an uneducated, uninformed audience. While I know some of his picks are well made (however, I already knew about them because I am already trading them on a daily basis. In fact, I know for sure, by his picks, he reads Investor's Business Daily quite often.), there is so many of them that I would steer clear away from due to obviousness from fundamental and/or technical analysis perspectives. Worst of all, even the picked stocks that are current winners are being recommended by Cramer yet the timing, to me, is another story. Thus, many investors and traders who watch his shows will get burned by this fact alone. There will be times he actually made money for them. That's fine and dandy, but the key issue here is: is it really consistent? Ultimately, that's what I strive for as a day trader. Three, when Cramer talks, I am always tuned out when he immediately gets into babble mode. Yes, I am well versed in the lingo of trading, but many people on CNBC are extremely dry, boring, and gibberishly nonsensical. Sadly, Jim Cramer falls into this category. My system works very well because I made it simple as possible, and I never overanalyze a stock or a trade. Pretty often, as I am a day trader, things are actually black and white to me: stocks rise and fall just because they can. All I can do is be in the moment of it. Why I am prepared is because I've done all my homework leading to the moment of making an execution of a trade. When I read Jim Cramer's Real Money, I just couldn't believe how overly technical Jim was. That was an amazing book if it was intended to be for the novice investors. There is no possible way for them to buy into his system because I have to say 95% of the information contained is really all air. Very, very little substance is involved. I actually did learn a couple things out of the book, but it doesn't mean I am going to change the way I trade because it looks better from his way. I'll just test his theory for a bit and see if it is useful or not before I make it part of my system. Everybody must have a system and a philosophy when it comes to trading and/or investing. Although I do believe in many principles outlined in the book, I have to admit that they are very basic to me and already ingrained in me a long ago. But to the novice just getting feet wet starting off with Jim Cramer's Real Money,: my opinion is: bad, bad, bad, bad idea. You won't make money. In fact, you will lose huge. There is just too much to learn, and the learning curve is usually two to three years. You must invariably watch the stocks and the market constantly every day for weeks, months, and years in order to truly understand what's it's all about. No book will teach anyone the way the market will. The market will always be the ultimate teacher. As I've read many books written by traders and investors, if there is one topic that is often overused and abused, it is war stories. Please, please...they mean absolutely nothing to me and has no relevance to my education of stocks. Jim Cramer falls victim to this overdone category, and he endlessly exercises it in his book. That's why I really, really had a hard time reading through much of the book. I mainly skimmed until I found essentials. All in all, anyone wish to get into stock market for the first time, reading Jim Cramer's Real Money is a disaster. It just simply is not going work. Everybody else, the already seasoned traders, will easily dismiss his book because there is nothing new in it. If you really want to get started in learning about money and investing, my best advice is to start with The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Money and Investing. It is a brilliant yet so easy and effective book in understanding it. I just can't believe the simplicity of that book. Second book, after that one, will always be How to Make Money in Stocks by William O'Neil. After that one, get a free trial of ten newspapers of Investor's Business Daily. It's just a brilliant paper that will go out of its way to teach you how to invest wisely. You won't ever find a simple yet effective paper as this one. Third book, I like is The Stock Market Course by George A. Fontanills and Tom Gentile. Of course, always read as many books afterwards. In the long run, decide what you really believe in and what makes sense to you, thus making a very bad idea for any newbie to take on Jim's investing style from the outset without exploring different types of styles that suit him. Once you've developed this kind of a personality, you are already on your way to becoming an educated trader/investor. But make sure that Jim Cramer's Real Money is just a stepping stone, no more nor less, of many but not be all and end all."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Cramer starts out, well ... very un-Cramer-like. It's not usual to see/read him so reserved and...actually enjoyable. If the book would have ended at about the middle, I would have given it 4 or 4.5 stars. He focuses on good fundamental analysis, and he does an excellent job putting everything in understandable terms that anyone can follow - even the first time investor. Not everything he says is correct (the continual reference to Maytag/Whirlpool is a black eye considering what's happened over the past year) - but again, because he did an excellent job writing and presenting the material, it really doesn't matter. He does a good job explaining the concepts.However, the second half of the book is an entirely different story. Back to the old Cramer we all know. Shoots from the hip, he's always right, never really made a mistake in his investing life. The mistakes he's made - well, either he knew in advance they were mistakes, he has someone else to blame, etc., etc.He tells you that he can see/call a top - it's so obvious, you just have to learn how to see it...as he does, so easily. As you continue reading, he makes so many references to his wife, you have to wonder, who exactly the book is about and has the expert knowledge?To summarize - first half of the book is a winner; second half of the book - a bunch of egregious grandstanding that you can pick up in any book that a \\"guru\\" is touting."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This is one of the best trading books out there (and I have gone through most of the books on trading and investing).

While the book is a good general primer for playing the market, I wouldn't have purchased it if I knew how old it was. It seems to me that the market changed so radically in 2008 that anything written earlier is an anachronism. Regardless, Amazon needs to correct the copyright date so the customer can decide."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"His first book \\"Confessions of a Street Addict\\" was thoughtful and interesting. This book reads almost like one of his TV shows. He \\"co-wrote\\" this one and it feels like he just sat down with his assistants and let it rip in his usual stream of consciousness style for a couple hours. The book seems hardly edited from that. Meaningless digressions , backtracking, repetition -- all left in here.If you're a fan of the show, you've heard ALL of this on the show (repeatedly). If you're not, you won't get anything from this book. I was hoping for a more coherent and deep window onto how Jim Cramer views the current markets. Not what I got."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I am a complete newbie when it comes to the stock market and Jim Cramer's book is filled with excellent information that not only makes sense but is written in way that rivals a good novel. It's not the snooze fest that other money management books are so typical of. This is a must read for any one just getting into the game or a refresher that one must read if they've been beaten up in the market in the past."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Having read several investment books, this book is a much needed shot in the arm in that it opens the doors to the type of independent thinking that the mutual fund industry doesn't want individual investors to engage in. Cramer's book encourages readers to move beyond what may be an effective but somewhat restrictive investment philosophy, and utilize several strategic approaches to building wealth in stocks. I never could have guessed that Cramer could do so much to help me see investing in a different light and ultimately help me understand investing much better."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Really, I figured what could it hurt to read & listen. Tried all his ideas, watched his picks on TV etc. Set up HIS ideal portfolios on my trading page where I trade stocks. After 2 years what are the results? Cramer's picks as well as Vectorvest picks got CREAMED compared to MY own idiotic attempts at making money long term as well as short term.So, do what you like, but if ever in San Diego & you want this book? You can have mine for FREE. Do however pay attention to his common sense \\"get out of debt\\" strategy."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"When I first checked this book out, I found it too boring and abstract to hold my interest...mainly because of the chapters about how the market works and how hedge fund managers trade. But then I revisited the book and spent some time with these chapters and realized the value of the information and also realized I had learned alot since I first approached the book which made it more interesting to me the second time around. Now Cramer insists he is a bottoms-up investor/trader, but this book has alot of top-down strategy in it. As far as the stock rules, well yeah they are common sense, but forcing yourself to follow them is a a whole 'nother story. Common sense can deviate when put into actual practice, otherwise we'd all be thin and beautiful, right? His strategy is like a diet, it requires willpower to be successful. This book may be beyond the beginner and unhelpful for advanced investors, but it is great if you know a little more than the average person walking down the street. Like Suze Ormond states, alot of people spend time in denial or hiding from their money situations."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Most high profile investment \\"personalities\\" make me suspicious, so I watched Cramer's TV show for about three months before reading this book. Turns out he was right most of the time, both with his stock picks and his market insights. I found \\"Real Money\\" enormously helpful because it is enormously sensible. No magic formulas, no shortcuts, no tricks - just common sense, hard work, and discipline. Cramer explains the fundamentals of stocks and markets using simple analogies, which is helpful for people like me who do not have much experience or schooling in finance. In the final chapter, he even provides a crystal clear explanation of the highly complex world of call and put options.This book is full of valuable ideas, which other reviewers have summarized very well. Here are a few of the points I found especially important.1. Reading \\"Real Money\\" will make you a better investor OR a better client. Not everybody is ready, willing, and able to be an investor. But even if you turn your money over to professionals, you need to know the fundamentals or you could get hurt. A key general principle of investing!2. Own retail companies before they saturate the market. Here's an example of a great tactical insight. Cramer notes that once retailers are in every market, they have a hard time sustaining growth. If you can catch one on the way up, however, it can be gold. Simple! Obvious! Never occurred to me!3. When you buy is as important as what you buy. I never realized how important timing is. Cramer does a great job of explaining how business cycles work and what stocks are good buys or sells at a given point on the curve.4. When you sell is as important as when you buy. I never realized how much science there was to timing a sell. But come to think of it, super gains can be wiped out in a flash if you stay in too long. That's why Cramer advocates \\"buy and homework\\" instead of \\"buy and hold\\".Here are some things the book is not. \\"Real Money\\" is not a get rich quick scheme, nor does it claim to be. In fact, Cramer offers so many suggestions for further reading, I can't imagine how his guideline of one hour of research per week per stock could possibly be enough. The book is not entertainment - don't be fooled by Cramer's manic TV persona. The writing is straightforward and energetic, but not wild and crazy. And the book is not a total investing solution. Cramer is a very conservative investor who endlessly warns us NOT to apply his rules of investing to our retirement funds. This book is for discretionary investing.The book is a great starting point. Cramer provides a framework for investing that will help you zero in on types of stock to look at, how to research them, how to buy them, and how to sell them. Now that I've read it, I can't believe I was rash enough to invest without it."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This is a college course in investing with Jim Cramer. Take it to the bank . Buy and Do Homework!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I am just starting to dabble in the stock market so I'm trying to learn as much as I can right now.This book is very easy to understand and a very fast read. Being a really big fan of Cramer already this was a 'no-brainer', and although he is very educated he really translates his thoughts and advice in an easy to understand way.I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in the stock market."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Enjoyed the book. He may be annoying on TV; however, he gives great advice and has helped us earn money. Have since bought another one of his books."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Excellent book for both fan and non-fans of the show. Not only offers sound stock investing advice, but does so intelligently and entertainingly."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I have heard a lot of people that I know put Jim down after watching his TV show Mad Money. They never have good arguments about why they put down the show and in the end their complaints always boil down to \\"I just don't like the guy because he seams like a sleazy car salesman.\\" In short they don't like Jim Cramer because he doesn't \\"seem\\" like your average financial geek. But you know what? They never really listen to him about the stock and the company that he is talking about. They generally never try to gauge stocks on their own with their own money. If they did, and they actually listen to what the hell he was saying then they, like I, would love Jim Cramer and what he does for me, \\"the \\"little Guy\\".In short, this book will tell you all the things that Jim also tells you on his show Mad Money. Just watching his show I garnered about 10 pages of absolute gold advice. And that's just the basic ideas, not the specific items about certain stocks.Jim's book though is in paragraph format almost completely. It would be a great book for an audio session. That's actually what I am doing with mine now, reading in a microphone for my mp3 player. I mean his advice is just too good to pass up and it needs to be studied not just read. Why? Because Jim will tell you things that are fundamentally different from most anything else that you will read or hear on the radio or tv. It's all common sense really, or so you think after hearing it, but its actually a kind of sense that is not common at all. If it was, then Jim wouldn't be so popular. The kind of common sense that he gives you in this book is the kind of sense that must be developed, not read. You know that he really did make the kinds of mistakes that he tells you about because there is no other way that one goes against conventional financial dogma as he does so confidently.The sector watching that he tells you about. Common sense right? But how often do you practice it? Do you really even know what to look for in the sectors that you watch or the sectors that you have stocks in? I didn't. Mostly I got tunnel vision with stocks and once I owned one I hardly ever looked at the macro side of things. I got tunnel stock vision.Most of all what I like about this book and Jim's TV show and the internet video clips that he does on the [...] is that he tells it like it is. When all the other financial sell outs only tell you what they want you to hear, Jim Cramer is there telling it like it is. The Truth! Or at least enough of it so that you can figure out for yourself what's going on if you did your homework on the company. Jim Cramer is not only helpful for trading, he is vital. I hope he never stops helping me, \\"The Little Guy\\".Thanks again Jim.With so many so called Wall Street professionals lying through their teeth to all their clients and the media, I am glad that you are there to try and help us with what you can. I for one appreciate it."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This is a great book if you're a beginner in the world of stocks or if you just want to know the works behind the man himself - Jim Cramer. This book covers many of his stories while he was working at his hedge fund, both good and bad. Not only do you get the stories but he delivers the best beginner tips to set you off on the right direction. Essentially you can learn from his mistakes. The book is also written in a level that a 5th grader could understand. I gave it 4 stars because I felt some parts of the book were slightly drawn out or it didn't give enough information. I feel many of his ideas still stand true today. This is a great book to help change the way you play the game of stocks whether you're investing or trading. The bottom line: you definitely can learn so much from this man by taking the time to read and understand what he's trying to teach you. Understanding the concepts is the key."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I have listened to both this books and yes I am a follower of his show. I've been an active investor for 25+ years and in college I majored in corporate finance/fundamental corporate analysis. I find this book extremely useful in driving home the type of analysis and research we should all do in picking which stocks to invest in.At times he goes a little too quickly in his explanations but the joy of having it on CD is that you can listen to in over and over during your mindnumbing commute.I do not agree with his recommendation that you should invest in only 5-10 stocks whic his far too few but htat being disregarded this book is a must for all investors. I guarentee that you will reduce the chances of losing money if you follow his suggestions.Oh............if you find him too iritating on TV don't worry he has toned it down on the CD."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This book gives you a down to earth look on investing your money. Simple rules and principles give you food for thought and make you think your own way of investing. Jim Cramer has strong opinions and easy to understand view on how to make the best of the continually changing markets. This is a great book. It's easy to read and gives you ideas how to manage your own stocks. It encourages you to take active role on investing and stock buying and holding. This is good advice for all who own stocks, whether it is for trading or for the long run. It makes you think the markets as a whole too and how to react to different situations, which investors regularly face if they stay on the business for years. The ideas give you good look on the market especially now that the stocks are turning more volatile."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I've read all of Jimmy's books, all great, but this one seems to be his best all-in-one market \\"how-to\\". His writing is as engaging as it is informative and out of the multitude of stock market how-to's out there, (and believe me, I've read a ton and most won't get you anywhere but confused) Jimmy, William O'Neill and Ken Fisher give you the best advice I've found on bound paper, hardcover or paperback.Still, if you're not willing to do the sometimes hair-pulling, nerve-wracking work involved in managing a portfolio of stocks yourself, (the best asset class available to you as an investor) going at it half-heartedly, you're likely to end up writing a one-star review on your laptop whilst sitting on your dirty linoleum floor like a sad clown sipping bad scotch after you've read it and plowed a bunch of your IRA money into a Mad Money tip that dropped ten points the following week, just like some of the other one-star reviewers here.\\"Real Money\\" will help you decide if you want a crack at owning stocks as an individual and may very well give you a bunch of insight if you already do. Though this book wasn't the one that got me into stocks, it is the one that got me to do it with more passion."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim's insite into stock investing is very broadfield. He gets right to the point in getting you to educate yourself so that you can do a better job in evaluating your actions."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"My husband and I proudly wore our Cramer t-shirts this weekend while on vacation. We both love this man and loved the book. Cramer gives very specific ideas on how to make the market more understandable and workable for any investor, but especially for newbies like us. I am a business school graduate and never learned any of what Cramer shares in this great book. I also loved his more recent book (Jim Cramer's Mad Money: Watch TV, Get Rich), too. What a guy! What a country!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This audio book will teach you the basics everyone should know about investing. 5 Stars"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim Cramer targets a pretty common audience in this book, those who are somewhat wealthy and are looking to do something with their extra money. He does a decent job at explaining the anatomy of a stock and how trades are executed. If you don't have a finance background, you can still understand the language with a little effort. I really like his idea of picking 5 stocks for a portfolio and diversifying it in different types of industries. This seems like a promising idea that eliminates some risk and provides additional returns. Also, kudos to him for discouraging the traditional buy-and-hold strategy w/ stocks.Some criticisms though: there are many styles of investing and many financial instruments for many income classes. If I had 500,000 for example and I just sold my house, I would put non of it in a portfolio, but rather go to the fixed income market. If I was a kid out of college with some extra cash to play with, I would rather go all out, shorting and making speculative trades with higher potential returns. Would be nice to see him discuss these.Conclusion: The book is great, but start a practice portfolio first and test your strategies. Afterwards, open a real portfolio and start small to build your discipline and strengthen your strategy."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World is an easy read and very practical in nature. I've been using his methods for a short time now and have posted some impressive gains. 9% in a little over 2 months. Throughout the book Cramer takes on Wall Street's conventional investing wisdom and explains why it is misunderstood or just wrong. His active management style as well as his backing of small speculative stocks may raise the ire of mainstream pundits but taken in context the thought process behind each is safe and sound. Well done Jim!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I think it is worth the investment of buying. You are not going to get rich just reading the book unless you apply what Cramer is saying. If you are out to make quick money then find a different book. For 20 dollars, I say get it."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim does it again! Love this book, Basic guide to buying and selling stocks. Much Wisdom, absorb it like a sponge and then go play..."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"If you are new to investing...this is a great read. Some of his principles are reverberated throughout other similar books. Cramer suggests buying stocks using \\"limit\\" orders, but for every day investors buying a couple hundred shares, it might not make a big difference. Limit orders should be made on stocks that have low trade volume or on penny stocks that can swing wildly.I recommend The Intelligent Investor."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Read a bunch of investment books, most are scraching the surface, you really need something *Actionable*, Cramer's book is the perfect choice for you to get to the ROCK BOTTOM.A hint: try out the Action alert plus and stocks under $10 at thestreet.com (I believe they offer two week free trial), I am really amazed at realtime actionable ideas almost everyday, and the best thing is you can make some money using Cramer's alerts while learning the rules teached by Cramer.Another hint: you may try to use stop loss for Action alert plus and stocks under $10 , I use a 15% stop loss, so in a long term, I always get a much lower cost basis than Cramer. If you are stopped out, you will always get another chance to get in later using Cramer's alert if the stock rise above to the level you are stopped out. However, you may always keep a core position for each stock, as I have did for KMART, URBAN AND UNH.Third hint: You must have disipline as always emphasized by Cramer. Do not be afraid stock is too expensive (they worth it, trust Cramer), actually Cramer seems doing best for higher price stocks.Cramer, it is really a joy to read, listen and watch everything you tought, thanks for the genourosity.Hope everyone make some money along with Cramer!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This book isn't a complete waste. That's why I gave it two instead of one stars. If you have 20-30 hours a week to learn and try his methods, you will learn some stuff from this book. But you need to take it on as a job, not a side line. It is NOT for the \\"average guy\\" like he tries to pretend.What I really don't like about it is it (and his TV show, Mad Money) pretends to be for the \\"average guy\\" and if the \\"average guy\\" tries to do what he says, most of them, unless they are lucky like playing the lottery, will be screwed. What he says to do would take a full time job to do and someone who can call up the companies CEO's, get into board rooms, etc. Far from \\"average guy\\" stuff.Do NOT believe what he says about \\"buy and hold\\" being bad investment advice. Buy and hold is the way to go for the \\"average guy\\" and will beat the returns of most people trying this day trader type stuff. He buys stocks and sells them days later. If you don't keep up on it DAILY you will be screwed.Beware.Also, why he has a TV cult following is beyond me. If you love his TV show you are drinking too much coffee!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I have to admit, I get a charge out of Cramer on his CNBC show. He is very dynamic, entertaining and informative. He usually get's it right and is right far more than he is wrong despite his critics.This book is must reading for anyone who invests. I bought it earlier this week and couldn't put it down. I won't restate his principles other than the most important ones like \\"Buy best of breed\\" and \\"Buy broken down stocks, not broken down companies.\\" And \\"Pay the taxes\\" and \\"Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered.\\"Finally I agree with Cramer that Google is a $560 stock. The numbers are all there. While I have to admit that I have a itchy finger and want to put in a sell order, I have been holding and adding and glad that I did.I passed on Yahoo, Amazon and Ebay as per Cramer and glad that I did."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Cramer's book provides a lot of important fundamentals and is a good book to remind the experienced investor of how much he has forgotten and ... doesn't use. The key point to take away is to do your homework, set goals and reasons for your investment decisions and review weekly. If it isn't there, cut your losses now. Good advice."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I purchased and read this book thinking it would be similar to his last book, Confessions of a street addict. This book contained the same information in a Finance 101 text book (albeit much, much cheaper). Going in depth talking about how to calculate P/E ratios was just not what I was looking for. If you are looking for a basic (very, very basic) overview of technical and fundemental analysis, by all means. I was hoping for more advanced substance, hoping Cramer would share a little more insight, insight that I am not really sure exists in him anymore.The worst part is that he goes on and on about a how he is going to tell you all about a topic later on in the book, but then the book ends and you are still looking for that info from chapter 1.People reguard Cramer as a \\"market guru\\" for all the wrong reasons.

In general, this book contains some excellent information about disciplined investing that would make the market much more profitable for the individual investor if they only followed them.I bought and read this book when I was a slimy maggot newbie in investing. I'd opened up my first discount broker account and was looking over charts and stocks. Cramer set me straight. I'm not a disciple, but I'm a convert, and I'm careful. Cramer's admonition to research stocks for fiscal soundness is one that every small investor needs to hear twice a week. If this book had come out 6 years ago, the internet tech bubble may never have happened because people wouldn't have rushed to bid insolvent companies up to the stratosphere in a desperate attempt to \\"get in on it.\\"There is one additional reason to buy the book (besides the 25 rules): the sector rotation chart on page 115 of my copy.

Practical, useful FACTS that will keep the average guy outta trouble and, just maybe, make some money despite the big players."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This book is an excellent primer on investing fundamentals. If you enjoy watching Mad Money and the advice that Cramer gives on his show then you will like this book. A lot of the fundamentals are very basic, but if you've never been exposed to the stock market then it all can look very intimidating. Cramer helps take some of that intimidation away and shows you how simple many of the underlying concepts of the market really are. He also shows you how to approach certain situations when the fundamentals just don't seem to be working, which happens a lot more often in today's market. I highly recommend this book since it is a great perspective on how to take control of your own portfolio."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Five reasons why you should buy this book and read it and why it gets five stars.1. Jim Cramer ran a successful hedge fund and made tens of millions of dollars for himself (somewhere between 50 to 200 million dollars).2. It has a great deal of information on valuation and how to find growth stocks.3. He is not a traditional Buy and Hold investor, but buy and homework, with the good rule of \\"don't fear the tax man!\\"4. The information is solid, if not a little basic, definitely for the beginning investor.5. The market is hectic and crazy and can be intimidating, and his book goes a long way to helping explain it, and make it a lot more accessible.Now then, now that I've given my reasons why I like the book, I'd like to explain why I personally felt that he comes a bit short on a few things. Jim Cramer is a fundamentalist, and that's fine, but he insults technical analysis, even though his wife, who was supposedly an incredibly trader, was a techie. Technical analysis works for some people just like Fundamentals work for others. The difference is, and I will admit, that as an investor, you want to be heavy on the fundamentals, but, he gives a lot of information for traders, and his information for someone who wants to go into the market for speculation, would not find much help in this book, or its speculation section. His talks on options are wrong. You sell to close the contracts,, you don't exercise the contract unless you have the money, also, the cost of doing that, exercising and then selling the stock, barely makes it worth it. There are plenty of people who will buy the contract for nearly the same gain that you could make exercising the option. In fact, that's how most option traders make their money on long calls and long puts.His other trading advice is kind of preliminary and basic and there are much better books out there on trading.However , for an investment handbook, this book is strong and well worth the money."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Even Jim in his early days struggled with problems of \\"cost basis paralysis\\" that many individual investors deal with. This is until his wife took his stock sheets and whited out his cost basis which allowed him to think clearer about the merits of keeping a stock, namely Maytag that he owned. In another anecdote he described how he decided to invest in AT&T; wireless. He asked his daughter \\"how come you never get frustrated with a busy signal when voting for American Idol\\" her reply was that she texted her vote but that an AT&T; wireless device is needed to do that.There are tips on top fund managers and funds in different categories. Also a chapter on how to spot a market bottom which I found easy to follow but insightful. It included simple criteria as finding a bear market article in the front page of the New York times, Bullish vs bearish investment advisors survey (in this case you need at least 60% bearish). The logic here is that if most are bullish then most money is already invested in and little money is available for new investment. Volatility index above 40, and a selling climax defined by at least two months of fund outflows. A similar chapter in tops in individual stocks was quite useful with the one warning I found most interesting is tendency of hyped stocks to almost always end up making a secondary offering below the latest traded price signaling the end of the run. Many other tips in this chapter such as accounting problems, over expansion using acquisitions, etc are included. All in all as other reviewers say not the endgame but a good start."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Good book for begginer or advanced investors. excellent tips to keep a level head in this shakey market."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Not a bad book as an investment primer, but the most important piece of the book, a graph of Cramer's cyclical strategy for stocks is COMPLETELY ILLEGIBLE on the Kindle."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I loved the book! I hated the book! And I have recommended it to many and continue to do so, but with caveats and frustrations.First, if you haven't watched Cramer's \`Mad Money' program at least once on CNBC, you need to do so. One show will give you more insight into Cramer's emotional make up and give you more of what to expect from his writings than any review! He is, at once, informative, opinionated, contradictory and entertaining. Well, my wife would disagree about the latter!Second, like him or not, he is one of those rare investment book writers whose track record is quite public. And he has practiced what he preaches to make (and lose and make again) millions in the market, mostly using other peoples money! To ignore someone with his success is not smart, but to take anyone's investment opinion as the \`only truth' is equally risky.So, let's get to why I stated that I loved this book. Because I do strongly recommend this book to people relatively new to managing their own investments. I especially appreciate his \`buy and homework' mentality since many people try to manage their investments without accepting that there is indeed work to be done. He does a good job of explaining why fundamentals are important and how to utilize basic measurements. He does a very good job in explaining market cycles, especially the major ones that cause \`big money' (pension funds, mutuals, etc.) to move in and out of various sectors. In general, this is an excellent first read for people new to investing and a reminder of some basics for the rest of us.Okay, so why did I sometimes feel that I hated the book. Well, first let's acknowledge that there is no perfect investing book or system. There are too many variables, especially those that include each investor's personal status - time available to do the work, time horizon before retiring, money available, etc. Every writer brings their own background and bias into their writings and, in turn, tends to become dismissive of other thoughts. But if you read many differing investment books by successful traders, you will find that the methods that they use differ and are at odds with each other. While I generally like Cramer's honesty, I find that sometimes he dismisses some investing methods out of hand which, since this books and programs are targeted to the average investor, serves to bias people based on his own personal biases. Some examples:a) Jim is a \`fundamental' investor - he relies on more traditional analysis of a companies balance sheet and earnings to determine whether to invest in a stock. That is fine, but he goes on to essentially dismiss people who trade predominantly on technical analysis, with a portion of his book essentially saying \\"nobody has ever made any money trading that way.\\" This is simply not true. Technical trading is simply a different type and method of trading and, indeed, many people have made significant money trading based upon technicals and combined fundamental + technical strategies. While Jim may not use technicals, his wife does, and quite successfully according to him. So dismissing anyone using or promoting technical analysis in the book does not serve the reader. It simply supports his bias.b) While not in the book, you will find if you read more from him or watch his program that he dismisses alternative investments like options. Again, it is not that the average investor should jump into options without having clear knowledge and understanding of the risks, but to simply dismiss other investment area is to do a disservice to investors who wish to advance and learn more about various markets. (Options, for example, are as risky as stocks - no more so. Their risks, however are different and the knowledge needed is greater than for straight stocks, but given the investor's willingness to learn and understand options BEFORE beginning to trade them, options can actually REDUCE the risks of stock investing.)Cramer strongly advises against simply following any advisors opinion to guide stock investments, yet sometimes his dismissals without substantiation serve the same purpose for those who may \`believe' only Jim Cramer.So, I highly recommend this book, especially for people who are relatively new to managing their own investments. Even people who only have a 401k can learn a great deal that can help them do a far better job managing the limited options most 401ks offer and improve their results. This is a great starting point for the average investor. But don't become so enamored with Cramer's forceful style that you stop thinking for yourself. Take his advice - learn from his experience - put it into practice = become comfortable that you can implement it and make money from it. And then, when ready, keep your mind open to the many other investment methods and markets that exist. Each requires study and work, but if your temperament, time and dedication allow you to, you may find it even more profitable to move beyond this first step."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Many of Jim Cramer's recommendations are nothing new -- diversify; know companies before you buy; keep up with your holdings; know when to get out. What's new is in his temperament. His take on evaluating risk, when to make a quick trade or a longer-term investments, what constitutes diversity. How to know when a company is over or undervalued. The \\"before buying\\" and \\"when to sell\\" checklists are really useful -- a reminder not to skip any steps. The anecdotes are illustrative and amusing. Especially the one where he sets himself up in a short squeeze. A lot of this seems logical, and I can see how it can help me avoid errors I have made in the past.Something is missing though -- HOW to do homework. How to calculate growth. How much growth is enough? Enough for what? How much growth is needed to justify that PE? And how long would that kind of growth have to continue? Why? (a couple of spreadsheets would help here). Using price appreciation + dividends when figuring how your portfolio is doing. How about some discussion of the different ways different types of businesses are run, and how this is reflected in their financial statements? For each of the \\"diversification\\" sectors he recommends, what can we expect the financial statements to look like? What are the important features? How does the banking business work? And what REALLY goes on when you place a buy or sell order?This must all be second nature to Mr. Cramer, but those buying his book generally lack his education, apprenticeship, and/or career experience. We didn't start learning the stock market in high school. We need the nuts and bolts. This knowledge can be pulled from a variety of sources, but a companion \\"how to\\" volume would be a great help."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Mr. Cramer is full of emotion. He is on TV and radio. He has much to say about the stock market. His information is helpful, but it is only the beginning in one's learning to be successful in stock market investing. You will have to read many more books including books on technical analysis in order to gain the knowledge needed to be successful.Cramer's 25 rules for investing are explained in this book. The rules are sound and very helpful for the investor to review. They are:1. Bulls, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered.2. It's OK to pay the taxes.3. Don't buy all at once.4. Buy damaged stocks, not damaged companies.5. Diversify to control risk6. Do your stock homework.7. No one made a dime by panicking.8. Buy best-of-breed companies.9. Defend some stocks, not all.10.

Many viewers of his show may be mystified as to what Cramer looks at when analyzing a company, but this book explains it all! He describes the Cramer ideas on utilizing P/E ratios, decisions from Fed, and even tips on how to judge a company's top management. This book is extremely practical because Cramer uses his saavy from 30+ years of investing experience and the lessons learned from working as a mighty hedge fund manager.A portion of this book deals much with investment discipline - deciding how much of a portfolio should be dedicated to speculation, how to properly diversify, etc. Another focus is about reading the market and predicting which sectors will be the performers based on the overall conditions of the market. Cramer also throws in signs to look for in individual stocks by presenting many examples of good CEOs (Commerce Bank) vs. wish-washy management (Sunbeam). Cramer gives reasons why \\"buy and hold\\" no longer works and why at least a small portion of everyone's portfolio should be devoted to short-term speculation.Real Money is a great read for anyone with money in the market. It's written for investing professionals as well as home gamers (individual investors). The investment advice is practical and definitely this is the best investment guide I ever read."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I was given a copy and unless you want to day trade, there is no true way for you to make money through this book. Stick with the basics (which he does cover) but please stay away from his \\"speculation\\" tactics.He admits on his show that you should only use his investment ideas with your \\"Mad Money\\", and it's for a good reason. His following (just like lotto ticket buyers) is strong enough to power swings in the market, but if you're not ready to trade daily, you stand a 50/50 chance of losing. I have tracked him for months along with the guys from the Motley Fool. Cramer will get in and out several times on speculation while the Fool sticks in for the long term. My point once again is that his advice is meant for day traders, hedge fund owners and short sellers. The guys at the Fool have beaten Cramer hands down. Yes I'm a Fool, but I do my own due diligence and don't blindly follow anyone. I will retire early thanks to long term strategies, dividend reinvesting (DRIPs)and buying without a circus clown telling me what's hot. I respect Cramer for what he has done, but certainly not for how he's done it.Check out his relationship with his partner at The Street.Com. There is suspicion of naked short selling on several equitieshttp://www.nfi-info.net/index.html(call his show and ask Cramer about Novastar Financial (NFI) sometime!) and it never fails that Cramer routinely \\"mentions\\" competing equities with a possible hidden agenda. He's right when he says he's not out to make friends!The main reason I don't like this book is more that Cramer tries to endear himself to you as a common man on your side. Personally I don't believe anything could be further from the truth. While his basics of the market are sound and it's well written (by a ghost writer), I believe his intent is to help promote his show, support moves by his hedge fund buddies and endear himself to improve his following so the market swings he can create become more profitable for the big money people. If you are reading this, then you probably can't afford to trade in blocks of 10k or better and you aren't privy to when Cramer's true friends are going to close their positions. If you can get a copy of his daily script and invest thousands into the equity BEFORE it airs, then follow the man to the ends of the world. Otherwise be prepared to buy and run or you'll be a Cramer pork sandwich special.Buy this book only if you:1. already understand the basics of trading/investing2. promise yourself you will never trade with your retirement money based upon his recommendations. Even Cramer himself tells you that in his disclaimer.3. don't want to know anything about trading options4. want a fun read but don't need to know about funds5. can't wait for it to show up at your local libraryJust be careful, borrow the book and spend the $15 on some good coffee to drink while you do your own research!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I just spent a lazy Sunday reading this book, and I enjoyed it!Cramer does a good job of giving people the very rudimentary basics of understanding important concepts about the market. The book is a good book to hunker down with if you want to start learning about investments and/or trading stocks.But if you are laboring under the impression that \\"If I just read what is in Cramer's head, I'll get rich, too!\\" you might want to reanalyze your position.This book is a STARTING POINT. Not the solution to your quandary about \\"How can I make a killing in the stock market?\\" He gives very basic information about earnings per share calculations, earnings multiples, the need for diversification with suggestions on how to build a small, diversified portfolio, paying attention to economic indicators, the actions of the Federal Reserve Bank, reading the headlines, and some tips on how to spot the bottoms and tops of the market.You should definitely read this book if you have no idea what I just talked about.But if you are a novice, you may need to read it several times (which is not necessarily a bad thing). Cramer claims on his TV show that his job is to \\"educate\\" his viewers on how to make money. A noble mission, for sure, and kudos to him for trying. But a novice learner may have a problem \\"learning\\" from him because he has a tendency to talk in Wall Street jargon throughout the book. And in some places he fails to explain the terms. A novice could easily get lost in some sections.Additionally, there are few visuals or graphics or charts to explain some of his concepts--and these would be helpful to readers who learn visually. Perhaps in another edition, Jim?What this book might do for you, if you are highly motivated to learn this subject, is inspire you to learn as much as you can about the jargon he uses, and to make it your mission to learn as much as you can about the nuances of his concepts.For example:He says you should stay away from companies that have a lot of debt on their balance sheet. Makes sense. But how much debt is too much debt for a certain company in a particular industry? He gives one very obvious example where the interest payments alone on debt a company must pay exceed its entire anticipated earnings. Well, duh! But what if they don't? What if they are 5% or 10% or 50% of earnings? How do you, the novice, learn to distinguish where the fine line is between an \\"OK\\" debt load and a \\"These-guys-are-up-the-turbulent-creek-without-a-freakin'-paddle!\\" debt load?He goes into a discussion about earnings per share calculations, but do you know what components of income are included in \\"earnings?\\" And do you know which components that exist on today's income statement might be gone on the next one--thereby affecting EPS calculations, and subsequently share price, more than a little? And do you know how companies can fudge their financials to make things look better than they are, all the while meeting auditor's and AICPA reporting standards?You need to read other books to master, or at least become much more fluent, with financial statement analysis and read other books on financial analyses for particular industries.He says you should do a lot of \\"research\\" on any stocks you might want to acquire. He lists some generic sources of info--articles, company Web sites, financial statements, etc., that you should read religiously. (And Jim, darling, where do I go on the Internet to hear these company conference calls?) You should do research, no doubt. But you need to read many more books on business, on economics, on finance, on the market, etc., to understand exactly how to sift through all that research information and pull out the gold nuggets. You have to know what you are looking for and how to triangulate discordant bits of info. (I think this ability is a huge part of Cramer's genius).Cramer is a very bright guy. He's a global thinker and learner with a very impressive mind, and he has the benefit of years of experience. To be fair to him, his subject matter is expansive, and to use his own metaphor, the canvas of his book is just too small to hold all the dots and dashes of his expansive and creative knowledge.You should read this book if you think you might like learning about the stock market and want to dip your toe in the pool to see how the water is. But if you think the water's fine, then be prepared to dive in and submerge yourself in knowledge beyond these 281 pages. Watch, listen and enjoy Cramer's antics on TV and radio and listen to his tips, (if you can handle loud, obnoxious, and brash Yankees. I love him. My husband cringes at the mention of his name!). But make learning about this subject an obsession first, just like Cramer did. Maybe then you'll make some Real Money."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"In some ways, this is a pretty basic book. He spends quite a bit of time explaining why stock price, by itself, doesn't reflect how expensive or cheap a stock is. What matters is the price/earnings ratio.Lots of personal anecdotes here. Entertaining, but a bit fluffy that way.He's good on analyzing the macro-economic situation because it has a huge impact on stock price movements. Pay attention to inflation and the Fed rates, he notes correctly. Good analysis of how to play different sectors during economic cycles.He doesn't believe in technical analysis and chart reading. Big plus for Cramer, IMO.He's honest about the possibility of losing money. He doesn't make absurd promises about how if you follow his method you're guaranteed to double your money every 3 years.He believes in making speculative bets with up to 20% of your portfolio. If you want to make \\"real money,\\" you have to take on some \\"real\\" risk.Cramer likes to trade fairly often. He doesn't advocate a \\"buy and hold\\" policy. But he ignores the pitfalls of trading too much such as selling too soon, trading costs, tax costs, and the difficulties of timing the market.Not much on fundamental analysis. He insists that you should do your homework, but doesn't say exactly what to look for. He seems to be a pretty intuitive type investor, plays hunches and looks for breaking news, looking for bottoms, bargains. Basically, Cramer looks for promising growth stories. Valuation does not appear to be his primary concern.He makes a good point that you have to be ready to sell a stock when things change. Many a great company have fallen.Final chapter has a very clear explanation of the basics of options. Nice.Cramer doesn't really offer a coherent method of picking stocks. He offers inspiration and needed warnings."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I enjoy watching his energy on TV and I think he's a pretty good guy but over the past few years I have studied his recommendations and his reasoning and they are conflicting. He'll recommend a stock now...then recommend it a month or so later...etc...but then all of a sudden he doesn't recommend it even though the stock is below a price that he recommended months back. This would make sense if there was a catalyst for it or some news but I've tracked his recommendations and most of the time you can see that it's his followers that bought the stock when he said buy...are dumping the stock after a day...two days..a week.One of his parts in his introduction in the book talks about investing in quality companies. High quality companies that can pay good dividends outperform everything else...BUT then he says most people buy low quality companies that will never pay good dividends..or they hold onto high-quality dividend payers that become low-quality disasters without dividends. He hates big pharma but almost all of them pay 3% or more dividend yield and even with litigation, they are making billions a year for their shareholders.I love cooking pulled pork and bbq ribs for family picnics/get-togethers and the only way to make sure the meat is moist and tender (and done the right way) is cooking low and slow - just the way INVESTING should be. Too many people are taking his recommendations and putting ALL their money into them. Some are working, others are not. Do yourself a favor and just buy household companies and companies that you buy products from. Those are the true time tested companies that will be there tomorrow - with the exception to airlines, electric companies and automakers - just because of their industries. I've been tempted to take Cramer's recommendations but my low and slow way of investing in companies like Procter and Gamble, Johnson and Johnson, GE, Bank of America, Walmart, Pfizer, Microsoft, Aqua America...etc. have not only gone up in value but are all dividend payers that have increased their dividends every year!! Ask me how I am doing on a \\"Buy and Hold\\" (although I continuously add to my position on these stocks when they dip some) strategy in 20 years...getting a couple $1,000 in dividends a year without selling my stock! I wish Cramer would mention or at least acknowledge that the buy and hold strategy does work as long as you are picking good sound stocks...not speculating like he does!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This is a terrific book for anyone who wants to make real money in the stock market.I have been trading for over 30 years and I can tell you that this is one of the best books I have read on the market in many, many years.. It has many very good tips and insights that reminded me of my past mistakes and triumphs. It was a great read!He proposes a simple, straightforward strategy for developing a small portfolio of stocks, tells you how to manage this portfolio - and make real money! He addresses timing, when to buy, when to sell, tops and bottoms - everything you need to know. But he keeps it simple and straightforward so that it is an action plan you can actually use and follow.I only wish the American people would get out of this Mutual Fund Mania and set up a nice little portfolio of individual stocks like this instead. They would make so much more money and the country would prosper like never before!Like anything in life you need to experience years of trial and error in order to come to an intelligent strategy that will work for the future. Kramer has this experience and he is sharing it with you in this book. You don't have to take his advice, but you would be a fool not to listen. He's telling you - don't do this, I tried it in the past and I lost money. Do this instead - I learned by experience that this strategy works and will make real money. What more could you want? Believe me when I tell you that if you are just starting out buying individual stocks - you will make many, many errors and you will have losses.Kramer's writing style could use a little more severe editing - he is too rambling and anecdotal for me. I hit page 75 before I found the nuts and bolts of what I was looking for - but from then on the nuggets flowed and flowed - it was terrific.The dilemma is that the people who really need this book will have a tough time realizing that this book is of any use to them! It's like trying to tell a 19 year-old college student what to do with their life - when you have a world of experience behind you and they are just starting out. The same thing applies to this book and some who will approach it. They'll say it wasn't useful, it didn't give them the information they were looking for, or that Cramer doesn't know what he's talking about. But after having traded for 30 years and having lost hundreds of thousands of dollars as well as having earned many hundreds of thousands of dollars - I can tell you that this man is speaking from experience in the real world and his advice should not be taken lightly.[...]I'm sorry to say however that I can't stand Cramer's television show -- his speaking style is anathema to me. So what I do is I subscribe to theStreet.com and read the columns and articles in the evening at my leisure - and I replay his audio programs on specific issues. I find them very helpful. And I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to be able to read this book and not have to listen to his voice in my ear! Kramer's web site theStreet.com is an excellent source of information.[...]"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"If you're new to investing in equities, this book would be a good starter.

I like the book overall but when you jump from texts on how to quantify market & credit risk and advanced texts on options, it didn't stand out as a \\"golden text\\", like some have made it out to be.

He uses \\"bottom fishing\\" technicques to find undervalued stocks. (compared to expected future earnings growth)You need to take notes as you read because the \\"gems\\" are embedded in chapters of \\"fluff,\\" are not printed in bold type or underlined, and are not summarized at the end of each chapter.That said, I finished the book with about four pages of notes and felt the rewards were worth many times the effort it took to dig them out."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"The lure of fast money has always drawn those with gambling instincts to the financial markets. Successful hedge fund operators, like Mr. Cramer, have learned valuable techniques for using combinations of financial leverage, intense homework and careful attention to find more trading winners than losers in fast-moving securities.Naturally, it's then exciting to tell your gut-wrenching stories of hard-fought wins with beginners to make them feel like part of the fast-money crowd. It's part of what draws people to attend events where celebrities are present.But few people will be able to read this book and start making great speculative investment decisions. But many people will think they can.If you want to read this book for fun, that's fine. Just don't start following this advice. Real Money won't get you there.Here are the best lessons in the book:1. His explanation of how sector rotation among industries occurs along with tightening and loosening of interest rates by the Federal Reserve.2. Diversify to control risk.3. Beware of Wall Street hype.4. Check hope at the door.5. Giving up on value is a sin.6. Buy damaged stocks of good companies with great prospects.7. Don't buy all at once.8. Do your homework and stay on top of your positions.9. Keep most of your money out of speculations.A major weakness of the book is that Mr. Cramer focuses on the U.S. markets at a time when the gains from non-U.S. markets have been magnificent. That's like teaching someone how to use a portable calculator to create spread sheets rather than using Excel on a portable computer."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Loved the book. It goes beyond theory and gives you practical advice that you can actually use. Honestly, it's got numbers you can follow, philosphies you can track with a spreadsheet and suggestions of where you can go for information. It clearly defines what YOU need to do from your end to be a successful investor. If you're new to stocks, I'd suggest reading it once through, then going back through it with a highlighter. The second time through you don't need to read every word, just cover the sections where concrete instructions are given so you can reference them later. The info can be a bit overwhelming if your new, but he usually ties it all together with examples that bring the lessons home."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"You can't deny the popularity of investing guru Jim Cramer. He's become an icon. But should you read his book Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World? I think you should.First off, fans of Jim Cramer should read this book no questions asked. I mean who wouldn't enjoy a book that starts off with \\"I want you to be rich. Really rich.\\"? If you're a fan of the TV or radio show, you'll get more of that same old Jim you love.Besides being a quick and entertaining read, Real Money can be a useful part of your investing education. I believe that investors of all levels can benefit from this book. For new investors, Real Money does a great job of explaining the basics. For intermediate investors, Jim's anecdotes and rules can help you stay disciplined. Advanced investors will at least have a chance to better understanding a man who has a noticeable effect on the market and holds a lot of sway with many of today's small investors.full review at http://www.investorgeeks.com/articles/2006/03/20/book-review-jim-cramers-real-money/"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I'm a big fan of Jim Cramer's TV show, and he has a way of expounding financial wisdom in an exciting and fun way that seems to have escaped his competitors. In our household, I am the one that makes the investment decisions because, quite frankly, the subject bores my husband to tears. However, he will sit down and watch and enjoy Cramer's \\"Mad Money\\" show with me, and actually remember what was said. Believe me, that is quite an endorsement! This book takes the wisdom you get from watching the show and places it all in one easy-to-read volume. However, don't think you have to be familiar with the show to get something out of the book. The book is full of insights such as watching to see if a company's CFO buys large blocks of his/her own company's stock and taking that as a BUY sign, since nobody knows the fundamentals of a company like its own CFO. I would have to say I have agreed and disagreed with Mr. Cramer's individual stock picks over the years, but his underlying concrete knowledge, wisdom, and \\"feel\\" for global investing and its rules are undeniable. Don't let Mr. Cramer's manic on-screen persona fool you. He's the most level-headed man in the room when it comes to making financial decisions."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"While it is easy and even logical to assume that Jim Cramer is a raving lunatic, after watching his antics and flip-flopping on Mad Money, his latest book, Real Money, may cause you to change your opinion of the man.Cramer The Entertainer vs. Cramer The Financial Mastermind are two different entities.Real Money is chock full of great ideas. The chapters on Spotting Stock Moves Before They Happen and Creating Your Discretionary Portfolio are nothing short of brilliant.This is easily the best tome on investing I've ever read. Jim Cramer really does know his stuff."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Investing Rule Number One: No book can teach you how to make money in the stock market. You might as well try reading a book on how to win the lottery.Of course this isn't James J. Cramer's rule. Cramer's rules are sensible and conservative. Do your research, start investing early, be a bull or a bear but don't be a pig, blah, blah, blah. He tries to get our attention with the \\"unconventional\\" advice to speculate with some of our investment money, but that's what investing is - speculating. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, blue chips, they're all risky to varying degrees.Don't read Cramer's book to learn how to invest. Read it because the writing is snappy and he tells good stories. Another reviewer compared listening to Cramer's radio show to being in a pinball machine. I haven't caught Cramer's radio or TV shows, but that's an accurate description of Cramer's pre-Bubble ramblings as his style in Confessions of a Street Addict.In fact, Confessions of a Street Addict is a better book than Jim Cramer's Real Money. There is no tedious investing advice cluttering up Confessions. And in Confessions he doesn't mention his radio show by name and 800 number every few paragraphs, if only because he didn't have a radio show then.In Jim Cramer's Real Money, Cramer recalls some of his most fabulous successes and his most egregious mistakes. It's fun to read, but one of the most revealing passages is almost an aside, in which he tells us that although his wife, the Trading Goddess was a phenomenal trader back in her Wall Street days, she has failed miserably at at-home online trading. Makes you wonder if even the best advice of a former Wall Street broker and hedge fund manager just doesn't apply to the average investor trading out of his $10,000 IRA on E*Trade."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I think this book has some good wisdom in it - and his 25 rules arevery important for people to learn before they make mistakes the hardway - so I would say this book is worth readingBut the reason I give it two stars is that in my opinionI want more meat - rather than just telling me that I need to do myhomework - I want you to tell me the process of what do you dowhen you do your homework:what information do you getwho do you talk tohow do you go about reading all the chartswhat technical information is important what isn'tif you were to screen stocks - what do you want to screen forwhat software do you use to screen stocksif you don't give me step by step instructions about how I cando what you did - then to me the book is nothing but a bunch of hypeand a bunch of garbage bragging about how great you are - and honestlyI'm paying money for a book so that I can learn how I can be a greatinvestor too - I think I already know how great and how rich and howpowerful Jim is - I think everyone knows that - that doesn'thelp me - I want to know how I can be rich and powerful myselfMost investing books give the investor just enough information to bedangerous - and I think this book does a better job than thatbut it doesn't give enough in my mindI plan to go through it again, but to me - it doesn't help enoughat least from 1 pass through.

We researched and searched and purchased and sold stocks that we felt comfortable with. Not bad for beginners. We now call Cramer a stock guru.After gaining our trust in Cramer we started watching Mad Money on MSNBC. We watched and learned. Every now and again Cramer would make stock pick suggestions. Saying things like boy if you can get this stock for under xxx amount then \\"that is a gift\\". Buy Buy Buy.So we thought this stock trading guru has helped us make money with his trading guidebook why not take his advice from Mad Money and trade those \\"gift stocks\\" that he gets so excited about.Well I can say that the stock guru is our leader no more. Since Cramer's guidebook clearly states \\"tips are for waiters\\" we feel foolish. The twenty four percent we gained is now less than one percent. If we would have not believed the tips from the stock guru himself and we would have just continued with the traders guidebook methods we would have been much better off.It is hard for us to believe that this man's reckless \\"GIFT\\" stock picks are from the same person that wrote the book. From what I have been reading online there are many that consider Cramer very reckless with total disregard for his own books methodology.So buy the book but do not take TIPS even if the TIPS come down from the stock guru himself."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Booya Jim!! This is a great book about investing using a fundamental approach. What is great is that the basics of investing are explained in a layman's language. You have to read chapter 5 to get a basic 101 on business cycles and how to exploit the cycle in buying and selling stocks.I can list all the chapters and what they tell you about or list all the rules Jim explains - but that is rote repetition. Read chapter 4 about basics of evaluation. Jim does a wonderful job about comparing apples to apples e.g., Walgreen to RiteAid and goes into depth why he thinks what should be bought. This lesson alone is worth the price of the book for an investor starting out. Another good lesson is to evaluate the current value of a stock.Of course, you can attend some expensive classes and get uncompreshensible instructions in an university, but for the price of the book, the value of the lessons here cannot be beaten.In addition to business cycles, Jim gives some great insights e.g., he states that it is stupid to consider investing and trading as a dichotomy. How true! His famous buy-and-homework approach is like hearing a great 101 lesson from a Professor who also knows the real world. I haven't made any money in buying and holding. My emotions eventually have gotten hold of me. Instead, you need to know when to buy and when to sell. There are separate chapters on predicting tops and bottoms of both the market and individual stocks - again, wonderful reads.In addition there are 40 rules about investing. Some gems are \\"I don't care what you paid for the stock, would you buy it now?\\" question to paraphrase. He gives a lot of credit to the Goddess, now his wife!All in all, a great book and a must-have book in your investing library. I read the book almost two times so that I could reinforce the lessons, especially about valuation and business cycles. My style of investing, which has been pretty successful, is both a combination of fundamental and technical factors, while Jim's is more fundamental. But the fundamental 101s in the book is useful and should be a must background for anyone wanting to put their hard-earned money on the fire in the stock market."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Having watched Mad Money on TV for about a year now, I grown to love the way Jim Cramer reduces all the confusion surrounding simple investing to everyday lingo. This book is more of the same, with less personality (which some people, not me, find distracting). Concepts are condensed to the necessities and anyone can understand their options should they wish to do their own investing rather than pay/trust someone else to do it. If you want to know the basics or how to get started investing for yourself, this is the book. Cramer rises above the politically correct Wall Street jargon and explains what they really mean. You'll learn the vocabulary and you'll be able to research your stocks and make intelligent decisions about how to invest your hard earned money. Check it out. It's hard to argue with his personal successes, but it's immensely commendable to realize he's willing share his successful tactics if you'll just listen."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This is an awesome Investor's guide.

The top 5 kinds of stock to buy when you begin. To stick with mutual funds if you are not going to do at least 1 hour of stock homework on each stock each week.In one chapter he discussed how stocks increase in price as the market sees the companys earnings grow, and that you must search out companies with growth potential. When I read this I switched my 401K funds into 4 small cap mutual funds, They have out performed the large caps by double this year giving me a 10.57% return and over $8000.

Also on his show, he tends to recommend stocks that are close to 52 week highs. I would prefer to buy stocks that are breaking out into a bull market cycle. Cramer is knowledgable about stocks and the market. The info in his book is basic, but insufficient for successful independent investing. I recommend it, along with Bulls Eye Investing."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"So I've been watching \\"Mad money\\" for some time now and have read this book too. There is a certain repetetiveness about Cramer ... though I feel and know its basically cause he's targetting a different audience (from novices to somewhat experienced home-gamers).But even then it can sometimes get monotonous! That said this book is a really good one if you are new to the world of stocks or even if you've been in for some time but find it tough to cut through the crap thats loaded onto you on radio and TV!This book can be read real fast.... but to get the full import of whats being said reading it over a couple of weeks would be better!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"\\"1) I appreciated how he presented the material in as 'plain English' as possible.2) The Cyclical Investing and Trading Chart was a prize.3) I enjoyed how he included situations and stories from his personal life in the book serving to break up the drier material (rather than the book being solely a \\"Text-Book\\" of sorts).4) I liked the last chapter the most, probably because he transformed complex subjects and market tools into easily understandable subjects and market tools.\\"I thought Id just quote this reviewer. THey hit the nail on the head, especialy with number 3. His stories were good entertainment (which helped keep the book from getting boring) and aided in helping the reader understand what Cramer is trying to get across."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Does anyone else out there think it's insanely risky to let tens of millions of American families manage their own retirement assets? With the demise of corporate pensions and the rise of tax-deferred personal savings accounts, Mr. and Ms America get to sit at the table with the pros and make bets on GDP growth and the movement of interest rates. Here's the cruel catch: very few pros beat the market average over any meaningful time period. What makes you think you can?Jim Cramer wants to help. Decouple him from his histrionic media persona and Cramer comes across as generally sensible. He starts with a fundamental distinction between trading and investing: trading is a bet (often short-term) on the movement of stock prices; investing is a bet over time on the underlying value of a company. Cramer is particularly good on why stock prices and company values become misaligned. In the Stock Picking Rules to Live By chapter, he distills his hard-won trading wisdom into pithy investing maxims.One of his valuable ideas is to make your self a \\"buy and homework\\" rather than buy and hold investor. Don't buy a stock and ignore it; instead you should monitor the company and the developments in its business sector. His rule of thumb is that an active investor must spend one hour per stock per week doing homework, including reading those eye-glazing company financial reports. The informed investor hopefully knows when to double down on a temporary dip and when to cut and run when things turn truly ugly.It's fun to get a little wild at times, and Cramer wants you to let your inner trader off the leash by taking a portion of your non-retirement funds and making some speculative bets on stocks. He gives you tips for how to find stocks and industries on the way up, and how to place your chips. Many investors will appreciate that he's specific about when and how to sell a stock, which isn't covered much in standard investment guides (how can money managers collect fees on the assets under management if you pull those assets off the table?). He also shares his rules of thumb for how you can spot a market bottom. This is pretty funny, actually. Even if you had Cramer's secret sauce - the proprietary algorithm all Cramer-like pundits use to generate world-beating results - your chances of calling a market bottom are roughly similar to your chances of beating LeBron James in a game of one on one hoops.That's the chief problem with this book: Cramer's trying to have it both ways. He's giving the reader the how-tos of being a trader, which is essentially what he is, while admonishing him to be a prudent, conservative investor. This is like seeing the guy you were partying with late into Saturday night appear in the pulpit on Sunday morning to preach against partying on Saturday night. Being a successful trader takes skill, discipline, experience, analytical intelligence, guts, guile and luck. Great ones are as rare as NBA all-stars, and very few consistently outperform the market over time. If you're inclined to take a walk on the wild side with Cramer, have at it. If you're interested in prudently growing your assets in a retirement account, go to the bible of individual investing, The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham.If Jim Cramer is the stock pundit for the New Media age, Ben Graham is the pundit for the ages. Warren Buffet, maybe the greatest stock picker who ever lived, acknowledges Graham as his mentor. Graham began his investing career during World War I. He first published The Intelligent Investor in 1949 and updated it regularly into the 1970s. Grahams's advice is simple, profound, and road-tested over many generations of investors and markets. Find companies with significant assets and good business models that have stood the test of time. Buy them when they're selling for less than their historical average and don't pay much more than the underlying asset value of the company. Stick with them until they appreciate in value, keeping fear and greed at bay by ignoring the short-term gyrations of the market. So simple, yet amid the bright lights and roar of the crowd, so hard to do.Buy the Harper Business Essentials version of the Intelligent Investor, which updates the book through the dot.com boom and bust, and contains excellent annotation and commentary by business writer Jason Zweig. Had he lived to see the internet bubble, Graham probably would have applied a French aphorism he was fond of quoting: \\"plus ca change, plus ca meme chose\\" - the more things change, the more they stay the same. Viewed from Graham's lucid, sweeping perspective, nothing we're seeing in the markets today hasn't been seen before.So how should Mr and Ms America manage their pension assets? Just as most of us can't play basketball like LeBron James, most of us can't pick stocks like Jim Cramer or Ben Graham. We should stay in the stands and put our savings into low cost index funds that mimic the market averages. Or we should turn our money over to proven mutual fund managers (understanding that their fees cut directly into our profits). We can stay out of the stadium altogether and put our stash into tangible assets such as a real estate. If you want to get out on the court yourself, hard work and practice are essential. Attitude too. But don't be surprised when the bigger, stronger players blow by you for easy baskets."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This is excellent and worth the time!

Jim has a macro view in his stock selections that is very logical and useable. Although his boisterous style on TV has soured me to his show, I thought the book was one of the most useful books I've read in 20 years of trading. There aren't many {any?) charts to look at, and you don't have to interpret candlesticks or X's and O's.

There is more but you don't want some uber math filled book on trading. This book fills the gap and it is great. Cramer assumes you have base knowledge and then coaches you up on P = M x E. He interjects stories that are relevant, both winers and losers. He freely admits mistakes and tries to get across the point that you are going to make errors and that is okay. Just as long as you don't make blundering errors. It is a lively read that will keep you interested.He does excellent justice to cyclical and sector investing. I mean I had a vague understanding before but he really drives it home in one chapter. For this reason alone it is almost worth the price of admission. He even includes a snazzy chart.His 25 rules are quite handy. He explains rules for shorting, how to use options, and diversification. He covers how to build a portfolio and drives home the point about doing research.Also, he is more of trader in this book than an investor. He discusses artifical tops and bottoms. How to correctly judge stocks. When to cut losses and what not. (If you get the subtley of that first sentence then the book is for you.)Long story short, it is an excellent read for someone who already has a toe in the water.

Confessions of a Street Addict is a Fautian tale about genius who betrays his best friend and ignores his family because he can let nothing stand in the way of his making money. It definately shows Cramer's crazy side. He must have had lots of therapy and drugs to calm down to the level that he is at now. I'm dead serious.Not only is Confessions interesting, it teaches you financial lessons that you will never forget. It's amazing that a book that taught me what an inverted yeild curve is, could be such a page turner.I literally couldn't put this book down when I was on vacation in Aruba. Moreover, I read passages to my husband, who kept begging me for updates about what was happening at the hedge fund during the crisis of 1998.So, yeah, read Real Money, the book everyone is talking about. But Confessions of a Street Addict is by far the better book."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I received two copies of this as Christmas presents. no one needs two copies, but one's worth the price.

BOOYAHHH !!!"},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This is an inspiring, plain-English guide on how to trade and invest in individual stocks. Some of Cramer's detractors complain that he is \\"too speculative\\", too much into *trading* and not enough into *investing*. And others bemoan his role in the bubble of 2000. I think they're losing sight of some big issues. Cramer's book may be full of sly techniques, but it also grounds you by driving home some important messages:1. Your paycheck isn't enough. You need to leverage your discretionary money! While mutual funds (and bonds) can make you *some* money, it still isn't enough to afford all the expenses that come our way in life. Also, mutual funds may *seem* safe. But even one apparently sensible fund can wreck you if the manager blows it! \\"It only takes one dog\\", as Cramer says -- and this saying applies to funds as well as individual stocks.2. Be a better investor, OR be a better client. If you don't have the time or interest to stock-pick and do the homework, you should at least become educated enough to understand how the pros do it, so you can pick good fund managers.3. You have what it takes to do it yourself, if you really want to. Learn how to spot when the market throws a perfectly good stock in the bargain bin. Make sure you have cash on hand to pounce on the opportunity to buy it! Of course one way to make sure you have the cash on hand, is to make sure you you weren't a \\"pig\\" and had already taken some profit on something else!This is a great book full of common sense. It's important to also keep in mind that every move Cramer makes is based upon years of experience and a huge amount of knowledge. The reader has to remember to stick to the basics in the book for now, keep it simple, stay disciplined, and start slow."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"Jim Kramer makes investing terms understandable for the ordinary person.

This book shouldbe read after Peter Lynch's \\"One up on Wall Street\\". Even thoughthis book covers the basics such as what is P/E and how to reada balance sheet, that is not what makes this a great book on investing. This book tells you how to manage your money in the stock market. When is a good time to sell a stock? How does the machine of Wall Street cause stocks to go up or down? How to avoid having your portforlio tank. Also he sticks to explaining everything in laymen's terms.Its actually a fun book to read as well, while you are learning some great investing advice. Over all a great book to read after Peter Lynch.Lynch is investing 101 and a bit dry, but valuable reading. Cramer is the reward for learning the basics and has more advance concepts. One area that was weak in the book, was options. The chapter was about 10 pages too short. You do get a basic idea about options, but more examples on how to make moneyand avoid losing money in options, would have been nice. Fourand half stars."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This book provides investing basics but will not make you an expert. Cramer educates the reader with simple ideas that can be easily implemented.

This practical book definitely rises above the metaphysical \\"money making\\" books. Overall, an informative read for the new investor."},{"Title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"I like Cramer's TV show a lot but this book left me cold.

The Baron and the Baroness will be meeting in the library that evening with Victor Passerat, someone with whom the Baroness is passionately in love but who is himself passionately in love with the Baron. Posting a \\"Not to Disturb\\" sign on the door, the triangle of lovers meets, determined to settle their issues, but these can be settled only one way--with gunshots. Convinced that death will be the result of the meeting, the servants are already referring to the Klopstocks in the past tense, and they have planned every aspect of their evening so that nothing will interrupt the flow of the expected crime.Though the Klopstocks are \\"obsessed with sex,\\" the \\"downstairs\\" inhabitants, are also not immune from this allegation, however more circumspect they may be. Heloise, the pregnant maid, has had so many lovers, she has no idea who is the father of her baby. Lister wants to marry his aunt; Sister Barton, the nursemaid for the Klopstocks' mentally challenged son, wants to marry her charge, though he throws dangerous tantrums, destroys furnishings, and has to be kept in the attic. They will all, however, be able to do what they want after the Klopstocks are dead. They have separately signed contracts to give their stories to various news outlets for large fees, and they have numbered accounts in the Swiss Trust Corporate, which will make them wealthy beyond their dreams.Scottish author Muriel Spark is wicked in her satire of the aristocracy's sexual dalliances, their \\"appropriate\\" marriages permitting affairs with whomever they choose and as often as they choose. But she aims her mockery beyond them. She also satirizes the desire of witnesses to events to land big contracts (those from English language venues are the most prized), and the eagerness of the media to grant them--even when the \\"witnesses\\" have yet to witness anything at all. Several of the servants pose for photos in advance of the crime. Later interviews lead the well-prepared servants to expound with literary quotations borrowed from famous authors.With vivid and hilariously dark dialogue, the novella becomes as much a riotous farce as it is a comedy of manners with the roles reversed. Spark keeps the actions and the interactions moving non-stop, her use of absurdity, suggestion, and gallows humor at their peak, and the one-liners coming fast and furiously. Spark's novella is word-perfect, her sense of irony honed to stiletto sharpness. Out of print in the US since its first publication in 1971, NOT TO DISTURB has just been released in a new edition, which will be celebrated by Spark's long-time fans and those newcomers who will joyously discover Spark for the first time.

Meanwhile, downstairs, the servants wait, planning for what they already know will be a tragedy. For their employers, that is. For them it will bring a very big fortune.Weird enough?\\"They haunt the house,\\" says Lister, \\"like insubstantial bodies, while still alive.

Recommended for those who don't mind feeling discomfort, and uncertainty in their fiction."},{"Title":"Not to disturb","review":"This is a very short novel, which delves into it's character's personalities and motivations in a rather unapproachable, abbreviated style. The story is from the point of view of the servants who know that their employers are about to commit a murder suicide and plan for it accordingly, by seeing how they can profit the most from the situation. The reader is thrown into the midst of their preparations and must put together the pieces of the backstory as the author drops the clues and hints amidst the seemingly random witty asides made by the characters. It's an interesting idea of a story with a great angle - the servants profiting from the foolish indiscretions of their employers - but the story comes off as rambling and self-indulgent at times, highlighting the absurd in humanity.I picked up this book because it was listed as a Jane Eyre derivative, but aside from the Gothic themes and the madman in the attic, there isn't much of a direct connection or homage to that novel. Perhaps certain characters were included as a pastiche on elements of Jane Eyre. Overall, this is a very curious story with a witty satiric style that I felt was overly-favored over the development of the story."},{"Title":"Old Testament Challenge Volume 3: Developing a Heart for God: Life-Changing Lessons from the Wisdom Books","review":"See my review of Volume I, ISBN-10 0310248914"},{"Title":"Hard Work: Life in Low-Pay Britian","review":"Hard Work is the British version of Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed. Journalist Polly Toynbee does justice to the genre. She works mind-numbing jobs that pay just enough to keep her in poverty. She packages pastries and cleans hotel rooms, she lives in a squalid flat she can barely afford, and she tries to make ends meet on minimum wage. It is very depressing.Toynbee finds that being one of the working poor is to be defeated at every turn. When she gets her dark, damp, unfurnished flat, she has to borrow money from the Housing Authority to furnish it because she won't get paid until she has been working for at least two weeks. She can't make an appointment to see the doctor because her job doesn't allow any paid time off. She can't try to get a better job because all the employers want to schedule interviews during her work hours (and she can't afford to take time off) or they want her to devote the day to waiting for an interview. She can't even make her views as a voter known, because to get to the voting station would mean unpaid time off from work, or an hour on the bus and in line waiting to vote after a 10-hour shift on her feet.Life is a constant Catch-22 and she finally admits defeat when she has to move out of her apartment because the building's front door doesn't lock, there are drug dealers in the lobby, and she can't afford a phone.In between descriptions of her alternate life in the slum, she splices discussions of the politics behind the policies regarding wages and poverty in Great Britain. Even for someone who isn't familiar with British government, it is very clear. It is also obvious that we in America have a lot in common with Britain."},{"Title":"Hard Work: Life in Low-Pay Britian","review":"Being unemployed, I read this book hoping that Polly focused primarily on her observations without too much analysis of causes and solutions. Sadly, politics dominate the book, but that's not the only problem.In order to simulate a life of poverty, Polly created a completely artificial scenario that made things far worse than they would be for most people. She found accommodation (in a run-down tower block) that desperately needed furnishing, but without a starting allowance. While some people may find themselves in such a situation, I suspect that it's only a small minority. For example, when I was made redundant in 2002, I still had my rented accommodation, my possessions and some money. I still have the first two although I have much less money these days. Polly decided that she was going to get a job come what may and created a bogus CV, necessary for her purpose but not an option for me. Polly was able to use her real name as it's not her professional name. Polly also regarded a lot of things as necessities that aren't. By contrast, I adjusted gradually to a lower standard of living as I suspect most people do.Since coming out of bankruptcy (something caused by taking out a huge loan six months before my redundancy), I simply remember when the big bills are due (every three months for the telephone, every six months for the water) and plan accordingly. I don't have a TV because the annual licence fee is a pernicious tax, but I can visit a betting office to see the big races (the aspect of TV that I most miss) although I rarely bet these days. Radio serves me well for news and sport. I do without home heating and when it gets really cold , I either hide under the duvet, go downtown or have a hot bath, all cheaper than heating a room for several hours. These and other sacrifices allow me a limited budget for books and music, but even then I am price-conscious. Life on benefits isn't great for me, but it's worse for some people, especially those with small families.There are many problems relating to long-term unemployment that cannot be simulated including the re-training schemes (particularly New Deal, for which I prefer the description Raw Deal), the limited range of subsidised training courses and the even more limited capabilities of the agencies to understand individual needs (Next Step, a government agency, tried to put me on a NHS course but the NHS said I was over-qualified), the periodic jobcentre interviews, the checking-up in between, the impact of bankruptcy and so much more. The housing benefit system doesn't allow monthly payments, so as the landlord refuses to accept payments directly, I get 12/13 of my monthly rent every four weeks leaving me to pay the difference. Yes, there's a once-a-year bonus month but I'd rather have monthly payments without a bonus month.Polly took a series of jobs in a short space of time (obviously for journalistic needs; I'll allow her that much) in order to get an idea of how hard some people have to work for pitiful wages, spread over several industries. The fascination of this book for me lies in the description of some of the condition under which people sometimes have to work, not least being the one-copy employmennt contract. If this isn't illegal, it certainly ought to be. In the days when I was able to find employment, there were always two copies, one for the employer and one for myself. I was always able to read my copy at home before signing, and keep it thereafter for reference. It seems that some agencies expect people to sign contracts that they can only study in the agency's office, but not take home. The system is clearly designed to stop people showing it to anybody who might make life awkward for the employer. I can only hope that I never end up desperate enough to sign such a contract. Polly also highlights a number of other issues that are useful to know.I'd be interested to see how easy it would be for Polly to get a menial job using her real CV. My experiences suggest that employers seeking to fill such vacancies don't like taking on people with a history of well-paid jobs (in my case, as a computer programmer), preferring candidates accustomed to menial work. Meanwhile, the shortage of IT staff is a myth. Employers could fill such vacancies with people like me who could do the work but need re-training. Employers won't fund such training, nor will the government.The book is good at highlighting some specific housing and employment problems but Polly's artificial scenario, only a little of which (the fake CV and rapid job turnover) was necessary for journalistic purposes, together with the large amount of unnecessary political dogma, detract substantially from what could have been a great book. If Polly had stuck to the facts as she saw them, letting readers make up their own minds about causes and solutions, I could have sympathized with her inability to adjust.If you have an interest in the subject, this book is worth reading despite its limitations. One way or another, it will make you angry, whether you direct that anger at employers, governments, journalists or all of them."},{"Title":"Hard Work: Life in Low-Pay Britian","review":"This is another entry in the view-from-the-bottom genre, which goes back at least to Orwell (as sociology) and Dickens (as grimly realist fiction). Polly Toynbee, a writer for the left-wing Guardian newspaper, dropped out of her comfortable life (for nothing can be more comfortable and respected in modern Britain than to be anti-capitalist and anti-American) to assume a false persona toiling in the \\"invisible,\\" low-paying jobs of the service economy, so that she could write about that world from her own experience.Not only did she work in such contemporary sweatshops as a hospital, bakery, school kitchen and nursing home, she even moved into one of south London's dreary council estates (what Americans call housing projects).What Toynbee saw in the jobs she took on and in state-sponsored housing is the stuff of nightmares. She describes grueling physical labor, inhuman work rules, long and unpaid commutes by bus and tube, and wages too low to live decently on. Almost all the service jobs she took were with contract agencies that have no interest in their employees' welfare, and whose profit margin, she says, depends on squeezing the most work for the least possible pay out of the long-term, dead-end temps they hire out.Despite Toynbee's Marxist leanings, I'm willing to take her word for it that conditions in Britain's minimum-wage jobs are as dire as she asserts. She is a good writer, and her descriptions offer a painfully fascinating picture of exploitation and blighted lives. One chapter toward the end of the book, about her stint in a nursing home for victims of senile dementia who inhabit a twilight mental world, is a heartbreaking look at both the elderly patients who have outlived themselves and the ill-treated carers who tend them.Polly Toynbee comes through in her writing as genuinely empathetic and caring, and she makes some good points along the way. She is particularly scathing about the effects of contract employers who are equally indifferent to their own hired hands and to the best interests of the companies they sell labor to. She sensibly points out the absurdity of a National Health Service whose hospital managers no longer directly hire employees, which might provide the employees with career paths upward, but can only choose among outside contractors who supply worker units like so many parts.Toynbee, however, cannot seem to think past her assumption that the only hope for amelioration is in more government regulation. But Britain had a near-Socialist economy for many years and still goes far beyond the United States in its nanny-state mentality. How is it, then, that in what Toynbee perceives as the savagely competitive, cowboy-capitalist economy of the United States, we have so much more job mobility? Why is it that in the United States working behind the counter or in the cleaning crew isn't widely thought to be a life sentence? How come in the cradle-to-grave welfare state that is Britain such a large percentage of people are living in awful public housing compared with the infinitesimal percentage who do so in the United States?Toynbee can be perceptive on small points, but I think she's so in love with the welfare state that she can't see the role it plays in the \\"root causes\\" (beloved Guardian-writer phrase) of the desperation of so many of the poor in Britain. She doesn't consider how the state's allegedly benign guiding hand in almost every aspect of life -- its assurance that all will be taken care of by The Government -- tends to infantilize people, making them disinclined to be responsible for their own lives.Toynbee's heart bleeds for the single woman who can't support her three kids on the salary she makes, and I'm sympathetic too, but this woman has been told by the state since she was a teenager (which is probably when she had her first child) that being a single mother was a perfectly acceptable \\"lifestyle choice,\\" and that the government would see to it that she and her offspring would never be in need. A lie, to be sure, but the prevailing ideology that is pounded into the heads of the country's most vulnerable and naive.Toynbee harps on the appalling working conditions that rightly make her angry as evidence that \\"market forces\\" don't work for the benefit of the poor. But market forces have been distorted by the multi-culti welfare state that is modern Britain, which has seen to it, through mass immigration, that sellers of labor are in large supply and buyers are in comparatively short supply. I expect Toynbee would throw up her hands in horror at the idea of closing the U.K.'s pliant borders, currently open to any joker who claims asylum, but the mess that she sees in the labor market is one result of the immigration welcome wagon.Hard Work: Life in Low-pay Britain is a useful reminder, for those more fortunate, of the misery of many who perform society's unpleasant but necessary tasks. They should have better working and living conditions. I do not think they will get them from a stronger dosage of the government social engineering that has been largely responsible for putting them in the fix they're in."},{"Title":"The Unfortunate Tobacconist & Other Mysteries: The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Volumes 1-6","review":"If you are a fan of the classic Sherlock Holmes film series starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, we heartily recommend this wonderful collection of vintage radio plays from the same World War II era as the films.Lovingly restored, this series of relatively obscure adventures of Sherlock Holmes are brought to vibrant life by Rathbone and Bruce who give sterling performances that seem second nature to them. Listening to this CD is like stepping back in time -- you can practically imagine that you are living in the 1940's sitting by a cozy fireplace one cold evening with the radio on enjoying the great detective's latest adventure for the first time.An added bonus is included: vintage radio commercials evidently included on the original tapes.Also, if you like this product, keep an eye out for the excellent hardcover book called \\"The Lost Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" by Ken Greenwald, which adapts Anthony Boucher's same radio scripts from this CD into a short story format complete with illustrations based on Rathbone and Bruce.A welcome treat for fans of Sherlock Holmes and for all those who enjoy classic radio programs or may wish to experience one for the first time (as we did)."},{"Title":"The Unfortunate Tobacconist & Other Mysteries: The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Volumes 1-6","review":"having been born 30 years after the recording of these great radio classics, i feel like I was there during the original broadcasts.

The stories tend to be somewhat contrived and suffer in comparison to the BBC productions of original Doyle stories in which Clive Morrison starred as Holmes. The organ music gets monotonous, and if I weren't already a teetotaler, the wine commercials would make me take the temperance pledge. Despite all that, the productions are wonderfully entertaining. Basil Rathbone's Holmes exceeds Clive Morrison's overacted Holmes as the day exceeds the night. The chemistry between Bruce and Rathbone is perfect, and the simple stories move swiftly to their satisfying (if somewhat obvious) conclusions. Although Holmes purists tend to hate Nigel Bruce's Watson, I found him to be irresistably likeable. I'd want Doyle's Watson guarding my back in a tight spot, but I'd rather sit by the fireplace and swap stories with Bruce's Watson. I particularly liked the host's introductory visits with Watson in which Watson sets the stage for the mysteries."},{"Title":"The Unfortunate Tobacconist & Other Mysteries: The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Volumes 1-6","review":"When I learned Simon and Schuster was re-releasing this set on CD, I hoped they addressed the problems with the cassette versions released in the late '80s. They didn't. Oddly, the episodes on the first three discs have some of the original commercials and/or portions of the announcer's closing banter with Watson edited out, bringing the run time to about 25 minutes instead of the full half-hour. To serious collectors of old-time radio, this is unacceptable, especially when the packaging in effect states the programs are presented as they were originally broadcast. The rest of episodes are intact. No idea what possessed S & S to do this, but here we are. Secondly, depending on the episode, the audio restoration is a bit heavy-handed. Too much noise reduction and processing has resulted in some words and bits of dialogue sounding clipped or chopped off. The shows should have been re-mastered for the CD release. These may be picayune issues to most people, but to others like me, they're not."},{"Title":"The Unfortunate Tobacconist & Other Mysteries: The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Volumes 1-6","review":"Unedited Radio Broadcasts from the late 30's and 40's with Rathbone and Bruce at their best.

The stories themselves are superb examples of pastiche, written with a deep knowledge & understanding of the characters. But in the end, it's those wonderful actors, Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce, who bring the listener back time & time again. Was there ever a Holmes as precise & eloquently spoken as Rathbone's? And while Watson was actually a stronger figure in the Doyle originals, who can resist the warm, avuncular version of Nigel Bruce, all \\"Harrumph!\\" with a jolly twinkle in his befuddled eye?

I have all 4 sets of the series, it is a must for anyone wishing to slip back in time and hear what the imagination can conjure up.Top Drawer!!!!"},{"Title":"The Unfortunate Tobacconist & Other Mysteries: The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Volumes 1-6","review":"By 1945 the \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" radio series starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce relied mostly on original stories written by Anthony Boucher and Denis Green, interspersed with a few Conan Doyle adaptations. The episodes on this first set of CDs are entirely original stories. As was inevitable when a writing team was commited to creating a new Holmes adventure every week, some of the stories are disappointing, but a few rank alongside the better prose pastiches that have been written over the years.\\"The Unfortunate Tobacconist\\" is reminiscent of such Canonical tales as \\"The Engineer's Thumb\\" in that it presents an effective and memorable central situation, the resolution of which tails off at the end into offstage confusion in which Holmes and Watson are not directly involved. Nigel Bruce's Watson is even dumber than usual here, never having heard the expression \\"kick the bucket\\" and having to be told by Holmes to hide behind a counter rather than under it!\\"The Paradol Chamber\\" is based on one of Watson's references in the original stories to unrecorded cases Holmes investigated. I had always imagined the Paradol Chamber to be a room in which someone was killed or in which Holmes and Watson were trapped and in danger of suffocating. The radio version fulfills both of these expectations, but the story constructed around them is extremely unsatisfactory in every other way. Mary Morstan Watson is depicted at the outset as far less than the intelligent woman she was in Conan Doyle's \\"Sign of Four\\", before suddenly becoming a deductive genius and saving Holmes and Watson at the end.\\"The Viennese Strangler\\" is a highly enjoyable, campy story, especially memorable for the over-the-top character of an Italian opera diva. Unfortunately, it shares with \\"The Notorious Canary Trainer\\", the other story on the same CD, the device of Holmes frightening a confession out of the criminal in an unbelievable way. Conan Doyle himself actually left unwritten a Holmes story he had outlined -- \\"The Adventure of the Tall Man\\" -- apparently because it would have forced him to use such a denouement.\\"The April Fool's Day Adventure\\" is unusual in being an extremely early case for Holmes and Watson, occurring less than a month after \\"A Study in Scarlet\\". The newness of Holmes and Watson's friendship is demonstrated by Holmes seriously considering Watson a potential suspect at one point. The climactic twist is lots of fun, although I saw it coming ten miles away. Rathbone seems to be making an effort to sound younger, but Bruce sounds as old and stuffy as ever; thus one must think of the story as being filtered through the elderly Watson's remembrance. \\"The Strange Adventure of the Uneasy Easy Chair\\" suffers from its plot being somewhat given away by its title, which is not actually mentioned on the radio broadcast, presumably for that reason.\\"The Strange Case of the Demon Barber\\" involves an actor playing the role of Sweeney Todd. Holmes himself is more likeable than usual in this episode. \\"The Mystery of the Headless Monk\\" is an unusually dark story, particularly in its conclusion, which features some of the most chillingly effective acting in the series. One suspects that the reference to William Hope Hodgson's supernatural investigator character Carnacki sailed over the heads of most 1940's American listeners, let alone the modern-day audience.\\"The Amateur Mendicant Society\\" -- another unrecorded adventure mentioned in the Canon -- is profoundly disappointing. Its first half is one of the best openings to a Holmes pastiche I have ever encountered, but the second half is a major letdown in which the story turns out to be about something entirely different from what it seemed. \\"The Case of the Vanishing Elephant\\" takes place in India. The episode implies that Holmes -- wildly uncharacteristically -- has made the long, dangerous journey from England **without knowing what his client wants him to investigate**.\\"The Case of the Limping Ghost\\", like \\"The Headless Monk\\", is a tale of debunking the supernatural. Amusingly, an American character seems to be voiced by Harry Bartel, the series' announcer, who is usually heard delivering the commercials for Petri wine! \\"The Girl with the Gazelle\\" is a Professor Moriarty story in which, as in Conan Doyle's \\"The Valley of Fear\\", Moriarty himself remains off-stage. It is a highly satisfying story of an ingenious scheme inspired by the Professor's love of the French artist Greuze.Overall, this is a fun collection for anyone willing to countenance further adventures of the Great Detective beyond the sixty tales of Conan Doyle, and whose teeth are not instantly set on edge by Bruce's somewhat inauthentic (but loveable) characterization of Dr. Watson."},{"Title":"Sketches of William Hicks, Abner Hicks, Jasper Hicks, George Harris, James Crews, John Earl and something of some of their descendants: With ... of living with those of sixty years ago","review":"My grandfather published privately this book before I was born, but I helped my father reprint it in July, 1954, with updates.The book, which I have read several times, would interest anyone interested in history, because my grandfather, Thurston Titus Hicks,a lawyer from Henderson, North Carolina, had an ear for language and an interest in unusual examples of life from1742 until 1926. anyone would be amused to learn the reaction of a family of country boys experiencing that newfangled invention, the match, for the first time.It meant that no one had to run miles to the nearest neighbor to get a bucket of hot coals when the fire went out."},{"Title":"Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century","review":"Marco a composer himself is equipped to deal with the expressive richness of Spanish composers. It's fascinating that he divides the book into two halves, claiming the Spanish Civil War,(1936 to 1939) as a moment which divided Spain. I would have gone farther into the Fifties,for Franco had kept a repression of the arts well past the official end of the Civil War. Spain had its grandfathers Manuel de Falla,Albeniz, and Granados,all here amply discussed as to their influence on future generations. The conservative side seemed to dominate Spanish music up to the Fifties, interests in a national voice with past nostalgia, composers of the Zarzuelas,and the Generation of 1927 are focal points. But composers here were quick to absorb the innovations of European modernity of Bartok and Stravinsky. The Generation of 1951 Marco refers is the post World War 2 generation, composers like Luis de Pablo who we see(almost exclusivily) on Europes most rigorous festivals. Spain has had a cultural distance an isolation from the power centers of Europe, and like embarking into the regions to acquire knowledge and wealth like colonialists, is a fascinating perspective here.It seems how the only Spanish composers who gained recognition in the capitals in Europe are those composers who fostered close ties with composer power brokers, like Italian composer Franco Donatoni,Pierre Boulez, or Stockhausen. The second half here of this book, is all about splinter groups it seems again a convenient way to describe different expressive interests, So we have The Associates,The Moderates,composers like Abril,who search for a meeting place of the conservative voice and innovation, The Independents.Spain still remains isolated in that we seldom have a chance to hear this music only read about it."},{"Title":"Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century","review":"Though I tend to read a lot of books of music history and musicology for fun and interest, I don't often think of commenting on them. The reason is wrapped-up in the current musicological tendencies, which at best are fascinatingly recondite, or at worst factionally leading. Music is such a great thing in my own life that I don't often want to muddy my enjoyment with critiquing extremes of interpretation as to understanding. I know what I think about music, and am interested what others think, but I don't want to get too serious about the latter. Frankly, it would take some of the fun of it out of it for me. But this book has moved me to feel the need to comment. There is a lot in it about composers I am guessing many will never have heard of, and if I may say so, probably will never again. But about many famous Spanish composers the odd ideological preconceptions of the author lead to very blinkered interpretations. The author, who is an avante-garde composer himself, seems to have had a very heavy layer of pre-judgment about many of his fellow composers of the past. Of course he has to say some good things about Grandos, Albeniz and De Falla. But slightly less well known composers like the Halffters, Ernesto and Rudolfo, are treated very cursorily, given their importance. And what amazed me most is that in discussing Rudolfo Halffter's imprtance as a piano composer he fails to even mention Padre Soler. This seems like a ridiculous omission in a book on Spanish music. Rudolfo Halffter's and Ernesto's works in the Soler vein are such a striking homage across the centuries, and one of the few true examples of successful updating of an antique form in musical history generally, that surely it deserved to be brought in to the discussion. Similarly, when he discusses the work of Carlos Surinach there seems a skewed ideological view, but it takes a really gratuitously nasty turn. Personally I don't mind if a commentator differs strongly on an approach and makes the parameters of that difference clear and thus distinguishes himself thereby. I don't call that nastiness, but criticism. And the person who receives the criticism can at least internalize it with the understanding that they are dealing with someone who differs greatly. But Marco does not make his ideological preference in favor of very abstract avante-garde music obvious till the end. Thus when he criticizes someone like Surinach it is not on seemingly serious grounds, but for what seems like petty nastiness. I don't mind saying that I take a somewhat personal interest in this because I knew Surinach somewhat. However one might have taken this very modernist gentleman, as a purveyor of \\"tourist\\" music it was quite impossible. Surely if his music was \\"flamencoized\\", as Marco avers, it had to do with the fact that he made his career writing quite modernist ballet scores. Of course Marco does not emphasize this ballet writing in any way, because he seems to have wanted to portray the flamenco character in Surinach's works as purely supper-clubby. It hardly fits what the man's career was about, and so to me just seems like gratuitous nastiness, not even acid with a purpose. Many of Surinach's works still seem quite striking.Of course the purpose behind all of it becomes clear as the book nears the end. The fawning treatment of many avante-garde Spanish composers seems quite out of proportion. Just to take the example of Cristobal Halffter, the lavish treatment Marco gives him hardly seems justified next to his vastly more talented relatives, who get short shrift. He calls the Cello concerto \\"excellent\\" when it seems a very obvious grab-bag of avante-garde cliches, even if he did get Rostropovich to play it. Marco repeats several times the \\"scandal\\" caused by one of C. Hallffter's work as if that is a justification in itself of quality. Well, I have not heard C. Halffter's Mikrofonos, but I am quite sure it is no Le Sacre, and having heard his Cello concerto, was sorry I plunked down good money for the CD of it.The only part of the book I really like, and the reason I am not giving one star only, is about the \\"Generation of the Motu Proprio\\". He discusses a number of composers influenced by the document of Pius X. It is quite interesting in terms of cultural history to see how these artists had their careers affected by this Papal document. It drives home again how special Spain always was in terms of the influence of Catholicism. It always seems a bit ironic that Italian culture was more \\"free\\" in this sense. I especially liked also his very terminal judgment on the future of liturgical music in general because of the later Second Vatican Council. He says such music is \\"finished\\". Somehow hearing this judgment from an avatar of the Darmstadt School gives the meaning of that finality several potential meanings. I am not particularly interested in what this author might mean if it were not finished. But, since I very much like Stockhausen's Gesang der Junglinge there is at least a potential for imaginative potential."},{"Title":"Abstract Algebra and Famous Impossibilities (Universitext)","review":"This is the easiest-to-read introduction to abstract algebra and, in particular, field extensions, that I have ever seen. It is easier to follow than Artin's famous little book, and has easy but useful problems to allow you to check your understanding.This material is developed in order to explain the questions of how to prove that certain famously unsolved problems of geometry (a general Euclidean method for trisecting an arbitrary angle, constructing a square with the area of a given circle) are actually unsolvable. It also addresses the question of the transcendence of Euler's number (e).The first problem is handled by understanding the abstract algebra of geometrical constructions; the second goes further into analysis as well; and I haven't finished reading the discussion on the third problem. Admittedly, the learning curve rises rather rapidly on the last two problems!However, the book is worth reading even for the first problem alone, and as an introduction to abstract algebra."},{"Title":"Pipits and Wagtails.","review":"Basics: 2003, hardcover, 496 pages, 30 color plates, 260+ color photos, many detailed b&w; drawings, 27 species, range mapsWith difficulty, I'll try to not excessively praise or extol the qualities of this book. Succinctly, this book is the benchmark for identification guides covering a family of birds. Each bird is thoroughly described in its own species account (i.e., chapter) that ranges from 3-16 pages. Two other birds, the Yellow Wagtail and the White Wagtail, receive 46 and 49 pages, respectively. This is due to their complex taxonomy which probably includes multiple species.As a point of accuracy, this book covers only the 27 pipits and wagtails found in the Holarctic (North America, Europe, Asia) and not all 52-ish species in the world.The species accounts contain meticulous notes for identification and descriptions. These cover the various ages along with specific body areas (e.g., head, upperparts, underparts, wings, tail). Very good coverage is given to the geographic variations that can be so distinct in some of these birds. Other thorough sections include systematics (i.e., taxonomy and relationships), molt, ageing, measurements and wing formulae, distribution and voice. A smaller amount of focus is given to behavior and habitat.Wonderful coverage is given to the vocalizations. In addition to the well written text, some birds have dozens of sonograms illustrated. These may be a bit foreign or thick to most people, but can be very useful to those birders and researchers with a special affinity for sounds.The plates are of excellent quality, displaying the many plumage variations found in the wagtails and the fine details needed for the pipits. The White Wagtail has six plates dedicated to just itself. To compliment the color plates, scores of black-and-white drawings are included throughout the chapter to help display the finer identification points with the head, tail, wings, or even a single mantle or covert feather. The color photographs at the end of the book provide multiple, quality views of the various plumages.Lastly, the range maps are individually tailored for each bird. Multiple colors are used to denote the seasonal presence or to distinguish the geographic separation of the subspecies. Each map contains very useful detail such as political boundaries for all countries as well as major and medium rivers.If you have any interest in advanced birding or have been frustrated by the various pipits and wagtails in the field, you'll enjoy this book immensely. And, if you want to continue your education on some southern pipits, another superbly done book is \\"Pipits of Southern Africa\\" by Peacock, 2006 (ISBN 0620359676)"},{"Title":"Pipits and Wagtails.","review":"this books go just that bit more than the common knowledge, to give the reader the exact info to move from bird enthsiastic to ornithologist.everything you need to know in the ever changing world of species and subspecies.makes all the difference when in need, and arrived just on time, a week befor we had a stuning olive backed pipit."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game - Moria","review":"This is also an expansion pack for dwarves.

Each Voice of America is male, often middle-aged, often eccentric, dystfunctional or, in a couple of cases, downright creepy. They generally exist at the margins of what passes for the American dream, a world of trailer parks, door to door salespeople, and road wanderers. DeMarinis is certainly not in the business of either transformation or redemption for these people and places. Still, through his eye for telling detail -- one character dreams of &quot;places so familiar and yet so utterly lost that he would wake up with tears on his face, even though the places he dreamed about were nowhere he'd ever been&quot; -- and true talk dialogue, more often than not these stories break through irony and malaise to hope. Among the best: &quot;Paraiso: An Elegy,&quot; &quot;Wilderness,&quot; the strange encounter of &quot;Infidelity,&quot; and &quot;The Voice of America.&quot; But my personal favorite is &quot;Her Alabaster Skin,&quot; in which a romance novelist writing under the pseudonym Veronica Lamonica meets the woman hired to be Veronica at book store signings.

He stakes his ground early by noting that &quot;political democracy was the medium more than the achievement of the Jacksonian party&quot;. The work recalls astute observers of American society at that time such as Tocqueville, Leggett, Sedgewick and Rantoul. Here through their eyes we become witness to the paradoxical and nuanced nature of the Jacksonian &quot;persuasion&quot; (as opposed to ideology, for example). It is the first time that we are confronted with the notion of fear in American history, in which the Jacksonians view the ineluctability of the American experiment with a degree of circumspection. Meyers' work is also outstanding as a paradigm for understanding the thoughts and ideas of a given epoch: to understand those thinkers as they understood themselves."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Sea Turtle Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 26)","review":"I am still working on collecting all the Happy Hollister series that I started when I was eight.

Really the book is divided into three distinct parts.The first part, and the most comprehensive, deals mainly with the author's experiences on Okanagan Lake in search of the elusive Ogopogo. Mr. Kirk describes in great detail his own sightings as well as his reports from other witnesses. I was extremely surprised by the amount of video and photographic evidence he refers to that I have not had the opportunity to view. Unfortunately, I still have not had the opportunity, since Mr. Kirk does not reprint any photographs or video stills whatsoever in his book. Overall, this roughly autobiographical account of Mr. Kirk's adventures on the lake is intriguing and informative. His speculations on the behavior and physiology of the creature are all very well thought out and compelling. Also in this section there are fairly brief discussions of Nessie and Champ. While these parts are much less than adequate accounts of these famous cryptids, there are plenty of books out there containing much more detailed coverage if the reader so desires, so the briefness in treatment by Mr. Kirk is quite understandable.The second part of the book is a moderately complete listing of dozens of international lake dwelling creatures world-wide, each with coverage ranging from a few sentences to many pages. In this section, descriptions of more well-known lake monsters such as Mussie of Muskrat Lake and the Flathead Lake monster are interspersed with lesser known aquatic oddities. It is obvious that Mr. Kirk has done an impressive amount of research to have compiled such a lengthy list of entries. One absence I found disappointing, considering the recent publication date of the book, was some discussion of the Lake Van monster of Turkey, which has gotten significant media coverage in recent years. I could only find reference to Lake Van in the appendix.The third and final section of the book is a physical comparison of Ogopogo with his Scottish cousin, the Loch Ness monster. Based on the majority of sightings, Mr. Kirk offers up a point-by-point discussion of their similarities and differences.In conclusion, while I find the book to be the best modern coverage of the lake monster phenomenon since Peter Costellos' excellent 'In Search of Lake Monsters', it does have a few glaring flaws. First of all, the lack of photos and video stills is a curious omission and should have been a no-brainer. And, considering the comprehensiveness of the book, the lack of an index is equally perplexing. With these oversights corrected, the book would be a near perfect guide on it's intended subject."},{"Title":"In the Domain of the Lake Monsters","review":"I have several books on the subject of lake monsters, but John Kirk's is one of the best.

I guess you could say that it was pure Kipling though."},{"Title":"Collected Poems of Rudyard Kipling","review":"This is just an unformatted text file. Save the money and go to Project Gutenberg"},{"Title":"Collected Poems of Rudyard Kipling","review":"Unlike other reviews, mine refers to the correct book - The Collected Poems of Rudyard Kipling, Wordsworth Edition. Before going into its merits, it is necessary to say a few things about Kipling's poems. They are some of the most famous in English; published when poetry was actually popular, they were immediate bestsellers. Indeed, the public has never stopped loving them; there are seemingly fewer poetry fans each year, but Kipling still topped a recent BBC poll of the Greatest English Poems. He remains a favorite not only with poetry buffs but even with many who usually dislike poetry. Kipling has also had a major impact on other writers, as widespread use of his titles, lines, characters, etc. clearly indicates. He has also managed to infiltrate popular culture to a degree rarely seen. Conversely, critics still hotly debate his merits. Some think him a major poet; at least as many think him overrated or downright bad. He had near-universal popularity at the turn of the twentieth century but was critically despised by the time of his 1936 death; the pendulum has swung back and forth somewhat since, but he has never come close to regaining his apex.Kipling undeniably does several things well. He is a rhythm master with almost unmatched technical deftness and an excellent rhymer. He can truly turn a phrase and is eminently quotable; his lines are indeed so memorable that several, as George Orwell points out, are often used unconsciously by many who have barely heard his name. He is notably diverse and adept at nearly every form he tries. Even his harshest critics cannot deny these virtues. The fact that many of his poems are set in India, Africa, or other distant parts of the British empire also lends notable historical value; we get a good sense of what life was like in this important time and place, all the more interesting in that it is often through the eyes of representative types such as soldiers. Other characteristics are more subjective. For example, Kipling is very straight-forward; his poems are extremely lucid and very accessible, in large part because he relies little on tropes. Those who value simplicity and clearness will appreciate this; others may find it somewhat lightweight.The real crux, though, is not with form but content. Kipling has long been stereotyped as a jingoist glorifying war and imperialism and is almost ubiquitously accused of xenophobia, narrow-mindedness, mindless patriotism, and racism. His work undeniably has an element of this, but anything more than a superficial reading reveals a wealth of nuances and complexities. For instance, \\"Recessional,\\" written for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, is a thoughtful warning against hubris that is far from the simple-minded flag-waving critics lead one to expect. Works like \\"The White Man's Burden\\" seem unambiguously imperialist, though not in a celebratory way, but a few have found subtleties even there. The issue comes to a proverbial head over Kipling's many soldier poems, where he has soldiers speak as they really did - not only with profanity that now seems mild but with casual racism that is now very striking. This at times reaches such a peak that it has made some liberals stop reading and even condemn Kipling - an understandable impulse, but we must look closely. Some defend him by saying he is merely a reporter, but this is a copout. The question of how much he agrees with his soldiers is complex and still hotly debated, but it seems safe to say that - like nearly all men of his time, place, race, and status -, he likely had a milder prejudice. Even so, we must not dismiss the poems automatically, because the prejudice has a valid artistic and even moral purpose. Anything more than a superficial reading shows that Kipling in many ways sympathizes with the victims of this racism, and this comes out in several ways. Most fundamentally, the insight and sympathy the speakers gain for the natives is believable and affecting because of prior prejudice, making the contrast all the more stunning. One must keep this in mind, though some will of course still think the poems unreadable. Kipling is certainly not politically correct by our standards, but this does not mean we should dismiss him automatically; doing so is at least as illiberal as he is said to be, and the literary, entertainment, and educational losses are potentially great.This makes actually reading Kipling all the more pertinent; only those who have are qualified to judge. There are many collections, but this is notable as an inexpensive, widely available single volume one with all the authorized poems first published in 1940's Definitive Edition - hundreds of works over 850 pages. It is all the Kipling anyone but absolute hard-cores will need, missing only unpublished poems and a small amount never collected. The real question is if it is too much. Even Kipling's greatest fans admit he is uneven; he has a large number of great poems but a significant amount of mediocre ones, and more than a few are simply bad. Casuals may be better off with a selection, but the fact that this has all the poems for little or no more - and in some cases even less - than selected editions arguably makes it a better buy.Whether or not they want this edition is a very open question. Anyone seeking only the poems will be well-served, but those requiring more should probably look elsewhere. There is substantial supplemental material, especially considering the price, but it is mostly low quality. Unlike some Wordsworth Editions, there is a sizeable Introduction with background on Kipling, the poems, and the historical context plus some initial analysis. We even get Orwell's famous essay on Kipling's poems, perhaps the most important piece of Kipling criticism. However, both Orwell and editor R. T. Jones start by assuming Kipling is a bad poet and defend him to various degrees; this is valuable, perhaps even inevitable, but not an ideal introduction. Those not already familiar with the poems should read them first, as it is hard not to have one's perceptions colored. Unlike nearly every other book in the Wordsworth Poetry Library, this also has quite a few notes - and they are thankfully footnotes, in contrast to the endnotes in Wordsworth fiction editions. This is essential, because Kipling uses a plethora of foreign, technical, and geographical words that are alien to nearly all readers as well as many contemporary and historical references. Numerous poems would be to various degrees incomprehensible without notes, and we should be grateful for them. That said, they have many problems. Words, including foreign ones, that few will know are inexplicably not footnoted - all the more frustrating in that some notes belabor the obvious. A great number of other things that should be footnoted are not; for example, a series of automobile poems parodies a variety of literary works, but only those aware of them will appreciate it, as the notes are silent. Less significantly, words defined once are never defined again, even though there may be hundreds of pages between uses; anyone not reading the book straight through in a short amount of time - i.e., almost everyone - will thus be frequently lost. On a more positive note, the edition differs from many Wordsworth ones by helpfully including a Table of Contents plus title and first line indices.These complaints are small considering the price, but dedicated readers will be unsatisfied. All others will likely be well-served."},{"Title":"Collected Poems of Rudyard Kipling","review":"The title of this Kindle item is a lie.

His was about Kipling's poetry; mine was about Kipling's use of realism in the American style rather than in the English or Continental European style. But I had written a long term paper on Kipling's poetry, and both of us had memorized large chunks of it. We've been married going on 26 years now, and we still cap each other's quotations, or one of us will begin reciting a poem and the other will pick up, making it a duet.Kipling's poetry is not much admired these days. I can only assume the reason for that is that nobody reads him. I cannot imagine anyone reading him and not loving him, but too many cutesy poets have ruined poetry for too many readers, who now will not go to the poetry they would like if they had read.Once in an undergrad speech class the professor proclaimed, \\"Farewell, romance! But of course you don't know what that means.\\"Without raising my hand, I shouted, \\"But all unseen, Romance brought up the nine-fifteen! I do too know what that means.\\"He forbade me to tell anyone else, and so far as I know none of my classmates ever found the source of the quotation.Oddly enough, although he was strongly Imperialist in many of his views, he is a very popular writer in the former USSR, as a writer of the working man.All I can say beyond this is, for heaven's sake and for your own sake, read him for yourself. Don't take anyone else's word about him, especially if they don't like him. He didn't get a Nobel Prize for Literature for playing silly games. He got it for hard, stark realism in such works as THE LIGHT THAT FAILED and KIM.Read him. Please."},{"Title":"Collected Poems of Rudyard Kipling","review":"The title of this book is misleading.

Passing each object in the exhibit case such as a typewriter or journal activated an audio clip with the voice of the writer giving a reading from a work or poem. What Birnbaum does in this compilation is invoke the voices of university fathers and presidents, statesmen, professors and authors on the higher learning. How fortunate for us that Birnbaum has done all the reading and provided the Cliff notes from legendary giants such as Woodrow Wilson and Robert Maynard Hutchins along with authors Oscar Wilde, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mark Twain, Booker T. Washington and suffragist Susan B. Anthony to contemporary luminaries Clark Kerr and P. F. Kluge and Derek Bok. For the first pass, it is a read cover to cover-I found it impossible to put down. This is a treasure trove of wisdom from some of the most eloquent voices in the English language-some you will ponder thoughtfully, others will make you laugh out loud. Birnbaum has written extensively on higher education and has grouped the quotations thoughtfully and expertly into Four Sections: Higher Education and Society related to purpose and social issues. Section Two on Academic Affairs including policy, learning, research, scholarship and teaching. Section Three consists of Institutions and Processes-the campus, institutions, governance and administration and management. The final section covers the educational roles of the faculty, the students, and the President. The book can be read again following the author index as well as the subject index. For example, in the entries on \\"corporalization,\\" the words of the sociologist Thorstein Veblen spoken in 1918 reverberate today. Almost a century ago he cautioned about erosion of the ends for which the university is maintained through imposing \\"standards and tests, in the place of personal conference, guidance and association between teachers and students.\\" Or imagine finding in one collection some of the pith of the likes of Friederich W. Nietzscke, William James, Anton Chekhov, T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats and Alfred North Whitehead. To me, it is only fitting to end with a quotation from Robert M. Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, \\"The real University is a state of mind. It is that great heritage of rational thought that has been brought down to us through the centuries and which does not exist at any specific location.\\" Robert Birnbaum's Speaking of Higher Education provides the road signs."},{"Title":"Speaking of Higher Education: The Academic's Book of Quotations (American Council on Education/Oryx Press Series on Higher Education)","review":"I have been very lucky to get this book right from the author. I have been an ardent reader of Dr. Birnbaum's books.

You may find all the quotations from the beginning of the US Higher Education history to the present date. You will find here the quotes from the distinguished presidents of the most prominent universities and their views, perceptions and thoughts. The book is fabulously organized and covers all the fields of the higher education. It is a must-have-book for everyone - even for the present, incumbent presidents and deans and for those who think they may find themselves in that position, or someone who is interested in the system of the field.

Disappointing, however, is the short-stop ending just after Ted moves to New York at 22, before any of his famous children's books were written. There is an additional four page narrative but it is not fully illustrated as the rest of the story is and may leave some children cold unless they have help to get through it.

A poll of any group of readers about their favorite books will ALWAYS come up with Green Eggs and Ham and The Cat in the Hat. Ted Geisel's work is loved.Kathleen Krull describes the events in his early life that became part of his work and interests later. His lifelong love of animals, his shyness, his sense of justice and fairplay were outgrowths of his boyhood on Fairfield Street in Springfield, MA.Geisel's boyhood was filled with fun and adventure but he was always slightly out of step with the rest of the world. He was a kid who preferred drawing crazy animals to studying. As the son of German immigrants, he was mocked and bullied. He had a three-legged dog. He wrote and drew under pseudonyms.The book follows his childhood and college days and ends with Ted striking out on his own, as an illustrator and cartoonist in Greenwich Village.The paintings by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher seem to just glow and invite the reader to keep turning the pages.I read this book to many classes as it was a Bluebonnet title but this is not a book you can just breeze though. There is much to discuss and digest. Without fail, the kids are outraged when Ted is shorted his medal for selling war bonds in an embarrassing presentation by former President Theodore Roosevelt. They are thrilled when Ted draws on the walls of his room and does NOT get in trouble. They examined the illustrations closely. I shared the book with at least 10 classes before I noticed (thanks to a sharp-eyed student) Ted's three legged dog is featured on the cover of the book.

I don't know if his case is airtight, but it is definitely well presented and argued.The author has some unconventional beliefs, but he is definitely a sane and intelligent person. Just because I have not experienced paranormal encounters, like the author claims he has, doesn't neccesarily mean that some people do. Even if you don't agree with any of the author's conclusions, you will probably get a kick out of some of his theories. I sure did!"},{"Title":"The Atlantis Conspiracy","review":"This is one very interesting book. Mr. Stoecker is very ambitious, tracing contemporary illuminati all the way back to legendary Atlantis.

He argues that the elite lie, and have lied to us about the basic nature of reality itself. That UFOs come, not from a distant star system but from basis on Mars, from a civilization originating here on earth long before our history was recorded. The author, Mr. Stoecker, tries, with some success to tie all the ruling classes thru history to one continuing group determined to hang on to power at any cost.

In fact, his humorous treatment of this was refreshing. The author agrees with many others that ancient people were more sea-faring than academics will consider. His discussion of \\"Chi\\" and enlightenment was interesting but naive.Unfortunately, too much of the book was either paranoid diatribe or deliberate disinformation. His obsession with Clinton grew tedious. Rehashing the Kennedys wore on too long as well.

A complete waste of money- I strongly advice you to not to buy it."},{"Title":"Paradigms Lost","review":"Without a doubt, this is one of the most insightful books I have ever come across in my life. In it a mathematician takes a critical and penetrating look at the most baffling problems facing humanity and science. These are; The Origin of Life, Language Acquisition, Sociobiology and Genetic Determinism, Artificial Intelligence, The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and the Mysteries of Quantum Physics. In narrating these topics Casti adopts a unique courtroom style in which he presents the arguments in favor of and against the dominant hypothesis in each of the fields, and then steps in to act as jury and provide his own opinion.But the book is more than only a deep exposition of these topics. Casti weaves an extremely lively and entertaining tale about a host of characters and discoveries involved in these exciting areas of thought and research. One of the things I noticed in this book is the marvelous sense of humour that Casti has. Nowhere else in serious science writing or even in popular accounts have I seen such intelligent dashes of humor expressed in such fine language. In fact that's one of the outstanding triumphs of this book. The language in the book is sophisticated, yet very accessible. The bibiliography at the end is almost as lavishly detailed as the book itself.In my opinion, Casti has emerged as one of the finest science writers in the world because of this book. I strongly suspect that it is because of his unique experiences; he combines the artistic and culturally sophisticated style which he developed in Europe with the informal, witty and pragmatic cheek found among Americans writers which he must have picked up during his time in the United States. All in all, it is remarkable how one man can collect and coherently discuss such a prodigious amount of information, especially about topics not directly related to his field of study. This will be a book I am definitely going to remember all my life.I will recommend it strongly to anyone even remotely interested in science, research and the future of humanity. An example of scientific writing at its best."},{"Title":"Paradigms Lost","review":"Casti poses the question, &quot;What does current science, in particular, important unanswered questions in current science, tell us about humanity's place in the universe?&quot; Thankfully, Casti is an amazingly knowledgeable and fair guide, with the emphasis always firmly on clear explication of that science, not any particular interpretation of its pertinence to the human condition. Casti is a scientist, not a dogmatist.The breadth and depth of this book are exceptional. Casti injects a little of himself here and there, as well, and comes across as a jovial fellow... his erudition speaks for itself.One of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Paradigms Lost","review":"Casti is one of the best science writers out there considering he isn't nearly as well known as some of them, but he deserves to be. Also, his books are consistently at a respectable level of technical detail and sophistication which is rare in science writing intended for the layman. In this book, although the discussions range from current cosmological theory to evolutionary biology to quantum physics, I was most interested in his discussion of Chomsky and current linguistic theory, which is my interest, so I will confine myself to that.In this chapter, Casti gives the best introduction for the general reader that I've seen on Chomsky's ideas on innate language acquisition and transformational grammar. In the process, he also compares them with competing views such as Sampson's and Piaget's, and he even discusses E.O. Wilson's sociobiological views a bit, which Chomsky himself commented on. After reading this chapter, you would probably be able to read the chapter on generative and transformational grammar in a good introductory theoretical linguistics text, such as John Lyons's classic Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics, or Donna Jo Napoli's recent book, entitled simply Linguistics, which is also excellent. So overall, another great book from Casti that stands head and shoulders above the competition and with a great introduction to modern linguistic theory."},{"Title":"Paradigms Lost","review":"This book is splendidly written. It surveys some of the big scientific controversies of our day. He tackels evolution, genetics, language, artificial intelligence, and the search for extraterestrial intelligence and two philiosophical questions that impenge on science. What is good is that he provides lots of footnotes to other works that those who, if they are really interested, can consult. The footnotes helped me locate lots of other good books for my library.John Casti is one of the great writers of modern popular science non-fiction."},{"Title":"Paradigms Lost","review":"A mathematician waxing philosophic? What's the world coming to?An excellent book by a very intelligent man. Style is a bit wordy, but an excellent storyteller with a great sense of humor. I bought this book years ago, but for the most part the observations and questions remain relevant, engaging and powerful."},{"Title":"Paradigms Lost","review":"John Casti is an American mathematician transplanted in the old world, namely in martial and musical Vienna. And it shows. His prose is as witty and cultured as any European master would like it, and as concise and right to the point as any new world's scientist is taught to produce. Even though my personal opinions about the subject matters covered by Casti in this book more often than not radically depart from his conclusions, this is by all means a must for any skeptic's library. And it will figure nicely in most other collections as well. Paradigms lost is about six major unsolved mysteries in modern science (some would say in modern philosophy). In order of appearance, we have: the origin of life, the genetic basis of human behavior, the existence of a unique &quot;language-organ&quot; in the human brain, the question of thinking machines, the possibility to uncover extraterrestrial intelligences afoot in our galaxy, and the very existence of a real world independent of external observers. Wow! It's hard to imagine a more compelling intellectual tour de force... The structure of Casti's book provides a &quot;claim&quot; at the beginning of each chapter, such as &quot;there exist intelligent beings in our galaxy with whom we can communicate&quot;. The author then provides a minimal background necessary to assess the arguments, and proceeds to lead the way to a parade of &quot;witnesses&quot; for the &quot;prosecution&quot; (in favor of the claim) and the &quot;defense&quot; (against the claim). In so doing, we are treated to the reasoning of Einstein and Bohr, Dawkins and Gould, Miller and Crick (if you don't recognize these names, shame on you, skip the rest of the review and pick up the book itself...). Each chapter then ends with a summary of the opposing statements (and a very useful table recapitulating viewpoints and authors), as well as with a final judgment delivered by Casti himself. This last component could be interpreted as somewhat pretentious (especially given the impressive array of witnesses that precede it). But every person is entitled to her/his opinion and to put it in writing (as long as the manuscript is signed)... Besides, Casti makes very clear at the beginning of the book (don't skip the introduction!) that the conclusions are only his, and more often than not are the result of a simple matter of taste. The first claim is that &quot;life arose out of natural physical processes taking place here on Earth&quot;, apparently hardly a controversial statement, until your initial confidence is at least questioned by an array of detailed arguments concerning the difficulties that modern physics, chemistry, and biology are still experiencing in order to answer the question of the ultimate origin of ourselves. Did nucleic acids come first, and then somehow gave origin to proteins? Or did it go the other way around? Or maybe they both appeared simultaneously? Or, perhaps neither of them came first, but they supplanted a much more primitive and ancient mechanism for the propagation of life? Casti even entertains - mostly for the sake of completeness - Nobel laureate Francis Crick's theory of panspermia, the idea that life has been &quot;imported&quot; on Earth from outer space; astronomer Fred Hoyle's hypothesis about a &quot;silicon creator&quot; responsible for disseminating life throughout the universe; and last and certainly list, creationist Duane Gish's idea that the christian god did it all first-hand. The author's conclusion is that it is likely that life indeed originated on Earth by natural means, but that we still have few clues to how exactly this came about. His personal preference goes for Cavalier-Smith's relatively recent suggestion that the original organisms were actually clay crystals, later supplanted by nucleic acids and proteins (see my article in Science &amp; Society at http://fp.bio.utk.edu/sands/... &lt;&lt;&lt; check address &gt;&gt;&gt; for a discussion of why Cavalier-Smith's hypothesis doesn't make much biological sense). The second claim is &quot;human behavior patterns are dictated primarily by the genes&quot;. This is the old yet always very current nature-vs-nurture debate that has been waged for centuries. Casti does a very good job at presenting the modern versions of the arguments, including biologist E.O. Wilson's &quot;sociobiology&quot; and its somewhat politically motivated rebuttal by the &quot;Boston group&quot;, spearheaded by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould and geneticist Richard Lewontin. Casti makes very clear that we are interested in the intellectual side of the question, not in its moral and political consequences. This is not to say, of course, that scientists should not care about the social implications of their research; it simply means that they are especially qualified to carry out the research, while they have no particular claim at understanding or discussing the moral corollaries of the research itself. I think this is a particularly lucid treatment of a very thorny subject, and definitely makes for a sobering reading on both sides. When all the smoke clears, the author casts his vote for the very reasonable middle-ground conclusion that it's really a bit of both. We are the result of a complex series of interactions between our genes and our environments, to the point that independent contributions of either factor are distinguishable only in extreme cases. Related to the nature-nurture debate is the third claim, &quot;human language capacity stems from a unique, innate property of the brain&quot;. This is Noam Chomsky's revolutionary suggestion in the field of human cognitive psychology, which is indeed the current virtually undisputed paradigm. Casti sees no reason to question it, and neither do I. Even though some of the many opponents of Chomsky do raise interesting questions, they seem to succeed only at refining the details of the central claim, not at invalidating it. The basic idea is that humans all over the world learn any language they are exposed to during infancy much too fast for this being the result of environmental influences only. It seems much more fitting to hypothesize that parts of our brain are specifically genetically hard-wired to facilitate such task. Admittedly, we still know very little of the actual physical, neurobiological bases of the language organ. On the other hand, the opposite claim - mostly by the Swiss Jean Piaget - that the brain is such a powerful general problem-solving machine that the cultural environment is all we need to explain the acquisition of languages, clearly contradicts some elementary empirical observations. For example, why is it that we have increasing problems learning new languages with age, while our brain doesn't find it difficult to learn how to solve other puzzles, including algebra and trigonometry problems? It seems that the human brain (and by extension other animal's as well) is a compound machine; parts of this machine are devoted to a general ability to learn and to solve problems, while other parts are hard-wired to solve recurrent and vital problems that occurred during the species evolution. I submit that the proportion of the two parts, as well as the particular list of hard-wired capacities, can be thought of as both the historical legacy of a given species and a description of the limits which that species encounters in using brain-power to maintain a longer presence on the evolutionary stage. The forth question asked by Casti regards the veracity of the claim &quot;digital computers can, in principle, literally think&quot;. To me this was truly a no-brainer. While the if, how, and when this will happen in practice is a matter of interesting debate, the theoretical possibility is demonstrated by the very fact that we - humans - do think. And it has been pretty obvious since Descartes, but especially Darwin, that we indeed are nothing but machines, albeit among the most of sophisticated in the known universe. Casti does also conclude that the evidence against the claim is weak at best (perhaps not by chance, it is based mostly of studies by philosophers, not computer"},{"Title":"Paradigms Lost","review":"This is a book that has stuck with me for the past 10 years since I read it. It is still a source of inspiration for me, and most books that I read are automatically compared to it in my mind."},{"Title":"Paradigms Lost","review":"I can't understand why this book is out of print - I assume that it is as I had to order a used copy. It is a beautifully-written tour of how science has found our place in the world. By turns witty and erudite, Casti has an uncommon grasp of the whole range of scientific endeavour and the issues that make up the transition between science and philosophy.It will save time if I start with the list of things I didn't like about this book, as it turned out to be a short list. It's basically one item, in fact: Casti presents the whole thing as a series of court cases, with the \\"prosecution\\" presenting the case that science has seized some aspect of our place in the Universe and the \\"defence\\" claiming like a bunch of besuited reprobates that the mystery remains. Harmless enough, perhaps, but there is a lamentable tendency in today's on-line discourse to confuse science with adversarial debate and claim that \\"both sides\\" should be heard. How one can assign two \\"sides\\" to the value of the fine-structure constant or the role of feedbacks in climate is beyond me, but the trend in debate is undeniable. Casti wrote before the world of blogs and chat groups had really come into being and can't be held responsible for not foreseeing the rise of science-denial, but to those of us who are sensitised it looks a bit irresponsible in retrospect to reinforce this confusion.Otherwise, the book is a tour de force. Not taking instruction well and already being familiar with the broad sweep of the philosophy of science, I ignored Casti's advice and read the entire book from beginning to end in one, long session. That said, the book is actually arranged so that any particular chapter can be read independently of the others and the early section on what science \\"is\\" could be left out altogether. This is what Casti suggests. A single chapter would serve you well for a longish train journey.It all comes down to why are we here and what is our place? There are chapters on abiogenesis, genetic determinism, language acquisition, artificial intelligence, the presence or otherwise of alien civilisation and observer-based reality. There are very extensive appendices to each chapter, gathered at the end of the book, with copious suggestions for further reading. My backlog just got even bigger...One surprise for me was in the section on language acquisition, where I found for the first time just how influential Chomsky's ideas have been. I am familiar with his political rhetoric but had only passingly heard of his ideas of an innate grammar until now. It appears to be a more weighty and scientifically resonant idea than I ever understood, and Chomsky has in effect shaped an entire field. Odd that I would find this out just as the grip of his influence in linguistics seems finally to be weakening.The entire book is a joy to read. Demand that it be printed anew, and do so loudly."},{"Title":"Paradigms Lost","review":"Having read the other reviews of Casti's work, I'll skip the general critique and jump right in to why I felt his treatment of the creationist position was less than fair. I wish that he had written the section on How We Can Know What We Know before his discussion about The Origin Of Life On Earth, because it is from the clear-minded verdict he rendered about the current state of our inability to say, &quot;we know&quot;, that the equally clear contradiction in the verdict he rendered against the creationists is found. By pointing out the fact that science is, first and foremost, a method for acquiring knowledge, he reveals that this method is useful only in answering certain kinds of questions (i.e. questions that assume only a natural explanation for phenomena should be considered). In describing the format of a court room as his method of presenting the various cases, he reminds us of the fact that the difference between 'evidence', and 'proof' is that evidence can be open to interpretation, where as proof cannot. He then clarifies that none of the subjects he will be discussing fall into the catagory of 'proof'. But when it comes time to give his verdict on creationism, he contradicts himself by speaking emphatically about the &quot;fact of evolution&quot;, and the creationist's &quot;murdering of the facts&quot; of evolution. Creationism is a completely different interpretation of the physical evidence to be found in the study of origins, and therefore cannot be accused of any such &quot;foul play&quot; as the author suggests. To validate this point even further, Mr. Casti did an excellent job of pointing out the fact that there is definitely an epistimological difference in the approach of 'origins science' as opposed to 'operations science', and he even goes so far as to rightly claim that origins science isn't really science in the true, classical sense of the term. Thus, the only proper verdict that should have been rendered in the case of the creationists is that their brand of investigation hypothesizes a supernatural origin, and a historical interaction with world-changing events (such as the Flood of Noah) as recorded in Scripture, and interprets the physical evidence accordingly, which is completely legitimate, as no one can yet say that such interpretation defies reason (it goes beyond it, but not against it), or that the origin of life had to of occured through natural processes, which must be proven first if evolution is to be categorized as &quot;fact&quot;. The book is a great read nonetheless, and I found no argument with any other aspect, or conclusion of the author."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Another wonderful book from Le Guin. My only advice is don't give up on it too early. The book is a bit hard to follow at first because it takes place in two separate time lines that interchange from one chapter to the next (which is a great little technique, since the main character is a physicist studying the nature of time and space).Once you reach the end, it all makes sense....and if you read it carefully, it will almost certainly lead you to ask some serious questions about whether our society makes very much sense. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Le Guin's &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; deserves the accolades it has received. It is a tremendous example of soft sci-fi, with little high-tech wizardry (though this book does contain the oldest reference to an instantaneous-communication ansible I have encountered), but deep character developement and social commentary.Unfortunately, I just could not find either of her hypothetical societies believable. The capitalistic Urras seemed to be a mix of 21st century technology and 18th century ethics. Though at face value, Urras appears to be a scathing condemnation of capitalism, a deeper look shows the problems on Urras result less from its free markets than from its totalitarian government and rampant &quot;isms&quot;. Likewise, the anarchistic, communist utopia on the moon Anarres also did not ring true. Le Guin simply did not convince me that the inherent conflicts of anarchy and communism could be resolved. People on Anarres did not shirk duties or commit crimes, even though they did not have self-interest (ala capitalism) or the threat of force (ala totalitarianism) to bring them in to line. Le Guin seems to explain this by proper education, social pressure, and child-rearing, which I couldn't swallow. I did enjoy her pointed commentary on the tyranny of the majority (even absent the rule of law), and of the oppression of the individual by social pressure for conformity.Overall, this rates as a sci-fi classic - even though it barely qualifies as sci-fi at all. Le Guin's best work."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Two inhabited worlds, each with a claim at being a perfect utopia: Urras is a wealthy planet, full of haves and have-nots, warring nations and vast resources and Anarres is its almost barren moon. Anarres is populated by anarchist rebels who fled Urras generations ago to try to create a perfect society where everything is shared.This is the story of a brilliant physicist, Shevek, born on Anarres. He grows up with the political ideals of his society, but it seems as if his own culture and people have no use for his theories of physics. His academic adviser proves to be corrupt and plagiarizes his work. Eventually he loses his academic post, and is sent to toil at physical labor far from his family. Eventually he and a group of childhood friends start their own publishing company and begin corresponding with scientists on Urras.This arouses strong feelings. Shevek's own mother accuses him of betraying his society. Eventually he decides he must risk everything to go to Urras. Only there will he find the resources and the time to complete his great labor of physics. So he goes, not knowing if he will ever be able to return. But once he is there he discovers that he can not let the secrets of his work fall into the hands of those who would use them only to gain more wealth and power over the poor and oppressed.How does a man chose between the ideals of his heart and his life's work?This is a work of classic science fiction, where ideas clash instead of spaceships blowing each other up. Real philosophical questions are posed. Instead of good versus evil, LeGuin has poised a question of good versus good. This book is only for the thoughtful. The richness of its meaning will sink in deeper with every reading. Not for stupid people, but worthy of the highest recommendation all the same."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is one of LeGuin's great thought experiments. It is interestingto compare it to her later, more tribalist, _Always Coming Home_.This is a smart book. It's full of ideas and speculation. It may not always succeed in its aims-- I for one found the sexism in her 'egalitarian' Annares irritating-- but it's a grand work of imaginary anthropology. She tries to lay bare for us the workings of two societies, the anarcho-syndicalist Annares and its capitalist home world.Whatever its problems, the fact of LeGuin's having attempted something that no one had ever done in Science Fiction before makes this worth looking at."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Read on, I'll get to the book...all this initial background is essential to my review.Don't listen to what others claim I believe, I'll tell you what I believe.As an avowed anarchist, I am appalled by mainstream perceptions of Anarchism. Most people confuse Anarchism with Nihlism (nothing matters, so take what you can--rape and plunder). When I insist that political Anarchism is actually quite the opposite--in fact it aims at creating an egalitarian, ultra-democratic, socialist society--most people can't or won't understand. I even had a professor of history at the U. of Barcelona who laughed about Anarchists during the Spanish Civil war as \\"People who don't believe in anything trying to have a political philosophy\\" (revealing himself absolutely unqualified to teach).Of course all these misconceptions are carefully nurtured by the prevailing orthodoxy (similar to intentional mainstream mirepresentations about Socialism) because the true philosophy, if understood correctly in the mainstream, might (I believe WOULD) attract mass support and thus become a real threat to the power elite. Such mass support has happened many times in the past, and governments have learned to carefully control how ideas are presented in the mainstream (Orwellian Newspeak). All governments hate Anarchism above even Communism and Socialism, because we want to do away with all institutional power, unequal wealth, and arbitrary privilege--starting with theirs.The truth is, Anarchism is simply the belief that all arbitrary power by one individual or group over another inevitably leads to abuse of that power. Political Anarchism attempts to find ways of organizing society that avoid such arbitrary power (in business, governments, families, and all human associations). This normally involves communal decision making, collective property ownership, and grass roots democracy in pure form.After explaining this to the person questioning me and getting a blank stare in return, if I deem them genuinely interested (as opposed to only feigning interest as justification for thier attempt to debunk Anarchism and teach me how foolish I am) I refer them to \\"The Dispossessed\\", by Ursula Le Guin.\\"The Dispossessed\\" is, as far as I know, the most eloquent and nuanced study ever put into print of how a true Anarchist society MIGHT look (not the only form such a society might take though). LeGuin illustrates the thinking, education, advantages, disadvantages, development, and pitfalls inherent in Anarchism, and contrasts it with totalitarian Communism and of course with our \\"holy Capitalism.\\"It's also a great sci-fi work, in the tradition of Asimov, Bradbury, or Heinlein. By that I mean sci-fi for thinking people, not action fanatics.This book will bore cartoonish sci-fi fans, generate confusion and rage in Republicans, Libertarians, and other reactionary proto-Fascists, cause nausea in rightious hipoChristians, baffle adolescent minds of all stripes, and provoke argument from Communists. But for true intellectuals it will never fail to generate personal epiphanies--even if you don't \\"agree\\" with anarchism. Also, for the capitalist power elite who want to better understand their enemies, this could be useful. Fortunately, most of the power elite believe their own propaganda (Orwellian Doublethink)--and so would find this book baffling and blasphemous.Le Guin is a brilliant intellectual, not to mention a fantastic author. Few fiction writers match her nuanced thinking, multi-faceted characters, and social insight. The Dispossessed showcases these qualities in the best way. Obviously I'm biased toward this particular book because of the subject matter, but other of her works also demonstrate her amazing mind and writing talent.Want to understand the essential underlying issues in all politics and history? A good place to start your education would be to read this book. Want sci-fi that actually explores the implications of a truly alien society? This book is also for you.This book is about the struggle for freedom.

It's interesting and inspiring, and only \\"science fiction\\" because it's set on another world."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There are so many reviews of this book I wondered whether to contribute to this \\"discussion\\".I think I have something to add.Le Guin deserves to be given credit for imagining an ideal society and acknowledging that like any other society it has it's flaws.I suspect that this society will only appeal to radical egalitarians.Anarres strikes me as being a dour,puritanical and overly utilitarian place.It's very conformist and beneath the surface there is a current of ugly authoritarianism that seems ready to break out into murderous violence with a little provacation.It's this that would likely be the death of the society.It stuck me at a certain point that Anarres biggest problem is it's priggish insistence on trying to supress any division of labor.Shevek is the universes greatest physicist.However he can't devote himself to that exclusively because he has to dig ditches and clean latrines periodically.I'm not suggesting that Shevek is too good for manual labor.I'm suggesting it's a waste of time and resources.At one point,shevek reflects on the concept of economics and is utterly dissmisive.Foolish man!At its most basic level economics is an analysis of scarcity.You'd think on a planet noted for its scarcity this would be of some interest.Unfortunately the Anarreans and Ursula LeGuin think economics is essentially an aspect of the false conciousness of capitalism.Anarres is probably doomed by its own inflexability.It will probably degenerate into Maoism if it doesn't open itself up to capitalism.I kept thinking what would be wrong with Shevek working in a think tank?a university?a private corporation? Well he can't do that because those aren't allowed.The paradox here is that \\"freedom\\" has diminished not increased choice.You might get the impression I don\\"t like this book.On the contary,any book that makes think this much is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is an excellent novel of ideas. Leguin portrays a nearly stateless society based on small groups of communes inhabiting a arid planet. The residents are exiles from a capitalistic planet, and Leguin uses the capitalist planet as a foil for her utopia. The novel was written in the early 70s when there were still hundreds, maybe thousands of active communes across America and the book is a speculation about how these social ideas might play out if used on a large scale society. The subtitle is 'an ambiguous utopia', Leguin tries to be realistic about the problems that human nature presents to such a society. My only criticism of this novel is that the pace is a bit slow at times, following the life history of the main protagonist sometimes in too much detail."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is not a review of the content of the book, but the text itself, specifically the Kindle edition.

It also tells the tale of a naive and brainy rocket scientist named Shevek whose genius is stifled by being stuck on a barely habitable moon. This book is great as pure fiction, the social commentary just makes it even better. Definitely the best &quot;utopian&quot; novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"We have the planet Urras with a single large moon called Arrakis. Urras is very like Earth; the main difference is that their moon is (marginally) habitable. Having discovered this early on, the Urrans became capable of space travel much earlier in their political-social development than we did on Earth.Just as they develop the ability to explore and exploit their moon, there arises an anarcosocialistic philosopher called Odo. Her followers become troublesome, and are invited to remove to Arrakis to build a utopian society on their own.Now, LeGuin is no Marxist herself; having been raised in \\"the People's Republic of Berkely\\" (her parents were professors at UC/B; her father was a famous anthropologist, although I don't remember her mother's field), she was aware of and sympathetic to Marxist theory and ideas. However, like any halfway aware person, she knew what happened in Russia, China, etc. when these countries attempted to set up Marxist societies.\\"Ah!\\" say a defender of Communist theory,\\"That is because not everyone in a country is equally committed to realizing the ideal. Many don't understand it; many oppose it. That is why these attempts have failed.\\" Please remember that most Communists are, at least, at first, well-meaning reformers; most really want to make the world a better place, even if they become corrupted once they get into power. Lenin and Trotsky really wanted to make Russia a better place, and Mao firmly belived (at least at first) that Communism would make China great; Stalin was another kettle of fish entirely, or course.LeGuin responds, \\"OK, let's have a group of colonists, all True Believers, go off and try to establish a this Utopia on their own, where the 'dead hand' of the old ways won't effect them.\\" The novel is a result of this thought-experiment; she could as easily have chosen Plato's Republic, except that nobody has seriously tried to establish a Platonic state, and several people have tried to establish Marxist ones.These events happened about 200 years before the start of the book. On Urras, we have various nation-states dominated by two powers which have a strong similarity to the United States and the late, unlamented Soviet Union. On Arrakis, the descendants of the Odoites maintain their ideological experiment. And it works, more or less. But at what a price! Individualism is repressed not by government--as there is none per se--but by social pressure to conform. Originality and excellence are frowned upon, for they lead to inequality and thus inequity. Stifled by this dull, grey, conformist society, a brilliant young Arraki physicist defects to Urras, the first Arraki in 200 years to do so.Of course, Urras is no better. All the excesses of Western Capitalism are seen in the one major country, while all the evils of Soviet Communism are seen in the other--all exaggerated to be sure that the reader does not miss the point. Due to there being no Democratic Socialists in the Capitalist country, the government has not been moved to construct even a minimal 'safety net', and the Communist country (for similar reasons) is more brutal than the Soviet Union or Red China were even in the worst Stalinist/Maoist stages. The exile of the Odoists was seen at the time to be a preventive of revolution, but Urras lost something important when they left.Although LeGuin is sympathetic to the ideals of Arrakis, she knows human nature too well not to know that the Utopian society there can't work without repressing significant aspects of that nature, but rather than telling us this she shows us how this repression can't be kept up, and how the Odoist experament can't be kept up much longer.I did not give this more than three stars as, while the ideas were interesting, it takes more than interesting ideas to make a good novel. The plot is merely a hook upon which to hang the ideas, and none of the characters are very memorable."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I don't think le guin was advocating this &quot;utopia&quot;.

The odonians have what they believe to be the best part of the exile, forbidding all but the barest contact with the societies of the old planet from fear of corrupting their perfect freedom of their perfect philosophy they have enjoyed for almost two hundred years.The odonians are anarchists. Communists if you like, they seem to me to be an idealized versions of Maoists. They live a painfully tedious life with little or no comfort, little food, in shacks with no running water and communal baths. They eat in what are really mess halls, but might be charitably called dining commons. They are perfect, without any flaws of self-worth or self-aggrandizement. Their planet is a desert, inhabited by nothing higher than fishes and worms and some hardy plants. They power themselves through their daily drudgery without the use of egos, or desires, or loves, or anything that might detract from their perfect ant-like existence. There is a hero. Shevek. Shevek is a physicist, a genius on the scale of Einstein. His marginally anti-social father loved and raised him after mom, the perfect anarchistic feminist, left them to pursue her owns goals. That is perfectly normal for odonians. The father's love, even attention, is anti-social, verging on the obscene and definitely \\"egoist.\\" Egoist is not exactly explained. But if you think what you do is of some value, if you think you are of some value, an artist or a scientist or even a person, or think your own children special to you, then you are an egoist. That's a bad thing to be.Shevek is good with numbers, as his dad is. He quickly becomes familiar with the narrow-mindedness of his society. As a natural theoretical thinker, he is thrown out of one math class as an undesirable, an egoist. He should just learn the problems his teacher assigns, not work at understanding them or what they imply. Who does he think he is?Shevek is shunned by odonians as somehow unclean, somehow possessing a uniqueness. A uniqueness that most people raised in Western society would treasure, but to odonians is a distasteful throwback to the archist societies. But he is not perturbed nor dissuaded. The odd part is that he is a loyal and deeply committed odonian. He once says, \\"You cannot buy the Revolution. You cannot make the Revolution. You can only be the Revolution. It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere.\\" Shevek is the Revolution. He is as true to his beliefs as he only can be in this work of fiction. Shevek perseveres with his math even while living a plodding life of hard labor, volunteering for more hard labor when he is not assigned to it. Obviously brilliant, he has few friends, mostly quiet admirers of his uniqueness. He is the living embodiment of the contradictions of humans living under odonianism. He is a self-abasing tireless worker ant, willing to do any base or menial task for the good of the community, all the while developing a theory that takes over where Einstein's life work left off! A difficult juxtaposition for sure. He succeeds in this story.Le Guin's language skills are evident. She is no mean hack for sure. Well written scenes and dialogue abound. I found myself rereading some portions of the text, not because they were poorly written, but because they were so naturally crafted. Shevek and other characters are consistent and more believable than most authors could have made them. In spite of the negatives of the story, within its fabric you will find a story of a man in conflict with his society, rent by the disparate desires of his humanity in a society attempting to snuff out all traces of that humanity. A society that commands his philosophical, nay, religeous loyalty.This book has a few negatives. The first is sequencing. It is as if Le Guin wrote the whole story out and then cut it into nine or ten sections and shuffled them. Transitions are rough, you are dumped from one to the next in such a way as you don't know when you are in the story. It is not unlike some movies that jump back and forth from flashbacks and reality to confuse you and make the story more nightmarish. The entirety of the story really does not fall into place until you are near the end of the book. Considering Le Guin's skills, this seems a very arbitrary fault. I would easily believe some editor thought this would increase the drama of the story and chopped up the completed novel.The second is the transparent impossibility of the odonian idea. If you build a bridge across a chasm, and then remove its supports, it will collapse into the chasm. Similarly, any group of people so narrow minded and doctrinaire, whose lives had no meaning other than just breathing and eating as these people are presented, would have literally died out when first deposited on this barren world, long before they build a functioning society. They have no humanity, no reason to exist. They are so pettily committed to odonism, self-effacing and self-sacrificing that they are mindless. Without even a mind, their blind little existences would have collapsed under the hardships manifested in the story. Of course, everyone who is even the smallest bureaucrat or busy body neighbor is an egoist, a closet capitalist if you will. The hypocrisy is everywhere evident as such a society cannot possibly exist, and so Le Guin must insert real people.Last, the dreariness of the odonians lives and world. What an unbearably gray existence! If they had survived the first twenty years to create this society, then thousands would just have laid down and died, rendered hopeless by their exile in Hell. Except for the egoists, who are doing okay living off the backs of the worker ants.In the end, the story demands a suspension of reality greater than any SciFi I have ever read, but was more engrossing than not, worth a read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It's one of my favorites. As others've said, it's a book you can return to again and again.It's the best -- most literate -- utopian novel ever written. Most utopian novels try to blend a good enough story with the ideas they want to tell. The Dispossessed is unique for having both story and ideas, without making either suffer. It's also great for trying to realisticly describe what it might be like to live in a utopian society -- good for making the point that even in a utopian society, there's still the pain of being human, of suffering for love and loneliness, of finding one's purpose in life and society, etc. Also that even a utopian society is an ambiguous one and that it's going to have its problems with corruption and rigidity, of idealists being criticized by society, etc.Interesting note: saw a recent paperback edition of The Dispossessed whose back cover blurb described the book as something like &quot;From the anarchist moon of Anarres Shevek travels to the utopian world of Urras to try to dispel the bonds of hate and ignorance that keep the 2 worlds apart.&quot; Interesting how which world as being the most utopian has changed -- publisher's mistake, or the publisher deliberately trying to appeal to more '90s tastes?"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It is easy for an anti-materialistic, anti-government utopia to exist when you set it up as darn near impossible to be materialistic due to the ecological scarcity of the planet. This makes it imperative for society to create ethics of no extraneous possessions, of hard work and sharing. And the attendent problem of coersion through peer pressure. As I said, it gives you lots of food for thought, totally fulfilling its mission."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"i regard this as one of my favourites ever. a thoughtful and enjoyable plot filled with conflicts between the reflective scientist shevek, and the social functions of surroundings. the *fantastic* social analysis on top of that makes it deserve more than five stars, imo.this book really opened up my eyes for the ideas of anarchism and syndicalism, and ultimately led to the point at which i engaged myself in this movement."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This may be LeGuin's best novel, despite its slow, ruminative pace. It's a thinking person's adventure, filled with ideas and so eminently quotable that it can spark discussion. Shevek is searching for answers, just like the pioneers who founded his ascetic, open society on the arid world to which they exiled themselves decades ago and from which they banished the concepts of private property and privacy. Are they on the right path? Do they really have a future? His search takes him back to the neighboring home planet of Urras, a wealthy, materialistic society corrupted and possessed by the desire for power, whose vulgar, neurotic inhabitants &quot;lived among mountains of excrement, but never mentioned shit.&quot; Their decadence helps explain and balances the anarchistic social extremes of Shevek's world, which were developed partly in reaction. The story loses power at the end, when the corruption of Urrasti society manifests itself in cliched violence, but thoughtful readers will find the novel very rewarding."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"A case can be made for Mrs Le Guin being seen to be the most important woman writer in English in the second half of the Twentieth Century. A review I read here which compared her to Ayn Rand is not only to insult her intelligence and wit, but to demean her style.I admit to a personal interest in Mrs le Guin's Speculative Fantasist (SF) vision, since I am myself an Anarchist. Indeed, I had never seen the sub-title &quot;An Ambiguous Utopia&quot; until I read this page. I do not think that the book fits into the &quot;Utopia/Dystopia&quot; tradition, but then, le Guin may be taking the Mickey out of us as she so often does.There is no other book, fictional or otherwise of which I am aware (with the possible exception of Orwell's &quot;Homage to Catelonia&quot;) that so clearly demonstrates the practicality of Anarchism as a political philosophy. Indeed, I have lost count of the number of copies of the book that I have given away for this reason alone."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I was reading a library-bound first edition of The Dispossessed, then I bought the Kindle edition.Oh dear, what edition was used to make the Kindle version? I find in the second half of Chapter 9, jumping in mid-chapter, two errors in the Kindle version that are not present in the first edition. It's hard to believe these were scanning errors; there's one case of the non-word \\"princple\\" instead of \\"principle\\" (page 300 location 4212) and a case where the word \\"where\\" is used instead of \\"were\\".I find that disconcerting, and it makes me wonder whether I'm reading an authoritative edition. It makes me wonder how Kindle editions are made. One wouldn't guess that a book published in 1974 would have fewer errors than its derivative Kindle version. It makes me nervous about the quality of Kindle text in general.Your thoughts on this?"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is one of my favorite books, but I regret buying the Kindle edition. It's obvious that to prepare this edition Harper Collins ran the book through a cheap OCR and then didn't spend much effort copy-editing the results. Just to take some examples from the first few pages of Chapter 2, the protagonist as a child is described as \\"a lanky eighty-year-old\\"; the correct text would read \\"eight-year-old.\\" Later a character is described as taking \\"a decade at the beach\\"; this should be \\"decad,\\" which is a word used in the setting to indicate a span of ten days.You should read this book, but not this edition."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"My review seeks to add nothing to the positive evaluations that other readers have already offered. This story is simply excellent. I only want to point out for anyone thinking of buying the Harper Perennial Classics edition that the text is riddled with very annoying typos. For example, I was seriously confused when I read a scene about the protagonist, Shevek, when he was a child, and the text said he was EIGHTY-years-old. Since I was unfamiliar with the story, and since just about anything goes in science fiction, I thought that Le Guin had created a society in which eighty-year-old people were still somehow childlike. It took me a few minutes to figure out that this was not a part of the plot, but one of many simple typos (Shevek was eight, not eighty). Perhaps these typos are in all editions, but it's something to consider."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It's been many years since I picked up this book, but it has a grip on my imagination that would allow me to pick it up today, open it anywhere, and read it with enjoyment.The structure of this book puzzled me at first: Shevek's story is told in chapters alternating between his journey to Arras and his ealier life on Anarres. I soon realized that the structure mirrored the theories in temporal physics (the physics of time) that Shevek is struggling with: Simultaneity and Synchronicity. As the greatest physicist of both of his worlds, and possibly of the Ekumen (Le Guin's universe that includes the world of The Left Hand of Darkness), Shevek grapples with both the content and the practical result of his work.Shevek remains one of the most ethical and humane characters I've ever encountered. If I could give this book 10 stars, I would."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"One of the best books I have read, especially in the Sci-Fi category. The contrasting worlds of capitalism and anarchy are philosophically expressed in this book, and are very eye opening. It is easy to fall prey to the societal view and images of what life would be like if we all lived in an anarchistic world, but this book helps to paint a clearer picture of what that reality might actually be like. The author, essentially gives us a ladder to climb over the wall of our own ingnorance, and see through the eyes of the characters a very different world and way of life."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It's long been known that since the advent of science fiction, man kind's greatest inventions were foretold in books and stories. In recent decades the focus of this genre has shifted from technology to sociology and psychology. This book, though published more than 30 years ago, is a prime example of how relevant this kind of writing is to our lives today. Even more importantly, with corporation-led globalization, and the protest and antagonism that it breeds, the lessons of this book are becoming more important by the day. The boundary between Utopia and Distopia is never clear (especially in LeGuin's writings), and this story serves to emphasize the differences between a couple of tracks we as a race may choose to follow. Never unbiased, LeGuin takes a strong moral stand, and brings some convincing arguments toward her case. Still, this is a very enjoyable read, but take care- it will make you think more than you might want to."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is one of the best and most thought-provoking books I have read in ages. While it is a sci-fi novel about two sister planets, one ruled by an advanced version of our own society and the other a planet of anarchists, the book reads more like philosophy than anything else. Don't let that scare you, though. The story was excellent.The planet of Anerres is a dry, dusty, arid planet and was unpopulated until citizens of Urras came to mine it for resources such as gold and lead. While this was happening, another citizen of the planet of Urras, Odo, began to write and speak out about the virtues of a society where no one owns anything and power is non-existant. The movement her teachings sparked became so prominent and threatening to the governments on Urras that they bought them off with Anerres. The miners and other workers on the dry planet were brought home, and the Odonians (as they came to be known) were sent to establish a new society of their own, free from government, bosses, money, and class. The Dispossessed tells the story of a physicist named Shevek that lived one hundered and seventy-five years after that society began.The story itself seemed to take a backseat to the ideas that run rampant throughout the text of this book. Thoughts about how a society based on anarchism would and would not work, as well as ideas that made you really take a look at the world around us pervaded each paragraph.It's difficult to write about this book because there was simply so much going on that I find it hard to focus on any one thing. Last night, after I finished the last few words, I set the book down and immediately thought: \\"I'm going to have to read this again soon.\\" There was so much depth to the world and ideas conveyed that I honestly believe a single reading isn't enough to absorb it all.Keep in mind (I can't stress this enough), this is not your average read and then put-on-the-shelf-and-never-think-about-again sci-fi novel. It was a true piece of literature, and I had a hard time (at first) believing that it was written by the same woman that wrote A Wizard of Earthsea. Not that there is anything wrong with A Wizard..., mind, I just wasn't expecting such an adult book.So, I have to say, I loved it and plan on reading it again soon."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"\\"To break a promise is to deny the reality of the past; therefore it is to deny the hope of a real future.\\" -- one of the more pertinent observations made in this outstanding book, one I found myself thinking about more than any other after reading it. Otherwise \\"The Dispossessed\\" is, among other things, an exploration of utopias, political systems and the politics of utopias. As usual Le Guin wraps all of these otherwise tiresome sounding political/philosophical themes into a very engaging SF story, with outstanding characters and a generally plausible storyline. It also falls among Le Guin's many books that subtly dissect humankind's rather high opinion of itself. . ."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book made a profound impression on me when I first read it 20 years ago, and still is one of my favourites of all times. It is filled with philosophical concepts that make us think again about how we view the world around us.Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a brilliant work that contrasts two competing world-views in late-20th/early-21st century Earth. Neither is explored through rose-tinted glasses. Shevek, an anarcho-syndicalist from the Moon, comes to believe that the only way to save his society of free anarchists from descending into a Soviet-style authoritarian culture, is to re-initiate cultural exchange with the rich and diverse home world, Urras. Because he has developed the equations that will enable faster-than-light communication across interstellar distances, the propertarian cultures of Urras invite him to visit. He eventually becomes involved in the labor movement of Urras, and, with the help of the Terran ambassador, gives his equations to all of humanity rather than a single nation. Unlike most plot-driven science fiction, Le Guin writes in a human-centered style that uses fictional worlds as a backdrop. An outstanding book."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I recommend this to everybody who ever shared or liked any meme related to the Occupy movement in the last year. At the heart of Occupy were anarchist ideas which begin at anti-statism. Most don't give much thought to how the nation-state developed. It's like water out of the faucet. Nobody did anything to get it there, you were born and it was just there. Le Guin shows one particular vision in how a society would function without the state. It would have its problems, and in fact some of those problems wouldn't be that different from the ones we have within state/capitalistic society. But the inequalities would be less severe and overall quality of life and freedom would be greater. Who knows if this is realistic enough, but as we can see from Occupy Sandy, Rolling Jubillee and #strikedebt, \\"the people\\" are pretty into what a lot of anarchists are doing these days. There is nothing preachy in this novel and nothing overly intellectual that might confuse or condescend to you, also a plus."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"One of the most overtly political science fiction novels - and one certainly deserving of the term \\"speculative fiction\\" - ever published, \\"The Dispossessed\\" remains Ursula K. Le Guin's literary masterpiece. It chronicles the journey of \\"post-relativistic\\" physicist Shevek from his home world of Arras to the planet Urras, seeking the answer to the puzzle that has eluded him, and one that will allow him to develop the ansible, the faster-than-light means of communication, that will bind humanity and other, closely related, sapient beings into a interstellar commonwealth known as the \\"Ekumen\\"; the setting for many of Ursula Le Guin's anthropological science fiction novels, of which \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" and \\"The Dispossessed\\" remain the best known examples, though the latter is set in a time prior to the Ekumen's founding. (In Le Guin's \\"Ekumen\\" series of novels and short fiction, humans and others are descendants of early interstellar colonization by the natives of Hain.) Hers is a political science fiction novel in the sense that it compares and contrasts the vibrant, politically Byzantine-like world of Urras, orbiting the star Tau Ceti, eleven light years from Earth, with the anarchist utopia on the barren, desert world of Arras. Originally a \\"Botany Bay\\"-like penal colony, settled by dissidents from Urras centuries before Shevek's birth; Arras is a world close to Urras, as an orbiting moon of the much larger planet, and yet, one that is distant too, since Shevek is the first Arras native to visit Urras in nearly two centuries. Le Guin offers readers a captivatingly poignant portrait of Shevek as he contends with the almost polyglot nature of Urras' governments, which are predominantly capitalist in orientation, rejecting the notion of \\"fairness\\" that is prevalent on Arras; a world where there are no laws that govern the behavior of its human residents. While Le Guin describes the vast inequities that exist still on Urras, she also emphasizes the importance of personal liberty, and by referring to both Arras and Urras as though they are the polar opposites, the \\"Yin and Yang \\", of human political behavior she does imply that both are of equal importance, especially with regards to Shevek's quest toward developing the ansible. As a novel of both ideas and a riveting, insightful, character study of Shevek, blessed with Le Guin's elegant, often poetic, prose, \\"The Dispossessed\\" is a science fiction novel that has earned deservedly, ample critical and popular acclaim from those otherwise unfamiliar with the genres of fantasy and science fiction. Without a doubt, \\"The Dispossessed\\" is not only a great work of 20th Century Anglo-American speculative fiction, but one that should be viewed as among the most important novels ever published in the latter half of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It's a good book. I love books that take you to different planets--in this case, it takes you to two, since the Cetians are not from Earth. Urras is a world similar to ours in both class systems and economy. Anarres is socialism in action, with no monetary system. It was really, really neat to read it and see a different way of doing things. It might be science fiction, but it's mostly an exploration of society, and while reading it, you're really not certain which way is the better way to live, even though le Guin does try to portray Anarres as the more \\"ideal\\" world, the planet that is much, much different than our current function here in the U.S. and in the world."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Slow-starting, as others have said, but the writing drew me in, which was a good thing, because much of the background detail was not provided until deep into the story. Indeed, some rather crucial details did not appear until near the end.Shevek's twin worlds are not appealing: his native planet is as socially stratified as any communist state and just as poor, while his ancestral planet is a gender-segregated hidebound capitalism that quells mass protest with helicopter gunships.Shevek's attempt to reunite the two worlds, however unlikely, makes reading about them bearable, even compelling. This is the first Le Guin novel I've read, but if they're all this good, I will try more."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I originally purchased this book in 1978 during a trip through Australia. The landscape of Anterres and that of Australia melded very well. It was easy to escape into the story of a man battling with the need to express himself and his ideas against the needs of the community--as well as the idea of ownership and communal property.Since the original reading I have returned to reread the story about every five years. Each time I find a new nuisance. This year I was amazed by the small physics description of how when you throw an object, theoretically, it could never hit another object as it is always between two points in the arc--the length of space between always having a halfway point.Read the book.Think about the fact you may never reach the end of your travel because you'll always be a the half-way point!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The Dispossessed is the best book I have read so far and I think Le Guin is the best writer of the ages.When I was at the last quarter of the book; I didn't want to read it any more.

The book, I have read was also a gift from one of my good friends. I am sure most of you read this book before; but can you think any better present for your friends???

For a long while I have been telling everyone my favorite author is Ursula LeGuin. I read all her stuff when I was a teenager and now, 20 years on, have re-read much of it (Left Hand, Rocannon, Planet of Exile, Lathe of Heaven) and enjoyed it enormously again. But for some reason I had never read The Dispossessed until last week. Having read the reviews on this page, I was looking forward to it very keenly.However, I found the book tedious and very disappointing. If it hadn't been written 5 years *after* Left Hand of Darkness it might be seen as a rehearsal for that much better book. But where Left Hand of Darkness is lean and exciting, The Dispossessed is full of boring backstory. Left Hand starts with a parade in Ehrenrang, where we meet the key players whose intrigue will absorb us for the next 300 odd pages - and then we're running. It's an opening sequence Burgess would have been proud of. Dispossessed starts off slow, and then is constantly bogged down by its non linear format: interspersing current events on Urras with Shevek's backstory on his home moon of Anarres. No doubt this parallel telling of the moons' stories is necessary for getting across the concept of &quot;simultaneity&quot; which is Shevek's life's work. The bigger problem is that there is nothing much happening on *either* moon, until Shevek's climactic entry into Annarian politics in the latter part of the book. And that is not a great payoff either, I'm afraid.In all the navel gazing and study of Le Guin's work, people tend to forget that she started off as a great storyteller. The Dispossessed is perhaps where it began to come off the rails.The book is certainly NOT a good introduction to people who haven't read any LeGuin. I would advise them to read Left Hand of Darkness or Lathe Of Heaven. If you don't mind a little science in your SF, Rocannon's World is also great, and in fact science-phobics can read this latter book as a &quot;swords and sorcery&quot; yarn, with a couple of spaceships and a radio (OK, an &quot;ansible&quot;) thrown in.Anyway, on balance, UKLG still rules. So I'll raise to 2*"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I read with great enjoyment her \\"Left Hand of Darkness,\\" and had high hopes for more of the same. While both build slowly, \\"The Dispossessed\\" was teeth-grindingly slow and after half the book I gave up on it ever going anywhere. The protagonist is dull and somewhat unpleasant, and if the hero is going to have those kind of flaws he or she'd better be doing some pretty interesting stuff. Well, he is, sort of. He is trying to bring together the Lunar people and their Earth kin, or the Soviets and the west, or the environmentalists and the capitalists, or some such metaphorical split. Mostly the communists and the capitalists, and one is reminded how defining the cold war was to that era. How quickly we forget. However most of the action takes place in his head, in his own bare and spartan thoughts, and the heroic nature of his \\"betrayal\\" of his country in the interest of unity and truth is never really conveyed to the reader on any kind of emotional level.The writing itself is splendid, the Sci Fi is only a context, but if you've read her stuff you know what you're getting into there, but again there is no action, no real tension, at least not in the first half. It may turn out great, I'll probably finish it eventually, but the author shouldn't demand of the reader that they endure 200 pages of prose just on the hope that it might get better later."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Le Guin is known for rich detailed background. That's what I found, except the societies in this novel are so ... blah.It all comes across as too symbolic; sci-fi as moral template of current politics. Like Rand-lite for geeks. Oh, she dives into the nuts and bolts of each world. Yet there's no passion. No intrigue. It's all laid out like a thesis, when it should be more of a fiery sermon.I only made it halfway through this novel, until I simply avoided opening it again.

The storyline is difficult to decribe here, so I just advise you all to read this book and be enlightened, for it is truly brilliant."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Le Guin, anthropologist-turned-sci/fi author, writes about aninteresting anarchic society, failing only to realize thatdecentralization is key to stability for any utopia. (Otherwise, anysuch society can be conquered at its central control point[s]."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"First off, if you're looking for action, this book is not for you. The Dispossessed is very much a novel of ideas, esp. those current in 1974, and these are expressed mainly through complex characters, and secondly, through thinly-disguised analogies to geopolitical states and ideologies on our planet (which itself makes a late, crucial appearance as \\"Terra\\"). But for a book written as the Cold War was still chugging along, the grand opposition between the capitalist US (aka A-Io) and the communist USSR (Thu) is, interestingly, quite back-burnered by LeGuin herein. Most subsequent histories of the New Left, whether sympathetic to that movement or not, assume that it was primarily socialist in spirit, but LeGuin shrewdly estimates its vaguely defined ideology to have been anarchist in character. At least in the US context, she's pretty dead-on with that assessment (and if you aren't willing to acknowledge that there's a big difference between the two, you're probably not going to like this book anyway). Furthermore, rather than writing a paean to presumed anarchist wisdom, LeGuin subjects her \\"ambiguous utopia\\" of Annares (which is her stand-in for that ideology as \\"organized\\" in [non]state form) to penetrating but fair criticisms, from a perspective that Orwell would have deemed \\"inside the whale.\\" In this respect, her book thus reflects the profound disillusionment felt among the immediate post-Vietnam American Left at the time she wrote. The book's social commentary is weakest, I think, with regard to its feminist themes: women are treated unbelievably badly in A-Io's society, far more so than any reasonably objective assessment of their standing in analogous post1950s America could claim. It is also an interesting lapse, in light of the time it was written, that racial themes play no role whatsoever in the book, even though gendered ones do, not just vis-a-vis feminism but in a handful of apparently gay characters as well. In any case, The Dispossessed can be read productively alongside Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) as period-piece bookends that together represent mutually reinforcing skeptical (some might say cynical) attitudes toward the 60s counterculture. (Heinlein's, however, is the superior and more durable novel of the two, at least in my opinion.)"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is possibly one of the most hypocritical chunks of literature I have ever been forced to read. There is nothing here to praise except an unlikeable, dull, and whiney man who is truly not as impressive as he is made out to be. The author tried so hard to create a utopian world where things were supposed to be so efficient as compared to the motherworld that she wants the reader to look past the fact that she gives Shevek everything he is not supposed to want or need. The whole story winds up based around a nuclear family and personal ambition, the very things that she tried so hard to make her readers see past as a cultural need. Also, if I wanted to read anthropological theory in massive chunks, I would go to my bookshelf and pull down one of my many anthro text books."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I love Ursula K. Le Guin. I count her as one of three writers I aspire to. She has a fascinating grip on anthropology and sociology and using the forum of science fiction creates complex worlds as far as social class, politics, ecology, culture, and human spirit. She is not a practical or \\"hard\\" scientist and it is very evident by this book. She has created a character who realized the Unified Field Theory, the holy grail of physics of today. But since this would require either her or the general audience to understand basic relative physics, she tries her best to talk around the science and more about the spirit of science and discovery. As much as I love her writing, and there are beautiful passages in every chapter, (My favorite is towards the end, the main character is in a garden on-board a spaceship and a flower has just blossomed during the night-time setting of the lights and the character thinks \\"The sunlights differ but there is only one darkness.\\") something like the \\"unified field theory\\" demands some science in it, Asimov would have had a fit that she skirted talking about physics, but this is Ursula's book not Isaac's. Overall it was satisfying, but satisfaction came at the end. To get there you have to traverse two stories of the main character's life, Shevek, One of him being born on a anarchist/commune culture that manages life on a desolate moon. The other is being from this commune culture and being placed into another culture based on capitalism and authoritarianism. It is interesting to note as I was reading this there were parallels to the happenings in Egypt. The clashes between authority and anarchy, which Le Guin does not give its common bad light, but actually akin it to libertarianism. But no one system of governance (or lack of) is regarded as better than the other they are just difference in culture. If I had any criticism it would be the structure seemed to beholden to linear structure, in that the book is designed to corresponded chapter by chapter to events of Shevek's life on his home world, to the next chapter of his life on the new world. I feel if it were designed where the two parts were mainstreamed I would have had a richer experience, and getting through some parts wouldn't have felt like a slog. At times I feel like there was padding to some of the chapters to expand them more artificially, but I kept going because I was invested in the complex world and the character of Shevek was very compelling, even if at first he seemed stand off-ish. But over all it was very satisfying ending and I do recommend giving it a read if you seem interested in it."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The first science fiction I ever read was this. I was impressed enough by it to subsequently read all her others. Two worlds are contrasted--Anarres, on which an anarchist system prevails and resources are shared, and Urras, a violent, hierarchical world. Le Guin is a subtle writer and her story consists of far more than a contrast between utopia and dystopia. Her landscapes are compelling and her spare prose memorable and haunting."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Most reviewers seem to miss the essential point, distracted by the most elegant elaboration of anarchy ever in print. The structure of the novel itself with its convergent time lines is the very realization of the physicist-protagonist's theories. A most beautiful example of the novel form."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"...FAVORITE books. I've read it at least seven times and each time it stays as wonderful as I remember. Le Guin is outstanding as a realistic visionary bringing to life alternate realities. Not only is this gem purely entertaining, it starkly holds up our society in the mirror right next to another society, a sort-of &quot;utopia&quot;. Le Guin doesn't insult anyone's intelligence. You'll believe those places exist. Her writing is that great. It's not a tough philosophical read. You'll love it. I've bought and given this book away about five times. Lots of copies are out there used and in the library. Get your hands on one."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a fabulously well-conceived book. I wouldn't call it a utopia, because it is more realistic than that, but it's not a dystopia either. Le Guin has carefully thought through the consequences of anarchism and idealism, while vividly portraying a living world in which her ideas evolve. The attention to detail has made this book stick in my mind years after reading it. If you like sci-fi with more than guns and battleships, this is an intellectual treat."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin always writes thoughtful novels about cultural and/or political clashes. This one is about an idealist, anarchist society exiled to a nearly barren sister planet of a predictably imperialist, capitalist society. If it sounds heavy-handed, it usually is not because it is really about the protagonist and the deeply human story about his two loves: physics and his family. John Lennon sang, &quot;Imagine no possessions&quot;; Ursula K. LeGuin tries to imagine the consequences of no possessions."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"In \\"The dispossessed\\" it's been almost 200 years since a million people left the kapitalist state Urras to go to Anarres and start an anarchistic society. At Anarres everybody is equal and possessions are being shared. Shevek is a brilliant scientist who realises he misses something. His ideas are not being approved of in Anarres. He thinks the freedom in Anarres is fake. He gets invited to talk about his ideas on Urras and he goes there. Here he tries to unite the two different worlds, but that's very hard.I liked \\"The dispossessed\\" because the society on Anarres is explained very well. Shevek is someone who you get to know. He becomes a real person."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The original subtitle of The Dispossessed was \\"An Ambiguous Utopia.\\" It is the best work of utopian literature I have read, including Thomas More, Plato and all that. Instead of rolling my eyes and saying to myself, \\"people don't behave like that\\" or \\"whoa, that sounds fascist and would not work,\\" I could imagine real people, with all their vanity, selfishness, jealousy and spite, working together this imagined society.The Dispossessed won both the Hugo and Locus Awards (awarded by fans), and the Nebula (awarded by professionals in the SF field) in 1974-1975.It is a intricately constructed tale (switching between planets and past/present) of a physicist, Shevek, who visits capitalist Urras (a thinly-disguised Earth) from his Utopian planet, anarcho-socialist Anarres. Although the socialism/capitalism debate may seem dated, Le Guin's vivid characters and compelling prose style illuminate the underlying politics with pathos. These conflicts in how we live and govern ourselves (property, division of labor, production & consumption) have remained inevitably fresh."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The action is set on two sister planets, with alternating chapters on each. The hero, a brilliant mathematician/physicist/philisopher, explores the nature and consequences of two political systems, their good and bad points - Capitalism and true 'Communism' verging on anarchy; there is even a brief, chilling view of our own future world in which the consequences of unrestrained consumerism has left a drastically reduced society ruled by an autocracy in a landscape become hopelessly degraded.In my opinion \\"Dispossessed\\", written in 1974, should be 'up there' amongst the great satires of our literature (Gulliver's Travels, Animal Farm and 1984)instead of stuck away with poor science fiction as implied by the cover. My enjoyment of the text was seriously impeded by poor editing, horrible type face/page layout and misleading cover. Maybe I should have gone for the hard-cover version."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Science fiction is no stranger to social commentary nor to utopias/dystopias. The structure of the totalitarian state has been dissected so thoroughly now by various writers in the sci-fi tradition that it has become just another piece of furniture in the world of science fiction. But there has been a distinct lack of good science fiction that has analyzed the structure and mechanics of the anarchistic society. Among a few short stories, the two that really stand out are Robert A. Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Ursula K. LeGuin's The Dispossessed. These two works, of course, cover opposite ends of the spectrum of anarchy: Heinlein the anarcho-capitalist side and LeGuin the anarcho-syndicalist side. LeGuin's novel is far superior in this aspect, to my mind, because of its thorough and non-ideological analysis of the good and bad aspects of this society. It is by far the most honest and compelling analysis of an anarchy that I have ever seen. Even better is Le Guin's ability to extrapolate and discuss the underlying philosophical framework of this society. There is a scarcely a more compelling creation in all of fiction.The plot is straight-forward enough: over a hundred years prior to the start of the novel a communist revolution, led by a woman named Odo, swept the world of Urras. Rather than waste time and resources waging a bloody war against them, the council of world governments on Urras decided to let the revolutionaries claim their uninhabited desert moon, Anarres. The revolutionaries built a utopian anarchistic society on the moon and, for the next hundred or so years the two worlds have built walls of hatred and distrust between one-another (yes, this novel is, in part, a cold war allegory). This wall of separation is breached and challenged by a Anarrestian physicist, Shevek, who wants to find common ground in-between the two worlds.This book is not perfect, however. While she does many things right (her beautiful writing style; her storytelling abilities; her realistic and fully-developed characters; a novel structure that jumps between two time-lines and which expertly interweave; her compelling look at the world of the Anarresti), other aspects aren't up to par. The story, for one thing, seems to run out of energy near the end, and it is if Le Guin did not know how to end her novel. There is little to no plot resolution. The only lesson the main character learns from his quest seems to be that the entire thing was a bad idea (you could make the case that he understands his role in the \\"social organism\\" of Anarres better, and that the trip was a necessary revolutionary action, but one shouldn't have to read so far into the story to justify the lack of necessary resolution by the author). So while the characters grow and learn, the story as a whole seems to just lose energy and fall over. Moreover, while Anarres is fascinating, the world of Urras is merely a foil and reads like a bad parody of nineteenth century Britain. LeGuin makes Anarres complex and fascinating, but she seems content to leave the Urrasti as caricatures of a very simplistic (and thus problematic) socialist worldview. She doesn't challenge herself by creating a complex capitalistic society and then looking at its positive and negative traits, as she does with the communists on Anarres. Instead, she creates a society so shallow, socially stratified, and brutal that almost anyone would want out. It's as if she chose Chile under Pinochet as representative of all 'archist' or even capitalistic societies.For its faults, however, this is still a fascinating, complex, and thought-provoking read, wherever you are on the political spectrum."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I read this book years ago and have re-read it many times. It and Left Hand of Darkness are my favorite novels by LeGuin. Both books start with a what-if premise. In Lefthand of Darkness the premise is what if there is no separation of the sexes. In The Disposessed the premise is what if there were a truly communistic society. What would it be like? How would it compare or hold up to a capitalist society? What impact would it have on the people that live in that society? She explores these questions through the life of the main character, Shevak. Shevak is a brillant physicist (akin to Einstein) who grows up on the communistic moon of Annares and later travels to the capitalistic parent world of Urras. Although LeGuin obviously favors the commmunistic world of Annares, she does not hesitate to fully explore its weaknesses. She also shows how difficult it is for a truly visionary human such as Shevak to live comfortably in either world. I found The Dispossessed to not only be a thoughtful examination of a philosophical premise but to also be a beautifully written novel and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book ranks high in my top ten list, and actually well above the Left Hand of Darkness. It's characters are complex and interesting and the political commentary is insightful. It's clear Le Guin has leftist leanings (as do I, which might bias my opinion) but she shows the darker sides of both capitalism and communitarianism. I believe that this book encompasses the better part of Le Guin's worldview, including her views on government, feminism, relationships, technology, and human nature. Readers who are strongly attached to capitalism and consumption may misunderstand Le Guin's portrayal of Urras, but everyone else should find some familiar elements in world where everything is for sale, scientific research is driven by profit, and sex is used to sell everything but love. These same readers will also be touched by Le Guin's careful rendering of the communitarian Annares, and will appreciate her honesty in dealing with the possible problems of this society (namely, forced regression to the mean, a tendency toward commitment to society over the individual in times of crises, and a strong current of xenophobia)."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I rate this book up there with the Dune series by Frank Herbert. The only Ursula LeGuin novel that ever held my attention for more than a few pages. Her insights on social interaction within and between cultures are somewhat profound. The theories of Odo rock!&quot;We each of us deserve everything, every treasure that was kept in the vaults of every king, and we each of us deserve nothing, not even a scrap of bread in hunger. Have we not all eaten while others have starved? Will you punish us for that crime? Have we not each of us starved while others ate? Will you reward us for that virtue? Free your mind of the idea of deserving and then you will begin to think.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The Dispossessed is one of my favourite books - one that almost always gets re-read when I pick it up just by accident. Ursula K. Leguin does construct a world for utopians; but this world is not really a conventional utopia. Our united suffering is one of the key themes, and while the book is often explaned in terms of its idealology, it shines in its personal relationships. I love Shevek, I love Shevek and Takver together, I love Dap with Shevek's younger daughter. Ursula K. Leguin can explore difficult ideas with a flowing style that never makes you think you are being preached or pandered to."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I recommend \\"The Dispossessed\\" because it is a good example of how to write a philosophical novel. The story deals with the planet Urras, a modernist technological society, and the moon Annares, an anarchist Utopia populated by outcasts who fled Urras many generations ago. The plot in this book is really secondary. The purpose of \\"The Dispossessed\\" is to analyze both of these societies and to point out their strengths and their flaws. While I don't agree with everything that LeGuin says about community life on Annares, I do believe that she does a good job of displaying what life under such a system would be like. Despite being relatively short, this book covers a lot of ground, including religion, economy, sexuality, family life, and art.With that said, I must confess a little bit of disappointment with the writing of \\"The Dispossessed\\". Having read the Earthsea Saga and \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\", I know that LeGuin can do better. In particular, this book lacks any of the great descriptive passages found in her other works. A few good word pictures of the unforgiving landscape on Annares would have gone a long way towards making the book more intensely realistic. Some of the dialogue also falls a little bit short. Still, I view the book overall as being quite impressive, and a must-read for science fiction fans who like to think."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There is no better work of fiction that describes what a society based on true anarchy might be like. You soon see that it certainly would not be chaos. That is because a society without leaders and laws is not a society without order- it is just that the order comes from within. That is true order. People work and sacrifice because they recognize that it is in everybody's best interest. Society should be brotherhood of equals, a big family. In a sense, the world of Anarres reminded me of one great farm where family members realize from an early age that they are needed for work that must be done. Either that, or I would describe it as an old-style kibbutz on a planetary scale. It isn't a perfect system. Vigilance is needed to make sure that unofficial tyranny from peer pressure and individual corruption do not set in, but it comes across as workable and believable.As for her sister world, Urras, it is a place of both the plutocratic-oligarchic state, as well as, the centralized communist dictatorship, locked in perpetual struggle. It is a world where men are forced and coerced to obey their leaders. It is our world. Urras is archism, Anarres is anarchism. You are forced to examine first hand the fundamental differences. It is the difference between a society of true individuals and a society of slaves.The hero, Shevek, is both a physicist and a philosopher. His was a mind capable of reconciling not only the seeming incompatibility of the simultaneous and sequential nature of time, but also of the conflicting drives of human nature. Both required the freedom of mind of a true revolutionary.I first read this novel over 25 years ago. It came as a shock to me to realize how much I must have internalized the character of Shevek."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"As someone who grew up on Asimov, Heinlein and Arthur C Clarke, I'd looked forward to reading The Dispossessed. Ursula K. Le Guin rightfully has a reputation of being their peer, and I'd enjoyed other Le Guin books (Left Hand of Darkness). As a book of ideas, The Dispossessed is a peer of the aforementioned authors. But as storytelling, it leaves a lot to be desired.First, the ideas. It's easy to dismiss this book as an outdated, cold-war diatribe, but that would be overly simplistic. The author does what great writers do--no idea is presented without ambiguity. No system is prefect, none are without flaws. Untimately, this is a story about a complex and enormously talented physycist, Shevek, who is held back by his anarchistic society (everyone is free to be part of the community, but not free to be different or exceptional). But when he seeks support for his breakthrough theory in the propertarian opposite of his world, he finds disappointment there as well. Through Shevek, the book becomes more about the need of humans to fulfill their potential (almost like an Ayn Rand novel) than about judging the political systems he challenges.Unfortunately, despite a strong protagonist, great writing and intriguing ideas, it's a slow read. The approach Le Guin take of alteranting chapters in the present, with back story in the past is constantly slowing down the flow. And Dispossessed is without significant surprises, plot twists, or indeed much plot at all. Even the ending is ambiguous and unsatisfying.This is a worthwhile novel for anyone interested in political systems and their impact on the individual. It is however, neither a fast read nor a great story."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There's a non-linear approach to The Dispossessed, which actually \\"begins\\" in the middle of the story. The novel begins with Shevek, a physicist on Anarres, preparing to make a landmark journey to sister planet Urras; he does this amid turmoil and protest on his own planet. The chapters alternate in time between events on his home planet leading up to this journey, and the events on Urras after his arrival. While he is working on his theory, Shevek's hope (and the ultimate theme of the novel) is to not only seek out the utopia he hopes for, but to break down the walls and find ways to unify the two worlds, which have grown distrustful and resentful of each other. However, an idealistic society is a complex and difficult puzzle to crack; both worlds have faults, both in the propertarian, material world of Urras as well as the workman, factory-like existence on Anarres. Shevek experiences disillusionment and frustration, but it is part of the self-discovery experience, the epiphany later on.The Dispossessed is smart novel which explores many spectrums and avenues of the \\"utopian-dystopian\\" existence. I thought it was fascinating how Le Guin encompasses so much in such a (relatively speaking) short novel. \\"Prisons\\" become a running symbol throughout Shevek's journey, from the time early in the novel when he becomes physically sick at the site of a peer being locked up, to the various \\"prisons\\" he witnesses within the realm of the two worlds.I can see why The Dispossessed is highly regarded and respected in science fiction circles, I felt a bit mixed about the reading experience initially. Le Guin has a strong foundation for making one think while reading The Dispossessed; it's no light experience. There are so many philosophical nuggets of wisdom, so many ideas to wrap your brain around and to take from the book, which gives insight into one's conception of utopia that you may have to spend a day or two thinking about its message. It is a high IQ read, but at points Le Guin borders on telling more than showing, and some passages and points of dialogue become a bit too preachy and agenda-driven, rather than using a subtle edge to make a point. The book is a bit slow going at first, and at points, but it does pick up. In the end, however, this book won me over, and I appreciated the ideas explored and the \\"humanistic\\" quality of Shevek, especially in the later parts of the story where he faces his most difficult conflicts.Any fans of science fiction or dystopian should give this novel a try."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Although The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia is classified as science fiction, it is hardly a novel about aliens and space travel. Rather, it is a speculative work of fiction that explores the possibility of existence and limitations of a completely anarchist society.At the center of the novel is the planet Anarres. Annares is populated by a community of anarchists, whose ascendants have left Anarres's sister planet Urras almost 200 years prior to escape its oppressive regimes and to establish a new society built on the principles of freedom, brotherhood, and complete anarchy. At this point Annaresti are isolated from and have no contact with Urras.At first, Anarres does seem like a utopia - no Annaresti is a subject to any law (they simply do not exist). Citizens of Anarres have a total freedom - sexual freedom, freedom of occupation, freedom to pursue their interests anywhere on the planet, freedom to work or not work at all. No one on Anarres owns anything, all property is communal. Even children do not \\"belong\\" to their parents, but raised in dormitories by volunteer teachers. There are no prisons or law enforcement on Anarres, because 1) there are no laws to be broken, and 2) if there is no private property, no power struggles, no sexual and physical abuse - there are no reasons to be imprisoned.As the story unfolds however, we see the other side of this society through the eyes of the novel's protagonist - a genius physicist Shevek. Shevek's is the plight of a person of outstanding abilities in a socialist world. Having a knowledge that could possibly bring together the societies all over the universe, he is unable to explore his theories on a planet where resources (including intellectual resources) are limited. He decides to go against the rest of Anarresti people and seek intellectual companionship on Urras. Can Urras give him what he seeks? Will his opinion of his mother planet change once he finds out what they all are missing out on? It is through Shevek's memories of Anarres do we see the weaknesses and strengths of the planet's chosen ideology.I have to say, although The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia is a fascinating novel, I liked it much less than The Left Hand of Darkness. It is simply too dry and too didactic.The best part of the book is, of course, Anarresti form of socialist anarchy. Ursula K. Le Guin's ideas of how such society might function are inventive and daring. But did I ever believe that an anarchist society can exist? Not for a minute. I think thousands of years of human history are on my side. I can't believe in a human society that rejects even the basic idea of family, because supposedly to be a dedicated parent to one's child is to be a proprietor, an egoist, a privateer. What can possibly hold people together except an elusive concept of \\"brotherhood\\" in a place like Anarres? It is also simply impossible for people to co-exist and cooperate without someone striving for power. It is a part of human nature. IMO in reality Anarres would be able to exist as anarchy for no longer than a generation. Once the staunch idealists are dead, any group of people will eventually settle into one of the more efficient orders - be that a democracy, dictatorship, theocracy, oligarchy - basically any social order with a power structure at its core.Nevertheless, as a work of speculative fiction The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia is an interesting book to wrap one's mind around."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin is one of the very few science fiction or fantasy writers whose work regularly is praised in the world of mainstream \\"literary\\" fiction. While this prejudice is unfair to the genres of science fiction and fantasy, the fact that her work escapes it demonstrates just how good LeGuin's writing is, and in my opinion, The Dispossessed stands as her crowning achievement. When you consider that she also wrote The Left Hand of Darkness and the Earthsea series (one book of which won the National Book Award), you can see how much I really like this book.The Dispossessed does what is rare in fiction today (whether science fiction or otherwise): it goes beyond just telling a story to asking basic questions about what it means to be a human being. How do we balance between our social natures and our individuality? Can a utopia really be achieved given the fluid, changing nature of human behavior, our wants and needs and imperfections included? What makes great literature is not that it answers these questions, but that it poses them and demands that the reader wrestle with them. We care about the characters, about Shevek and Takver and Pilun and the rest, but to gain the full benefit of reading The Dispossessed requires that we engage the ideas of the book. Here I mean not just the anarchist philosophy of Odo or the fascinating ideas about physics but the deeper human questions that motivated LeGuin to create them."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"\\"The Dispossessed\\" is a utopian/dystopian novel along the lines of \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"The Handmaid's Tale.\\" Although Le Guin creates an atmosphere of tension, there's not a lot of action (at least for the first three quarters of the book)--so readers expecting more \\"traditional\\" science fiction or surprising plot twists will certainly be dissatisfied. This unashamedly political novel portrays one character torn between two worlds with disparate political and economic systems, and it focuses on the highlights and the inadequacies of both those worlds.Shevek, an unappreciated scientist from Anarres, travels to Urras, whose inhabitants seem to value better his discoveries in physics. Annares, the home of the \\"Dispossessed,\\" is a 175-year-old rebel outpost of anarchists who have established \\"an experiment in nonauthoritarian communism\\" that emphasizes community and cooperation and who must make the most of the limited resources on their desert planet to avert the constant threat of starvation. Anarres's mother planet, Urras, boasts a triumvirate of strong and repressive governments, the most important of which is the capitalist government of A-Io with its impressive wealth, cultural accomplishments, and scientific achievements.But all is not what it seems on either world. Le Guin alternates chapters detailing Shevek's early years of disenchantment on his lawless but peaceful native planet with chapters describing his growing realization that Urras has a significant \\"dispossessed\\" population as well. The novel is, of course, deeply informed by the Cold War--it was published in 1974--and each world features its own \\"ambiguous utopia\\" (the book's subtitle). The anarchists of Anarres have diluted their revolutionary vision with mindless and dogmatic conformism, discouragement of artistic pursuits and dissenting ideas, and an entrenched and uncaring bureaucracy that acts like a government in all but name. The capitalists of Urras, meanwhile, have traded libertarianism and meritocracy for a repressive oligarchy and the armed reinforcement of widespread economic disparities. As the novel progresses, Shevek appreciates that there is much to be learned from both (or rather, all) worlds.Some readers and critics have suggested that Le Guin is \\"promoting\\" anarchism/communism; this is too simplistic, since the book is far too subtle and tentative to work as propaganda. Instead, she posits an attractive and idealistic society, contrasts it with a world with an appealing facade and an unattractive underclass, and shows how human nature tends to corrupt even the most well-meaning of civilizations. A book of ideas rather than of advocacy, \\"The Dispossessed\\" challenges readers to envision humankind's limitless possibilities."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"A group of revolutionaries settles the dry desert moon of a rich, Earthlike planet. Their founding philosophy is based on the writings of Odo, a woman who never sees the moon colony created on her ideas, which are based loosely on pure Communism. Odonianism tries to change human nature, by inculcating the principle of sharing and non-possesiveness, with the interesting twist of removing the possessive word &quot;mine, ours&quot; from language and substituting &quot;the one I use.&quot; The Odonians create a somewhat impoverished but vigorous society on the moon Anarres and for two centuries have been isolated from their Urras roots except for trade contact at the spaceport. In fact, Anarres is a mining colony for Urras and is left alone as long as valuable minerals are shipped back to the mother planet.The Anarresti use a language created by a computer and using their philosophical beliefs. People when born are given a two syllable name from the computer. The society is free, all sexual activity is allowed as long as the partners agree. Marriage is not uncommon, but not the norm either. Children are raised communally, a bit like the first kibbutzim in Israel. Work is assigned from a labor pool with a computerized system of allocating assignments wherever they are needed. But anyone can choose any occupation that suits them, and is free to refuse a posting, or even work at all. Once in every ten days, an Anarresti participates in volunteer labor that's needed by the community. Only a sense of responsibility, taught from birth, a conscience, keeps everyone working for everyone else and free from &quot;propertarianism&quot; or the desire to accumulate possessions and wealth. People are free to move around, choose their work, choose partners and do what they want as long as it doesn't hurt others.This Utopia has seeds of destruction, however. Individuals are quashed by &quot;syndicates&quot; or groups controlling various occupations. New ideas are &quot;egoistic&quot; and suppressed. The main character in The Dispossessed, a brilliant physicist named Shevek, has suffered this isolation and discouragement from childhood on. His brilliance is fostered however, by two special teachers, one of whom is another such isolated and unappreciated brilliant mind. When he goes to Abbenay, the capital, to work at the central institute, he becomes aware of the jealousy, conservatism and backbiting that are undermining their utopia. He also embarks on a major discovery in physics, that is rejected by the institute, but greatly coveted by the physicists and industrialists on Urras. He's invited to finish his work on Urras and to accept a prize equivalent to a Nobel. No one from Anarres has gone to Urras in two centuries and a conflict of huge proportions erupts, against the backdrop of a heartbreaking drought and famine on Anarres.How the conflict is ultimately solved, and how the Utopia is forever changed makes for some exciting reading. The book is a good examination of the question whether it is possible to set up a completely unselfish society and what the eventual outcome might be based on human nature. This is one of Le Guin's best books, and written in spare, beautiful language that describes the people, the landscape and the drama in a most memorable way."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Quick -- name three SF literary portraits of functional societies founded on principles of anarchism.I come up with Eric Frank Russell's Gands in _The Great Explosion_ (&quot; . . . And Then There Were None&quot;), Robert A. Heinlein's Loonies in _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, and Ursula K. Le Guin's Anarresti in _The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia_.Oh, there are a handful of others, notably James Hogan's _Voyage from Yesteryear_ (which was itself strongly influenced by Russell). But most of the rest are thinly disguised libertarian propaganda without a great deal of literary merit (though your mileage may vary).Of these three, Le Guin's is in some ways the most compelling. In part that's because she's just such a fine writer. But it's also because she's probably the _least_ &quot;ideological&quot; of all the SF writers who have ever tackled this subject.On Le Guin's somewhat Taoistic approach, each of the contrasting societies contains the seeds of the other, and she lets the reader see both their &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; points. She clearly likes the Anarresti society (and on the whole it comes off rather better than its Urrasti foil). But she doesn't hesitate to show the reader some of its critically important drawbacks. Its childrearing practices, for example, recall Ira Levin's _This Perfect Day_, and its treatment of original thinkers (and their &quot;egoizing&quot;) even recalls Ayn Rand's tub-thumpingly propagandistic _Anthem_.In general, then, Le Guin is pretty well immune to the usual salvation-by-ideology claptrap. And as her subtitle suggests, her utopia really _is_ ambiguous. For her, people aren't &quot;saved&quot; by adopting the correct philosophical position or social principles.Least of all is her protagonist Shevek &quot;saved&quot; by such means. Shevek is a physicist from Anarres (the moon of the planet Urras) and has grown up in its anarchist society. But it doesn't really have a place for him. Neither, more obviously, does Urras, the &quot;propertarian&quot; counterpart to Annares's communitarian society, with which Annares has had no contact for about a century and a half. So with respect to the two polar-opposite patterns of social organization, Shevek is doubly dispossessed.What's the book actually _about_? Well, Shevek cooks up a plan to get the two societies on speaking terms again and, in order to pursue it, decides to leave Anarres for Urras; so off he goes, as a passenger in a ship called the _Mindful_. (And yes, do be careful not to trip over the symbolism.) That's all I'm going to tell you about the plot. But the essential theme of the novel is, I suppose, barriers and their overcoming. (The very first sentence goes like this: &quot;There was a wall.&quot; Yep.)It's a very thoughtful novel. The narrative hops around in time a lot and the plot isn't exactly marked by nonstop action, so it's probably not for space opera fans. But readers of a more philosophical bent will enjoy it immensely.And if you're at all interested in literary portraits of anarchist societies, make sure you read this one. If you share Le Guin's Taostic/anarchistic leanings (as I do), you'll like the Anarresti _and_ appreciate Le Guin's refreshingly anti-ideologue-ish honesty in her portrait of it."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This novel won the 1974 Nebula Award and the 1975 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year as well as the 1975 Jupiter Award. It is centered about a complex society that is founded upon anarchism: an ordered society without laws. The &quot;dispossessed&quot; in the novel are the millions of the inhabitants of Anarres, an arid moon of the lush planet of Urras. Two centuries earlier, the followers of an anarchist philosopher had fled Urras to forge a new society, a society that has done away with the concept of &quot;possession.&quot; There is no property on Anarres, no money, no marriage (I hope that Le Guin is not meaning to suggest that marriage is a possession by one or other of the participants), no government, no laws, no prisons. Even the language reflects this attitude. Possessive pronouns are even avoided. Instead of saying &quot;My hand hurts,&quot; one would say &quot;The hand hurts me.&quot; A mathematical genius of Anarres, who has made a conceptual breakthrough that allows for the development of the ansible (an instantaneous communication device that other science fiction authors will begin to use), travels to Urras. He had been having difficulties with the philosophical ideas of his home world but the social structure of Urras baffles him. The cultures of both world cause problems for the protagonist Shevik. This is one of the best science fiction novels of all time. However, I'm surprised at some of the comments by earlier reviewers. It appears that some reviewers are really offended at more cerebral type of novels. I gave this book five stars. And, I also gave &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; five stars. Both books have their place within the genre. Perhaps we should be not so narrow in our tastes so that we exclude valuable works. Both of these novels should be read by any serious student of science fiction literature."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Whether or not THE DISPOSSESED passes as good sci-fi, I know not. I am not very knowledgeable of what SF fans look for in a book. As a novel, and as a philosophical exploration of authoritarianism, anarchism, capitalism, communism, revolution and utopianism -- this book is first-rate. The questions Le Guin grapples with here are by no means simple. Even great philosophers, like Marx and Bakunin, had difficultly imagining what an ACTUAL society would look like without bosses and owners. But through the gripping tale of an anarchist caught between two fundamentally different worlds, Le Guin seeks answers to many of the questions these philosophers left untouched. How would an anarchist society function? What would it take as its fundamental principles? What problems would that society have? What would a &quot;propertarian&quot; capitalist society appear from the perspective of an anarchist? Without offering any quick or final answers, Le Guin sheds light on these issues and beckons the reader to imagine the possibility of another world.

Beyond Le Guin's compelling storyline, masterful character development, and brilliantly constructed setting (all of which can be found in any of her other books), The Dispossessed is a social commentary the likes of which I had never experienced before.Most people, I am sure, hear the word &quot;anarchy,&quot; and it brings to mind images of smelly punk-rock kids throwing rocks and trashing cars (direct action!) However, the layperson generally cannot see beyone the premise of &quot;no government = chaos.&quot; Le Guin tears down the philosophical walls and false presuppositions and proposes a world based on true libertarian socialist ideals: Anarchy. These people are not terrorists, but hard working, sincere individuals, possessed with all the faults that we have always had. It adresses the problems that could arise in an anarchist community plagued by extreme scarcity, but its message triumph over tribulation rings true.It is this book which radically changed my political philosophies, and if is powerful and beautiful enough a piece of literature that it can do the same for all who read it."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Do books really change people's lives? I've read this book many times over the last decade or so, and it never stops speaking to something deep inside me (and my wife, who I knew I had to marry when she said this was her favorite book).

And there's no Ursula book like The Dispossesed. If you haven't read it by the year 2001, you kind of missed the boat on 20th century literature.

You have successfully removed another brick from the wall.Note: The Perrenial Classics edition of this book (not this edition) is much more sturdy and readable, if a little more pricy."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Ursula LeGuin is one of my favorite writers and I just re-read this novel (in my early 40s, around the age of Shevek, the protagonist) after having read it the first time about 20 years before. The Dispossessed is a startlingly ambitious and perfect novel. On its face, the novel is about a physicist from a world of self-exiled anarchists (Anarres) who decides to travel to the \\"propertarian\\" (capitalistic) mother planet (Urras), both to complete his life's work of reconciling two contradictory theories of physics (Sequency and Simultaneity) and to tear down the walls between his society and the Urrasti world left behind.One of LeGuin's remarkable achievements is her conception of an anarchistic society, something that has never existed in history. LeGuin fleshes out a world of 20 million anarchists, explaining how the people of such a society might live and love, how such a large community could function without a government. But this novel is so much more than a writer's imagining of functional anarchism. This novel is not really about politics, it is about love and the nature of human interaction.The life work of the protagonist is to reconcile Sequency -- time as linear, history as progress -- with Simultaneity -- time as instaneous, history as cyclical. Similarly, Shevek tries to reconcile his society of Anarres, where there is no government oppression or inequality but also where individuality is stifled and creativity devalued, with Urras, where there is unjust distribution of power and wealth but also great beauty and achievement. LeGuin tells Shevek's tale in two different time arcs, a linear progression through Shevek's journey to Urras and the events there, and a looping back through Shevek's life from infancy to reach the beginning of Shevek's journey at the end of the novel. LeGuin writes the novel in two chronologies as if to highlight Shevek's struggle with reconciling the two theories of Time. This literary device works brilliantly, as the reader rushes through the novel not only to find out what happens to Shevek while in Urras but also to find out why Shevek chose to leave Anarres for the journey.Underneath it all, LeGuin is not just trying to reconcile competing conceptualizations of time, or to decide what is the best way for people to govern themselves, but rather to harmonize the contradictions that exist within human nature. We are all \\"propertarians,\\" as LeGuin demonstrates simply and beautifully early in the novel with a heartbreaking passage in which Shevek as a toddler is enjoying warmth and sunlight flowing through an open window, trying to \\"possess\\" the sunlight, only to have a larger boy shove him aside. We are all anarchists as well, disregarding government mandates for the sake of personal choices. Humans are both greedy and altruistic, inclined both to take and to help, to hate and to love. LeGuin settles on love as the human constant, the key variable in the equation of human interaction, but does not presume to define love, only describe aspects of it. LeGuin shows us that trying to understand human nature, and reconcile its contradictions, is easily as difficult as trying to construct fundamental principles of the physical Universe and reconciling the conflicts in our perceptions of reality. Following Shevek as he finds his own answers to both is a rewarding journey. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago and it still echoes in my mind as far and away the best science fiction novel I have ever read simply because it avoids problems found in most SF--poor characterization and over-reliance on techno-babble. It amazes me that this classic has not been made into a movie yet, but it would lend itself much better to the screen than, say, &quot;Dune.&quot; This book squarely faces the central dilemma of a materialistic society--that by its very nature encourages possessive (hence the title) desires, both sexual and otherwise, that lead inevitably to spiritual dissolution and unhappiness. And as far as LeGuin's prose goes, there are sentences here that I will never forget. The last line is surely one of the most memorable in American literature."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is not an ordinary SF story. It is social philosophy with depth, new thinking about old ideas and fascinating portraits of persons involved. The science is not bad either. I was riveted to my Kindle every day when commuting until finished. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Like Shevek himself, this book has a quiet, intelligent stoicism about it, and yet burns with the hot, subversive passion of revolution at its core. This is a book of ideas, and the \\"action\\" of this novel revolves around the creation and development of these ideas, rather than around specific \\"events\\" per se. Indeed, moments of \\"action\\", such as the military firing into a massive, unarmed insurrectionary crowd, barely seems to raise Shevek's (and by extension, as the lens through which we see this world, our) pulse rate. Instead, it is the subtler moments of dispossession, possession, being outcast, returning home where the emotion and the passion swell. The narrative structure is quite fascinating and effective, as chapters in Shevek's \\"real time\\" alternate with Shevek's past; however, true to the ideas of time in the book, these distinct pieces combine to form an inseparable whole. More broadly, they serve to show the seductive promise of the worlds of Urras and Anarres, and then the deep flaws of each, ending on a ambiguous note that is ultimately satisfying, for this is a book that asks more questions than it answers. What makes these two worlds, and indeed this whole story, timeless is the fact that although this book was written during the Cold War, it would be more fair to say that Urras and Anarres represent stylized manifestations of capitalism and communism, respectively rather than more straight-forward metaphors for the U.S. and Soviet Union (which would've made this story feel somewhat dated). Indeed, despite the end of the Cold War, reading this book at a time when the frailty of both capitalism and democracy in the developed world are on display makes for an interesting and contemplative experience.It is important to note, however, that this story is much more complex than a simple ideological battle between two worldviews. For, while Le Guin seems to favor the Odonian vision of Anarres over the nations of Urras, both societies are critically flawed. Urras is seen as a hell by Shevek, who abhors the greed, exploitation, dishonesty, and selfish ambition he sees there. Yet, Anarres in many ways, is just as or more flawed; pressures to conform to societal norms and expectations, informal bureaucracies just as autocratic as authoritarian states, and a xenophobic fear and rejection of Other create a repression of the mind and of creativity almost as stifling as the more overtly oppressive states on Urras. Some see the introduction of Terran and Hainish actors toward the end as a bit of a deus ex machina, and it is to some degree from the perspective of the *action* in the plot; but from the all-important perspective of the *ideas* of the novel, they provide an interesting and important counterbalance to Shevek's perspective on the two worlds, and importantly provide the possibility at the end of a way forward, and a new, more wide-spread revolution and evolution of ideas.This is a complicated, subtle novel; but the beauty of it is that its essence is captured entirely in the first two paragraphs. This is a novel about a wall and all it implies. Insider versus outcast. Belonging versus exclusion. Laughably trivial and yet the most important thing in the universe. Humanly-devised, given meaning only through the social constructions of the collective. Viewed, in our case, from the dispossessed traveler who journeys forth but always returns. A joy to read, and even more so to contemplate; a timeless classic of science fiction as powerful today as when it was first written."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin's classic 1974 novel The Dispossessed is brought wonderfully to audio courtesy a Harper Audio production of an excellent Don Leslie narration. Winner of both the Hugo and Nebula awards, it is also (and much less impressively, I might add!) my pick for the best new science fiction and fantasy audiobook published at Audible.com in September 2010. The publisher's summary is brief: \\"Shevek, a brilliant physicist, decides to take action. He will seek answers, question the unquestionable, and attempt to tear down the walls of hatred that have isolated his planet of anarchists from the rest of the civilized universe. To do this dangerous task will mean giving up his family and possibly his life. Shevek must make the unprecedented journey to the utopian mother planet, Anarres, to challenge the complex structures of life and living, and ignite the fires of change.\\" Here, there is simply too much to say, and so I will play a bit of the coward and not say much at all, other than: Le Guin's Anarres is the definitive rendering of anarchism in fiction, and this is an unforgettable novel, and a masterful narration."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Along with everything else which has been said about this wonderful book, I am convinced this is where the fashions of the Centauri on the television series \\"Babylon 5\\" must have originated.

I highly recommend this book, but get one from a different publisher."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Clearly written as an allegory for the cold war, the dispossessed still resonates. Money and possessions still function as prisons, keeping people apart for fear of loss. We could stand to be more like Anarres, treating others like brothers instead of strangers.With a lack of action and the usual pulp-sci-fi tripes, I think this one might bore a lot of contemporary readers, particularly those that don't have a strong understanding of the Cold War dynamic around which it was based.For those who like a little philosophy in their sci-fi, however, this is a classic work that deserves some attention somewhere down your list of things to read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"One man's initiative combined with his abstract intellectual brilliance disturbs the political stasis in two planets and may be a seed of change even beyond. The book sensitively explores the social organisation and personal experience of the anarcho-communist world in which Shevek lives. He gradually realises that the price of freedom is eternal \\"initiative\\" - opposing the 'vigilance' of those who protect the status quo. His power to influence events comes from the value of his work in theoretical science. All worlds share a quasi-religious belief that theory is the first step to technology and thus to power.The strength of the book is the complex and convincing shades of grey in which both characters and social systems are portrayed. There are no easy solutions and even the motivation of villains is complex.A enthralling and satisfying philosophy text presented through fiction."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"In this science fiction classic a planet, Urras, and its colonized moon, Annares, have a unique relationship. Urras is made up of archistic states, whether they are socialist, capitalist, theocratic, etc. while the moon is populated by anarchists due to a quirk in history. There is little contact between the world and little trust between them. The story revolves around the life of Sevek, a physisist from Annares, who over the length of his life begins to formulate a theory of how to travel faster than the speed of light. The problem is that Annares seemingly has no use for his theory and he must deal with Urras in order to go forward.An interesting fable, it is fascinating for its approach to how a world with nor rules would function. Graphic and scatological at times, it is a great book, one I have read several times.

Le Guin's \\"The Dispossessed,\\" is compellingly written, sophisticated in its presentation of theoretical physics, and devastating in its profound critique of capitalist culture and social structure. But the novel also addresses the potential shortcomings of an anarchist alternative that can all too easily fall victim to the tyranny of the majority. Written as science fiction and taking place in the distant future, the narrative nevertheless has a great deal of contemporary relevance. It is told from the point of view of a theoretical physicist, with the creative ability and intellect of an Einstein, who has grown to adulthood on a planet with a well-established anarchist culture. Being a committed anarchist, he seeks to defend and expand the values of personal freedom and responsibility. The anarchist society in which he lives espouses such values, but falls far short of living up to them in practice. The capitalist alternative, embodied in a society located on a different planet, is controlled by an elite driven by greed and power. This exploitative society is perceived as largely barbarous by the physicist, who is portrayed as a person with an enlarged sense of humanity. Le Guin succeeds admirably in presenting these societal critiques without being doctrinaire. She is not only an imaginative and fine spinner of tales with an anthropologist's eye for concrete detail and cultural patterns, but has a refined grasp of political theory. The dilemma posed by the novel is whether one extraordinary and courageous man with the help of like-minded others can overcome the shortcomings of both societies and make a lasting contribution that enhances peace and freedom throughout the cosmos. This is a must read for all those interested in the political and economic contradictions of our own time."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I read The Dispossessed back in college and have re-read it many times and remain spellbound and captivated by Le Guin's storytelling. Arguably her finest work, its tale of a desert-like Socialist-style communal world contrasted against its parent planet of rich resources and warring nations remains as relevant today as it did when published nearly four decades ago. An absolute must-have on any science-fiction reader's shelf -- but also required reading for any student of history, culture or society. Works of such insight, beauty, and intelligence are rare gems, and the genre is blessed to count this one among its number."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I was so excited to read a book dedicated to the principles of anarchism! Where better than sci-fi to explore an anarchist society with a long history and highly articulated ideas. Who better than a highly accomplished writer such as Le Guin to tackle the endeavor? By Odo, was I disappointed.Le Guin's \\"Dispossessed,\\" while generous in its drawing out of anarchist ideas and events, left me bored out of my wits. The plot is thinner than cardboard, the characters are unmoving, and I could find little reason to turn the pages. But turn them I did.

The funny thing is, I can't understand why it was in the libertarian Prometheus' Award Hall of Fame, next to 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' by Heinlein and 'Atlas Shrugged' by Rand, since it is completely different from the other winners.

Basically, if you like 'Left Hand of Darkness' (and many do, for some reason), you will like this novel. They have a very similar premise: One man, alone on a new planet, with new ideals, forced to live between 2 sets of incompatible countries. I don't understand how Le Guin can write such a masterpiece of fantasy literature (Earthsea) with action, and depth, and such an amazing plot, and then also, churn out this sci fi philosophical trash. I know she is trying to be like Heinlein, who is also very libertarian and preachy. But, Heinlein, on the other hand, is a good story teller and drives his novels through action and clever dialogue with many twists and turns and usually a very cool unexpected ending. Le Guin's novels have NONE of that. Just like there is a huge difference between Science Fiction and Future Fantasy, I will say that there is a big difference between Future Fantasy and Future Philosophy, because that's what I believe Le Guin's sci fi novels are. They are her attempt to sell her libertarian anarcho syndicalism by placing it in a futuristic setting between 2 extreme forms of government; a plutocracy (capitalist dictatorship) and a communist dictatorship. Le Guin never attempts to compare her utopian society to a democratic socialism or democratic capitalism, at least, not to my way of thinking. I have had to scratch and claw my way through 2 Le Guin sci fi novels now, and I will not be planning on trying another."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I really appreciate amazon.com for being punctual. this is one of the very few websites on which i fully rely. amazon.com is undoubtedly number one when it comes to online shopping. i strognly recommend you use it!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I could not finish reading this story.

The story revolves around the cultural clash of a member of an anarchist world encountering a society much like ours.(Side note: if you think anarchism means throwing bricks through Starbucks windows, you need to watch less TV. Anarchism is a political \\"ism\\" with as long a history as Marxism. The easiest way to convey it to an American is as a \\"libertarian socialist\\".)"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Recently, I've read a number of books written by Ursula LeGuin. This after having somehow avoided her for the last forty years, largely as a result of her Earthsea cycle. I've come to enjoy her science fiction with an anthropological slant, best represetned by The Left Hand of Darkness and her Hainish tales. This novel takes it a liitle further, adding a very philosophical political commentary to the sociological layer of the story.Our backdrop is the Tau Ceti system, and more particularly the inhabited planets of Anvarres and Urras. Urras is the cradle of Cetian civilization and is composed of several different nation states, the two most prominent being A-Io and Thu; the former, a free market capitalist state (think United States) and the latter an authoritarian Communist state (think U.S.S.R.). It would seem that 200 years in the past, the underclass of A-Io revolted under the leadership of an anarchist/libertarian by the name of Odo. The Odoists were gathered up and settled on the stark, barely survivable moon, Anvarres. There, they built their ideal anarchist society, with no concept of ownership or personal entitlement. Pronouns such as \\"my\\" and \\"mine\\" were not even part of their language. The worst insult from an Anvarren would be to term someone an \\"egoist\\" or \\"profiteer\\". Their motto: \\"No one starves while others eat.\\" Though plenty starved. The two planets are almost completely isolated from one another.Our protagonist is an Anvarren physisist, Shevek. Shevek cannot fully explore his ground breaking theories (involving instantaeous space travel, Simulaneity) on Anvarres and is invited to study and publish in A-Io, an unprecedented turn of events. It is Shevek's journey to A-Io, his observations and the interactions between the several competing political systems that make up this novel. There is a second thread which describes the lead up to Shevek's journey, in which we learn more of the Anvarren, anarcho-socialist civilization, and its far from ideal operation.This novel becomes somewhat weighted with political discourse and even theoretical physics, sometimes to the detriment of the underlying story. However, by and large, it is a fair treatment of the various political systems, their strengths and weaknesses. We see two alien races interacting with the Cetians, the Terrans and the Hainish. For those familiar with the Hainish tales of LeGuin, we discover the source of the ansible, a communications device allowing instantaneous communication throughout space. The story is similar in style to Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress in its socio-political overtones, but not as dense as some of Philip Dick's or Frank Herbert's work. Bottom line: A worthwhile and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The Dispossessed is a story with multiple levels. On one level, it's the story of a man- Shevek- on a quest. On another, it's a utopian/dystopian novel. On yet another, it's about the nature of time.Shevek lives on Anarres, a large moon of the planet Urras. Anarres is a harsh world with sparse resources. There is no luxury and there are sometimes privations, but the people live in an anarchic socialist state. There is no property; everyone shares everything- if one goes hungry, all go hungry. If there is excess food, all eat well. In theory, everyone is free to do what they want, but this is a very organized anarchy. The Division of Labor's computers show all jobs available and you pick what you want, or, in times of crisis, are asked to take specific jobs. Syndicates decide how to deal with specific issues. This is where Shevek runs into trouble. He is a physicist working on a unified theory of time. His theory is at odds with the theory the head of the university syndicate has worked on. When the syndicate refuses to publish his theory, he finds that even a society based on equality, freedom, sharing and not having anyone superior to any other has it's rules, rulers and ways of making people conform.When Shevek does get his theory published, he gets it sent to Urras. He is awarded a prize for the innovation and importance of his work, and this is where the story starts: as he leaves for Urras. While there has been some small trade between the worlds, the people do not mingle. Ever.The story weaves two time streams together: Shevek's life from his childhood, leading to the point where the story starts, and Shevek's life as he goes to Urras. Some have found this technique hard to follow, but it emphasizes Shevek's theory of time being simultaneous rather than sequential.Urras (where the Anerres people migrated from less than 200 years before) is the opposite of Anerres: society is materialistic, capitalistic, class and gender stratified. Many people go hungry while a few have food to waste. But it's a luxurious world; there is great wealth, both in the upper class people's lives and in natural beauty. Here there are trees, flowers, grass, abundant rain. Shevek enters this world as a noble savage- will he hold to his ethics, or be seduced by the soft Urras life they offer him? In the end, it's obvious that neither society is perfect and that things still need to be worked out.Written in 1974, this book explores a lot of the issues that were important then. The situation of Urran women as property, kept from education and jobs, vs the gender equality on Anarres steps right out of the second feminist movement. There is some space given to anti-war sentiment; the Viet Nam war would have been winding down while this book was being written. The biggest theme, of course, is communism vs capitalism, which was a big issue in the 70s. What saves this book from being a ponderous treatise on sociology and politics is the characters. Le Guin's people are complex, rounded, interesting people. We have no caricatures here, we have living, breathing humanoids dealing with the effects of the society they live in. Despite the 36 years since this book was written, it remains both meaningful and engaging."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There is no better work of fiction that describes what a society based on true anarchy might be like. You soon see that it certainly would not be chaos. That is because a society without leaders and laws is not a society without order- it is just that the order comes from within. That is true order. People work and sacrifice because they recognize that it is in everybody's best interest. Society should be brotherhood of equals, a big family. In a sense, the world of Anarres reminded me of one great farm where family members realize from an early age that they are needed for work that must be done. Either that, or I would describe it as an old-style kibbutz on a planetary scale. It isn't a perfect system. Vigilance is needed to make sure that unofficial tyranny from peer pressure and individual corruption do not set in, but it comes across as workable and believable.As for her sister world, Urras, it is a place of both the plutocratic-oligarchic state, as well as, the centralized communist dictatorship, locked in perpetual struggle. It is a world where men are forced and coerced to obey their leaders. It is our world. Urras is archism, Anarres is anarchism. You are forced to examine first hand the fundamental differences. It is the difference between a society of true individuals and a society of slaves.The hero, Shevek, is both a physicist and a philosopher. His was a mind capable of reconciling not only the seeming incompatibility of the simultaneous and sequential nature of time, but also of the conflicting drives of human nature. Both required the freedom of mind of a true revolutionary.I first read this novel over 25 years ago. It came as a shock to me to realize how much I must have internalized the character of Shevek."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I just finished reading this book for what must have been the fourth of fifth time in 20 years. Everytime I read it, it is a completely different book from the book I remembered. I've decided the book actually metamorphosizes and is growing. How else to explain it? The book is always good, but always different. This is the best book ever written about how a real communistic system would probably work. It shows the good aspects and the bad. But I remembered a lot more about the main character's early childhood than was actually in the book last time. So either the book changes, or the character has lived in me so long that I've filled in some of the times Le Guin didn't write about. There is no better recommendation of a book than that the characters become alive for the reader."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"\\"The Dispossessed\\" was not an \\"easy\\" read, as I personally find much SF to be. And it is not quite typical for all SF (less about the technology and more about the politics.) The writing is extremely detailed and, frankly, a bit dry. In some ways for much of the book, it seemed like very little was happening and I didn't quite enjoy it. But then once I'd put it down for the night, I'd think about the characters and the plot and ideas and liked them...And I *really* enjoyed the story once I was done reading it, and have found that it has helped inform my thinking about other texts and subjects. In short - worth the read if you're into politics, relationships, life, questioning, etc."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Is it SF? Fantasy? Just plain good fiction? Who cares?

One book per memorizing subversive. For all my adult life I have known that if I had to choose one book to save; it would be &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Science fiction has often described libertarian societies and ideals. Think of such works as Heinlein's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" Russell's \\". . .and Then There Were None,\\" and Williamson's \\"The Equalizer,\\" among others. One of the most explicit of science fiction works on a society characterized by freedom is Ursula LeGuin's \\"The Dispossessed.\\"At one point in the history of the planet Urras, a feisty woman named Odo led a movement for freedom, for liberty, for anarchism. Finally, Urras ceded the moon, Anarres, to her movement. Here an \\"ambiguous utopia\\" developed, as per the subtitle of this book.The primary character in this novel is Shevek, a physicist on Anarres. As the novel proceeds, he becomes concerned that the original promise of the libertarian society is being lost. Over time, something like \\"a tyranny of the majority\\" is creeping into society. Nonconformists are subtly (and not so subtly) penalized. Obviously, this undermines the concept of a libertarian society. His friend, who starts him thinking along these lines, Bedap, Says: \\"You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.\\" He goes on to point out that Odo herself had mentioned this as a threat.The society on Anarres is a kind of amalgam of a Kropotkin anarcho-communist society (in terms of the production and distribution of goods and services) and a Stirnerite individualist society. At one point, Shevek decided to visit the home planet, Anarres. He comes to understand the promise of Anarres--and the threat to the vision of freedom.Upon his return, he begins an effort to organize in such a manner as to renew the ideals that Odo had raised and advocated for. As he said later on in the novel: \\"That the Odonian society on Anarres had fallen short of the ideal did not, in his eyes, lessen his responsibility to it; just the contrary.\\" Later, he argues that \\". . .we didn't come to Anarres for safety, but for freedom.\\"The novel sometimes drags a little, as discussion and debate might slow the action. But, in the end, this novel works very nicely. And it raises issues that all of us need to think about. What are our country's ideals? How far should we go to undermine those just to have \\"security\\" (whatever that means)? In many respects, this novel speaks to American ideals after 9/11. Do we turn our back on those ideals for security? Where is the fine line between undermining the ideals of the Founding Fathers to maintain security or to demand freedom and undermine the need for security? Such questions are raised in this work, indicating that it addresses critical issues of relevance to all of us, long after its original publication."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I tentatively picked up this book at the age of 10, guiltily not sure if I was allowed to read an \\"adult\\" book. Although it's protagonist was a physicist and I hated science, this became my favorite book. It offers amazing insights into the innermost thoughts and feelings of one man. Shevek was completley real to me and I could completely empathize with him. I loved the scene when Shevek, as a youth in class, disproves his society's current scientific edicts. The anger in the teachers eyes taught me that people don't always react to the truth kindly. All the characters in this book are utterly genuine, from Shevek's friend who gets exiled from \\"Anarchist\\" society for being too controversial to the fawning housewife on the foreign planet who gives Shevek his first exposure to women with shaved legs. A great quote is when someone asks Shevek if it's true that Men and Women are treated exactly the same on his planet. And Shevek answers \\"That would be a waste of good equipment.\\""},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is one of my all time favorites.Reading over the other reviews, I hope people don't get the wrong idea. Sure, this is a very smart book that explores the possibilities of anarchy in a serious, philosophical way. But even though those things interest me, didactic science fiction with a MESSAGE is usually incredibly boring. This is not that kind of a sci-fi book. LeGuin writes a story with intelligent, real, flawed characters, and I find myself drawn in every time I go back to the book. Buy it for the story; the philosophy is a bonus if you like that kind of thing. (Of course, if you like zap, blam sci-fi, don't get this book.)"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Both The Dispossessed and The Left Hand of Darkness are modern masterpieces. Mrs. LeGuin's writing is thought-provoking, complex, mythical, and, I believe, more fantasy than sci-fi. Her lineage can be traced more to Tolkien than to Asimov. The Dispossessed displays a deep understanding of culture and human sociology, just as The Left Hand of Darkness displays a real exploration of myth-making and religion. If you want your characters cut out along dotted lines and a book's ideas to not make you think too hard, then these books are not for you. If, however, you expect the books you read to be interactive, offering a dialogue rather than a monologue, than I highly suggest you give these books a try. For those people that rate these books below a 5, stick to Grisham and Crichton."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This was required reading in my Science Fiction class at Penn State (in 1983), and for good reason. The Dispossessed is not great science fiction, it is great fiction that happens to be science fiction. Ms LeGuin has written a masterful book that could be set in any era, anywhere. I, as other reviewers have mentioned, have given this book as a gift -- to non sci-fi readers who have been extremely pleased with it. Do not miss the opportunity to step into The Dispossessed. I have no need to buy this book from Amazon as I still have my copy from 1983, but have gone out of my way to review it here anyhow, fourteen years later. That is the kind of impact this novel had on me.The Dispossessed is in my top five of all time, and by far the best science fiction book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Shevek is a physicist from a world of anarchists who finds the only way to spread his revolutionary ideas of temporal physics is to visit the world who exiled his culture nearly 200 years ago. In this act and in those leading to and from it, he brings a reexamination of the revolutionary anarchy of the desolate moon Anarres as well as casts a gaze on the stratified capitalist world of Urras.Set in the same universe of LeGuin's other space stories, _The_Dispossessed_ critiques the capitalism of late 20th century Western culture, with its proxy wars and gender inequities, the failings of idealized communist societies which succumb to human drives for power through buereacracy, as well as the drive in both to maintain a status quo.In addition, Shevek's struggle to unify linear and circular views of temporal physics parallels Einstein's (or Ainsetain's (sic))and modern physics struggles to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics. This, along with insights into the perils of dual career families and academic politics round out the tale.Shevek, is perhaps the only fully realized character and he serves as the readers eyes onto the two Cetian societies and thus the aforementioned critique of our own. So, while I did identify and feel empathy for Shevek, it was the social descriptions and plot which kept me from putting the book down more than once to sleep, over the course of 24 hours.Are you possessed by your possessions? by your ideas?"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a rare book of science ficiton that transcends the often masculine, ultra-high tech prose that dominates the genre. Le Guin's father (Kroeber) was one the founders of Anthropology as a discpline and this fasicination with the possibilities of human culture is what drives this book. It is not, as some people say, a rant against capitalism or cannonizing anarchy as the tonic for human ill rather this book opens up the possibilites of human organization, of human culture. If you enjoy the themes of alientation and the idea cultural evolution then you will likely enjoy this book. If your'e more into fast paced, kill the aliens, type prose then you'll be better off dismissing this book as a cold war relic."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The Dispossessed is my favorite work by le Guin-- this is the book I give a copy of to everyone I know. It covers so much ground; you have the whole anarchy vs archism, of course, but gender roles are well explored, theories of time, all sides of the human mental/emotional/social experience that you can fit into a story; there are no one-dimensional characters in this book. Of all the friends i've given this to, there isn't one who hasn't enjoyed it, and there isn't one who hasn't told me how much it made them think."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"For those stupid Sci-Fi painted covers bore me to death and this one makes the book seem just another vaguely interesting Sci-Fi novel. Believe me, it is not really Sci-Fi at all - the story doesn't happen on earth, but that is the only Sci-Fi thing about this book. Sorry I won't go into detail. The weird thing is that I am always more than suspicious when people say that books changed their lives...this one didn't change my life, but left me deeply impressed and deeply thinking about different realities within countries and -generally- larger groups of human beings. Anyways-if you don't find it generally stupid to think a bit from time to time on how else life could be get this book. It is very smart and very fascinating."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"While reading this book, I couldn't help but get the feeling that it is an Atlas Shrugged but for the Left Libertarians rather then the Right Libertarians. They are both books of Idealistic politics and morality. But there is a major difference between the two. Whereas Atlas Shrugged is one-sided propaganda that could hardly be called critical, The Dispossessed is not a fawning love-portrait. Ursula K. Le Guin does not accept Anarchism with the feverent faith that Ayn Rand accepted Capitalism. She recognized that problems would certainly arise, and true to Libertarian form, she addresses these problems in The Dispossessed. Shevek is no John Galt, and that is why The Dispossessed is simply the best novel of Idealistic politics out there."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"&quot;The Dispossessed&quot; describes a world I would like to live in.Whithout personnel properties, whithout the need to own anything.

I had long considered it my favorite book of all time, and I wasn't sure it would hold up to a re-read.

Oh, and MOON ANARCHISTS!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"As many reviewers have noted, this LeGuin novel is more about the socio-political content than the action or characters. Although the book follows a single character from birth to late middle age, the story is really a canvas upon which the author paints a picture of the benefits and dangers of both anarchistic communism and oligarchical capitalism. The anarchistic society is presented in a slightly more positive light than its counterpart in this book, though the main character, Shevek, becomes disenchanted with both types of social arrangements in one way or another. Shevek ultimately chooses his home world, Anarres, as the superior one, shunning the world that held the promise of scientific progress, but tainted that promise by treating science as a means to gain superiority over other worlds.I prefer science fiction to lean more heavily on the plot and characters than this book does. While the philosophy is wonderful to explore, I felt that it could have been done equally as well with much more emphasis on a more interesting plot and compelling characters. Three stars for this one."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"One of the most overtly political science fiction novels - and one certainly deserving of the term \\"speculative fiction\\" - ever published, \\"The Dispossessed\\" remains Ursula K.

Le Guin offers readers a captivatingly poignant portrait of Shevek as he contends with the almost polyglot nature of Urras' governments, which are predominantly capitalist in orientation, rejecting the notion of \\"fairness\\" that is prevalent on Arras; a world where there are no laws that govern the behavior of its human residents. While Le Guin describes the vast inequities that exist still on Urras, she also emphasizes the importance of personal liberty, and by referring to both Arras and Urras as though they are the polar opposites, the \\"Yin and Yang \\", of human political behavior she does imply that both are of equal importance, especially with regards to Shevek's quest toward developing the ansible.

LeGuinn novel I ever read, and I loved it. I then went back and started the Hanish cycle from the begining (according to in-verse chronology.) This is hard sci-Fi, but it's more focused on anthropology and sociology then on astronomy and physics. Not that the physics are bad, they are just not the focus. Neither is the plot really, but it has a good one. Oh yah, it's also beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Shevek is a brilliant physicist from the barren anarchist world of Anarres. His work could revolutionise interstellar society, permitting instantaneous communication - maybe even instantaneous travel - between the worlds of humanity. But, in contrast to the idealism of Anarres, he finds his work undervalued and even repressed by jealous colleagues. Frustrated, he travels to Anarres's capitalist sister world of Urras, hoping to find more tolerance there but instead becoming embroiled in politics, rebellion and war.The Dispossessed is widely considered to be one of Ursula Le Guin's finest novels and is arguably her most ambitious work. The book asks nothing less than how best should human society function and by what means. Le Guin picks two popular models, that of a semi-communist state and a capitalist one, and pits them against one another. She is not interested in 'proving' the values of one over the other, instead comparing and contrasting the strengths and weaknesses of both and also the affect they have on the individual, particularly on the individual who has a great, transformational idea but whom is seen by others purely as a pawn or something to be crushed.The novel relies on this thematic idea to sustain it, but the actual plot structure is also intriguing. The book alternates chapters between the present-day storyline (Shevek on Urras) and events in his past (Shevek growing up on Anarres). We see the present-day Shevek as being an open-minded, questioning individual and how he has changed from his earlier incarnation as a blinkered man who accepts dogmatic ideas as fact (such as the notion that Urras is a corrupt capitalist state that will one day destroy itself), with later Anarres chapter depicting his shift in belief and motivation. Le Guin constantly has Shevek developing as a character even as she develops her ideas and the setting of the two worlds.The novel's greatest strength is its depiction of someone who seeks simple answers and is instead rewarded with having his worldview broadened and made more complicated. Shevek sees Urras as the answer to all his problems but instead of the utopia he was hoping for he finds a cluster of nations all feuding with one another (at one point fighting a Vietnam-style proxy war between two superpowers with the rulers acknowledging that nothing will change, only thousands dying for no real goal). Anarres is not rose-painted either: the world is desolate, the people poor and, for all of their freedom of choice, are often forced into jobs and roles they despise and are not well suited-for. The book is sometimes criticised for condemning capitalism and promoting communism/anarchism, but it's more complex than that. Le Guin's argument appears to be that all human societies are prone to dysfunction and corruption, no matter how well-meaning people are.The novel's ending is intriguing, as Shevek's conflicted views are commented upon by an outsider (an ambassador from an Earth ruined by war and ecological disaster) and her analysis spurs him to reconsider his approach. However, the book somewhat abruptly ends before Shevek's return to Anarres with him not having reached a conclusion. This is presumably because any answer would be unsatisfying and simplistic. Instead we are left with the questions, which are far more interesting.The Dispossessed (*****) is a thought-provoking novel that does not attempt to simplify complex matters and combines fascinating worldbuilding and character development with a refreshing plot structure and some rich prose. The novel is available now in the UK and USA."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I'm very particular about the books I read, and I rarely give out 5 stars. However, The Dispossessed is simply one of the best novels I've read, and definitely by favorite science fiction book in recent years.

Shevek lectures a lot, but he is a likable enough character that the reader never loses her affection for him.I recommend this book as a kind of time capsule -- what was the World like between 1966 and 1974? Like the best science fiction, it reveals more about the time it was written than the time Le Guin is writing about."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is an incredible book and I reccommend it to any thoughtful individual out there. Read it with an open mind."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"A novel beginning with anarchists on one planet, 'archists' on its twin. That is, the planets are astronomical twins; the anarchists' planet is only marginally habitable while that of their seeming bete noir is quite earth-like. Very earth-like, in fact, replete with capitalists and modified communists (the novel is a cold war artifact).The author attempts to explore what happens in societies, how people lose their freedom. The anarchists become somewhat bureaucratic and terribly provincial in the worst sense, that of pruning outcroppings of creativity by means of social opprobation.The capitalists, wealthy though the aristocrats are, are not free in the author's view. The society has its best analogue in 19th century Great Britain, complete with the class distinctions then normal.The text is turgid, even occasionally ungrammatical. The characters are shallow, mere ciphers for the author's didacticism. Of action we will not speak: there is none of which to speak.Looking at the other reviews, I see one that says he got the message: \\"capitalism good, communism bad.\\" I do wonder what book he read when he thought he was reading this book. The message here is \\"freedom,which implies responsibility, good; societal/governmental repression of freedom bad.\\" This is a message that is easy to endorse, even if the book was far from my favorite."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book is about what communists and socialists dream about, what's called anarcho-syndicalism. As such, it's very well executed. As an aspiring writer, I find anarchy a very interesting topic. This was a good book to get a feel of what what these types are thinking. I believe, the anarchists you heard about among the occupy wall st crowd were essentially of this variation. What I found interesting was to identify the inconsistencies with this vision. But I find Anarcho-capitalist's arguments much more compelling. For an understanding of that perspective, read 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' in fiction or 'A Market for Liberty' in non-fiction.These people are supposedly free, but they can't leave their planet, and no one is allowed to come to theirs, they can't name their own children, and a computer runs their lives even separating families which are very loosely sanctioned. And nobody who's in charge of keeping the 'ruling computer' uses it corruptly for their benefit, though there are hints of corruption that don't seem to spin out of control like we witness in every pretty much every society with a power structure.Every effort at communism end's in very big, corrupt government and severe poverty if not outright starvation, so this vision is totally impossible. Le Guin recognizes that such 'equality' means a more meager existence, but she under-appreciates the complete societal breakdown which ensues.This book has nothing to do with reality, but gives insight into a very odd and dangerous political philosophy.The book, while reasonably engaging and well written, is also overly philosophical and insufficiently story-based. The science fiction ideas are totally weak and erroneous. The protagonist travels around near light-speed without having to worry about aging differences with his loved ones. She doesn't seem to fully understand her invention of the Ansible which is reused from an earlier novel."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I came into this book with some high expectations and while it did disappointment the actual journey was a pleasant one. Le Guin's prose is crisp and makes her lengthy passages of idealogy very brisk and readable. She avoids the trap of many Utopian/Dystopian novels by attempting to show the flaws of the former and the good points of the later as well as noting that the seeds for either already exists in both societies. Her main character, Shevek, is engaging and isn't a bad person to spend this nearly 400 page novel with. The love story between he and Tavark is touching.The problem? I simply do not believe the communist commune society of Arrakis. Le Guin fails to demonstrate why this society would succeed when so many other like minded attempts have failed. Her reasoning seems to be that other attempts have been underminded because not everyone in the country is equally committed to the idealogy. Her answer? Build the society with nothing but 'true believers'. Its a nice thought but I think it denies a fundemental aspect of human nature and that's self-interest/preseveration. We're not an alturistic species by nature. Sure, many of us are quite willing to help our fellow man in his time of need, but at the sake of our own happiness and prosperity?As just one example, Le Guin presents a society where properity is forbidden. Rather, possesions are kept in warehouses and other such places and handed to anyone who needs them, then are promptly returned. Forgive my cynicism but I think that warehouse would be missing quite a few items after a few months. To Le Guin's credit she does make concessions that this type of behavior goes on but we're led to believe its among only a handful of individuals.If you find the description I just gave you plausible you'll probably find much about this book to enjoy. But if you're like me and have doubts about humanity's ablity to work soly for the benefit of their neighbor then you may want to avoid this. Libertarians, if you found this book through the Prometheus Awards realize that Le Guin's anarchist society is quite different than the one Heinlein presents in \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\" (what inspired me to try \\"The Dispossessed\\")."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book is definitely thought provoking, but I found it was not much fun to read. I think it might have been more relevant at the time of its original publication, but the premise of exploring alternative political systems (or lack thereof) is dated. I have to give the author credit for portraying the anarchic communtiy as far from perfect, but then again, this is blamed on the inevitability of capatalism. I don't believe anarchy could work, but I think I would have given the concept more credit than the author does. I don't think selfishness and the lust for power (other than what is needed for self preservation) is genetic or inevitable, but rather those traits are something that is learned."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There is precious little \\"science\\" in this Science Fiction masterpiece. Lovers of Vernor Vinge or Kim Stanley Robinson, hoping to discover a rock-solid hard SF tale, will likely be disappointed. Likewise, lovers of rock'em'sock'em space opera, or media tie-in books like Star Wars or Star Trek, will be similarly disappointed. \\"The Dispossessed\\" is a very quiet read, dwelling almost entirely on concepts of the individual human and his/her proper role in a properly-ordered society.I can see why this book gets a lot of traction with college professors and academic types. \\"The Dispossessed\\" panders to the conventional wisdom of the academic set, namely in that its protagonist is also an academic who perpetually steps outside boundaries and defies convention, eventually coming face to face with the 'evils' of capitalism, which in turn steer him back towards his native, idealic anarchism.From the standpoint of pure writing, this is an elegant read from start to finish. But my suspension of disbelief was greatly strained through much of the text because I couldn't believe in the Odonian society of Annares. Even assuming that all of the million original Settlers were fully committed to non-authoritarian anarchism, there is no reason to assume their descendants would be. If there is one constant about the human species, it's that children often think and act differently from their parents, no matter how they are raised. Thus the glass-fragile, idealized society on Annares would surely have collapsed within two or three generations, so that by the time 160 years had passed the descendants of the Settlement would have largely abandoned the socially-cooperative 'utopia' established by their forebearers.Meanwhile, A-Io on the planet Urras is something of a straw-man. If it was Le Guin's intention to criticize the United States and its capitalist economy, I think she failed. A-Io did not remind me of the U.S. as much as it reminded me of late 19th-century England, replete with royalty and class stratification and higher education being the playground of the very, very rich. Even if we timewarp back to the early 1970's, when this book was written, it's difficult to see America in A-Io; though the conflicts between A-Io and Thu read as directly analogous to the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.Again, as pure writing, this is an elegant book. That's why I gave it three stars, even if I think some of the politics and the assumptions behind them are flawed.For a fictionalized account of how true anarchy might REALLY function, I recommend Larry Niven's story, \\"Cloak of Anarchy.\\" As Larry himself is known to have quipped, the problem with anarchy is that it's too delicate; it falls apart at the slightest touch."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Thank you, Mrs. Le Guin, this book is a great gift for the reader."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is an excellent book. I had to read it for class, so it was kind of a drag. However, after the first few chapters I became completely immersed in the book and could not put it down. It is very thoughtful, intelligent book that really questions our societies. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There is no need for a lengthy discussion of Ursula le Guin's intriguing premise and fine execution, her masterful description of contending utopias. Other reviewers have done that.I do want to compliment the author on writing what is one of the finest depictions of love - that of Takver and Shevik - that I have read in any genre. Her prose is as always delicate and eloquent, suggesting great vistas with an economy of means that one can only read with joy and - I admit - envy. But these two characters...breathtaking. The warmth and earthiness of their love is infectious, and, implicitly, the strongest argument in favour of Anarres' ambigious utopia. I cannot recommend this wonderful book enough - oh, and one final qualification: slow? Lacking in action? This is completely dependent on your definition of action. If you think realistic character development is action, then this book is completely for you. If you think guns, swordfights and the like are the only way to constitute action, then you are less lucky - although I would add that the massacre in Nio Esseia is one of the most ghastly scenes I've ever read!Ursula le Guin makes few bones about her own philosophies - but even if you cannot agree with the direction of her thought, you can sit back and be warmed by her gentle, beautiful writing."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Which begs the question: aren't all utopias (beginning with the original) thoughtful? Yes and no. Quite a deal of thought usually goes into utopian societies, yet most, in my opinion, studiously ignore the question of how actual, real people would live in these societies. The populations of Utopian novels are often slightly plastic, as if they were facsimiles of people rather than the bonafide article.And this is where Le Guin steps in. The anarchist society she depicts in The Dispossessed is clearly utopian, but there is trouble in paradise. Isolated and calcifying, the society on Annares is crumbling. Why? Because as well-organized as it is, it ignores certain human tendencies (inertia, dogmatism, and those other insidious beasts of the mind) that threaten the ideals of freedom the society was founded on.But all this tells you nothing about the story. In a word, it's wonderful. Like most sci-fi, the preoccupation with some imagined changes--in this case mostly sociological and political--can distract one from the plot, but overall the characters are well-developed and believable. Le Guin is a talented, impassioned writer, and she shines in The Dispossessed. The pages are overflowing with ideas, impressions, events, and emotions that are at once intimate and inspiring.I'm ending this review. If you've read Le Guin but not The Dispossessed, do yourself a favor and read it now. You won't be disappointed; in my opinion its easily her best sci-fi novel. If you haven't read Le Guin at all, do yourself a favor and read her now; in my opinion she's easily one of the best writers in science-fiction or in any field."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book deserves to take its place among the classics that explore the possibilities of creating a just and content society. Unlike Walden 2, or Utopia, the thesis of the Dispossessed is that utopias cannot be realized: the anarchist society of the title already carries the seeds of its own destruction. This is a necessary read for those who mistakenly believe that the &quot;End of History&quot; has arrived."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book is very involved and chalanges you to think, like most of Ursula Le Guin's book it chalanges our values and our ideas of morality. Not a &quot;light&quot; read but one worth reading more than once.It is classic science fiction like early Asimov and Heinlein. I have read hundreds of books and own over a hundred mostly Science Fiction this book has been my favorite for over a decade, ever since I first read it."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The Disposessed is one of the best books that I have ever read. The plot, setting, and characters stand alone as an excellent novel, but LeGuin goes further, weaving in a full political dialogue about anarchism, capitalism, and the meaning of freedom. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes to think."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is my favorite Le Guin book. As much a political science book as science fiction.Also one one of the feew utopias written after WW2. The title refers to an anarchist society that lives on the moon who do not have possesion. Far from one sided this book shows the problems of both societies through the eyes of Shevek,an Anarres Physicst. Shevek has problems with both his society because the descendents have lost their political idealism and with Urras' because the greed and corruption of it's captialism . A complex work of thought with no easy to find solutions. And a good introduction to the theories of Anarchism."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book is a five hundred page social commentary, decribing a utopian communist commune. The main character is a physist who is out to resolve conflicts withing the communes planet and it's sister plant. A Earthlike planet with a political situation, not unlike the one we have now.The reason I &quot;disliked&quot; the book is the political and social commentary that is at the center of this book just did not sit with me at all. Le Guin just didn't convince me that this society had fixed the issues within communism and anarcy that make them unstable, and have led to some of the most promising nations in the last hundrend years and driven them into the ground. It would be nice if people could live the way she suggests, but the book does not give any real answers. A famous econimist recently stated in his book that all econimic systems are inherantly unstable, and that strong regalotory systems are needed to stop periodic crashes and times of econimic chaos. This hurts this book because this is a political book that is about the politics of a perfect world, and validity of the political system is the center of the story.That being said, this is a brilliant piece of writting. As much as I disliked the politics of this book, the story is very well told, with engaging characters, and a well depicted world. I find it nice to sometimes read books about ideas I disagree with, it makes me re-evaluate my point of view, either changing my ideas or making my beliefs stronger.This book did not change my political ideas at all, but it at least gave a good account of itself. And that makes it well worth reading, no matter how distastefull the book feels."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Like her Left Hand Of Darkness, Le Guin's Dispossessed is a sharp commentary on the insanities of human society. Yet what has stayed with me over the years since I first met Shevek is the integrity of this truly good man who stands firm in what he believes. While Le Guin pulls no punches when it comes to deprivation and human pain, I finished the book with a sense of hope for a hopeless world."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The title of my review says it all. When it comes to philisophical soft SF jam packed with insights into the contemporary world, there's no one better than LeGuin. Shevek, in my opinion, remains one of the most well-written characters ever to come out of science fiction. Be sure to read this one along with her earlier work, The Left Hand of Darkness."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Quite conceivably the best SF novel ever written - if that phrase means anything at all. There are two different achievements in this novel. Firstly, it is a superb portrayal of the mind of a scientist, showing the slow conceptual struggle towards a new idea (instantaneous communication). Worth reading just for that. The second achievement is that UlG explores the balance between the individualistic and collectivist strains in all societies. The device that she uses for this is a world (Urras) much like earth which contains mixed economies and socialist states around which orbits a moon (Annarres) containing an exiled colony of anarchists. The protagonist, Shevek, is a physicist on Annarres who becomes aware of the constraints of the anarchistic society and journeys to Urras. Here he sees the limitations of state power, whether capitalist or socialist. The superb, and vitally important, narrative structure that is used is Shevek's concept of simultanaeity: the novel intertwines two narratives (Shevek leaves Annares, and Shevek leaves Urras) which allows UlG to raise the problems with both types of system simultaneously. This is not a political rant (or Rand, perhaps) but a story about an enquiring mind. And yes, it does have characters. It does what SF is supposed to do: it frees us from the tyranny of present fashion."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"As his anarchist society threatens to degenerate into hierarchy and authoritarianism, brilliant physicist/philosopher Shevek decides to shake things up in an attempt to jump-start the revolution that must be lived every day. So he heads off to the capitalist world of Urras - the historical home of his people from which they fled into self-imposed exile nearly 200 years earlier - in order to trade the extremely powerful \\"Grand Temporal Theory\\" that exists only in his head for a chance to forge connections between the people of Urras and the anarchists of nearby Annares.However, being an anarchist, Shevek is not a very good trader. He quickly finds himself trapped in an invisible prison, carefully isolated from the restless masses of Urras, while the leaders of Urras try to get the Grand Temporal Theory from him in order to establish their rule over the entirety of known space. Breaking out of his luxurious jail, Shevek joins up with socialist revolutionaries and tries to make sure his life's work is not misused.\\"The Dispossessed\\" is written in an interesting fashion, with flashbacks covering the course of Shevek's life routinely interrupting the narrative. While some might be annoyed by the story's resulting disjointedness, I personally was not bothered. The flashbacks let Le Guin explore her ideas of how an anarchist society would operate, how life, love and politics would work in a government-less world. For me, being able to explore the conflicts and tensions between society and the individual, between centralization and autonomy, between responsibility and freedom - this proved nearly as interesting as the plot itself.Although \\"The Dispossessed\\" is technically a work of science fiction, it seems to be primarily an exploration of society and the human spirit. The physics that forms the base of the plot is presented more as philosophy than hard science and the level of technology on Urras and Annares seems hardly more advanced than what exists today. Overall, this book has excellent characters, a good plot, and a whole approach that is sure to make you think about government, society, and humanity itself. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There are three groups of people in the world: those whose favorite LeGuin book is THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS; those whose favorite LeGuin book is THE DISPOSSESSED; and ... well, let's not waste our time on the poor fools who don't even have a favorite LeGuin book.I'm of the Dispossessed party. It's possibly the most perfect SF novel I've ever read, and certainly one of my five all-time favorites. (The other four? C.J. Cherryh's CYTEEN, Bruce Sterling's SCHISMATRIX, William Gibson's COUNT ZERO.) But whether you like The Dispossessed or hate it - and many readers do hate it - it is the book that changed everything. And you can't call yourself a science fiction reader until you've grappled with it.The Dispossessed is one of those sf novels, like Orwell's 1984, whose literary production values are so high that it's hard to talk about it purely as science fiction. It 's also a quiet novel, even by LeGuin's standards, and it offers pretty cold comfort to readers in search of high-tech thrills and chills. What it does offer is believable characters, unresolvable moral dilemmas, and ideas that will rattle around in your head for the rest of your life chipping away at the received orthodoxies.Read it. If you don't like it now, put it down and try again in five years or so. Repeat as needed. Eventually this book will change your life."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"my favorite book is &quot;grapes of wrath.&quot; number 2 is &quot;the fountainhead.&quot; number 3 is &quot;the dispossessed.&quot; it's a fascinating story of how life might be lived if there were true equality and no government. the little touches were nice, like how weeks were called &quot;decads&quot; and lasted 10 days and how the words for sex do NOT imply doing something to someone else (screw, nail, do) but rather an equal consensualness (copulate). also, i liked how the children were taught the ancient history of laws, cops and prisons and this prompted them to want to play &quot;jail&quot; with each begging to be the prisoner because they had no locked doors in their lives. The talk of this being a &quot;utopian&quot; world is interesting, because le guin takes great pains to show that the anarchist world is NOT utopian, just better than one where greed and violence are the driving forces. for anyone curious about how anarchy could really work, this is a must. but more so, it's a fun read with lots of action, love and ideas. i still think about shevak, just as i think about tom joad and howard roark."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This compact book is easy to read and absolutely gripping, yet it has a depth to it that unparalleled in any fiction I've read. I have re-read this book more than any other, and I never cease to contemplate the ideas contained in it.I can't even begin to describe all the issues that this book tackles, but to just name a few, it tackles: distribution of resources and its effect on a society, the relationship between language and culture, the hidden assumptions behind how we conduct scientific research, how people can coerce others in a non-violent environment, what motivates people to work, how people view relationships, etc. The most amazing thing is that the book relates these issues to each other: it shows how one area of life (for example scientific research) that we might think of as completely separate and unbiased, is actually intimately tied up in subjective areas (such as political beliefs, or the distribution of resources).This book is just amazing and everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Ditto to all the five-star comments. I read this book after reading Left Hand for a class assignment and flipped-out over it (better than Left Hand - is that possible?) Le Guin has a way of getting under your skin - her characters are memorable with their thought-provoking dialogue. Le Guin is a very talented author - don't miss out!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It has been said that utopias are just social engineering, there are no human beings in utopias, only their functionalities. It may or may not be true in other utopias, but this &quot;ambigious&quot; utopia has real human beings in it. It is not about a perfect world, or a world where there is no suffering but only about an anarchistic (and I believe probably more human) world where the real freedom is not confused with capitalist slogans.Mrs. LeGuin is too clever to avoid her book becomming a book of slogans, a book to be preached. She, in her soft way, shows an alternative, not decides about the good and the bad.The book is not some science-fiction, it is a novel, and as great a novel as Crime and Punishment. It tells the story of Shevek, a great phycisist, a good lover, a wanderer, and an amator philosopher seeking for the truth. He is not a hero, he has his mistakes and virtues, like all of us.I think Mrs. LeGuin is one of the best writers of all times, and this novel may be her best. I have read it many many times, very few books inspired me as much. By the way, if you like LeGuin, I'd recommend you also to read &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Four Ways to Unforgiveness&quot; Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a wonderful book, the best utopian novel written in English. The only comparable book is Zamyatin's We. The quality of writing is splendid. Set in a planetary system with 2 competing societies, a conventional capitalistic society on one planet and an anarchist utopia on its companion moon. The hero is a visionary scientist, a scientific revolutionary committed deeply to the ideals of his anarchist society. This book is one of the few that deals well with the issue of social obligations of scientists. It is a shrewd and often moving analysis of the necessity and costs of pursuing noble ideals and the obstinacy of human nature in the face of ideology. This is one of those genre works whose quality trascends its genre."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a nice book, and it kept me engaged, amazingly. There isn't much action here, just interesting themes and thoughts and the struggles of one man to explore ideas and to fit into society, both of which become herculean tasks. Do not get this book if you want exciting sci-fi action or if you want sci-fi technology. This is a book for sociologists and explorers of human society."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This was one of LeGuin's earlier works and still one of her best -- second only, in my opinion, to _The Left Hand of Darkness._ Shevek is a once-in-a-century theoretical physicist and also an Odonion -- an anarcho-syndicalist on the world of Anarres, which is a satellite of the thoroughly capitalist-imperialist planet of Urras, from which the Odonians had removed themselves two centuries before. But Anarrian society is becoming infected with egoism and bureaucratic attitudes, and Shevek finds himself to deal any longer with the jealous resistance his theories have created among his scientific colleagues. Shevek and his friends undertake the necessity of rebelling against the permanent anarchist rebellion, and this involves Shevek making the journey to Urras, both to pursue his research and to attempt to communicate with the anarchist underground there. It's a fascinating story with very fully realized characters, both in their human personalities and in their sociopolitical attitudes. The Urras-Anarres dichotomy, of course, is a straw man LeGuin has set up for the purposes of exploring how a true anarchist society might function, and she succeeds admirably.

However, just because it is a &quot;comic book&quot; and uses well-selected illustrations to drive home its point (often with considerable good-natured humor), do not think that it isn't also an insightful and well-researched guide into the workings of the capitalist system.This book isn't a piece of &quot;free market&quot; propoganda. The author consistantly points out the shortcomings, absurdities, and out right injustice of the system. In fact, his examination of why so many Americans continue to support the capitalist system, when it is clearly contrary to the best interests of 9 out of 10 of us, is among the best I've seen.After reading this book you will know the basic textbook concepts of economics. You will know mecantilism from monetism, and microeconomics from macroeconomics. You will be familiar with the theories of Adam Smith, Karl Marx, John Maynard Keynes, F.A. Hayek, and Milton Freidman. You will understand the law of the falling rate of profit, and how paying lower wages can only temporarily offset this. You will know what a multinational corporation is and how they operate. Indeed, the author's warning about &quot;corporatism&quot; (in 1981) is down right prophetic.Some people might be tempted to write this book off as dated or obsolete because it was first published in 1981. On the contrary, because of the good old &quot;business cycle&quot; conditions are once again very simular to those of the early eighties....The author is no wild-eyed radical.

There are very few competitive markets of the sort envisaged by Adam Smith and his followers. To an increasing degree, capitalist economies are directed by the entirely visible hands of monopolists, multinational giants and domestic oligopolists. And finally, the argument that competition, even where it is to be found, must enhance the public good is deflated by the ever-increasing environmental damage inflicted by externalities.\\" (Pg. 170)"},{"Title":"Capitalism for Beginners","review":"Quite possibly the best introduction to Capitalism I have yet come across, certainly the most sharable (which is a feature I really like.) I would say that its only weakness is that it ends just as Reagan and Thatcher and Friedman and Hayek begin to run amok.

Also, men's studies fulfills the most when it covers the intersectionality of masculinity and other areas. Books have been produced about older men, black men, bisexual men, rich men, poor men, and finally this book publishes work on rural men. Like much men's studies, the contributors are both male and female.Though this book includes photographs of men of color and non-Christian men, not one article spoke of rural men of color. There are articles that speak of racist, and religiously intolerant rural men, but that did not suffice in terms of diversity. Because many men of color and immigrant men work on farms, this is a sore absence.I applaud the editors for including articles about the UK, New Zealand, Sweden, and the US. However, this book only mentions rural men in industrialized countries. What about the countless rural men in developing nations? The status of the US is intriguing here. Only a few chapters cover this nation and they are placed somewhere in the middle of the book. Did the contributors need to cover Americans in order to get published or did they want to prove that the US is just one country of many that has rural men?R. Connell is the godfather of men's studies. Having him contribute a chapter somewhat blesses the text. Cornel West once did that in the book about Black men in academia. Now that I think of it, Patti LaBelle blessed the young songstresses who remade \\"Lady Marmalade.\\" Still, I didn't think Connell's entry was strong. It just proved that he can write on history, rather than just sociology.I wasn't wowed by this book, but I truly appreciate its addition to the genre."},{"Title":"Dare to Inquire: Sanity and Survival for the 21st Century and Beyond","review":"NOVA took on the question of whether psychiatry is really science (&quot;Freud Under Analysis&quot;).

I don't expect to see a NOVA on &quot;Astrology Under Analysis.&quot;General Semantics (GS), and its founder Alfred Korzybski, have enough substance to them to warrant attack. Max Black, Martin Gardner, Steven Pinker, and other bright, sincere attackers have delivered their criticisms of GS. Having read Dr. Bruce Kodish's defense of GS against the attackers (&quot;Contra Max Black&quot; 1998), I feel if Korzybski were alive today he'd be patting Kodish on the back and urging him to &quot;Give them another whack!&quot;But GS is a philosophy opposed to fundamentalism and intolerance. How does a tolerant person defend anything? The answer is in the book's title: with daring inquiry. The inquiry part says &quot;Here are my beliefs, tentative though they are.&quot; The daring part is selling one's ideas with the best logic one can muster without being fundamentalist. Kodish excells in both.Speaking of &quot;Dare to Inquire,&quot; he says &quot;In it I give my present responses to some perennial questions about the nature of the world and of humans, the role of science in society, the 'meaning' and purpose of life, and how we humans can get along with one another. Whether or not you agree with my conclusions, I hope they inspire you , the reader, as you formulate answers for yourself.&quot; Now THAT's tolerant and undogmatic! That's Inquiry. Now to the Daring.Kodish attacks fundamentalism with a fervor. He reminds me of William Perry's concept of the &quot;committed relativist&quot;--one who knows he doesn't have the only map of the territory, but who champions his map against less-well-thought-out ones. And his map is a modern cornucopia of GS tachniques (abstracting, non-allness, indexing, etc.) applied to perception, mathematics, politics...and even religion.I (and probably you) don't hold to some of Kodish's conclusions. But that's just content. His process is impressive. Were I on the staff of NOVA I wouldn't produce the episode &quot;General Semantics Under Analysis&quot; without Dr. Kodish's consulting advice.Bob Eddy"},{"Title":"Dare to Inquire: Sanity and Survival for the 21st Century and Beyond","review":"Life can be pretty confusing these days. With newspapers being used to spout forth political agendas instead of unbiased news, international and national terrorism rampant, and governmental officials showing us the path to unethical behavior it only increases the confusion. The solution, at least on a personal level, is through inquiry. &quot;Dare to Inquire&quot; examines scientific and ethical inquiry as a pathway to truth.The focus in the book is on a field of study known as general semantics. Using the principles of general semantics you can remove illusions that appear to be reality. In fact a major focus of general semantics is that what we perceive to be fact and reality is only a portion or one aspect of true reality. By opening your understanding to more fully grasp all of reality it opens the doors to deeper understanding, happiness and better communication in all areas of life.Bruce Kodish is very blunt about the fact that this is Humanistic philosophy. Those who have a dogmatic opposition to humanism will not like the book, others will find it interesting, informative and a recommended read."},{"Title":"Dare to Inquire: Sanity and Survival for the 21st Century and Beyond","review":"There is an old Zuni Indian saying that there are no truth, only stories.Bruce Kodish seems to have lost track of what is one of the most important statement of General Semantics: &quot;The Map is not the territory.&quot;While Mr. Kodish is eager to point out what he perceives as others' failings (i.e. mistaking the map for the territory) the author is all too willingly and self-conplacently loosing track of his own shortcomings in this matter. A major focus of General Semantics is that what we perceive to be fact and reality is only a portion or one aspect of reality. A thing the author does make sure to remind us of but then quickly forgets as he proceeds to present to his readers HIS view of the world.The world is what it is. We can make all kinds of maps and models of how the world works, and some of them can be very useful, and we can talk about them with great benefit. But the models and maps and any words one can put together can never do more than approximate the actual world or the actual phenomena being examined. The actual territory is beyond verbal description.Bruce Kodish would have us believe that his own political/ideological views are an accurate description of reality, while the views of those with whom he disagrees are based on an erroneous perception of that same reality (i.e. Bruce's reality.) In so doing he falls prey to the &quot;either-or&quot; fallacy and &quot;black-white&quot; thinking he only seems able to perceive in others, thus exposing his own dogmatism and biases-which are many! This makes &quot;Dare to Enquire&quot; more an exercise in demagoguery rather than the sober appraisal it pretends to be.The main goal of Korzybski's General Semantics is better human relationships at all levels of our human interactions-personal, interpersonal, societal, international. This can be accomplished by being highly and unceasingly attentive to the ways we speak, listen, understand, interpret, give meanings to, give values to, 'think' about, and evaluate words, symbols, and other features of our human and physical environments.A lot of excellent books and essays have been written on that subject. I wish I could say that &quot;Dare to Inquire&quot; is one of them but it is not."},{"Title":"The Arian controversy (Epochs of church history)","review":"This brief history concerning the Arian Controversy is the fruitful product of many years of studies which the author, Henry M.

In my opinion, the book was a useful addition to the course. It is not particularly technical, but does a good job of describing fairly technical issues -- e.g. screening vs. signalling -- in plain English. My students generally seemed to find more technical items, e.g. journal articles, easier to follow after reading Hillier.I would suppose the main use of this book would be as a supplement to a graduate course. It isn't technical enough for PhD level work, one would have to go to another source for this, but it is a nice presentation of the basic ideas of the economics of asymmetric information. If someone needs a good understanding of such, this would be worth reading.It does not have much in the way of problems to solve."},{"Title":"The Economics of Asymmetric Information","review":"I really like the subject of the book, because I find that information play a very big role in any economy and in specific in the financial markets,and that We're in the midst of a major revolution where we are moving from the industrial age to the information age. what is unique about this book is that it coveres and measures the value of information in different markets, rather than focusing only on one market as in other books.Moreover, the problems resulted from the asymmetric information was highlited, and their impact on different markets were cleary explained. Least but not last, by the end of each part in the book some other reading were recommended,allowing us to extensive our knowledge.personally I find it a very interesting topic which I am thinking seriously of writing my thesis about it, and I find this book a very beneficial and diversified one to me.

The writing is long-winded, the author's ideas are sometimes (in Volume II) flaky, but the content of the book is too good for this to matter. Theweleit studies the art and literature of a particular group of men--the Freikorps--who were essentially disaffected former soldiers in Germany after the First World War. These men developed their own groups and their own culture, and became the firsts-in-line to man Hitler's new army in the '30s (the Brown Shirts and Black Shirts). What is so fascinating about this book is that it approaches the study of this group by looking at the images of women in their writings. Initially, the author goes in great detail over letters these men wrote; then he looks at their magazines and novels. It turns out that through their images of women, a whole vision of human personal and political reality can be decoded. A particular vision of women (a complex typology of types of women: the mother, the sister, the white nurse, the red nurse, etc.) turns out to be intimately interwoven with a fascist approach to human life--AND this vision turns out to be the core of a great deal of our own imagery and political self-perception. The first 225 pages of Book I are the crucial part to read, and then you can skip around through the rest of Volumes I and II as you see fit. The discussion of Freud and Medusa in this section and the discussion of the notions of deterritorialization and reterritorialization in the work of Deleuze and Guattar are specially valuable segments. This book is also a good introduction to some important Weimar-era history, especially regarding Rosa Luxemburg and the Spartacists. I recommend this book to anyone in the humanities and to any generally intellectually minded adult. If you take the time to get into it, it will change your perception of some important things."},{"Title":"MALE FANTASIES Volume 1: Women, Floods, Bodies, History","review":"Examines fascism as a Reichian phenomenon gone awry - the fascist male experiences ego-dissolution in early infancy, finds it threatening, and so builds for himself a &quot;body armor&quot; within which are contained such &quot;female&quot; traits and emotions (unaknowledged) as weakness, fear, guilt, etc. Through repetitive conditioning and a brutal pedagogy, these negative, shadowy perceptions are then projected outward onto the despised classes of scoiety and made to represent the chaotic forces of the collective cultural unconscious. Like Adorno said, &quot;fascism is psychoanalysis in reverse.&quot;"},{"Title":"MALE FANTASIES Volume 1: Women, Floods, Bodies, History","review":"A deeply felt and extensively documented look at the lives and times of these men in Weimar Germany. The author looks unflinching at the Freikorps men, precursors of the Nazis, with all that they have very different from most of us today--and all they have that is all too common with us today. But here I am stressing the conclusion. The point is, he honestly gets his conclusions out of huge amounts of documentation on everyday life. These men represent an extreme, of course, but their motives and life-conditions were very close to many people in the Weimar Republic. It is a great book on that period, which also relates that time to our own."},{"Title":"The City of the Golden Sun: Sequel to the Fisherman's Son","review":"Marilyn Peake's \\"The City of the Golden Sun\\" is a charming extension of her children's novel \\"The Fisherman's Son.\\" As the second book in the trilogy, \\"The City of the Golden Sun\\" builds naturally on the first while indulging young readers with adventure equal to the first and more magical fantasy.Wiley and his new friends from the mysterious, ancient City of the Golden Sun find themselves transported back to this fabled place once again by Elden the dolphin and Beluga the whale, along with a few more dolphin cohorts. But this time the friends are immersed, not only below the waves, but into a long-ago era when the City of the Golden Sun thrived above the ocean as a monument to the best that humankind has to offer.Ms. Peake sets aside the harder life lessons her young hero Wiley had to learn in the first novel of this trilogy. This book allows young readers to play and enjoy more along side Wiley and his friends. But that's not to say those readers still aren't learning higher standards and values. Where \\"The Fisherman's Son\\" explored the sadder examples we find all too often in adults, \\"The City of the Golden Sun\\" gives its young readers the nobler ones: honorable leaders, loving parents, supportive friends and neighbors.As with \\"The Fisherman's Son\\", this novel is geared toward ages eight to twelve with a simple, concise style perfect for this skill level. Even so, there will be just enough new words to have your child coming to you or the dictionary to expand his or her mind. Once again, Ms. Peake deserves a Five Star rating for creating a book easy to read, that encourages healthy fantasy and creates a desire in young readers to learn."},{"Title":"The City of the Golden Sun: Sequel to the Fisherman's Son","review":"The City of the Golden SunBy Marilyn PeakeAuthor Housewww.authorhouse.com2004ISBN # 1-4184-1057-8Large Trade Paperback159 pages$ 12.25 USPicking up right where \\"The Fisherman's Son\\" left off, this sequel proves to be just as enjoyable and well written with no let down at all in reading quality. This second installment of a planned trilogy finds Wiley O'Mara and the six children he rescued from the city at the bottom of the ocean back on dry land. Wiley is faced with the challenge of explaining their presence in his small village. He also is faced with explaining to the boys how things work now and with helping them to adjust to their new surroundings.As Wiley makes plans to obtain food and clothing for the boys of various ages and temperaments, he begins to realize just how daunting his task of assimilating the kids will be. He soon realizes that a neighboring village some distance away but reachable, might be the best place for the boys. To get there they will have to pass through the magical forest that borders the area. The boys disbelief in such things is quickly vanquished when the meet the magical Lucinda who tells them to go back to the ocean and wait for Elden. The quest has begun.What follows is a rich fantasy tale of exploration as the boys go back in time to \\"The City of the Golden Sun.\\" As before, the writing is clear, the descriptions compelling, and the tale vivid as most of the action takes place in the distant past in a time that could have been. Like the first book, this sequel appeals to young and old.Like \\"The Fisherman's Son\\" this fun read is perfect for the pre-teen reader. With a minimum of violence, plenty of action, and lots of history, as well as a continuing appreciation for nature, beauty and magic, the reader is swept away. Wiley's maturity as a character continues to grow and this sequel follows nicely the original novel with no gaps in the tale or changes in writing style."},{"Title":"The City of the Golden Sun: Sequel to the Fisherman's Son","review":"In Marilyn Peake's THE FISHERMAN'S SON, we found her main character, Wiley O'Mara, harrowing over a difficult quest with the aid of a dolphin, Elden, and a magical cup that allowed him to communicate with the mammal. His quest was simple, to rescue six boys lost in an underworld city that lived many, many years ago.Fulfilling this mission through various obstacles that ran in his path, Marilyn Peake's newest addition to this trilogy, THE CITY OF THE GOLDEN SUN, finds Wiley once more in another quest. However, this one is not of courage as much as it is in explanations. Wiley's task is to make the presence of these \`lost boys' known to his villagers, to help the boys cope with their new surroundings, which proves to be a feat in itself. One boy in particular stands in Wiley's way by refusing to believe in the magical cup, and Lucinda's magical powers that guide Wiley in both books.What ensues is a magical tale of rediscovering your homeland and coming to the realization that a catastrophe overpowered it.Taking you alongside the boys, Marilyn weaves a tale full of descriptive details making you think you're swimming alongside Wiley and the boys as they approach the Golden Gates of a kingdom that blossomed in riches. The historical reenactment of what possibly took place within these gates, will mesmerize readers.Although the book is written for the younger reader , anyone can enjoy this action-filled compelling tale written in narrative form."},{"Title":"The City of the Golden Sun: Sequel to the Fisherman's Son","review":"Rebeccasreads highly recommends THE CITY OF THE GOLDEN SUN as another grand adventure from Marilyn Peake that will keep young readers glued to the pages.

It takes a masterful writer to make such an amoral protagonist work, in any context. The other two tales, involving a wife-swapping and a widow ready to try intimacy again, are less gripping, and a bit anticlimactic with their payoffs."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"Roald Dahl could easily be the best ever writer of 'twist in the tale' short stories. A few years ago in the UK ( and I'm sure on PBS in the USA ) there was a television show called &quot;Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected&quot; in which some of his stories were dramatized. It was not too successful and I suspect that the reason was that Mr.Dahl's stories are stories to be read. That is, read on a dark night, with a strong drink close at hand, by the light of a single reading lamp.... Then you get the full effect. Yes, these stories are chilling and bizarre and simply wonderful. Though it is not in this book, everyone should read Mr.Dahl's story entitled 'Pig'. In this reviewer's opinion that was the best story that he ever wrote. The word 'shocking' does not even come close."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"..This is easily Dahl's most sfnal work, and is mostly erotic humor, a micro-genre that is in woefully short supply.Here's a sample from \\"Bitch\\", my favorite. The protag has been dosed with the world's most potent aphrodosiac:[quote] ...the two of us were millions of miles up in outer space, flying through the universe in a shower of meteorites all red and gold. I was riding her bareback... \\"Faster!\\" I shouted, jabbing long spurs into her flanks. \\"Go faster!\\" Faster and still faster she flew, spurting and spinning around the rim of the sky, her mane streaming with sun, and snow waving out of her tail. The sense of power I had was overwhelming. I was unassailable, supreme. I was the Lord of the Universe, scattering the planets and catching the stars in the palm of my hand...Oh, ecstasy and ravishment! Oh, Jericho and Tyre and Sidon! The walls came tumbling down and the firmament disintegrated, and out of the smoke and fire of the of the explosion, the sitting-room in the Waldorf Towers came swimming slowly back into my consciousness like a rainy day...\\"What a pity that Roald Dahl didn't write more adult fiction. Anyway, if you haven't read Switch Bitch, some wonderfully sly, bawdy and remarkably well-written entertainment awaits you. Bon appetit!Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"Until recently, I didn't realize that Roald Dahl -- the famous writer of such children's classics asCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,James and the Giant Peach, and theFantastic Mr. Fox-- wrote adult-oriented stories as well. It was probably as surprising as when I found out Judy Blume wrote novels likeWifey.I decided to see what these stories were like and ordered SWITCH BITCH. SWITCH BITCH is a collection of four short stories of Dahl's. While I enjoy and appreciate the short story form, I typically don't read short story collections because too often I feel a bit cheated. I invest my time in getting to know the characters, begin to like and understand them, and then before I know it, the story ends and the characters are gone. Forever. This is not a reason to not read (or write) short stories, but it can sometimes be disappointing to a reader to get involved again and again with different characters so quickly.The title of this short story collection comes from combining the titles of two of the included short stories: \\"The Great Switcheroo\\" and \\"Bitch.\\" Also included are \\"The Visitor\\" and \\"The Last Act.\\" \\"The Visitor\\" and \\"Bitch\\" are stories about the fictitious oversexedUncle Oswald. Apparently, Dahl wrote a lot of short stories involving this character's travels and exploits. \\"The Great Switcheroo\\" involves something of a Twilight Zone-like story where two men plot to have sex with the other man's wife without her knowledge. \\"The Last Act\\" involves a lonely widow who tries to move on after the death of her beloved husband.There are consistent themes throughout the four short stories included in SWITCH BITCH. Each of the four short stories included in this collection have a bit of suspense to them. It's not in a thriller sort of way, mind you, but once I read one story and realized the technique Dahl was using to write each story, I found myself a bit hooked, very curious, and rushing toward the end to see what happens. Additionally, each story has a twist at the end, and I found myself trying to guess what was going to happen, much like anO. Henryshort story. Lastly, each story introduces some sort of scientific theory that is relevant to the story. Whether they're true or not is anyone's guess, but they're interesting enough to believe for the sake of the plot.Ironically, the introduction says that these short stories were originally published in -- of all places -- Playboy magazine; however, details of the sexual encounters are glossed over, and the narrator always says, \\"I won't bore you with the details...\\" or \\"I'm sure you can guess what happened next...\\" Hello, it's Playboy! I guess now I can honestly say that I read Playboy just for the articles.I was quite entertained by Dahl's short stories in this small collection. So much so, that I'll probably look into buying and reading more. They really held my attention and seem to withstand the test of time."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"I rarely read short stories anymore because I think there are very few good writers in this genre. The reason for that, I think, is because good short stories are hard to write. You've got to be able to pack a lot of punch into a small space. And this is exactly what Roald Dahl is able to do. He creates memorably eccentric characters and unexpected plot elements, usually culminating in something deliciously surprising by story's end. I recommend this collection for anyone who appreciates well-crafted short stories.

Dahl included a lot of elements that lent depth to the character. But the ending disappointed me; it was so gimmicky! I felt rather cheated, as though the whole story had been a long road to a cheap punch line. What about all that character detail? Had it been for nothing?The rest of the stories seemed the same way, too.I wouldn't call the book &quot;worthless.&quot; It was certainly entertaining. But by the third story, all I could do was listen and try to guess what the next punch line would be, and the layers of the characters seemed to lose all meaning."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"When I first read Dahl's adult writings as a kid, I was a Wonka and Peach fan. I was surprised to see how easily he dealt with far darker themes, and as an adult I appreciate his wit even more.Not everything here is great, but the highlights are very special indeed.Roald twists things around but is never cruel to the reader or character; justice is usually served, often a la carte...When he's at his best, I'd rank Dahl up there with Saki and O'Henry for knowing how to stand a short story on its head. That's high praise!Very entertaining."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"This is quite possibly the most entertaining a hilarious collection of short stories I have ever read.

Not recommended for younger readers at all. This is aimed purely at adults. If only Roald wrote more like these."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"These four short stories were a real surprise to me when i saw the great Roald Dahl had written them.They have a bit of seductiveness about them....they are a bit creepy, but always brilliantly painted and with often an ironic twist.There is one story i will always go back to read and others which did not get me quite as much, but on the whole i really enjoy this book and recommend it to friends, mostly male friends.am now looking at the other 'uncle oswald' publication."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"Four wickedly funny, sexy tales with patented Roald Dahl twist endings. Very enjoyable reading, although the type on my copy is a bit small for comfortable reading."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"There are only four stories in this collection but it's well worth reading, especially if you've already read MY UNCLE OSWALD, one of the funniest adult books I've ever read (that Roald Dahl wrote a book where he gets to describe all the great minds of Victorian England in the uncontrollable throes of passion is hilarious in itself!).The two middle stories deal with a scheming husband lusting after his neighbor's wife and a widow looking up a high school sweetheart she dumped 25 years ago. The first and last story star Oswald Cornelius, the cultured lech-at-large whose life appears to be one long sexual adventure. (Reading the last story, I wondered if Dahl could have sued the author of PERFUME since they both wrote about a perfume that provokes men to ravish the closest woman--Dahl for laughs, PERFUME for a dark murder mystery).Extremely well written, not as smutty as you'd think but still very adult in content, sharp and perceptive. It's been a long time since I read MY UNCLE OSWALD but now I feel like reading it again. If you liked these stories, then check that one out."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"Roald Dahl, perhaps the most entertaining short story writer ever to grace the world with his genius, created a world unto itself in this collection of four short stories, a world in which the characters are eccentrically unforgettable, the plots are sensually graphic, and the endings are climactically uproarious with emotional impact. Dahl is a master of forming stories that ferment over the time it takes the reader to read them and, in his trademark endings, explode with surprise and joy."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"A terrific collection that plumbs macabre depths while keeping a sense of humor. Dahl's style, apparently, is to stoke the engine until the train is roaring on the tracks, then, with little or no notice, have it crash spectactularly into a brick wall."},{"Title":"Switch Bitch","review":"As Dahl goes, this is an acutely uneven collection of short stories.

He was one of the most controversial figures in American public life; \\"Tricky Dick,\\" the man you loved to hate. He started his career as a hero to conservatives, a dedicated anti-Communist, the vanquisher of Helen Gahagan Douglas and Alger Hiss. Later he enraged many those same supporters by imposing wage and price controls and opening China to the West. He was the leader of the Silent Majority, the ender of the Vietnam war. He was also crippled by disgrace; the only President forced to resign his office.In the Arena is not a conventional memoir. Nixon already covered the essentials in his 1978 volume, &quot;RN.&quot; Rather, this is more of an introduction to the man himself; a personal, intimate, conversational book about how he felt and thought, and what he believed. It is a reminiscence about the major points in his life, both high and low-the subtitle of the book is \\"A Memoir of Victory, Defeat, and Renewal\\"-and a commentary on some of the events that have occurred since his earlier autobiography. This is by no means the definitive book on Nixon, but it does provide intriguing insights into the mind of a most intriguing man.Some of the more interesting revelations in the book are Nixon's personal dealings with and reactions to the famous men he knew and met in his life. Herbert Hoover, MacArthur, Churchill, de Gaulle, Adenauer, Kennedy, Eisenhower, and many others. He had their respect, if not their friendship, and he was able to deal with them as an equal, both before and after his presidency. He relates engaging impressions and revealing insights of these Titans of history. Gorbachev, he reveals, was better educated and more charismatic than Brezhnev so he came off as being a benign presence, but, in truth, he was no less ruthless. \\"[B]eneath the velvet glove he always wears, there is a steel fist.\\" Mao told Nixon that he preferred \\"rightists\\" like him because \\"those on the right can do what those on the left can only talk about.\\" Chou En-Lai was a ruthless negotiator with an all-encompassing understanding of international affairs. MacArthur was the most fascinating speaker he ever met, able to deliver, off the cuff, hours of brilliant, hypnotic rhetoric. The only leader Nixon ever met who could equal him was Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore.Nixon also writes about Watergate, although, predictably, he makes no stunning confessions or apologies. He admits his responsibility for the cover-up, but denies having any role in the crime itself. He also continues to emphasize the political aspects of the scandal. He paraphrases Talleyrand: \\"Watergate was worse than a crime-it was a blunder.\\" He reveals that even he did not know about all that was going on. He did not give the matter sufficient attention because he was preoccupied with his China initiatives and his efforts to end the war in Vietnam. He admits regret for considering options that were clearly illegal. Ironically, his order to kill the investigation, the famous \\"smoking gun\\" which ultimately led to his resignation, was disregarded. He also discusses his agonizing over accepting the pardon offered by President Ford. \\"Next to the resignation, accepting the pardon was the most painful decision of my political career.\\" Ultimately, though, he concluded that the continuing obsession by the people with Watergate was crippling the nation. That and his own \\"desperate financial situation\\" left him with little choice.Nixon also writes passionately about his role in the Vietnam War. \\"A day did not pass during my years in the White House that I did not hate the war in Vietnam.\\" Nixon's mother, of course, was a Quaker and his upbringing had to influence the way he felt about such things. He especially loathed the tremendous human suffering caused by war. Still, he felt that the nation's course was a necessary one and that our goals in Indochina were \\"worthy and honorable.\\" \\"I would have done anything to achieve them by peaceful means. But no such options were available.\\" He believed that it was \\"imperative both morally and strategically\\" to help free the countries of Indochina, but that did not \\"lessen the burden [he] felt from leading our nation in war.\\" As always, Nixon remained committed to the ideal of \\"real peace\\", that is, an end to war. We cannot achieve what he calls \\"perfect peace\\"-an end to conflict-because conflict is the natural state of affairs in the world. However, real peace is obtainable, if only we can take the profit out of war. He believes that this is possible because the destructiveness of nuclear weapons has made world war prohibitively expensive, and because increasing world prosperity has drastically reduced the desire of nations to increase their wealth by acquiring more territory and resources."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"Since the former president granted my request and sent me a personal autographed copy absolutely free I am biased about this book. I think it is well-written, insightful, personal, and philosophical all in one package. His approach to life was essentially life it to the hilt, have something to show for your existence, hence the title. He was not hesitant to enter &quot;the arena.&quot; In fact, his life was lived in the arena. President Nixon was both a thinker and doer.While he lived adventurously on two levels, the mental and physical, he was somewhat neglectful of the spiritual arena. He talks about his Christian parents, especially his mother, but he doesn't address spiritual matters in his personal life in any great detail. I know he was on friendly terms with both Billy Graham and Norman Vincent Peale. I'm sure they had some Christian influence on him.In this book, the president looks back on life as an elder statesman. Some of the advice he gives is pertinent to any arena. When he talks about living with a purpose that transcends self, the focus is beyond political. He devotes time to the human condition, overcoming personal challenges, victories, defeats, and renewals. This is a well-thought out book. Any open minded reader would be stimulated by it."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"Why is it pleasurable to read this book ? Because you have the impression of sitting with former President Nixon having him telling you his experience as a politician, truly revealing, with simple but skilled language, anedoctes of his life and his mind about a lot of topics.I really enjoyed having this presidential chat with President Nixon and every once in a while I will surely have some other ones by reading some passages of \\" In the Arena\\", a memoir narrated not in chronological order, but according to certain matters he deals with."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"This is an excellent book. Well written and compact. No wasted words in this story.It's vintage Nixon and he's at his best. It's full of fascinating stories and hard, tough insights into power politics. His core belief is that your life needs to be dedicated to some cause greater than yourself. It's an idea well worth pondering.Probably the biggest weakness is the masterful spin on any of his problems. It's almost as if he's running a political campaign. Every controversial issue is turned into a positive reflection on his career. You know he's got to be lying at least a little bit, but you just can't figure out where. Oh well."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"First, let me say that I rated this book at 4 stars. In my ranking system, a 4 is a very good score. I rarely ever give a 5, because it implies perfection.With that said, I do believe that this book is worth reading for anyone interested in bettering themselves. Whilst the subject is about politics, many of the stories revolve around human nature and Richard Nixon gives some utterly insightful advice.It is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"Richard Nixon's In The Arena is a political masterpiece. He demonstrates remarkable insights into the forces of the world of politics. It is odd that a man who had such a profound knowledge of the system and an understanding of how it can be tamed made such foolish errors in his own administration. The book, however, indicates that his legacy will be more than just the Watergate scandel, and more than the resignation of the presidency. Much like a lion tamer who one day loses control of his beast, so too Nixon lost the power over politics, but that does not repudiate his long career of dominating in the arena."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"This books tells you very interesting things about Politics and Life in general. Definitely, Richard Nixon was a very intelligent man.Something I find fascinating and mysterious is that the most intelligent President of USA has been the only one to be dismissed, the one who obtained one of the most landslide victory of USA's electoral history (1972) and the one who had more enemies in the Press."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"This is not only one of the best books President Nixon wrote, but I have also found it to be one of the best written by any President. What makes it so good is the fact that you do not have to be a fan of Nixon's in order to appreciate it. Instead you get a personal view of his feelings on a variet of subjects. Even his most fierce critics would give him credit for giving excellant advice. In this book people of all sorts of professions can find sound advice for everyday events and aspects of their lives.I would love to discuss this book with anyone who is interested.Brian Maughan"},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"Atlanta, Georgia- The title In the Arena comes from a quote from Theodore Roosevelt. The quote states:It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how strong a man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and counts short again and again; who becomes there is not effort without error and short coming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.As time passes Richard Nixon wisdom and judgment seems timeless. This book is a deeply personal book, because it exposes his faults and failures. After he had disgraced himself by resigning the presidency, Nixon was asked what he would do with the rest of his life. If he might stage one last comeback. His answer before the Oxford Union in 1978 became is mantra. He stated, \\"So long as I have breath in my body, I am going to talk about the great issues that affect the world. I am not going to keep my mouth shut. I am going to speak out for peace and freedom.\\"Arnold Toynbee in his book Study of History describes what he calls the phenomenon of withdrawal and return as a \\"disengagement and temporary withdrawal of the creative personality from his social milieu and his subsequent return to the same milieu transfigured in a newer capacity with new powers.\\" Examples are Mohammed, Confucius, Peter the Great, and you can include Richard Nixon in the mix.Nixon's life was one of always being underestimated and working harder than anyone else. Yes he made mistakes, but he also had great successes. This book allows you to gain insight into one of the most complex political figures of our nation's history. His intellect and curiosity of ideas and solutions about some of our world's biggest challenges is admirable.In the Arena: A Memoir of Victory, Defeat and Renewal by Richard Nixon humanizes this man behind the growling smile and waving peace signs of victory that have become an iconic caricature of this former president."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"I read this book when I had just graduated High School (over 15 years ago) and I still think it and Atlas Shrugged have had a profound effect on my life (I am in fact trying to purchase it for my cousin off to boarding school this year). It is Nixon looking back on his life discussing various subjects, from alcohol to negotiating. It thoughtful and timeless. It is a great book to give to a young adult to help shape their morals and to develop their decision making process. It is a Nixon at the end of his life trying to give advice to future generations not on global politics, but on life choices. Regardless of what you think of the man, he is an authority on life decisions and their consequences."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"I purchased this book when it was originally published as a high school student and it was then and remains my favorite book of all time.

You must be out of your mind not to read it."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"First of all, I began this book after reading his \\"No More Viet Nams\\" which was top notch. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed with \\"In The Arena\\". Nixon covers much about his life in politics and gives us his personal views on life, his wife, family, friends, television, books, and so on. Reading this book was much like listening to your favorite, wise, ol' grandad talking about his life and what he experienced. IF you are not interested in that, don't read this book. You'll be disappointed. Personally, I was more interested in his pointed comments about politics, foreign policies, political leaders, war, and so on but there wasn't enough of that."},{"Title":"In the Arena: In the Arena","review":"An autobiographical account is always a dicey proposition, and in order to succeed, the author requires a certain amount of objectivity, as well as superior writing skills. Unfortunately, this displays neither.I'm not here to bash Nixon politically, but I do have to say that the book comes off as extremely self-serving. Nixon's account of Nixon's life just doesn't come off as honest. I think that when he wrote it, he was still too entrenched in a persona that needed to take public opinion into account. The result is a lot of treacly, ponderous prose that comes off like the presidential equivalent of a Hallmark television special.The one saving grace of the book is that it gives us many little anecdotes that demonstrate the minutiae of the daily life of a President of the United States, and that is indeed interesting.

If, despite your assurances that meat will do her no harm, your child absolutely insists on maintaining her stance, take this as a sign that the child may be quite seriously ill at ease about life itself.This dis-ease should be uncovered and cured.\\"I hardly know where to start with this politically and culturally ignorant rubbish."},{"Title":"Understanding You Child: An A-Z for Parents","review":"I found this book extremely outdated and generally very unhelpful, merely emphasising old stereotypes about child raising which I have personally found to be untrue.

Because it is translated from French, some of the text is choppy and although provides good background, does not go into great detail. Trust me, though. You won't want this book for what is written on the pages, but for the pictures that capture some the great moments of the world's most exclusive union: hockey goaltenders.Denis Brodeur has photographed the Montreal Canadiens for several decades, so all of the pictures were taken at The Forum and a few at the Molson Centre(Bill Ranford). It is no secret that Denis' son, Martin is one of the finest goaltenders in the game, and the father pays his son a nice tribute in the book.This book a must-have for any hockey fanatic and features photographs of goaltenders hard to find anywhere. Where else will you find Gilles Gilbert, Daniel Bouchard, Rick Wamsley and other lesser-known, but succesful netminders in the same book? Brodeur's photos have captured the spirit and flamboyance of the position and is a tribute to everyone who has ever put on the pads and gone &quot;between the pipes&quot; in the great game of hockey."},{"Title":"Goalies: Guardians of the Net","review":"This book provides a ton of pictures for the reader, as well as it gives some insight about the goaltenders that are photographed. While it is so extensive, I feel it is too extensive, covering almost every netminder that has been in the NHL since the 1980's. I would like to have seen just some of the better players over the years, not just the HOF players, but perhaps a few less than were put in.Also, the pictures are of average quality. Brodeur does have some phenominal shots of goalies over the years, but these pictures are not art quality, rather documentary. I would like to see a book that focuses on the art of goaltending and the people behind it rather than a somewhat plain approach than was taken here. Nonetheless, it still sits on my coffeetable and starts a conversation or two."},{"Title":"Goalies: Guardians of the Net","review":"If you want info on all the goalies(just about), this is the book you are looking for.

The conversational style keeps it from being boring and it is on a level that one does not have to have a college degree to understand. As with any study, it is always a good thing to undergird, support, and illustrate with other resources. If this is done, it balances any weaknesses found in the book's material.

As the cover states, it is quite \\"basic\\", but it is ideal for use as a beginner-level overview of the history of Christianity: exactly what I'd hoped it would be.The twelve chapters -- each of which covers the main events, names, and terms of a time period -- read incredibly quickly, as each page contains colorful pictures, block quotes, and other graphics which present information in a variety of ways. The scope of the book is grand, covering the time of the apostles up through postmodernism and the Emergent Church, and everything in between. Obviously, nothing is covered in depth, but Jones provides readers with a \\"big picture\\" view of history, enough detail to have at least a basic familiarity with the most important aspects of church history, and resources for further study.I was personally most appreciative of the author's emphasis on the work of God in building the Church throughout history. He is honest about the many failings of the Church and its leaders, but highlights the ideas and contributions made during each era which ultimately led to the spread of the Gospel. This is most evident in Chapter 6 (\\"God Never Stops Working\\"), which covers the difficult period from 673-1295. Jones applies the words of Jesus in John 5:17 (\\"My father is always at his work\\") to show how God worked through the monastics, the Scholastics, and the mystics to preserve the Bible and a remnant of believers even through the Dark Ages. Taking that view of history helps us to remain optimistic at times when it is difficult to see how God is working.His final chapters are also helpful in introducing the various streams of Christian thinking in the world today. The book documents the rise of Dispensationalism, Christian liberalism, Pentecostalism, Fundamentalism, and the \\"Emergent\\" church. Jones sticks to the \\"facts\\" for the most part, describing what happened rather than making value statements about doctrinal differences within evangelicalism, but he does take time to point out the errors of liberalism and it's later postmodern iteration (Readers should expect no less from a professor at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary!). I should also note that from the Reformation onward, the focal point is on the history of the Protestant church, with very little discussion given to events taking place within Roman Catholicism -- the Second Vatican Council being a notable exception.This edition contains a 12-week detailed study guide so that using the book as a teaching tool or discussion starter is also \\"made easy\\". While group leaders may not choose to follow the guide exactly -- each session calls for 60-90 minutes of guided discussion, worship through song, and a \\"learning activity\\" which often requires some preparation and supplies from the leader -- everything needed to use in nearly any group format is included. Leaders can simply adapt the provided materials to suit their needs.If you're looking for a good introduction to church history that doesn't require a long commitment to deep study, this one will serve you well."},{"Title":"Christian History Made Easy: 13 Weeks to a Better Understanding of Church History","review":"From the moment I saw the title of this book I thought it would be a great book to read.I am an instructor at my Church so I use it to learn and to teach my adult students who vary in age and knowledge. History can be boring to some but this book helps me to provide fun ways to present the material.I would recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about Christian History. Also it is very inexpensive which is very important to my students who are taking more than one class.Dr.Jones has certainly made it an easy to read book chocked with a wealth of knowledge.

It jumps out at you."},{"Title":"Christian History Made Easy: 13 Weeks to a Better Understanding of Church History","review":"From reading the first chapters of this book a reader would would be completely unaware that:The early Christians believed that the bread and wine of the Eucharist literally became the flesh and blood of Christ and that it was viewed as the sacrifice (oblation) of the ChurchThat the bishops and presbyters of the church were viewed as the legitimate successors of the apostles and had the authority from Christ to, among other things, forgive sinsThat unity with your local bishop was of the utmost importance. Those in schism with the one church forfeited their salvation.They believed in baptismal regeneration. One was born again through water baptism for the forgiveness of sins and the anointing with the Holy Spirit.That infant baptism was not a late innovation but rather was understood to be a practice handed down from the apostlesThat the relics of martyrs were preserved and veneratedThat from the beginning of the second century the church was referred to as the catholic church to distinguish it from the various heretical sects.Etc. etc.Don't take my word for it. Read the early church fathers themselves (...). You could I suppose argue that immediately after the death of the original apostles the entire church became corrupted and the pure gospel was only restored after (fill in the date). But in that case you might as well be a Mormon or Jehovah Witness, since central Christian doctrines like the Trinity were articulated by the same church that believed the list above. Same goes for the New Testament canon that we use today.But at least this book may spark some interest in further study of Christian history. As orthodox Christians we are all heirs to a rich spiritual heritage spanning 2000 years. We are truly One Body in Christ."},{"Title":"Christian History Made Easy: 13 Weeks to a Better Understanding of Church History","review":"I read through this book to get a gauge as to whether or not to use it for a Bible Study group we have in our home.

In preparation I am reading several books, but a friend recommended that I start with this one. That was a wise suggestion. This book gives a great overview, highlighting most of the major events and personalities; so it served well to lay a basic framework to which I am adding with further study. (It was also a quick way to refresh my memory of all that stuff I crammed into my head during my Church History course in Bible college.) It lacks a lot of details--but that's the point of the book. Sometimes, on very minor issues, Jones seems to disagree with some of the more scholarly works; but Jones is no dummy and his perspective could very well be the accurate one. The down side is that the research is poorly documented as he rarely cites his sources. Over all, this was a very quick, practical and helpful read for my purposes."},{"Title":"Christian History Made Easy: 13 Weeks to a Better Understanding of Church History","review":"I discovered this book a few years ago after reading several in-depth histories of the church for a grad school class, and I was grateful that Dr. Jones had condensed two thousand years of growth and change in the global church into a short, concise, engaging book. It is safe to say that most Christians do not know the differences between denominations or how the church grew and changed since the time of Christ. Prejudice, misplaced beliefs, or flat out ignorance have clouded our ability to work together with the community of believers from different churches, and Dr. Jones' book does a great job of telling the \\"family story\\".My Sunday School class used this book for a 13 week study, and it was enlightening. Great leader notes at the end, excellent questions to prompt discussions, and the reading load for each week is very light. Jones' writing style is conversational, witty, and avoids academic jargon. There isn't great enough detail to give each subject/ person enough justice in the book (it is two thousand years in thirteen weeks, after all), but he does point out opportunities where readers can learn more about the topics from each chapter in side notes.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Christian History Made Easy: 13 Weeks to a Better Understanding of Church History","review":"This book is full of interesting info presented in an easy to read and understand format.

No More Back Pain!","review":"When I received this book in the mail, I wondered why such a thin book was so expensive. It took several re-readings before I got the main point of the book, which was actually so simple that it was no wonder I missed it the first time. Except for the isometric exercise, most of the other exercises outlined in the book are just too difficult for me, and I don't think I am in such bad shape for my age (45 yr. old female). I also think it would have been a lot better if each exercise had it's own picture or picture series, because it was a bit cumbersome to READ all the explanations of how to do everything. Lots of good information on what works, why, and what doesn't and why. I think this author knows what she is talking about, and I am sure that if I met her in person I would like her because she is so sensible in her approach, but a good book editor could have helped to put it all together in a more readable fashion. This book is worth the read and the effort to extract the important message this author is promoting."},{"Title":"The AB Revolution: No More Crunches! No More Back Pain!","review":"I bought this book after attending a seminar with this extraordinary lady - more on that in a moment. The book is invaluable to ANYONE who wants to eliminate back-pain immediately. Most of us have been told so many times to \\"stand up straight, don't slouch\\" that we do precisely the wrong thing, over-arching and putting strain and stress on our back each and every day. With Dr. Bookspans straightforward, no-nonsense approach, you can instantly modify your posture and the pain/ache in your lower back IS GONE! What is deceptive is how easy this is to accomplish and so on first read, you might not totally grasp the concept. Take your time with the book, try each modification and exercise as she clearly explains it, and give it a try. Your first goal should be to stop the pain, your second to start strengthening your abs and back by retraining your daily habits - and let me tell you, you'll thank her for it. As a 40 year old martial arts instructor with 24 years experience, I was fortunate enough to attend one of her seminars. That's where she really works her magic, face to face. She utilized the concepts in her book to change the way a room full of martial arts instructors and grandmasters live their daily lives. For all of our knowledge and experience, Dr. Bookspan provided a collective epiphany to over 60 veteran martial artists, we were all shaking our heads in amazement and smiling at how good our backs felt. It's practical and it WORKS! To her credit, Dr. Bookspan LIVES her healthy lifestyle philosophy. This book is not very big, nor is Dr. Bookspan - but both are filled with tremendous power and wisdom. Everyone could benefit from the Ab Revolution."},{"Title":"The history of Portland: A facsimile of the 1865 ed","review":"There were two editions of Willis. The reprinted one is basically pre-Civil War. It is voluminous and Willis is obviously collecting virtually every fact available to him.He is an extremely reliable, accurate scholar with a smooth presentation style. Quite remarkable for old histories, especially with the heavy factual orientation. Yet the heavy genealogical emphasis is not burdensome, and is relieved by his objectivity and lack of &quot;social commentary.&quot;The only comparable comprehensive history is Goold's, written 20 or so years later. Goold is not a professional historian, but a journalist, and strongly relies on Willis' groundbreaking research. He's a good read too.There are several other histories and pseudo-histories, mostly journalistic or highly opinionated. The monographic material leads much to be desired, even the newer research. Again we must go to the classical writers for better material. Renaissance man Baxter, of course, is the very best for fact, objectivity and style. His writing is mostly about the early colonial period, and is studies of Leavitt and Cleaves, and contributions to the ME HIstorical Society series are phenomenal. Another valuable resource are the Smith &amp; Deane diaries, which were edited and culled -- again, around 150 years ago. And the originals disappeared. Various Nineteenth Century travel guides (Elwell, Neal, etc.) also have valuable historical vignettes, as do miscellaneous histories of county, businesses, ethnic groups, and professions. There is abundant material for the post-Civil War period, but it is never presented adequately as objective, comprehensive history."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"Canadian author Frances Itani had a promising idea to write about the education and early life of a girl struck deaf in infancy, as her own grandmother was at the turn of the last century. And it was an intriguing one to contrast her silent world with the cacophony of the western front in World War I. The novel that results contains interesting characters and effective passages, but it is too diffuse to really work.Grania O'Neill -- the name is an anglicization of the Irish for \\"love\\" -- loses her hearing at the age of five as a result of scarlet fever. She wakens to a world shaped and contained by words, but where language is deceptive and words have to be agonizingly relearned. She has an ally in her grandmother Mamo; the relationship between the two is the most lovely thing in the book. But I found the early chapters repetitive and could never enter fully into Grania's world. I was more interested in the relatively brief section dealing with her time at a special boarding school and the battle between the two theories of education for the deaf: sign language and the oral method.As a young adult, Grania falls in love and marries. But it is 1915, and her husband Jim goes off to war as a medical orderly. The unusual perspective makes some of the war writing quite powerful, occasionally approaching the intensity of classics such as Sebastian Faulks'BIRDSONG. And the scenes back in Canada show something even less often written about, a picture of wartime life on the home front. But the fact remains that there is an ocean between Grania and Jim, and their parallel stories barely connect. Still, a few touching episodes do manage to bridge the gap, as when one of their friends returns wounded and mute, and Grania teaches him once more to talk.This is a book that needed to dwell in language and sound, and above all in silence. It calls for an almost abstract style that can handle ideas and sensations rather than events -- poetry rather than prose. The steady narrative that Itani offers contains much that will interest and even move its readers, but for this reader at least the most exciting promises are lost."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"It is a wonderful story to tell, and I am sure it is loosely written on fact vs. fiction. But I found it dragged on and on and just lost interest until I finally I had to put it down, unfinished. I don't do that very often."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"This novel gives a wonderful, insider's view of deafness and war. Once Jim goes off to WWI, some of the chapters are told from his perspective. At first, I was disappointed by this shift, but as the war (and ultimately, the novel) drags on, I wanted to know what was happening to Jim and the boys he was working with.Itani writes wonderful, three-dimensional portraits of Grania's family, especially Mamo and Tress, Kenan, Fry, the various characters in Deserando, Jim (Grania pronounces his name as Chim), Irish (the name is ironic, considering that Grania is Irish) and even the teachers at Grania's deaf school. Though the novel drag on at moments, you will want to read it until the end."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"The title may be Deafening, but the book is anything but. It's very quiet--too quiet. As we try to inhabit the life and mind of Grania, deaf since the age of five from scarlet fever, we imagine what it would be like not to know when someone is approaching from behind, or to know when the speaker has changed in a conversation. This book was just too slow-paced for me and the characters too one-dimensional. Grania and her hearing husband Jim seem to be without fault. More complex is Grania's sister Tress, who struggles with her emotions when her husband comes back from WWI disfigured and dysfunctional. Another interesting character is their mother, who postpones sending Grania to a school for the deaf as long as possible, while she battles her guilt over Grania's hearing loss and seeks a cure via specialists and spiritual quests. However, the author doesn't fully explore the inner conflicts of Tress or her mother, and we are left with a love story between two very nice people. Jim's story is more disturbing than Grania's, actually, as he becomes a stretcher bearer during the war and sees both friends and patients blown up inches away from him on a regular basis. His sections of the book are very moving reminders that the lives lost in wars are not just statistics. The most moving and ironic incident is Jim's wordless interaction with a German counterpart as they both struggle to rescue their wounded on the battlefield."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"The jacket copy intrigued me, and I wasn't disappointed. The author does an excellent job of presenting an inside view of deafness. She also author provides a harrowing close-up view of the horrors of war---namely World War I---and of the great flu epidemic. Nearly all the characters are three-dimensional (though we never do find out why Cora is so hateful to the narrator), and the author avoids cliches. For example, the narrator's siblings and parents are supportive, though human."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"The first part of this novel was a superb 99 pages. My enjoyment of these 99 pages is what makes this a three star book despite the fact I grew too bored to finish somewhere in the middle of part three. Here is why:Part one is about a child named Grania growing up in Canada in the late 1800's. A bout with scarlet fever at the age of 5 has rendered her permanently deaf. Thankfully, Grania has an understanding family, especially her grandmother, and with their patience, she learns to lip read. I know from my own experience, lip reading is not an easy task and this book shows us just how difficult it is. Grania struggles to see words, understand words, and even feel words. Readers will feel her frustration, her fears, and her shame at times. When she begins school, we see how the deaf are treated by the hearing people with less than kind hearts. The teacher does not want to take time out of her already busy day to ensure Grania understands what is going on. The children like to laugh at her and play games that humilate her. Most upsetting of all is the ignorant assumption that deaf means dumb. When Grania is sent to a deaf school to learn lip reading and sign language, we see another world. It is a world of silence, yet friendships build and minds expand.Part two is about an adult Grania who falls in love with a hearing man named Jim. Jim is a nice fellow, but he does not hold my interest. I found his conversations with Grania dull and their romance a bit sappy. My mind began to wander.Part three follows Jim as he enters World War One and the fighting he experiences or sees. This created a problem for me, as I said earlier, Jim just didn't hold my interest.Part one seemed a novel all of its own. The style changed after that. I realize the story is about Grania and Jim and World War One, but it just was not written the same as part one. I encourage people searching for deaf fiction and literature to pick this one up tho."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"good book club . lots of similar experiences between blind wife and soldier husband."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"Deafening is one of the best books I've read in a while, but sometimes it falls into ambiguosity. The changing verb tenses and constant reminders that the main character is deaf are wonderfully placed to put you in Grania's mindset, but I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who has never read a book from this genre before."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"This is my surprise book of the year. It was a gift, and I didn't quite know what to expect, but it's turned into a real winner.Spanning the years from 1902 till the end of WWI, we follow the life of Grania, a child/woman who became deaf following scarlet fever. From a loving middle-class family, she went to a boarding school for hundreds and hundreds of deaf children, grew into a self-sufficient young woman, became a nurse, and married a hearing man, Jim. He went off to war, as did her childhood friend and brother-in-law, Kenan. Improbably for that Great War, both men returned - but in very different conditions.Divided into several parts, the early chapters are Grania's education, learning to live as a deaf person in the world of the hearing. The next part is Jim's story of his war experience.Then comes Grania's ultimately successful efforts to return the power of speech to her mute and traumatized childhood friend. And finally the resolution of all the stories.This book grows on you. One of the boldest risks author Itani took was to try (successfully) to convey Grania's silent world to readers, and to imitate the understanding of sign language as well as lip reading for those of us unfamiliar with the Deaf World.It's a stunning and powerful book, showing the power of Story to convey love, union, and understanding - and ultimately, joy."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"A great novel!This book, by Francis Itani, revolves around the world of a girl/woman who as acquired deafness through childhood illness. The setting is initially in Ontario, Canada in the late 1800's and then eventually alternating between Ontario and the European theater of World War I.I must admit I had some difficultly getting into this work, but I persevered and I'm glad I did, because this book is truly a magnificent read. Once committed, I could barely stand to put the book down.As with all great books, what makes this book special, is the quality of the writing. The prose just seemed to flow effortlessly off the pages as time melted away. You learn things about deafness, quietness and darkness that you never really noticed before; you begin to appreciate what people without hearing have to endure to get through an hour, a day or a lifetime. There were a couple of occasions in this book where I was taken aback with a new revelation regarding deafness; where I would just let this book slip to my lap and think about what I'd just read.There are parts in this book that are not for the faint of heart; some of the description of the trench warfare in France and Belgium are very graphic and disturbing. (but, most likely, accurate)All in all, a story that is quietly beautiful and at the same time beautifully sad. Really, one of my favorite books. If I had to compare it to another book for quality, beauty and heartrending appeal, then I'd pick Charles Frazier's \\" Cold Mountain\\". Both books have that intangible timeless aura to them that separate them from their peers.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"The true test of an author is the ability to portray the mind of someone else. Recently, that ability has been stretched by writers who describe the \\"abnormal\\". The young, autistic Christopher in \\"Curious Incident\\" is the prime example. Frances Itani takes us into a different world, that of the deaf. It's a world of endless confusion. There are sounds, so easy to the hearing, but meaningless to the deaf. We think speech is the only important sound, but talk is hurried, undirected, and indistinct. Nature produces her own sounds which we use in speech, but for which there's no meaning to the deaf. Through Grania O'Brien's early life, Itani strives to introduce us to that world. Does she succeed?Grania, who would have been \\"Grainne\\" in her ancestral Ireland, lives in small-town Ontario as the story opens. Deafened by scarlet fever [remember that?], she's coached by Mamo, her grandmother. Blessed with a quick eye for lip-reading, Grania is given a book with words displayed as rope. The rope, of course, becomes highly symbolic as the book progresses, but Grania begins to equate the shapes with meaning. Mamo strains to have the girl equate printed words with proper sounds. It's important that Grania \\"blend in\\" with the rest of the community. With her parents running a hotel, Grania's only other tie is with her sister Tress, with whom she develops a secret sign language.All of Mamo's dedicated effort, nor trips to sacred shrines, can't force the pace. Grania is to leave home for a \\"Deaf School\\". Itani portrays the school as staffed with immensely caring ladies. No Dickens intrudes with harsh discipline or abuse, but the school draws children from across the Province. All the children remain in school until the summer holidays. Sign language is discouraged for those who can speak - dividing the children, some of whom are mute. Itani passes rapidly over Grania's progress in the school. The deaf girl, however, manages to shed some of her fear of the dark - a long-held terror.Meeting a young aide in a hospital after leaving the school, Grania's life takes a new turn. The courtship is but a moment in the story - the wedding description not even related until much later in the book. Instead, the Kaiser rudely intrudes on their lives with the invasion of Belgium. Itani carefully rejects any political discussion in the narrative. King and Country [Britain, not Canada] are under threat and Jim must sign up. There's no family discussion, no question of how Irish immigrants in a far land should react - Jim crosses the Atlantic. There's a training stint, then Jim finds himself in the thick of battle. When time and circumstances permit, letters are scribbled in muddy trenches. Sometimes Grania's reach Jim, but delays in the exchanges make communication a flimsy thread.Itani makes a splendid effort to depict the impact of the Great War. Confronted as we are today by daily images of conflict, Itani still manages to impart a special sense of horror at events. The years pass with Jim, a stretcher-bearer, braving the bombardments and fusillades of machine-gun fire, without being able to fight back. He carries wounded, tends their injuries, dodges fire and grows increasingly introspective. Never once, does he question the worth of the conflict. At home in Desoronto, Grania watches the causality lists, the statistics of insanity, lengthen while she worries. Soldier's wives need more visibility and Itani's effort is commendable.This book cries out for a sequel. Grania's life hardly ends with the Armistice. With the end of the War, her deafness remains, the family is almost intact and a future must unroll. Itani has built a unique scenario with skillful prose. You will not find it easy to put this book down as you read. However, when you do finish, you will find the conclusion abrupt. Nothing is lost by that finale, but there might be much gained by going on. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"Language and silence, the strength of love in times of diversity, and the horrors of World War 1, shape this lovely, and powerful novel by Canadian writer Francis Itani. Deafening is almost reminiscent of Rebecca West's Return of the Soldier, as the reader journeys from small town Canada to the battle scarred chaos of the Western Front. When she was a little girl, scarlet fever robbed red-haired Grania O'Neill of her hearing. While her mother, Agnes prays for a miracle to restore her daughter's hearing, Grania's grandmother, Mamo, enrolls her in a special School for the Deaf in Belleville, Ontario.Grania must learn to live away from her loving family, but she is lonely for the company of her sister, Tressa and the secret language they shared. Grania is a bright student and excels in school, learning both sign language and speech, and after graduation takes a job at the school hospital, where she meets the kind-hearted Jim. When Grania falls in love with Jim, her life seems complete, but the First World War soon tears them apart and sweeps Jim across the Atlantic into the horrors of the Western Front and trench warfare. At the Western Front, Jim is tested to his limit as he and his buddy Irish - both stretcher-bearers - recover the crushed bodies of their comrades.Apart from her husband for two years, Grania feels &quot;a loneliness so brittle, she believed that she would break in two,&quot; and she is forced to cope with many domestic dramas, both large and small, of life at home. The way she sees is divided, &quot;into things that move and things that don't move,&quot; and when Kenan, her brother-in-law and childhood companion, returns from the Front, battle scarred, and speechless, Grania helps him regain his voice through altruism, selflessness, and love. She is a woman who knows how to listen even though she cannot hear.While Grania is destined for a life of silence, Jim is &quot;deafened&quot; by the noise of war. Jack gradually comes to learn the gap between what happens and what is understood, what is there and what is not, and while trying to survive in the trenches, the &quot;sounds knock him over, and block all thought.&quot; The sounds &quot;seep into the body like deadly gas, and seep into everything around until there is no rift or fissure left unfilled.&quot; Jack searches for Grania - her face, eyes, lips and self - in the words of letters that he thinks of but never writes.Through Itani's vivid imagery and lyrical prose, we enter Grania's world as she tries to communicate where sound exists only in the margins. Itani also doesn't shy away from showing the horrors of war - the distorted bodies, the yellowish-grey mud, and the shells that burst with a deafening bang. The book is totally rich in time frame and location, and is written with all the lyrical language and slow character development that one can hope for in literary fiction. Graceful and precise, Deafening is a deeply moving journey through the strands of strength and vulnerability that weave heart and spirit together. The horrific images of war are not what makes the pages fly by, rather, it is the unfolding of the tale itself, along with the lush writing and the accretion of character that gently, yet persistently, pull the reader in. Mike Leonard July 04."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"In this sensitive portrayal of love and war, author Itani reveals the life of Grania O'Neill from her earliest days in Deseronto, Canada, through her marriage to Jim Lloyd, who serves in the Ambulance Corps during World War I. Grania has been deaf since the age of five, and Itani opens her inner world to the reader, using Grania's voice to tell the story and gracefully conveying her deafness as part of her selfhood, not as a handicap. Using short sentences of twelve to fifteen words when Grania is a young child trying to figure out her world, Itani begins the story in a simple subject-verb-object pattern, using no complicated clauses or involved syntax, which Grania herself would be incapable of using. When Grania becomes fluent in sign language and lip-reading, the sentence structure becomes more complex. By the time she marries Jim, a hearing man, sentences and syntax are fully developed, and Grania's ability to recognize ambiguity, to see relationships between events, and to respond fully to a hearing world are obvious in her &quot;voice.&quot;The point of view alternates between Grania and Jim, once Jim goes off to war, and important themes--war and peace, life and death, love and friendship, and strength and dependence--weave and develop throughout their contrasting worlds, Grania at home and Jim at the front in Belgium. Itani develops these age-old themes in new ways, sensitively incorporating them with the imagery of sounds and silence, sight and shadows, action and inaction, images we have come to associate with the life Grania and Jim share. In Jim's traumatic world, sound becomes overwhelming: pounding guns, explosions, screams of agony from wounded soldiers. As a result of his life with Grania, however, he is also acutely sensitive to what he sees, discovering, ironically, that it is the hands of the dead and dying that communicate most vividly because they &quot;revealed the final argument: clenched in anger, relaxed in acquiescence, seized in a posture of surprise or forgiveness.&quot;The subordinate characters further flesh out the themes. The friendship and interdependence of Jim and Irish, his best friend parallel the love and support Grania has received from her sister, her remarkable grandmother, and her deaf friends. Grania gains strength through them and is able to give support and strength to others when they need her, just as Jim gains strength from his relationship with Irish and continues to rescue the wounded and dying. As the reader comes to know Grania and Jim and the love they feel for each other, Grania's silent but active world becomes more and more understandable to the reader. Ultimately, the reader has to agree with Grania when she declares, ironically, &quot;Sound is always more important to the hearing.&quot; Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"A beautiful book. So wonderfully written that savoring the words was a joy, never mind the sensitive yet powerful story. Though the topics -- deafness, World War One -- suggest a very grim work, it ends up being a powerful affirmation of life.This book deserves to be much more widely known than it is; it's an excellent example of how even good books deserve ample promotion, as I think that it's a lot better than some major recent best-sellers. I was pleased to see in a bookstore recently that it's won an award."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"This is a wonderful first novel about sound, silence, deafness, communication and love. Grania is a young girl who loses her hearing at the age of five. Her guilt-ridden mother refuses to accept that she is deaf and resists adapting to reality; only Grania's loving grandmother saves her from a life of illiteracy and loneliness. Grania is taught to read with &quot;The Sunday Book,&quot; a precious gift from her grandmother that becomes a metaphor for life's struggles and complications as Grania emerges from childhood, attends school, and meets &quot;Chim,&quot; a hearing man who loves her stillness. Just married, Grania must return home to wait while Jim goes to war as a stretcher bearer.Once again, WWI emerges as incredibly pointless and bloody, as men are thrown into the confusion of the European front. Jim experiences the war as a haze of brutal sound. He steels himself to the sight of mutilated men blown apart, but cannot stand the sight of their hands, which of course for him had become the instruments of his personal &quot;language of love&quot; with Grania. Meanwhile at home, a beloved friend from Grania's childhood who became her sister's husband returns home, mute from a horror no one can imagine. Drawing on the foundation of love from her grandmother, the deaf Grania not only coaches him back to speech but heals her sister as well. The end of the novel feels tantalizingly like only the beginning for these wonderful multi-dimensional characters.Itani is a wonderful writer, and manages to convey to those of us who hear what it's like not to be able to--she also shows what we the hearing might be missing! The background on the theories of language and teaching the deaf was fascinating, and Itani must have done some meticulous research. This is a wonderful novel well worth your time."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"It is only March and I have already voted this book for my Book of the Year Award, which I normally select toward the end of the year. This book was beautifully written. You could see the human emotions coming through the characters and it made me want to keep turning the pages to see what was going to happen. You feel both sorrow and joy in the characters. Frances Itani knows the human heart and displays it so well on paper. Great job! I am going to make this book a part of my permanent library."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"I wanted to like this book, but I expected a lot, and found it a disappointment. The first half about Grania's struggles with learning how to communicate and trying to fit in with her family and friends was interesting and new perspective, even though a bit slow at times and not always that compelling. As far as the second half, I have read other books that have dealt with the horrors of WWI, and this one offered not one new perspective or new point of view or descriptions. I didn't see how it added to the story at all, and at this point in the book I really wished I wasn't reading it, but I guess some part of me wanted to find out what happened, and I felt that the ending was a let down. Mostly, I feel that this topic could have been really, really engrossing, new, and compelling, but the book's lackluster plot and storytelling left me flat. I won't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Deafening: A Novel","review":"I picked this book up in a bookstore because it sounded very intriguing and, fortunately, I wasn't disappointed. Itani does a wonderful job of bringing us into the world of the deaf, so much that sometimes after reading this book for long periods I would be surprised to hear noise around me. I was also impressed that there was very little offensive language which is rare in books nowadays. Itani's characters are wonderful, the story is interesting, and I highly recommend this book to anyone who is in the mood for a good read."},{"Title":"88 Secrets to Photoshop for Photographers (88 Secrets)","review":"The book \\"88 Secrets to Photoshop for Photographers\\" is packed with helpful tips, from customizing program windows, to shortcuts, to image editing techniques, and more!

Living year-round in the Arctic desolation of eastern Greenland, nine men surreptitiously radioed crucial weather data to the Allies and patrolled the extensive coastline for a Nazi landing. When the Germans arrive, the conflict begins.The book is exciting and inspiring, with moments that are both touching and funny. One of the highlights of the book is how the unarmed and unaggressive band of Danes, Norwegians and Eskimos can outlast and outdistance the better provisioned Germans who aren't prepared for life, let alone combat, in the frozen north.Now reissued, Sledge Patrol was originally published in 1957. At that time, the author was able to get to know the parties involved, both Allied and German, adding dimension to the characters and realism to the story.I loved this book!"},{"Title":"The sledge patrol","review":"Recently, books such as INTO THIN AIR, THE PERFECT STORM, and ISAAC'S STORM have captured the imagination of armchair adventurers everywhere. Long before these books went to press, however, David Howarth penned THE SLEDGE PATROL, a remarkable story of survival and adventure. Written only a few years after the war, THE SLEDGE PATROL tells the story of seven Danish and Norwegian hunters and adventurers (and many Eskimos) who patrolled the entire east coast of Greenland during World War II on their own. Hundreds of miles of raw, icy coastline, thousands of square miles of nearly uninhabitable land, mountains, crevasses, driving blizzards, polar bears -- you ask, Why would anyone bother to protect that? The answer, as Howarth tells us so skillfully, is that the weather for the North Atlantic begins in Greeland, and accurate reports from just south of the north pole were vital to the survival of Allied convoys and the success of Axis U-boat patrols.Seven men patrolled, by dogsled, the dangerous yet beautiful coast of Greenland, sending out weather forecasts to the British while sledding along the shore to report sightings of Germans in the vicinity. These men, who could hardly believe the Germans would or could venture this far north, one day find a strange footprint in the snow -- not theirs, not an Eskimo's. What begins is a 200-page race across the Arctic to evade the Nazis and end transmission of their weather reports back to Germany.Howard writes of the beautiful danger of the Arctic, of hearty men who lived in harmony in the far north and who could not fathom evil in their midst. A great read."},{"Title":"The sledge patrol","review":"Proving that truth is stranger than fiction, Sledge Patrol tells the story of ordinary men accomplishing unbelievable feats under extreme physical conditions and bizarre political circumstances during WWII.

Yes, that conflict even extended to the remote Danish colony. Greenland was strategic because weather patterns for Western Europe and surrounding waters form there. This was of obvious and vital interest to the American, British and German navies. Early in the War, the Danish colonial weather stations had broadcast reports &quot;in the clear&quot;. Anyone, including the Germans could pick them up. Two critical events take place: Eske Brun, the Danish colonial head decides he had the power to resist German interest in his territory- and formed the Greenland Army with a force of 9 men. Then the Danish weather reports are sent in cipher so that the German navy can no longer eavesdrop. The Germans land a force to establish their own weather station. This the background to SP. What follows is almost as much a tale of personal honor and battling/surviving the Arctic elements than of military action. There is much dashing to and fro on sledges (dog sleds) to the point where this reader lost track of who was going where. The sides vie to avoid each other more than to engage in combat. And since there is minimal fighting and hence no real &quot;bad guys&quot;, I found myself losing track of who was on which side. In fact, most of the men on both sides appear as nice, solid guys. The ending is almost academic. Readers will receive an excellent sense of the fierce and beautiful Greenland geography and Eskimo tradition. Mr.Howarth is an excellent writer and interest in his books appears to be going through a well-deserved revival. But one has to be cautious in recommending SP. It is simply too hard to keep track of the action. Furthermore, the maps are inadequate, adding to the confusion. A positive note: SP is well laid out in an eye pleasing typeface and paper stock. So many of us take such for granted but a tip of the hat to an anonymous graphics person is in order. Cautiously, I'm giving out 4 stars, but 3 may be more appropriate due to my frustrations with the maps. It really would have helped to know where these guys were rather than &quot;somewhere in eastern Greenland&quot;."},{"Title":"The sledge patrol","review":"This is a story of bravery and endurance during World War II. I liked David Howarth's account of the Sledge Patrol and its mission to guard the coast of Greenland. Howarth did his research and what the reader gets is a down to earth factual description of the hardships the patrol faced while experiencing severe weather conditions. The sledge patrol alone in a vast wilderness of ice and snow had to survive on their own. This story is a tribute to them. It was interesting to see how the situation created enemies amongst those who might otherwise be friends. The lack of hostility in the Inuit demonstrated the great importance of culture. Howarth is a great author and this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The sledge patrol","review":"Like his book \\"We Die Alone\\" David Howarth acquaints us with a little know part of World War II, reminding us once again that this was really a WORLD WAR. The occupants of Greenland, faced with helping their home country of Denmark against the German aggression were willing to use their talents and experience. There wasn't much understanding of this war, especially among the native Eskimos, but they were willing to follow orders anyway. No ordinary men could have withstood the problems they incurred, such as traveling dozens of miles without adequate clothing. Although interviews and official documents were used to tell the story I suspect some of the thoughts of the men were fabricated. Also, it's obvious the story was written back in the 50s when religion and Christianity was so much more a part of the life of citizens of most of the world. These days there probably wouldn't have been reference to God, prayer, etc. It was refreshing to hear a variety of people comforted by their faith. I couldn't help but think that if everyone had the convictions of the Eskimos then there probably wouldn't have been a war at all! It was a little confusing sometimes to keep all the people straight and the places they were going. Would have liked to have an actual map of their travels. Also, don't know if this came from the original or from the reprint but there are a lot of typographical errors that tended to distract while reading. I counted one on three consecutive pages, simple things but things that should have been cleaned up by an editor. However, the book is worth reading and just adds another detail to the study of World War II."},{"Title":"The sledge patrol","review":"A truly inspiring story of survival against all odds - the elements and a determined human foe. An incredible story of irregular warfare in the extreme. An adventure that is beyond comprehension and seems too incredible for belief.

A phenomenal story of heroism and survival against all odds."},{"Title":"The sledge patrol","review":"I THOUGHT THE OVERALL ACTIVITY WAS, IN ITSELF, BOTH INTRIGUING AND INTERESTING FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WWII HISTORICAL EPISODES.

Like David Howarth's &#34;We Die Alone&#34;, it presents a part of World War 2 that I didn't even know existed. This book is about the lonely, cold work of the men who monitored the Greenland coast for German intrusion. (Weather stations in Greenland were necessary to predict weather patterns over England and eastern Europe, therefore the need for Germany to establish an outpost in the frigid, uninhabitable coastal area of NE Greenland). Very interesting. I do not believe anyone who enjoys reading about World War 2 or other survival books will be disappointed in David Howarth's books."},{"Title":"The sledge patrol","review":"Until now, its only my, that have seen the book, it's a Christmas pressente for my son.

This is an account of one of many firefights in this unknown battlefield.The progress of war needed good weather. To predict the weather for Europe the weather of Greenland was considered necessary. Good weather told each side that enemy aircraft attacks were coming. Bad weather, grounded aircraft, meant no attacks. Greenland became the epicenter for this information.American(sledge)patrols were on the lookout for secret German weather stations. The German's wanted to keep their mission secret. Both sides did their duty. Both sides had to battle against an unforgiving environment and enemy hot lead.The book is an easy read and colorful. Yet, leaves gaps in explanation. I wish it had a chapter or two on an overview of the Greenland conflict.This is a good start for history buffs."},{"Title":"The sledge patrol","review":"The story was interesting to me as I spent time with the Greenlanders and Danes at Scoresby Sund in the mid fifties and knew people who had been on the sledge patrol."},{"Title":"The sledge patrol","review":"The story itself is interesting and exciting, and I enjoyed the accompanying insights into life and travel in the arctic. The author narrates well, but almost manages to spoil it with an intolerably smug, condescending attitude towards the \\"eskimos\\", which he probably mistakes for a kind of colonial \\"affection for the natives\\". He describes them as absurdly nave, refers to them repeatedly as \\"somebody's eskimos\\" as if they are servants of a master race, and paints an image of Danes \\"teaching them Christianity\\" and introducing modernity to them while simultaneously protecting them from it as if coddling a baby. He paints careful character portraits of the Danish, Norwegian and German characters, while leaving the native Greenlanders faceless, spineless and mostly nameless. His deference to their expertise in the arctic nature does little to compensate for this.A Christian religious slant appears intermittently, which appears to come from the author rather than any of the characters or the natives \\"whose whole morality was in the Sermon on the Mount\\". Characters are described approvingly as religious or being brought back to God by the beauty of the arctic. When the German commander was regaining his sense and began to think in a balanced way again, \\"he was able to pray\\". This may go over well with a devoutly religious reader; to the rest of us it seems silly and contrived, foreign to the subject matter.I can recommend the book, but not unreservedly. If you can stomach the cultural bias, it makes a good read."},{"Title":"The sledge patrol","review":"Greenland, a Danish colony, found itself in an odd spot after the mother country was occupied by the Germans during World War Two. Technically, the colonial government, headed by Eske Brun, should have followed the instructions from Copenhagen, i.e. the Nazi occupiers. But, Brun decided to take Greenland into the camp of the Allies. Thus, he formed the Greenland Army, to which he gave instructions to patrol the virtually uninhabited northeast coast of the huge island, and be on the lookout for (and shoot at) any German forces attempting to land. This instance of a &quot;mouse that roared&quot; serves as the milieu for this story, first published in 1957.In fact, the Germans did &quot;invade&quot;. A small, armed force under a naval officer named Ritter made landfall for the purpose of establishing a meteorological station tasked with broadcasting weather reports to the Kriegsmarine&#65533;s U-boats operating in the North Atlantic. This &quot;base&quot;, out beyond the last human settlement, subsequently came to the notice of THE SLEDGE PATROL, commanded by Ib Poulsen, which represented the entire 9-man Greenland Army. (Yes, that's right. Nine!)The action of the book is principally a series of almost haphazard dog sled journeys across snow and ice-covered bodies of water and land by members of the Greenland Army and the German intruders. At times, as both sides seek each other out, one is reminded of a Keystone Cops episode. Though the climate provides some element of hardship, the damage done by each opposing force to the other is minimal. Indeed, if one views the Germans as the Bad Guys, their nominal leader, Ritter, is hardly the great villain of the piece. As a matter of fact, he&#65533;s such a nice and ultimately decent guy that he&#65533;s clearly inept in the role of military commander. Poulsen, as the leader of the Good Guys, is conscientious and responsible in carrying out his duties, but otherwise rather nondescript.This narrative serves to record the personal heroism and stamina of those men - chiefly Poulsen, Kurt Olsen and Marius Jensen - ordered by the Governor to observe and report back the German presence. And resist, if possible. Of that heroism and stamina the reader is left with no doubts. However, the time at which the events occurred, late winter/early spring of 1943, was also the period seeing an end to the Battle of Stalingrad and the final conquest of North Africa by the Anglo-American armies. Against the backdrop of these pivotal conflicts, the exploits of THE SLEDGE PATROL pale to absolute insignificance. Perhaps that&#65533;s why their story should be told. Or, perhaps, why bother? You must decide for yourself. As for me, I was left with respect for the defenders&#65533; efforts, but otherwise emotionally cold."},{"Title":"49th Fighter Group: Aces of the Pacific (Aviation Elite Units)","review":"This is a great book. Most of the time, we read stories about the fighter groups and aces when they are flying the latest aircraft in 1944-1945. This time, the story is about a fighter group that fought in the early untold stories of 1942 and 1943 with inferior aircraft. Mr. Hess gives a superb account of the 49th Fighter Group's air battles over the Darwin area and New Guinea airspace. Unlike most books, this one gives the 7th and 8th squadrons of the 49th Fighter Group a chance to tell their stories of their victories while flying the P-40 until September 1944. The book also tells about the 9th fighter squadron flying the P-40 until it was re-equipped with P-38. What is amazing is how the 7th and 8th squadrons managed to score as much as the 9th squadron considering the fact the 9th was flying P-38 for nearly 2 years compare to the 7th and 8th who were stuck flying the P-40 for the same time period."},{"Title":"49th Fighter Group: Aces of the Pacific (Aviation Elite Units)","review":"Osprey Publishing has done a series of small books like this on Elite aviation units. The 49th Fighter Group certainly qualifies as an elite unit. Less than a month after Pearl Harbour they were sent to the South Pacific flying P-40's in the defense of Darwin, Australia. They fought up the island hopping campaign until the wars end in 1945 when they were preparing to move to Okinawa for the invasion of Japan itself. Beginning at the end of 1942 the P-40's were gradually replaced with P-38's and P-47's. The most famous Ace of the 49th was Richard Bong - 40 victories. By the end of the war, the 49th as a whole had scored 668 aerial victories.About half story and half photographs, the book is profusely illustrated with wartime photographs of the aircraft, people and the places where the 49th operated.

I am concerned that the translation may not be accurate--my doubts arises because the text mentions separate courts of law and equity, and I would be surprised to learn that there was such a separation in Germany at the time that Ship of Fools was written. However, it is my understanding that this translation was a successful publication in English, regardless of how true it is (or is not) to the original. So, I am happy to have read it."},{"Title":"Wives of the Fishermen","review":"This is a very enjoyable book of the friendship and lives of two women in a small fishing village in Scotland. The book is so well written that you actually feel you are a part of village life. The book draws a moving portrait of the lives of fisherman and how it affects their families. Characters are well written especially the contrast between quiet, steady Myrtle and her flirty,best friend Annie. The book has many themes about friendship and love. I would highly recommend this book. This is the first book I read by this author, but hope to read her other books."},{"Title":"Wives of the Fishermen","review":"I read this book for a book club/discussion group and did not go into it with any expectations.

The story seems to crawl and is depressing, and the character of Annie is enraging at times. You find yourself wondering why Myrtle keeps putting up with Annie and her bratty, flirty, accusatory ways. The death of Archie is very sad and the turning point for the story, yet the plot remains snail-paced and sleepy.

I have used Barclay's Daily Study Bible off and on for forty years. It is hard to beat. Readable, smart, inspiring, faith filled - you can't do better. Barclay was a man of faith, a man of extraordinary scholarship, a man with a gift from God to take the most esoteric scholarship and make it not only readable but enjoyable, a man with a pastor's heart, and a love of the Lord.

This book (and part two) solved that problem for me. Barclay takes anywhere from one to several verses at a time and discusses them in the contexts of the time they were written, the prevailing religious thought, and their admittedly proseletizing purpose. He demonstrates how Matthew took ideas from the Hebrew Scriptures and showed that they predicted the coming of Christ. He also tells that many of these references were inappropriate, but because Matthew was intended for the Jews, this method was used. Beyond this, though, Barclay explains the meaning of the words and deeds of Christ, making opaque parables and homilies clear and compelling. The love of Christ and his ministry to save mankind come alive in this book. Barclay elucidates the message of Christ in a powerful, heart-gripping and understandable way. I am a Jew, and recommend this book to people of any faith if they wish to understand Matthew."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Matthew (The Daily study Bible series)","review":"This is one of the two volumes Barclay wrote on the Gospel of Matthew - each covering roughly half of this book of the Bible. These are a part of his series on the New Testament, where Barclay clearly discusses each section of each book of this portion of the Bible. Each section of the book starts with William Barclay's personal translation of the text and then goes into a discussion of the text, the times, the culture, the people, and the beliefs surrounding the text. William Barclay talks about the Bible in the context of when it was written and how it applies today. It is not surprising that the writings of this scholar hold up now as they did 30 years ago. Funny how truth stays the same year after year - it keeps going, and going..."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Matthew (The Daily study Bible series)","review":"According to one's view of the Bible and Christian beliefs, you will typically approach a commentator who shares your approach and viewpoints. Those who believe in literal interpretation will shun Barclay in favor of literal intepreters.

Written about 50 years ago, much of the background information and schalorship in his commentaries are outdated. Sometimes he stretched historical/cultural background too much to explain the text. Conservative readers should be aware that Barclay was a universalist (one who believes that all people will be saved ultimately). He does not believe in miracles and tries to explain them away in his commentaries on the Gospels. However, his comments on the relevance of the Bible can still be very valuable for discerning readers.Advanced students would not need to be told where to find more updated scholarship on NT Bible. Beginning students should get Tom Wright's two-volume \\"Matthew For Everyone\\" instead of Barclay's. The volume on Matthew by Michael J. Wilkins in NIV Application Commentary series and Craig Keener's volume in IVP New Testament Commentary series are both excellent for slightly more advanced readers.

He argues persuasively for the importance of this topic by pointing out that Young Turks ruled the Ottoman Empire for nearly all of the period 1908-18; that former members ran the country until 1960; and that even today, the official state ideology shows the influence of ideas dating to that period. Perhaps Hanioglu's most original conclusion concerns his argument that the Young Turks constituted three quite distinct movements.The research base of &quot;Young Turks in Opposition&quot; deserves comment, being one of the most prodigious this reviewer has seen. Hanioglu's relatively slight text of 216 pages contains over 2,500 footnotes, or some twelve per page, or one every four lines. And what footnotes! The author has done extensive research in the archives of twelve countries, including those of Albania, Greece, Israel, and Sweden. His work in the Turkish archives includes not just the usual Istanbul documents, but with those located at the Ottoman embassies in London, Paris, and Rome. He searched out the private papers of twenty-four individuals in places as disparate as Thessaloniki, Edinburgh, and New Haven. The list of periodicals consulted runs to over five pages. This heroic scholarly apparatus is by no means for show purposes; quite the contrary, it closely undergirds the author's weighty and original study.Middle East Quarterly, June 1995"},{"Title":"In Ole Virginia;: Or, Marse Chan, and other stories","review":"Although the dialect rendering of Black English in these short stories may offend today's delicate politcal sensibilities, the reader should bear in mind that these stories were written in another century for a different audience. Get past that, and you have pure Plantation Tradition - the same tradition that inspired Margaret Mitchell and disgusted William Faulkner, James Branch Cabell, and Ellen Glasgow. The stories are simple, sincere and guaranteed to elicit emotion. Marse Chan is an American Classic, and No Haid Pawn has been likened to a tale of Poe. Get this, read it, and if you don't see life in Ante-bellum Virginia as it was, you can see it as Page thought it should have been."},{"Title":"Central Casting: Heroes of Legend","review":"This was the first book in the Central Casting series, and each one got progressively better as time went on.Central Casting: Heroes of Legend is designed for creating detailed backgrounds for any fantasy-based role-playing game, including Dungeons&Dragons;, 7 Seas, TORG, and Lord of the Rings.

Lauber takes us on a jaunt through history starting with the cave man and his ideas about bathing. She then jumps to the ancient Middle East, and then moves on to Greece and Rome. Then she covers the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Lauber then moves to the United States, and the rest of the book focuses on modern bathing. The book is illustrated by John Manders (who does an excellent job adding bits of humor in his drawings), and does not include any photographs of ancient ruins or artifacts or the like. But there is still plenty of information--did you know that ancient Romans used a sponge on the end of a stick instead of toilet paper? The stick was rinsed in salty water after they used it. And that a flush toilet was invented in 1594? This is a readable nonfiction book that makes learning about the history of cleanliness fun."},{"Title":"What You Never Knew About Tubs, Toilets, & Showers (Around-The-House History)","review":"The question, \\"Where did they go to the bathroom?\\" is asked at living hsitory museums all the time! Both adults and children want to know the every day details of basic human needs. At the Royal Governor's Palace, the jail, the courthouse, and the homes of signers of the Declaration of Independence -- THAT'S the question whispered by blushing adults or blurted out by curious children.This book answers all these questions in an honest, entertaining and accurate manner. The illustrations are appropriate for both children and adults. They are less revealing and/or \\"inapproprate\\" than classical art.I heartily recommend this book!"},{"Title":"What You Never Knew About Tubs, Toilets, & Showers (Around-The-House History)","review":"After I had read their book on the history of dining, I couldn't wait for this one. Tubs, Toilets and Showers handles the awkward subjects of what you do in the bathroom and how people used to do it. It has vignettes from several cultures and time periods.Many children (and some adults) will be surprised to learn that the Europeans came to value cleanliness much later than did many other cultures. They may laugh to imagine how certain historical figures might have smelled.Since the book deals with bathing and eliminating, some of the illustrations do involve nudity. However, the illustrator has drawn the cartoons in such a way that genital areas are hidden. I would not find the drawings objectionable for young children.Baths and hygiene are often areas of conflict between parents and children.

I thought the colorful illustrations were hilarious. The book not only entertains, it provides the reader with useful research information. Amusing sidebars poke fun at the primitive waste-disposal methods that prevailed through the ages. Readers will also be amazed to discover that baths were considered unhealthy during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It was not until the discovery of germs in the mid-1800s that the importance of cleanliness was recognized, and it wasn't until 1851 that the White House had a bathtub with running water.

It is a collection of short stories that run the gamut from the Civil War era to a young married couple going to Myrtle Beach for their honeymoon. It is an odd collection that is intriguing, strange, unexpected and at times touching.

While reading I felt as if I had somehow gotten hold of a first draft, one that had NEVER seen an editor! The relationships in this book are bizarre, things are never fully explained (who is Jesse? was Trista ever really married to this Amerson guy officially? If so, why wouldn't he help her? What happens to Trista's inheritance? What is the deal with this swamp woman?) and you have no opportunity to care at all about the characters. Also, the ITALICS! At least 20 italicized words on every page! The heroine is tortured throughout the book, repeatedly raped, abused and degraded, and no one is made to answer for the crimes. The &quot;love interest&quot; Blaze, is more of a &quot;lust interest&quot; as every time the two main characters are together all they do is have brutal, graphic sex, never sharing a meaningful conversation, and yet they are &quot;in love&quot; at the end of the book. Most disturbing is that when the &quot;hero&quot; Blaze finds out about the atrocities committed against Trista, he does nothing, and rapes her again. This is a sick and disturbing book. I don't know that I will ever read Rosemary Rogers again, though I have enjoyed her books in the past. This one goes right to the second hand book store. PS: if Trista attempts to hit Blaze, but he &quot;brutally captures her wrists in his hands&quot; ONE time , this same scene happens 20 times! God, what an awful book! Also, the plot description above is totally wrong. Trista never joins a wagon train, she moves to Paris! Blaze isn't a cowboy, he is a Civil War correspondent!"},{"Title":"The Wanton (An Avon Book)","review":"If this were the first Rosemary Rogers book I had ever read,I would never read another one. This morbid book is terribly degrading to women,and the incidents that occur in it are beyond digusting! I am normally a fastreader, but this relatively small book took me four days tocomplete. It was not detailed enough to hold my interest,and the characters never did come to life for me. I often found myself having to read and re-read whole paragraphs just to try to understand their meaning. Sometimes I found myself thinking about other things while I was reading it - like &quot;Did the trash get taken out tonight?&quot; I nearly drove my family and friends insane with my complaining about whether or not I would EVER be able to finish it. The whole book was nothing but a series of trials and tribulations. The ONLY reason I was determinedto finish it was to see if this poor heroine survived the atrocitiesdone to her. Even the ending was unsatisfactory - a relatively &quot;happy&quot; ending, but too vague and far to abrupt. It might have been better if some of the devastating tortures the heroine experienced had gradually been dealt with. I got the impression that Ms. Rogers just got too depressed with writing the content of the book and decided just to end it. The first Rosemary Rogers book I ever read wasSweet Savage Love - that book I have kept and enjoyed re-readingfor years. Wanton hit the trash can as soon as I finishedreading it. Literally! It is definitely NOT a romance. This books depicts the heroine's life as &quot;a living Hell.&quot; The only excuse I can seefor the publisher putting this book on the market is because of the draw of anestablished author's name. That, or Ms. Rogers just didn't have anything betterin the works to submit in time for her deadline.

And then goes about getting that yes by any and all means necessary through out the novel.With that said, I tensely disliked this novel... This was by far the worst novel I have ever read and actually completed. Rogers heaped way too much abuse on the female main character. She goes through so much {which includes beatings and being raped at the hands of evil stepbrother and of course her own husband. Oh did I mention the gang rape?!}I was actually hoping for a happy ending for her, which Rogers refused to give. This book ended so badly that I tossed the book in the trash.

And if that's not enough...Alan's Song of Love also relates the author's life as an abused wife, the subsequent (and necessary) divorce...and her life as a single, working mom.Most of all, though, Alan's Song of Love is a true story about love, both Alan's and his mom's. Dr. Ashley tells of a fellow human being whose life was struck down far too early. Further, she tells of a mom who had to change the system, from the way the hospital treated AIDS patients...to the way physicians and other parents viewed them as well.This page-turner offers the reader an opportunity to step into a different world, a place where crisis roller coasters to despair, anger, frustration...and back up to love, hope and the realization of self-reliance. Dr. Ashley writes, \\"Alan had no qualms about death, nor did I, finally.\\" And, \\"Anything wrong, Al? No, mom. Nothing's wrong. It's just that nothing's right!\\"On January 22, 1988 Alan's pain and anxiety were ended...he succumbed to his illness. And the same strength of character...the same love...and the same self-reliance Vikki Ashley brought to bear to help her son...enabled her to survive his death. Alan's Song of Love is a wonderful love story, as well as evidence of Spirit, and the resultant strength and courage!"},{"Title":"Growing Vegetables California Style","review":"I just absolutely love this book. Living near Sacramento, it is really hard to find good information that applies to this climate. This book explains what needs to be done and when. We cannot just rely on the zone 9 recommendations other books give and this book gives exact planting times for a variety of vegetables. I highly recommend it for everyone who lives in the Central Valley area."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"This book is excellent both as a fresh and simple approach to a tough subject and a standard referance for anybody who needs to use calculus but - like me - can't retain list of formulas in their head. I took two quarters of college calculus and needed a third but the national guard sent me to Iraq for a year and a half. Naturally I was worried about steppping back into my courses and having to keep up with sharp freshmen right out of highschool honors programs. So I bought some textbooks to self-study. I have complete confidence in my ability to tackle my remaining math requirements after I demobilize from reading and doing the problems in this book on my own."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Last week I was re-reading this classic that I had in an old edition (1965). I then began the current edition and found that Gardner's contribution definitely upgrades this book from moderately good to very good. I have been using this book for years as an entertaining read specially with maxima and minima concepts. This current edition has some of the language updated to conform with modern usage. The book still inspires me to dig deeper into the calculus. The writing is succinct and the illustrations are quite good. After reading this book delve into James Stewart's Calculus."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"This is a book I definitely would keep for a long time, even until I go to college. I'm HS junior and taking AP calculus, with only algebra 2 as preparation from last year. I found this book is very easy to understood even for a self-taught person like me. I would recommend this book for every body who is taking calculus with or w/o proper preparation.The sample question covered broad type of calculus question you might face in the exam. I actually borrowed this book from my school library,and found it's worth to have it one at home. Now I'm gonna purchase it."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"This is a highly recommendable supplement for anyone taking first-year calculus. It will take you all the way up to integration, and explains the concepts in both clear and simple terms. You will not even need much of a foundation in geometry or pre-calculus to understand the material in this book. Although I know there are some good calculus teachers out there, I can say for sure that Silvanus P. Thompson did a better job explaining the key concepts than my calculus professor. It's not that I had a bad one- it's that Thompson is obviously just better. While I would recommend this mostly to those about to or taking calculus I, it also makes a good review for those who slept through most of it. All in all, an excellent piece on a most difficult topic."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Don't let the other reviews confuse you. Amazon automatically copied the reviews from the 1998 version to the kindle version. Poor form.The kindle book is the 1942 version of this classic, and I'm glad it's available. It's the book I used back in the 60's before high school to get a feel for the topic. College calculus was that much easier because of this book. Highly recommended, but absent Gardner's additional material and footnotes."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Don't get me wrong I am a fan of this book; however, today there are numerous books which are provide better insight for the novice and student.The main issue is that the author considers infinite series expansion as a simple case. I am sure when this book was written, it was easy compared to textbooks at the time. But the issue is that some very complex concepts are simplified to the point where the student will lack a fundamental understanding by today's standards.Though this book does provide some interesting insight into precalc topics and the author does give some interesting techniques which predate calculators. So there are some real gems in the book which make it worthwhile reading.The other issue is that Marin Gardners input about limits is nice, but there are plenty of opportunities for revision or adding to this book, and Gardner's input would have help.My suggestion is Adrian Banner's Calculus Lifesaver for students and anyone brushing up. And of Morris Kline's book as well. Though it is not exactly light reading."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I didn't take Calculus in school - most of my Calculus knowledge comes from working through this book - but I've been able to apply what I've learned to video game developement in a useful way. The book was tough going at times, there were some background topics it was assumed I understood (polynomial long division, finding roots of cubic equations, etc.) that I had to dig around the internet to learn, but for the most part it's laid out fairly step-by-step.I do wonder at the relevance of all the detailed by-hand methods of integration and derivation now that computer tools like Wolfram Alpha can do it automatically - Gardner talks about that in the intro - but in the end the theoretical understanding gained from doing the work manually for a while is probably worth it.The language is a little olde-tyme, but Thompson has a good sense of humor and pragmatism that shines through."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I have a pdf (not Kindle) version of Calculus Made Easy on my Kindle. I have read only the beginning of this witty and clear book, but Thompson has already made me a big fan with his polemic against willfully obscure explanation of calculus and his breakdown of a complex subject into simple and lucid components. You quickly understand why a \\"little bit of a little bit\\" can be treated as marginal when interpreting the meaning of a differential. The book won't turn you into a mathematician, but it will help you appreciate what calculus is about and add this subject to your liberal arts education. Not the calculus textbook you had to slog through in college."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"While not a complete overview of calculus if you're taking a course in microeconomics, macroeconomics, policy analysis, policy modeling, or anything that uses calculus, consider picking this up as a supplement.This book is not part of the educational/textbook industry and its price reflects that. But the low price should in no way overshadow the usefulness of this book. This is not your formal proof of calculus. This is a quick and dirty alternative presentation that will work with many students who balked at the cut and dry presentation in university classes.Calculus hasn't changed much in the last 100 years so why not pick up a cheap supplement and pass your courses? The digital copy is $3 each. I recommend this book to all my students as a refresher and as a new way of seeing the material."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I'm going to be a junior in HS next year and take AP Calculus, but I got bored over the summer so I decided to pick up this book and learn some stuff to give me an edge next year. The first few chapters were very easy to understand and were written in plain simple language, but I got pretty hard when I started the chapter on finding derivatives of ln's and exponents. I spent like, a whole week on that one chapter before I finally understood. However, I hit a brick wall on the chapter about dodges, pitfalls, and triumphs (Integration techniques). This chapter is HARD HARD HARD!!!!!!! I'm still on this chapter; the first section of it is easy enough, but it got much harder on the second example of subsitution. Anyways, if you are going to buy this book, then be prepared to be stuck several times throughout the book! Oh and you need to have taken serveral years of math in order to get thru the book; I suggest taking a look at it AFTER you finish 2 years of algebra (Alg I and II), geometry, and Trig (The guy who said he read the book when he took geometry must be on crack or something because theres NO WAY a geometry student could understand this stuff (well, MAYBE the first few chapters, which are REALLY easy; it get MUCH harder from there), because geometry is BELOW Alg II and Trig, both of which are CRUCIAL to your understanding of calculus!) If you do manage to get thru the book, then it is VERY satisfying, and you'll learn a LOT, because calculus sort of ties up all your math up to this point; all that math that you have learned throughout all those years will finally come together!"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Being an electrical engineer (with additional majors in mathematics and physics) and pushing twenty-five years work experience, I have to admit not a little anger at having read this book. This anger, however, stems from the facts a) that I was not fortunate enough to have had it as a resource while I was learning calculus and b) I have seen a lot of author-aggrandizing techno-babble dedicated to the subject that has served only to discourage the masses! Mr. Gardner has done a great service with regard to both Mr. Thompson's opus and all students of mathematics. With Mr. Gardner's additions, it is even simpler, more straightforward and, in terminology borrowed from the realm of pure mathematics, &quot;elegant&quot; in its presentation and demystification of the subject. To anyone beginning the study of calculus and desiring to understand and appreciate the subject, it is highly recommended for both reading and practice.M. L. Sewell, Jr., 3/2000"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I have been teaching Calculus for the last two years, and I just stumbled across this book a few weeks ago. What I found was a book that explains the philosophy of the subject in a very simple manner, making it easy to understand even for people who are not proficient in math.The concepts in Calculus are really simple things; as Gardner puts it, &quot;the universe seems to favor simplicity in its fundamental laws&quot;. But there's always the teacher's pride, which leads him to make it all seem difficult, expecting the student to be amazed at how much the teacher knows. Alas the true result is that the student is usually left confused, loses interest in the subject, perhaps gives up on a career that he/she otherwise would have succeeded in, etc. I know about this, because I am guilty of it myself.I recommend this book to people who:1. Are just learning calculus. The book uses easy-to-understand language, simple examples, etc. Read about the binomial theorem before reading this book, though.2. People who want to grasp the essence of calculus, not necessarily for a college course. Easy, entertaining reading; as stated earlier, the philosophy of the subject is presented in a comprehensible manner.3. Calculus teachers. Definitely a must! This book is a good example of how calculus should be taught. Though you may not draw totally upon it, having read through Thompson's book can give you a good idea on how to organize your course and how to explain fundamental concepts"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"After 3 years of advanced mathematics in college and an engineering degree, everything I knew about calculus was rote: I could come up with the answers, but not because I understood the underlying principles or basis, but because I could memorize procedures. Years out of school, I bought this book and read it, and the light bulb turned on. I don't know whether I was just a bad student before, had bad teachers, or simply was presented the material in a way that was incompatible with the way I learn. In any case, this book did it for me, and perhaps it will do the same for others. I've since gone back through my old college math books, and they're as difficult to understand as they were the first time. If you know someone struggling with calculus, do them a favor and get them this book."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Most calculus courses are taught to college freshman by graduate students who really didn't understand the course when they were freshman being taught by graduate students who didn't understand it when they were taught, etc, etc. Once you realize that most college instructors aren't proficient in the course to teach it, then you start to realize that if you're ever going to truly understand calculus, then you better find an alternative source of knowledge. And this book is exactly that source.Read this book before you enter one of those imposing lecture halls (or at least the appropriate chapter of this book). Then and only then will you begin to at least recognize what the instructor is saying. And hopefully you will recognize when they're saying something that is not quite right.Calculus is not hard; it's just not easy. This book probably should have been titled Calculus Made Understandable, or Caculus Made Fun, but it wasn't. So read the book and do the problems. It will open up a whole world of enjoyment that will last a lifetime.Remember this very important point. Math was never learned in a lecture hall --- it's only truly learned in a study hall or library doing problems over and over and over."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Calculus Made Easy is truly a well-written book. It divides into over 20 chapters thorough examples and applications of calculus as well as the development of calculus itself, and everything is surprisingly contained in fewer than 300 pages! Authors of many modern-day calculus textbooks twice its size try to explain the same fundamental concepts but cannot achieve Thompson's levels of triumph.Topics in this work include: limits, maxima, minima, successive differentiation, compound interest, law of organic growth, and more. Though the subjects are frequently isolated for each chapter, Thompson has nonetheless provided insights to the degree that one could synthesize or put together these various concepts to formulate their own interesting problems and procedures.With the great Martin Gardner to revise this classic and to provide further mathematical expositions, Calculus Made Easy is highly recommended for the lover of mathematics as well as the teacher who wants to present mathematics from a better thematic standpoint."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"This is the very best math book I have ever read. As many other reviewers have pointed out, this book is an excellent source for UNDERSTANDING calculus!!! If you want to understand calculus, this book is an outstandingly excellent beginning. I studied calculus over 30 years ago as a math major. I currently teach mathematics and was absolutely stunned when I ran across this wonderful, beautful, lucid exposition of the differential and integral calculus. Dr. Thompson is surely ranked among the greatest math teachers of all time. Of course, Martin Gardner's revision simply increases the lucidity, joy and beauty of this mathematics classic. MUST reading for any literate and intelligent person, who wants to UNDERSTAND mathematics. There are tons of books that one can read in order to learn how to \\"do\\" mathematics, but Thompson's book is in a class by itself, when it comes to excellence in teaching mathematial understanding. I simply cannot find the words to describe the sheer joy and wonder I experienced while reading Calculus Made Easy!!!!"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"What one fool can do, another can.Or so goes the introduction to &quot;Calculus Made Easy&quot; by Silvanus P. Thompson. He's right, of course. I should know because I'm a fool myself.One of the great things about this book is Thompson's surprising sense of humor. I just wasn't expecting a math text, written nearly a century ago, to be so irreverent. In fact, the author goes out of his way to slam the math professors of his day and their methods of teaching. Some things never change.Speaking of fools. I flunked out of pre-algebra in the 8th grade, dropped out of high-school at 15, and did not return to college until I was 28. I had my sights set on a computer engineering degree; however, I knew that in order to achieve my goals I would need to go back and slay those math demons from my past.After completing the algebra stuff with surprising ease, I now venture into &quot;the calculus&quot;, as they call it. Just those words &quot;the calculus&quot; are enough to strike fear in the hearts of millions. Isn't calculus for nerdy, Cal-Tech types? Can mere mortals, fools even, understand how to integrate a simple funtion? It's telling that a rather large percentage of those who enroll in calculus every year end up dropping the class. What a shame, because as it turns out, according to Thompson, the real fools are the professors themselves.Thompson's book will demystify much of the material from a first-semester calculus course. You will learn differentiation, integration, lengths of curves, etc., all quite painlessly (well, you'll have to put in the practice time).Of course, one will need to be comfortable with algebra in order to pick up a book such as this, but trig and geometry are also helpful as some of the functions are trigonometric. I should point out, though, that you don't absolutely NEED trigonometry to do calculus. What little you do need can be picked up rather quickly from a book like &quot;Geometry and Trigonometry for Calculus.&quot;My advice: if you are about to enter a calculus 1 course (as I am), then spend some time with this book. It will give you a great head start on the class and is surprisingly readable."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I went thru 5 years of college, emerging with degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I never really understood the foundations of calculus, but managed to pass the math classes by learning by rote. Years later, I discovered this book, and it was truely a revelation. I now know what 5 years of high-level education failed to teach me. This book explains things in ways that my other math books never did. If I'd had this when I entered college, math classes wouldn't have been such a struggle. If you're about to begin taking calculus classes, I recommend that you read this first. It'll make your life much easier."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"The mathematicians who write textbooks are invariably sadistic cretins with either no aptitude for effective communication or contempt for it. The dirty little secret of the textbook world is that students don't pick textbooks, so meeting a student's needs isn't a publisher's goal. A textbook author's primary goal is to solicit the approval and support of other academics. This is not a system that often rewards clarity or readable prose. After reading this book, I realized that calculus is really very simple and is based on a relatively small set of simple rules. It's incredible beauty and power comes from it's simplicity. Mathematicians have a habit of making very simple concepts sound more complicated than they are. A Definite Integral for instance, which is governed by something audaciously called The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, is subtraction - fricking subtraction. Anyone who couldn't &quot;derive it&quot; when needed should probably switch to a career that involves flame broiling and extra cheese. The obviousness of the Fundamental Theorem doesn't make it any less significant, but it does prove that the &quot;hardness&quot; of math is a function of how pretentious the expositor is. Thompson's relatively down to Earth and casual style helped me get excited about math again. If you're like me, you'll find yourself wondering what all the fuss was about after working through this book. It's a great book and an absolute must for anyone taking their first stab at calculus, especially if your professor is from Bangledesh and bribed someone to pass the TOEFL."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"A topic as complicated as calculus can be approached in many different ways, each appealing to a different kind of audience at a different level of understanding. I began my second college career as a physics major and consequently had to take calculus. Despite a firm grasp of precalc algebra and trig, I didn't really grasp the concepts at an intuitive level, which is necessary for facing anything other than very obvious problems cooked up for the occasion. Calculus Made Simple offered me a window into the crucial concepts and let me enter the mindset needed for tackling calculus problems. I read the original version without the benefit of Martin Gardner's improvements (I am sure he did a spectacular job) so I am not sure about the new version, but the writing did seem a little dated at times. It didn't bother me, but I know for others who might already be turned off by having to learn calc, it could just be another detail that pushes them away. A more modern approach is How to Ace Calculus, which I also found useful. Be warned, though, for those about to take calculus for engineering and the physical sciences, these books deal with grounding you in the most basic nuts and bolts of the subject. The problems you encounter in, say, the Thomas's calc textbook become waaaay more complicated than what you get in these guides. Regardless, I give the book high marks and hope you find it helpful too."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"This book casually fills in the blanks between knowing what calculus looks like and why it is that it actually works. The authors make it comfortable to get into understanding the calculus without one intimidating and lifeless mechanism after another. This would not be a good book to learn calculus from, but it is truly the best complement to a standard calculus textbook."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"One of those rare math books that read like a thriller. Those who loved William Dunham's &quot;Mathematical Universe&quot; will surely treasure this one. Thank you Mr. Thompson."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Just when you think Martin Gardner can't top himself, he magically appears with another work that is more stunning than his last... if that is possible. Don't even give thjs a second thought , just buy it... for you , your kids, or whoever. There are only 2 people to consider if you want the best in science, math and puzzles: Mr. Gardner and his heir apparennt, Terry Stickels. They are the best--get everything you can from both these great authors!!!"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"The pre-Gardner version of the book was utterly charming. The writing style is wonderful (\\"What one fool can do, another can.\\"). And even though I know calculus well, the pre-Gardner book still shed light on me -- \\"Oh, right, I hadn't thought of it in that way!\\" I am not sure whether reading this book is a good use of time nowadays for someone who is trying to learn calculus for the first time, given how well certain modern calculus textbooks are written; but at the time Thompson wrote this gem, standard calculus textbooks were generally atrocious, and this book must have been a godsend to many students. I have not read the post-Gardner version, but from reading the other reviews, it appears that Gardner removed much of the charm from the writing style. Why he would do that, I do not know. Four stars for the pre-Gardner book; 3 stars for post."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I did not read this book to help me learn Calculus; instead I was looking for a bit of reinforcement on certain topics. I should explain that I have taken college level Calculus, in fact I managed to get an A in it my first time around in a 5 week summer class. Yes, it was a regular class of four credit level Calculus, the same you would take in a semester. I'm also an Applied Mathematics major. Learning Calculus this fast is both good and bad in some regards. The speed with which you cover the material means you may not fully grasp the full implications of a technique. Hence the reason I wanted to read this book before I start my semester course work.I realize this book was published in the early 1900's and I have the updated 1998 edition by Martin Gardner. Frankly, I would be incredibly confused in areas if it wasn't for Gardner's notes. Knowing how to do Calculus was the only reason I could read this book with any general understanding. However, there were sections where Thompson does things that even confused me and I know how to arrive at the answer with the methods I learned in my class.One thing I got tired of is that Thompson constantly refers to almost everything as a \\"dodge\\". When he was discussing the Chain Rule, he did not call it the Chain Rule, he said \\"this is a useful dodge\\". The same thing happened when we get to the section on Integration. I don't feel this book has any use for actually practicing these methods with any accuracy. A student may learn what they are, but telling a teacher this is a \\"useful dodge\\" rather than the \\"Chain Rule\\", will only confuse the situation, in my opinion.A good part of this book is it has sections full of problems you can solve and the answers in the back of the book. This was excellent and I find the problems very enjoyable to go through to give me extra practice. For that this book is excellent. Another part that is very on point and I wholly agree with Thompson, is that Calculus IS easy to understand. This insistence that mathematicians use all kinds of fancy language to explain very simple things, such as Differentiation (which may be intimidating to some students), is just silly. I completely agree with Thompson's view on that particular point. I also have to agree with his insistence on practice. You only get good at something when you practice it. As Thompson points out, mathematics is like an art form, the only way you get good is by repeatedly working on similar problems. That's the only way you will become proficient and master the Calculus.Other than that I couldn't get into this book. Some people may find it useful, but the \\"simple language\\" had me floundering at parts. This is greatly discouraging when it's something you already know how to do. Such as Definite and Indefinite Integrals, I don't particularly like how those topics were handled. The way they are explained feels more complex than what they are, if you just wanted to learn the bare basics of what is going on.2.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I wish that I had been introduced to this book when I took math in my first year of college. It would have encourged me to not fear the big &quot;C&quot;. I would hope that this book would be placed, always, on the list of math books to be examined. It should help a lot of students to continue to take math and not be intimidated by the fear of the unknown, which &quot;...makes cowards of us all&quot;."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Martin Gardner is a busybody who has removed much of the charm from a great work of populist mathematics.

Many of the things it says are simply wrong, like the opening discussions of 'orders of minuteness'. This book gives a lot of disinformation in attempts to simplify difficult topics, when all that is needed of these topics are clear unthreatening explanations.

This book made me fully understand the area of Calculus more than those \\"doorstopper\\" books they recommended to us in school. It's well worth it. It's not a short cut and pictorial book but it gets right down to subject without the \\"genius jargon\\". It's for the average person. It's the first Calculus book I have worn out so far flipping through pages. Mr. Gardner encourages his readers to engage the subject and explains in step-by-step simplicity. He uses examples, a bit of humor to urge you on. Every subjects starts with easy to understand explanations then progresses on to solutions. What strikes me is how the thought is well driven home by Gardner's method. I'm now having fun with derivatives and integrals. After having done the whole of this book I could not believe I have tackled some of the most complicated solutions. My highest regards and praises to the work of Mr. Gardner in encouraging and giving future generations this book that they may be educated in a subject that looks very threatening to the regular man/woman. I carry this book in my bag and use to hone my skills in engineering exams. I would highly recommend it to students and even those taking licensure exams. Most of all, it should be used by teachers to encourage their students as I was once a student too."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Well, Calculus was coming up in a nice warm summer semester and the last thing on my mind was learning a foreign language. Well, luckly I happened to stumble upon this book. It is written by someone who thought the same way all the rest of us college students think - why are text books, especially math ones, written in a form as to not allow us to learn what they are speaking of? Well, this book is quite the oppsite of those 40 lbs text books you buy in the college book stores. It is written in a way my mother could understand (no really, she understood it), and helped me out through first semester calculus. This book is a great study guide to go along with any calc book, I really can't stress the fact enough that this math book is easy to understand."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I like this book because I hate limits. From a strict mathematical point of view limits are standard for explaining calculus. But from a practical point of view (physicists, engineers, economists) the notion of the infinitesimal may be the most appropriate. It's worth noting that Thompson's degrees of smallness are an accurate reflection of the theory of nilpotent infinitesimals described in \\"A Primer of Infinitesimal Analysis\\". A combination of these two books might make for a great introduction to practical and alternative-theoretical calculus."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Absolutely great book.

Better yet, if like me, you need a review after more than 20 years' (I took 3 calc sequences and DiffEq in 1978!), find an on-line calc course and take it (a good compromise between taking an attendance class and doing it yourself which usually never happens)."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"This book is quite possibly the best introduction to the Calculus I have found.

In spite of its age, this version is still very useful, though the symbology is dated. I am certain the latest version is every bit as good as mine."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"SilvanusThompson wrote numerous books on physics and electromagnetism, math, and engineering topics during his lifetime, but he's most remembered for this great little primer on calculus. Now refurbished by the redoubtable Martin Gardner, who was in his eighties when this was published, if I remember right, it has even more appeal than before. I was most familiar with Gardner from his 25 year stint as mathematical games editor at Scientific American, and for his classic book, Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, one of the great classics of science writing.I've seen dozens of books that purport to teach calculus and math more painlessly, and most fall far short of their intended goal. But this is one that hits the mark. It's much clearer and more concise than the usual textbook treatments, and after this, you could consult those books for more information. But if you just want the basic idea without too much trouble and hassle, this book is the best I've seen. It ranks with Lacelot Hogben's Mathematics for the Million as one of the great teaching books on math or science of the past century.My test for this book was to look ahead at the integration section, which is much harder to teach than differentiation, but the author does equally well here. The worked examples are well chosen and proceed step by step. Occasionally, there was a simplfication step that I had to go over several times due to my own rustiness, but overall, this is the best primer on the subject I've seen.Sometimes the wording is a little quaint, but that just makes it more endearing, which isn't an easy feat for your typical intimidating math book.By the way, if you're looking for a good book on Advanced Calculus after this one, Advanced Calculus Demystified by David Bachman is the best book I've seen for easily explaining this difficult subject."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Written in the superb style of Brisirh science writers. Straightforward, evidence of classroom (teaching) experience, presenting an easy approach to understanding the basics of the calculus."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"This book is a great primer on Calculus and a good quick read before taking the dive into a Calc I college course. It's well written, funny at times (believe it or not), and Martin Gardner's notes give even more insight to the concepts.But be wary this book approachs Calculus in a rather old fashioned way. My professor arrived at the derivative with a very different method than Thompson did. So you need to be able to see the underlying concepts and don't get too caught up on syntax."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Mr. Thompson's book is very good for the people who wishes to study about the subject. The book explains an easy way before you will enter the door and explore calculus. This book does not contains many mathematical solved problems, it contains more wordy explainations and shows some important formulas and gaves a very clear understanding of their principles. Yes that is it...understanding the principles first is the best.This book is best when paired with Teach Yourself Calculus by Hugh Neill? please check the spelling of the author since I little forget of it. Why? because when you are already in the room, Teach yourself provides examples that will let you execute the principles with clear explainations that will stimulate your brain during your journey. Okay Calculus made easy before entering the door and when you are already inside then you pair it with Teach Yourself. and then...Additional book must be added of the two above. Why? Because Teach Yourself will gives you skills to begin solving problems. And the 3000 SOLVED PROBLEMS IN CALCULUS by Mendelson is the book to practice in addition to your teachers examples, if you have much budget then you can add more solving problem books like the 3000 solved problems, etc...I am sure that it will provide the best result....Goodluck!!!"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Yes this book doesn't follow the standard way of teaching calculus, but it does what no other book I am aware of achieved. It makes calculus clear and understandable for the newbie. After reading this book, you can read the \\"standard\\" book without any problem.The text is clear and concise. It is not obstructed by a millions of examples as is usually the case with other books. The examples are few but are carefully picked and illustrate the matching topic perfectly. The text is divided in many small chapters which make it easy to find what you want when you need it.The exercises are all located at the end of each chapter, in the same philosophy as the samples, there are not too many and they illustrate the topic at hand perfectly. The solution are provided at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Before you give up on the calculus, read this book. I bought this book for my son in the college. He told me that it had changed his perception of the calculus completely, giving him much better ubderstanding of the subject. Why they don't use this book in the college?"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"After looking all over the web and the library for calculus tutorials, the ones I found were to complicated-- the authors instead of aiming to let you learn it were using the traditional approach which basically shows off intelligence. I found this book and started reading it. I got everything, at the most I just had to read a passage 2 or 3 times. This covers differentiation, integration, maxima and minima and much much much more. I cant rate this book high enough. After trying those large textbooks-- and being stumped-- this book is excellent and easy to understand-- even a 14 yr old, like me, can understand. Buy it-- you won't regret."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I am a linguist without much math background. I wanted to understand the concepts of calculus and to get familiar with the mathmatical expressions. I am very happy to have found this book. What I thought was a difficult task turned out to be easy and unexpectedly enjoyable. I invested some weekend spare time reading this book. the reward is that now many technical reading on speech and natural language processing become much easier."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I received the book fast enough, the book itself however, not what i would call \\"pleasure reading!\\" It is part of one of my courses for my master's degree and up to now, I have read 5 chapters, i do not think it makes calculus easy!"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I am now finished with Calculus II and I still don't understand the content of thisbook. It is extremely complicated and poorly written. It makes it seem that Calculus is so easy, but it's just easier studying the old fasioned way, doing homework problems.I really don't recommend this book, at least for undergrads."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Though this book has much to recommend it, I have one gripe. The section entitled \\"How to deal with sines and cosines\\" 'proves' that d sin(theta)/d theta=cos(theta), with an accompanying picture showing sin(theta) against theta, with theta in degrees. The problem is that the above relation is only true when theta is measured in radians. The text assumes the reader is familiar with radians, which is certainly assuming too much for the beginner. Perhaps the next edition could clarify these points. I enjoyed the rest of the book. Incidentally, I see that only 2 out of 6 people liked this review. I assume that the majority disagree with my comments about the derivative of sin(theta). I'd appreciate it if they could point out where they think I'm going wrong. For those of you who aren't sure, why not try taking the numerical derivative on a calculator: [sin(theta+dtheta)-sin(theta)]/dtheta, for dtheta=0.001 degrees say. Does this approximate cos(theta) if the calculator is in DEG mode, or if the calculator is in RAD mode? Is this difference clear from reading the book?Great! Now we can comment on each-other's reviews, all of the people who disliked this review can tell me why they disagree."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Excellent review.

Silvanus P. Thompson, though a poly-math, was indeed an electrical engineer. The same cannot be said about Gardner.Even in Thompson's last edition (3rd), he good-naturedly taunted and teased mathematicians. If an update really was necessary, it should have been done by an EE like Paul Nahin (wrote the 1988 IEEE Oliver Heaviside biography and An Imaginary Tale among others), not by a Mathematician like Martin Gardner."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"if there are shortcuts to learning calculus this isn't one of them.Its much easier to just do it the normal way, take a class.BTW, who on earth decided that the flaming leftist Noam Chomsky is a good person to quote on the back cover of a Calculus book?"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Like many of you, I have taken Calculus in college. In fact, 3 semesters worth not including a semester of Differential Equations. I did well in these courses, however, I cannot really explain why, never really understood the concepts. Jump forward 30+ years and for some reason or another I decide to get this book based on positive reader comments.I do not believe this text deserves the accolades it has received over the years. Although, the author's initial explanations of differentials and integration is adequate, really not bad, he fails to go into the logic behind problems solving using the Calculus.I believe the perfect book, albeit long, would consist of the following:1. a brief introduction as to what a differential is and the meaning of integration. (like I noted above, this book does accomplish this.)2. Introduce the reader to some word problems. First, go step by step through the problem sequence using a math concept other than Calculus.3. Solve the same problem using Calculus with a step by step explantion.4. Go through Steps 2 - 3 for various problem types.5. Have a problem list at the end of each chapter with end of book answers with complete explantions.Hey, maybe I'll try to write this book."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Well, what do we have here? A great book by Silvanus P. Thompson. It was my first calculus book, but what's this? What is Martin Gardner's name doing there? Well, Martin Gardner is a great and clever man, but I wish the publishers would just leave original author's works alone. It reminds me of another book 'Principia' by Stephen Hawking. Stephen Hawking? No, it was written by Isaac Newton in 1687, and became the foundation of mathematical physics. And yet, Hawking's name is on the cover with a much larger font than Newton's. I am sure that Newton is rolling around in his grave, as should also Mr Thompson. The publishers are, of course, trying to generate more book sales by attaching the names of today's popular scientists to past great works. Well, Einstein's name is still God, so thank God, they haven't corrupted his works (yet). I would like to ask the publishers to stop doing this, but since it's all about money and profit, that is not going to happen.Now to mention an obvious error. This quote from Calculus Made Easy; 1st page of chapter II:\\"Again, think of a hundred dollars compared with a penny: it is only worth a 1/100 part.\\" Hmmm, I don't recall that error being there when I read it 30 years ago. Yes, Gardner has actually gone through the main text and altered it, detrimentally from it's original English from about 100 years ago. The original quaint flare is gone. A treasure has been turned into a doorstop. Maybe we should change Shakespeare's English while we're at it. There's no need on expounding on the book itself, as there are plenty of other reviewers who have already done that. I would suggest that anyone who is about to take a calculus course in college - read this book first; but the entertainment doesn't start until page 38 (Thompson's). I would much rather have an older edition than this one. My original was lost when I loaned it out to someone else. I also lost my first volume of Apostol's Calculus this way, so lesson learned."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"this book is very reader friendly, it is very clear and helpful, I really like the way the book is written and how the writer explains everything in detail."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"During my college days, I found that the classes I did well in were those I could sit with the professor in his or her office and talk about the subject and what was the best approach to learning it; their enthusiasm was often infectious. Unfortunately, my calculus professor was not that approachable and I struggled through one semester, concluding that I just wasn't going to understand the material. History (and its professors) won me over.A few years after graduating, I found Professor Thomson's book, Calculus Made Easy, and read it. It turned out to be an excellent overview of the calculus - like sitting down to chat with the prof and hearing from someone who truly loved the subject what calculus was about and what concepts were important or interesting. His chiding his colleagues for being too much like mathematicians and not enough like teachers put a human touch to a mechanistic subject. And like any good teacher, he pointed out what vantage point was best to see what true mathematicians were doing with it. This book made the calculus accessible to me.Not surprisingly, when I went back to Thomas and Finney (the textbook for the class) things fell into place and I understood much more than when I was taking the class. The rigor wasn't so overwhelming. I already understood the concepts so the rest was detail. It was like appreciating an artist's use of color or brushstrokes on a masterpiece after being drawn to art by the photographs of beautiful paintings.I wonder sometimes, if I had sat with Professor Thomson before taking Calculus I, would the history of my life have been written from a mathematical perspective."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Calculus Made Easy is truly a well-written book. It divides into over 20 chapters thorough examples and applications of calculus as well as the development of calculus itself, and everything is surprisingly contained in fewer than 300 pages! Authors of many modern-day calculus textbooks twice its size try to explain the same fundamental concepts but cannot achieve Thompson's levels of triumph.Topics in this work include: limits, maxima, minima, successive differentiation, compound interest, law of organic growth, and more. Though the subjects are frequently isolated for each chapter, Thompson has nonetheless provided insights to the degree that one could synthesize or put together these various concepts to formulate their own interesting problems and procedures.With the great Martin Gardner to revise this classic and to provide further mathematical expositions, Calculus Made Easy is highly recommended for the lover of mathematics as well as the teacher who wants to better present mathematics from a thematic standpoint."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I got this book a short time before starting Calculus in high school. It was clear and a very easy read, and gave me a big head start.This book is put down by mathemeticians because it avoids limits. Thompson does it the 'ugly way', whereas mathemeticians prefer the 'beautiful way'; put another way, mathematicians like using a chisel to carve a tunnel; Thompson uses explosives.Anyone who wants to learn calculus should use this book."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"This is one of the best technical books that I have every read. The book introduces Calculus at the right pace and in a way that makes it very interesting. My only criticism is don't read it late at night, or you will lose a lot of sleep. I have been reading it most nights for the last few weeks and I find it thoroughly addictive.It has been a long time since I studied Calculus and I didn't relish coming up to speed with it again. This book brought it back quickly but this time made it something really interesting."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I wish I had been given this book in high school. I'm currently working on a computer science degree so I bought this as a kind of tutor for stuff I may have forgotten. It's totally worth it, and it makes it easier to understand - for anyone who may be afraid of math."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"As the commercial reviews mention this is a classic text. Such notables as Feynman and Dyson both studied this book. In fact, Feynman quotes Thompson in his Lectures on Physics."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"I like math and am a B or B-plus in aptitude; I think I am this book's audience. For me, it has been excellent, but for someone who struggles with math, it might not be as good.The book keeps the new ideas of calculus short and simple (in particular by leaving out the idea of a limit). But it does expect you to be clever with the algebra you already know. The problems ask you to extend what was discussed, not merely to repeat it.As Gardner says, traditional calculus textbooks must include every possible topic, so that no instructor will need to choose another book. That means that a typical text can be several thousand pages long and cost as much as two hundred dollars. This book is a great counter to that trend; anyone who enjoys math and needs to learn some calculus without worrying about proofs should pick it up."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"The Kindle edition does not have the mathematical symbols and has bad formatting. It's basically a copy of the text from Gutenberg project and nothing else. It's impossible to read.

This book has helped me to learn so much already that I'm sure I can get an easy A in all of my math classes in High School. I've also learned so much that I should be able to take advanced math courses during my senior year, such as Calculus 3 or Calculus AP. This book was easy to understand and taught me a lot. Even if you've already had Calculus, this book can teach you more about it and help you understand the sub-subjects within Calculus that you found tough or impossible before."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"This book is fantastic! If only I had it in college. I happened across Calc Made Easy in a bookstore on a business trip. In college, I was a math major and, at first, struggled through the concept of calculus and was intimidated by the terminology. I haven't done calculus in 25 years, but I read this whole book in one afternoon covering both limits, as well as differential and integral calculus. I cannot believe how easy this author makes these concepts.Every 1st year calculus student should read this book. After grasping the concepts in Calc Made Easy, then you can concentrate on the algebraic manipulations you need to practice in order to solve the integrals and differencials in you're classroom textbooks. Reading this book you will look like a genius. But, more importantly you'll really appreciate the beauty of calculus and probably be motivated to do well in this class. Good luck and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"Since I had taken calculus courses before reading this book, I didn't learn any techniques or concepts that were new, and I can't say whether or not one who has never touched a calculus text will be able to learn the subject with speed. With this bias, I can still say that it is a book that is much easier to read than a textbook, and does not have millions of practice problems. So it would be great for a review of the subject, and *if* a beginner can follow it, then it would be great to learn from. At the very least, you will get the feel of calculus and what sort of problems it is intended to solve. Martin Gardner tries to clarify a few outdated things, and he writes about some additional problems related to calculus at the end of the book.Of course, if you are looking to learn calculus in depth, this book probably will not suffice. It can't possibly cover what a first year college textbook on calculus does. But many people understandably do not want to trudge through difficult proofs and definitions, repetitive problems, and a thousand pages of text (though these are the things that sometimes pound concepts into your head).A good read for a quick overview of calculus. Expect to solve some of the problems, if you want to learn something.

This class required Calculus I, but I hadn't seen or done any calculus since 1993. This book was an excellent refresher, and I actually understand calculus better than I did back in '93. The author really builds up a strong foundation before giving examples, and then he goes into the examples in extreme detail.

This is the book I learned calculus on due to the kindness and encouragement of my 6th grade teacher and her husband. It cuts to the simple ideas behind calculus so that you understand what is going on. This can be used by anyone who understands algebra to make the simple (!) leap to calculus. None of the complexities of most introductory books and it is actually modestly entertaining. This is not mathematically rigorous, but that is best left for 2nd year college math majors; not people struggling to figure out what calculus is and what it is useful for. I have a B.S. in Mathematics, with nearly 4 course years of college calculus, and this is still the best. I like to think that Newton and Leibnitz came to their intuitive (aha!) understanding of calculus through very similar thinking.

Well, this book thoroughly explains how to solve those problems which made others stumped when taking a first glance. See, I'm a fourteen year old boy who loves math, and shooting to become one of the classmates in BC Calculus in my senior year. So I decided to take a glance at the dreaded topic of Calculus. Many days ago, I look through other Calculus books and I start to say, \\"Argh! I can't solve these darn problems!\\" Right now, I am currently reading this book and I will tell you my deepest opinions about this awesome book!The book starts out with the basics of Calculus, in which you will learn in PreCalculus, a course many will take in their junior or senior year. This includes the true meaning of a function, the technique of solving limits, and an easier way of finding derivatives. Then it moves on to real Calculus, including finding the maxima and the minima of a function, and partial fractions. These two topics are the ones I've mastered so far, and I still have a long journey. I highly recommend this book to High Schoolers including Freshmen, so they can get an idea what Calculus is. With the help of Calculus Made Easy, written by Silvanus P. Thompson, I'm positive that I'll become a classmate in BC Calculus!"},{"Title":"Calculus Made Easy","review":"This book really cements ones understanding of Calculus. Many textbooks and university courses teach calculus in a rote manner.

How many textbooks or lecturers tell you this...this suddenly makes sense and calculus suddenly changes from difficult concepts to \\"oh I know what that now means\\". This book really shows the beauty and elegance behind calculus. This book also shows that those old guys at the beginning of the 20th century really knew and could explain their work.

The only major flaw is the book's untested assumption that Yugoslavia was poised for a smooth transition to liberal democracy, which was derailed by a nationalist \\"de-mobilization\\". This claim seems facile in lieu of a serious analysis of what exactly it was that nationalists were trying to suppress. Would Yugoslavia be merely another Poland today if the nationalists had failed, or something radically different? Writers like Gagnon tend to overlook that Yugoslavia was never a communist bureaucracy in the tradition of the Soviet puppet states, but an experiment moderating elements of socialism with a relatively open market. It is too easy to chalk it up as just another repressive communist authoritarian structure which bred a popular movement for liberalization. Nonetheless, Gagnon is to be commended for moving far beyond the typical \\"ancient ethnic hatred\\" explanation for conflict in the Balkans."},{"Title":"The Myth of Ethnic War: Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s","review":"- still misses the mark. Gagnon is essentially correct that \\"ancient ethnic/tribal hatreds\\" as explanation for this Balkan bloodshed are a copout by the lazy and the smug of Western Europe. That said, it's revealing that ethnic hatreds can be used to mobilize/demobilize people at all. Professor Gagnon's explanation really doesn't account for the whys, ultimately explaining little.In the first place comes the contradiction between mobilization vs. demobilization, the latter defined as a diversionary tactic. Yet the two seem used interchangeably when addressing ethnic rabble-rousing. Perhaps a better term might be counter-mobilization, along a different agenda than the one Gagnon prefers. But how does that differ from mobilization per se? Nationalism as a counter-mobilization theme is at least a century old, used to neutralize the appeal of socialism. As such was it used in pre-war Yugoslavia, and (ironically) in \\"reforming\\" post-Communist Yugoslavia. But if patriotism is a vessel for emptying politics of meaningful content, that also applies to regimes besides the post-Communist authoritarian type.Secondly, he posits the bureaucratic apparatus vs. the reform-minded masses, a typical anti-Communist trope that really seems out of place in analyzing Yugoslavia, where Balkan localism was already enshrined in federal decentralization and workplace (semi) self-management. The local elites were, in fact, embracing liberalizing reforms, as in Slovenia. Or even Serbia - Milosevic did get his start as a banker, after all. This raises the question of liberalization as the root cause of instability, with reform and nationalism equally embraced by both masses and leaders as assertions of post-Communist identity.Moreover, the economic instability unleashed by liberalization has historically been tied to ethnic/race wars. An economy of scarcity - downsizing, high unemployment, deficit reduction through reducing the public sector, market competition, land \\"shortage\\" - have always heightened tribal and localist chauvinism. \\"Keep the jobs for us, and let *them* go elsewhere.\\" Such competition nearly always engenders violence. The bulldozing of blacks by poor whites in the US South is one example; driving Serbs out of the Croatian marketplace, or Bosnians off land needed by these same displaced Serbs, falls into the same pattern.Thus I don't feel Gagnon has really stated his case, and much other evidence suggests completely opposite conclusions. He is to be commended for trying to go beyond the smug Western consensus, but he still so desperately wants market liberalization to be the \\"good guy\\" here. That case has yet to be proven."},{"Title":"The Myth of Ethnic War: Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s","review":"Gagnon does his work, and clearly presents a fact based alternative argument to the long held belief that ethnic hatreds caused the wars in the Balkans. In his fact based assessment, Gagnon clearly presents the history, and the truth behind the history."},{"Title":"The Myth of Ethnic War: Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s","review":"V.P. Gagnon present a refreshing analysis of the breakdown of state structures in Yugoslavia and the rise of so-called \\"ethnic wars\\". It is a much needed diversion from the heavily skewed and highly inaccurate appraisals of Balkan societies as portrayed by Robert Kaplan's Balkan Ghosts or even Mischa Glenny's the Fall of Yugoslavia, in which the jouralist-writers portray the entire region as a place awash in ancient hatreds, pre-modern superstitions, and primitive tribal communities.One strong element of Gagnon's book is his clarity. If you come away from this book not knowing that the conflicts in Croatia and Serbia were the result of elites in power purposefully \\"demobilizing\\" the greater population by constructing images of external threats and provoking violence along ethnic lines so as to shift political discourse away from issues of reformist change, you were making a concerted effort to not pay attention, as Gagnon repeats this claim on almost every fifth page. His argument is supported by social scientific polling data taken in Croatia and Serbia at the time, which indicates a continued trend towards favoring democratic development and multi-ethnic communities, even during the most violent periods of inter-ethnic warfare.However there are some apparent weaknesses of his work. The most important is that while he alludes to elites resorting to casting the \\"other\\" as aggressive and violent against one's own \\"innocent\\" community, Gagnon does not explain why the images and historical references chosen were used towards the larger audience. In other words, elites didn't simply make up stories and myths of past aggressions; they had to, at the very least, create images of the \\"other\\" that their own communities could recognize, identify with, and accept. Likening Tudjman's HDZ to the Ustasha regime of WWII could only work if 1) Serbs still collective remember that era as a time of extreme ethnic oppression against them, 2) Some members of the HDZ actually likened themselves to the Ustashas and 3) Tudjman did not openly play into extreme elements of Croat nationalism. Likewise, the Serbs could not have been cast as aggressors if extremist elements under Milosevic's control did not seek to carve out territorial elements within Croatia. In short, Gagnon's argument is valid, but dismisses historical memory too quickly - something he argues needs to be taken into account from anthopology and culturalist studies of the region.Finally, he attempts to liken his elite demobilization model in the last few pages to U.S. Cold War policy and the policies of the Bush Administration following September 11. While there are some parallels that could be found in sidelining any opposition to the Bush Administration's positions, the fundamental difference is that attempts at elite demobilization were made AFTER the 9/11 attacks, and were not a pre-planned nor pre-orchestrated plan before any hostilities as was argued in Serbia and Croatia. In addition, the opposition, did not, and has not, presented an opposition platform that voters might gravitate towards, something the Croat and Serbian opposition parties did have. Moreover, he ignores the rather lopsided positions taken by the Clinton Administration's policy of \\"Good Croats\\" and \\"Bad Serb\\" lumping that was so prominent in the foreign policies of both Warren Christopher and Madeline Albright, blaming Serbia for the same strategies of political manipulation that an exonerated Croatia similarly practised.However, these are only small problems Gagnon has, but this does not take away from the overall clarity and specifics of his work in the former Yugoslavia, and he should be commended for providing an intelligent and honest assessment of a series of events that have been so horribly misunderstood in Western medias."},{"Title":"The Myth of Ethnic War: Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s","review":"I agree with BB. This book requires the reader to agree that black is white, yes means no...there are so many occasions in which the author offers fundamental untruths in order to demonstrate his points that one ends up throwing ones hands in the air in disgust. It is telling that the book one an award from the APSA -- an organization of non-experts. Experts who read this book will be left exasperated. Gagnon has a certain cachet, though, so he probably won't get the reviews he deserves. Bad ones, that is."},{"Title":"The Myth of Ethnic War: Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s","review":"This ideas in this book are pure nonsense. Having lived over there both before, during and after the war, I can honestly say that, Prof Gagnon doesn't have a clue what he is talking about. While Croats, Serbs and Bosnians will never agree on who really is to blame for the war, what caused it, what really happened and will in general each attribute the blame on one (or both) of the other ethnical groups, they will all agree that the thesis presented in the book has nothing to do with reality. Did the politicians manipulate the masses? Sure; could the war have been avoided? Maybe, maybe not. Does it have to do anything with the ideas Prof Gagnon is presenting? Not really.Thesis presented in the book can best be described as wishful thinking; one morning the esteemed profesor woke up with *the* greatest idea that would both explain the behavior of human masses as well as provide an unified framework for explaining all the wars in the world and similar phonomena such as 9/11 terrorist attacks (getting all the fame and glory that comes with such ideas), and then set out to find the facts that support this product of pure genius. The only problem is, the idea has nothing to do with reality.The only other possible explanation for the book that I can think of is that the esteemed professor is trying to achive some other political agenda which would make it even more pathetic. That would certainly explain why he is trying to connect two completely separate and unrelated events such as war in former Yugoslavia and terrorist attacks on world trade center.All that being said, with all the great books written in the world every year, it seems like a crime against humanity to waste your money on nonsense like this book."},{"Title":"American Government: Readings and Cases (15th Edition)","review":"This book is a great book full of cases to help you learn how some of our nation's laws came into effect."},{"Title":"American Government: Readings and Cases (15th Edition)","review":"It was as described.

Then again I knew that when I bought it."},{"Title":"Cronos","review":"I don't know what is it about modern science fiction, but I haven't read a fantasy or a science fiction book in a quite while which gave me this feeling of wonder. If you don't know what I mean, try reading the &quot;Time Machine&quot; by H.G. Wells.Nevertheless, this book somehow managed to capture this long lost feeling - and not only once, but three times! Time Travel stories have always been a favorite of mine, so I was delighted to find a collection of three medium sizes time travel stories.The first story, &quot;Letters from Atlantis&quot; tells about Roy, who is sent 20,000 years back in time. However, Roy does not travel physically - only his mind makes the journey. Upon getting to the past he finds himself inside the mind of the prince of Atlantis (which hasn't been destroyed yet) - and what he sees greatly surprises him... I'm not going to reveal any of the plot, just that it's a good story - even though it's my least favorite of the three.The second story, &quot;Project Pendulum&quot;, is definitely my favorite one. It tells about twin brothers who are sent to a journey through time. However, since matter has to be preserved, whenever one is in the future, the other must be exactly in an identical &quot;amount of time&quot; in the past (So, for example, when the first brother is 50 years in the future, the other brother is exactly 50 years in the past). The way their journey works, is that they increase their interval by 10. The first brother is being sent 5 minutes forward, when the second brother is sent 5 minutes backward, and then the first brother goes 50 minutes forward, and so on: 500 minutes, 5000 minutes, 50,000 minutes, etc. This interval goes to 90 million years in the future and in the past, which is when their journey ends. As you can imagine, since the brothers explore a myriad of timelines, every jump is a story of its own. Robert Silverberg really managed to do it well - he kept every jump interesting while still not repeaeting himself.The third story, &quot;The Time Hoppers&quot;, has a definite Asimovian feel to it. If you liked Isaac Asimov's &quot;The End of Enternity&quot; you will definitely love this story. The story tells about Quellen - a lowly crime investigator living in the 25th century. Appaerntly, the 25th century turns into quite a dystopia. Too many people and too few jobs cause most people to live unemployed and in quite bad conditions. Many have found that the best way to escape this is to jump into the past. However, the government isn't all too happy about this, so assigns Quellen to investigate how this is accomplished and put a stop to this.Three different stories, all quite different, but all good - I recommend this book to all time travel lovers, and even if you're not really a fan of this sub-genre, you will still probably like these stories."},{"Title":"Jewish Meditations on the Meaning of Death","review":"Rabbi Gilbert Kaperman former President of the New York Board of Rabbis writes this about the book. \\" The book is a scholarly compendium of chapters of wisdom reflecting classical Jewish attitudes toward life, death, and bereavement and the concomitant issues of God's will , faith \\"This work is a collection of fifty- seven eulogies given by Rabbi Rozwaski in which he as the book- jacket says ' gives messages of inspiration and strength'Rowazski's firm religious belief and his belief in the afterlife are conveyed here clearly .

[no. 479])","review":"Bede (Latin Beda), also known as Saint Bede or, more commonly, the Venerable Bede (ca. 672 - May 27, 735), was a monk at the Northumbrian monastery of Saint Peter at Wearmouth (today part of Sunderland), and of its companion monastery, Saint Paul's, in modern Jarrow. He is well known as an author and scholar, whose best-known work, Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People) gained him the title \\"The father of English History\\". Bede wrote on many other topics, from music and metrics to Scripture commentaries.His works show that he had at his command all the learning of his time. It was thought that the library at Wearmouth-Jarrow was between 300-500 books, making it one of the largest in England. It is clear that Biscop made strenuous efforts to collect books on his extensive travels. Bede was proficient in patristic literature, and quotes Pliny the Younger, Virgil, Lucretius, Ovid, Horace, and other classical writers, but with some disapproval. He knew some Greek but no Hebrew. His Latin is generally clear and without affectation, and he was a skillful story-teller. However, his style can be considerably more obscure in his Biblical commentaries.Bede practiced the allegorical method of interpretation, and was by modern standards credulous concerning the miraculous; but in most things his good sense is conspicuous, and his kindly and broad sympathies, his love of truth and fairness, his unfeigned piety, and his devotion to the service of others combine to make him an exceedingly attractive characterBede's writings are classed as scientific, historical, and theological. The scientific include treatises on grammar (written for his pupils), a work on natural phenomena (De rerum natura), and two on chronology (De temporibus and De temporum ratione). Bede made a new calculation of the age of the earth and began the practice of dividing the Christian era into BC and AD. Interestingly, Bede wrote that the Earth was round \\"like a playground ball\\", contrasting that with being \\"round like a shield\\".This book is the most important and best known of his works and is also known by its Latin title as the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, giving in five books (about 400 pages) the history of England, ecclesiastical and political, from the time of Caesar to the date of its completion (731). The first twenty-one chapters, treating of the period before the mission of Augustine of Canterbury, are compiled from earlier writers such as Orosius, Gildas, Prosper of Aquitaine, the letters of Pope Gregory I, and others, with the insertion of legends and traditions.After 596, documentary sources, which Bede took pains to obtain, are used, as well as oral testimony, which he employed with critical consideration of its value. He cited his references and was very concerned about the sources of all his sources, which created an important historical chain. He is credited with inventing footnoting. (Due to his innovations like footnoting he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop Wilfred, although the actual accusation was for miscalculating the age of the world, his chronology being contrary to the calculation of the time. The controversy is linked to footnoting because Bede cited another source in a note, rather than opining himself; others misunderstood the significance of citing another source).So brush up on your Old English and don't be deterred by some of the spotty pages - this is a very important work!"},{"Title":"Harry's Mad","review":"The book I am going to talk about is called Harry's Mad.

This book takes place in Paris, France. There are four main characters. The characters are Mom, Dad, Madison, the African Gray Parrot.

One day, when no one was home, a burglar breaks in and steals Madison. While Madison is at the robber's house alone, he calls the police. The policeman could not believe what madison told him because Madison's stoy was unbelievable. Madison had even told the police man that he was 9 inches tall.

Both his parents thought sometimes that. Harry is very mad.After a few weeks, Harry revealed his secret to his parents. From then on, it seemed to the whole family that they had never been a time without Madison even the cat and the dog thought so too. Madison is also a walking dictionary because he helps Mr. Holdworth to think about the puzzle sheet and amazingly, he eats together with the family-using spoon. He knows how to cook by giving Harry's mother some recipes, teaches Harry in his English homework, plays chess and even monopoly with the family.One day, while Mrs. Holdswoth went shopping, Harry in school and his father is in work, a burglar broke into the house and took Madison away.
