The first half of this book was extremely bland. Character development seemed to be sacrificed for unnecessary details about recipes and Goldy's constant catering concerns. I knew more about how the food was packed and transported to the catering sites then about the murdered person and those who were possible suspects. Now, personally, I love to cook, and the recipes are a great idea, but I really was disappointed in the lackluster story development and dialogue between characters. There were some occasional good moments and plot twists, but not enough to give this mystery reader a reason to continue reading books in this series.Who have I liked in this particular genre?

This is the first book I have read of this series. However, this book is the fifth in a series and the main character went on and on about her ex husband.

I thought the premise of this book was interesting: catering a low fat luncheon for a cosmetic company. However, the book was downbeat mixed with corny and I didn't care about any of the characters. I also didn't like that the author would negatively stereotype people if they were physically unattractive.

All while preparing delicious low fat recipes. Don't read on an empty stomache."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"Really rate this 3.5 stars - This was a typical Goldy book, light, fluffy and insubstantial, the kind of book you read for escapism, not reality. I like Goldy, as unlikely as her adventures are, and I simply can't believe how helpful and on-the-spot teenage Julian is for her catering business despite the death of his girlfriend - but hey, it's fiction. And as such, it's fun.However, it is certainly not factual. Take it from a toxicologist. The attempted poisoning at the end was so full of dangerous nonsense I just have to speak up. First of all, coffee is NOT an antidote to the classic hemlock (conium maculatum) of the ancient Greeks. Not even close - there IS NO SPECIFIC ANTIDOTE. And COFFEE IS NOT AN ANTIDOTE TO ANYTHING ELSE, including alcohol. At best coffee might ease some of the sedative symptoms of classic hemlock, but not by much. Also the paralysis described was all wrong, since it would hit the respiratory muscles at the same time as other muscles - if the victim was poisoned enough that he / she couldn't run, he/she certainly couldn't breathe either. But really, this is a moot point - classic hemlock poison is both stinky and INVALIDATED BY COOKING. If is was baked in the muffins, they'd be both nasty-tasting and nontoxic.There is a possibility that the author is referring to water hemlock (cicuta), a completely different plant from the stuff that killed Socrates. However, water hemlock is EXTREMELY toxic, would cause major seizures (which the victim DIDN'T have) and may kill the victim within minutes. THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE FOR WATER HEMLOCK - only treatment if it is caught in time (not often the case). Water hemlock toxin can also go through the skin, so any poisoners handling it would likely show symptoms themselves before being able to bake the stuff in muffins.So, as much as I like the Goldy books, once again I find myself pleading that the author at least TRY to get her facts right. This lack of research really bothers me, and mars what is otherwise a highly entertaining series."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"Am I the only food professional who didn't know about these delicious mysteries? In Killer Pancake Mott Davidson's indomitable sleuth, Goldy the Caterer, takes on the cosmetic industry, the lunatic fringe of animal rights activism, and (once again) her menacing ex-husband. And she still has time to operate her demanding business on a daily basis! Actually, that's what I like best about Mott Davidson's mysteries. Goldy has to make time for business; she needs the money. This sleuth is always real. Her business, her family, her love life, and her friendships have ups and downs and ins and outs that seem awfully familiar. Specifically I enjoy the details of her catering business and have learned or been reminded of tons of information about food preparation, storage, and presentation. These books are a veritable archive of food lore. And the recipes--some of which I've tried--are great! I especially enjoyed the recipes from Killer Pancake because they were developed for low fat crowd. Try the Vanilla-Frosted Fudge Cookies. They're yummy. My biggest worry is that Goldy will run out of murders. I mean, Kay Scarpetta has D.C and V.I. Warshawski has Chicago--no end to violent crime there. But shouldn't little Aspen Meadows dry up pretty soon? I guess there's always Denver."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"Diane Mott Davidson is an old standby for me. Whenever I'm in a bookstore, I can look for her titles on the shelf and all is right with the universe. This is a series of mysteries with the same character, Goldy the caterer. Though she isn't a detective, her job involves her in a lot of situations other 9-to-5ers might not run into, and that's the hook of the book as it were.Killer Pancake is light fluffy fun (the allusion to pancakes here is intended). And there are recipes, so who can fault that? I recommend any of her books. The subplot of her relationship with \\"the jerk\\" may get a little old for you if you read enough of her stuff, but let it ride. Every great lady has to have a few flaws. Killer Pancake is just one more in a fun little series. Bon appetit."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"Enjoyable, but not my favorite book in this series. I have to laugh at some of the crazy situations Goldy finds herself in. Her husband, Tom, was not a central part of this storyline and I wished there was more interaction between them.

This was a fun mystery, and I look forward to trying out some of these! Main Corpse and Prime Cut are still my two favorite books by this author!"},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"This book really missed the mark for me. The overall storyline seemed more disjointed then her past efforts and previously prominent characters barely made and appearance.Goldy and her Goldilocks' catering company are hired to cater the luncheon for Mignon Cosmetics Company. Not a problem, until she finds out that her usual fare will not do, everything must be low cal and that is not Goldy's specialty. A dessert without butter and cream is not worth eating.Nevertheless, a job is a job and she must come up with something, little does she know that finding the right recipes will be the least of her problems. Mignon has been accused of animal testing and as she is trying to delivery the food for the banquet she is confronted by an angry mob and as Goldy is trying to battle her way into the venue there is a squeal of tires and one of Mignon's leading sales women is murdered in the parking lot.Turns out that there is quite a bit of corruption when it comes to beauty and once again, Goldy throws herself into the business of finding a murderer.As I said, this book was a bit of a let down for me, would I continue the series, I really do not know. However, I do tend to give authors one more chance that tends to lead to two or three more chances when I have started out enjoying the beginning of a series."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"I liked the story but could not concentrate because of the constant grammatical errors! Almost every time the word \\"close\\" or \\"closed\\" was supposed to have been used it appeared as \\"dose\\" or \\"dosed.\\" There was a lack of punctuation so sentences ran on and recipes included misspelled words such as \\"portobfxo\\" instead of \\"portobello\\". Most glaring was Goldy's best friend being named \\"Maria\\" rather than \\"Marla\\" as she is called in the other books in the series. I found these errors very irritating and was surprised that no other reader commented on them. My other kindle books did not have nearly this amount of errors. Clearly there is a need for better proofreading in the conversion process!"},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"Like other reviewers, I found this offering was just so-so. It may be that I'm weary of Goldy always finding dead bodies, always having mini-breakdowns, and Goldy's loved ones always being under suspicion. It seems churlish of me to complain about very well-described human emotions to traumatic death, but after four or five stories it's just gotten a bit tedious for me. Let Goldy solve a murder that's not directly related to her little family for a change."},{"Title":"Killer Pancake (culinary whodunit)","review":"The so-called \\"low-fat\\" recipes in the book appear delightful especially the Hoisin Turkey with Roasted Pine Nuts in Lettuce Cups, and Turkey Curry with Raisin Rice. Hopefully they result in delectable dishes when I finally make time to prepare them. An index of the recipes is included at the end of the book which is great. As for the mystery itself, it is an account of a caterer trying her best to stay sane doing overrated daily chores while assisting the police (whether they welcome it or not) to solve a murder case that involves the well-being of her assistant while balancing a so-called fear of an ex-husband. If there are civilians who are as perceptive as Goldy, the caterer, then maybe a lot of real life murders could be solved more quickly. At least, that's what the writing seems to concentrate on - a woman's intuition. Too much of it makes the story unbelievable even as a fiction. There are a few actions including a shooting spree but the way the tale is told, the tumults cannot be grasped - everything is on the surface, more in the form of a news article than a stirring recounting. It is a rapid read of a short mystery that comprises mentions of lots of good food, drinks, and preparations with a mediocre technique of story telling."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The Great Depression in the 1930s continues to be regarded as the worst trauma of twentieth century America, and its scars are still felt to this day. If not for anything else, John Steinbeck will probably be regarded as the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm. OF MICE AND MEN is arguably one of the best novels about the hardships of the poor during this time.Lennie and George, a pair of drifters, represent brain and braun, respectively. Caught in the whirlpool of economic collapse, the two go from job to job, taking work whenever and wherever they can find it. Along the way, and especially at the farm that is at the center of the book's action, the pair encounter violence, racism, ignorance, selfishness, and a host of other tragic qualities among the poor that are compelled to fight tooth and nail for survival. Steinbeck certainly is not blaming the poor; rather, he is saying that this is what men will resort to when denied good, decent work. And, ultimately, OF MICE AND MEN has given us a glimpse into this tragic time. A highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Deceptively short and simply written, John Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; actually offers any reader quite a lot to think about. The relationship between the two main characters highlights a number of issues relating to the themes of mental illness and friendship. The story takes place in Depression-era California. Lennie is a very large, strong man, but not too bright. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body, but because he fails to comprehend his own strength, he frequently does harm to others without meaning to. He loves to pet soft things, like mice and rabbits and puppies, and then becomes distraught when they die, not understanding that he has been too rough with them. Lennie's companion is the brains of the pair, a small man by the name of George. He fills the role of both caretaker and friend to Lennie, and does his best to keep him out of trouble, though he doesn't always succeed.The two men are traveling laborers, moving around as the availability of work dictates. To keep Lennie motivated and obedient, George pacifies him with stories of a future bright with luxury and free from worry. They'll buy a small farm, he tells his avid companion, and live off the fat of the land. They'll have their own crops and their own livestock, and go to shows whenever they feel like it. And if Lennie stays out of trouble, he can even have some rabbits of his own to take care of. Captivated by this vision, Lennie does his honest best to obey George and avoid doing anything that might jeopardize their dream. But his best just isn't good enough, and just when their plans look like they might actually be falling into place, Lennie makes the biggest bungle of all, leaving George with an extremely hard decision to make.One of the social problems Steinbeck seems to be commenting on here is the place of the mentally ill or impaired in society. What was their place at this point in time? Did they even have a place? This story makes it clear that there really weren't many avenues open to the mentally ill at the time. They could be institutionalized, but such places had little merit during the 1930s, when mental illness was not yet really understood. Patients were treated little, if at all, better than criminals. The other option would be for such people to try to get along in the outside world of &quot;normal&quot; people, as Lennie does. When Lennie's Aunt Clara dies, he is left with no family and so falls in with George, who becomes his new guardian. But the outside world is no more understanding of Lennie's handicaps than the doctors of the time, and provides countless pitfalls of its own.The other major theme of the story is friendship. What is true friendship? To what extent does one have responsibility to a friend, and what does this responsibility entail? This is something George must struggle with every day. He feels obligated to care for Lennie and help keep him out of trouble, though he clearly realizes that his own life would be far simpler if he were on his own. In the end, when Lennie commits the ultimate, irredeemable blunder, George must sort through this inner conflict to decide what is best for both of them. Should he continue to protect his companion, or should he save his own skin? And if he chooses to put Lennie's best interests first, what course of action would be the most just? The conclusion he arrives at is both intricately complex and, in another light, quite obviously simple at the same time.Aside from these two overriding themes, Steinbeck also gives us glimpses into other issues of the time, among them racism and labor conditions. On the farm where the bulk of the story takes place, one of the characters is a black stable hand. Nicknamed &quot;Crooks&quot; because of his crooked back, this man is estranged from the rest of the workers (all white). The only one who fails to comprehend why Crooks should be treated any differently than anyone else is Lennie, whose simple mind doesn't grasp the idea of racism. We also see what life was like for Depression-era vagrants, moving from place to place in search of work. The living conditions were not ideal (though those in this story are far from the worst imaginable), the food provided often lacked proper nourishment, and employers could treat their hired help in just about any way they pleased. After all, the laborers were lucky to find any paying work at all. Even if they didn't like the conditions, where else could they go?I'd definitely recommend this book to any reader. Though times have changed somewhat, the issues Steinbeck comments on are still very relevant today. The ideas presented in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; are many and deep, and much time can (and should) be spent contemplating them, but the book remains very accessible. It is a very short story, and can easily be read in one day. The style of writing is simple and direct, while retaining detail and a startling depth of feeling. However, it is by no means a feel-good story, so don't read this one at a time when you're already down in the dumps. While the ending has a very nice sense of resolution, and one is left feeling that George made the best decision he could under the circumstances (or, at least, this is the feeling I was left with), it is still rather depressing."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is truly a masterpiece. John Steinbeck does it again. This is a story about a mentally retarded man who travels around with his friend. They go to a ranch and a lot of things go amiss. I don't want to give it away. The way Steinbeck wrote this book was very powerful and meaningful. There is definitely a strong message buried into the pages of this tragic novelization. If you're looking for a well-written, to the point book, you should buy Of Mice and Men."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In &quot;Of mice and men&quot; there are two main characters .George , the small and smart one.

He has the unique ability to say a LOT with a small amount of words in one paragraph, and in the very next paragragh say a little with a LOT of words. This novel should be read by anyone wanting to master the craft of writing. Steinbeck delivers every time. I can't think of any bad writing he has done...Can you?God Bless!www.therunninggirl.com"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is the story of two men - George and Lennie. George is small and smart, and George is big and mentally challenged. George and Lennie are about to start working on a new farm; they had to leave a previous farm because Lennie got in \\"some trouble\\". Lennie has a preoccupation with things soft and pretty, which lands him in pretty big trouble.This book didn't immediately draw me in from the beginning. I thought the beginning was rather monotonous, but the pace quickly picks up when George and Lennie arrive on the farm. I found that this book is a beautiful portrayal of human compassion. George says that his life would be much better without Lennie, and perhaps it would be, but still you can tell that he cares very much for the gentle giant.George isn't the only example of \\"human compassion\\". You have Carlson who's probably on the extreme uncaring end. He's one of those people who feels that a life isn't valuable anymore once you're of no use. There's also Slim who's very kindhearted. He believes that you can tell if a person is good or not just from their manner of acting. Then, there's Crooks-the cynical stable hand-who likes to believe in the worse of men rather than the best.Also, Steinbeck did a very good job getting his point across using mostly dialogue. There is precious little description in this book, but that's okay because most of the emotion of the story is conveyed through dialogue."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"there is a scene in this book that has affected the way I look at life ever since reading it. the lesson steinbeck would like readers to understand is displayed in the early scene where a worker's dog must be put to death. the man loves his dog and faithful companion like no one else on this earth, and when the dog is so old he is suffering all the time, the man is too weak to carry out the painful deed of killing his best friend to ease his suffering. the man has someone else take the dog out to a field to shoot him, and he feels guilty because his best friend had to look into a stranger's eyes while meeting his death. he failed to uphold his responsibility to the dog- who was unfailingly faithful to him.this lesson is echoed in the final climactic scene in the novel between two men: one who must prevent the suffering of his completely faithful and innocent companion. this man, though, faces his responsibilities with strength, and steinbeck would like people to understand this concept of morality. i do - the lesson was not lost on me, and i appreciate and adhere to this lesson everyday... if taken with thoughtfulness, this is a highly recommended American classic."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Lennie Small is too strong for his own good. He is not a very intelligent person (everyone says he's stupid), and understands very little of what goes on around him. If it weren't for his friend George, who travels with him, Lennie would have a very difficult time functioning in society. In fact, he has that problem already. His strength is a danger to him, because sometimes he harms things without understanding what he's doing. For example, he's always crushing mice to death, and he even does this with a puppy. Lennie is innocent and would never intentionally harm anyone, but his stupidity and his strength are a very potentially harmful combination.This book raises an interesting question: what should be done with people who are dangerous through no fault of their own? Should people like Lennie, who unintentionally harm other people, be held responsible for what they do? Lennie is a very difficult case, because he does not deserve to be punished for what he inadvertently does, but he also cannot be left free to cause harm to other people. This is the central conflict of the novel.Set in depression-era America, this novel by John Steinbeck is well-written and thought-provoking. The dialogue is fabulous, as is the narrative. This book is considered to be a classic of 20th-century American literature, and in fact it is a very good read. I would not give it the rank of classic, perhaps, but it is nevertheless a great (and highly recommended) novel."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of mice and man by John Steinbeck was published in 1939.

Friendship are not easy to maintain in a good status."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"...P>The best laid plans of mice and men oft go awry and many times it is due to the uncontrollable longing that nearly everyone has to belong somewhere, to have something we can call our own. We can say too that our failures may be due to a state of mind or the wish to fill an endlessly yawning hole in the psyche. Inner loneliness often drives us in our several directions towards fulfillment. For drifters like George and Candy, it's a little piece of land that beckons; for Lennie, it's something soft and close---a dead mouse, a puppy, a piece of velvet. For Curley's wife, that ultimate destination was love, attention, and recognition; for Crooks, respect and justice. In OF MICE AND MEN, nobody gets what they want. The novel, like life, is an unmitigated tragedy and we are our own worst enemies.This is an American classic in the real sense of the word. Though Bob Dylan's verses may not be totally precise in summing up the story, they certainly sum up my mood after putting down OF MICE AND MEN. \\"Nobody tried to say a word, when they carried him out in jest.

At the next ranch they begin to work and meet many interesting characters, including the flirtatious wife of one of the farmers.

I never got around to reading it until the next year however, which i guess was better since, i like reading on my own accord, rather than for school. I'm a stubborn person like that. Its a short read, about 120 pages, i think. I thought since i had to buy the book, i might as well read it, i can get it in one sitting, and be done with it. With titles like \\"east of eden\\" and \\"grapes of wrath\\", i really didn't think i'd like it, i mean \\"east of eden\\" is in oprahs book club, and everything about oprah's show disgusts me. Before you judge me, on that statement on oprah, keep in mind i'm a 16 year old, a kid. But back to the point, i read the story.What really scared me about the book (before i read it) was that it is required reading for some american literature classes. And from my experiences, english classes, have done nothing but to scare people away from books, that all good books, are just complex masses of hard-to-get symbols, metaphors, imagery, blah blah blah.So thats what i went into the book expecting, to be confused the whole way through because of my inadequate reading skills. But since it was so short, i thought i'd survive at least. The first page and the half of the second page, was describing the landscape, which started to scare me. But once the characters were introduced, it was loads easier to get through. What caught me was that the dog character from looney tunes, the one that always gets fooled by the squirrel hes supposed to chase, sounded alot like lennie \\"which way did he go, george? which way did he go?\\", you should know what i mean.What i really liked about the book was how human it was, especially in a negative sense. Being somewhat of an misanthrope (not REALLY, but i'm not exactly the most optimistic person ever), i enjoyed steinbeck's crack on human nature. Lennie, being too small-minded to use his own judgement, of whats right or wrong, what'll help or harm, whats too much or too little, what to be scared of, what to do, relies on other people's wills, in a mother-son, father-son kind of way. But since, it is an grown man (a STRONG man), the problems of his dependence on others are much more serious (such as murder).Just read it, its only about 8 dollars, if you don't like it, then its not that much of a loss, but if you give it a chance, on your time, rather than because of a school assignment, you'll probably like it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Life was hard and times were no joke in the economically blighted cities and wind-blasted rural areas that marked a Depression era America. Whatever joy most Americans grasped for seemed to be just beyond their collective reaches. In OF MICE AND MEN John Steinbeck portrays a people who are just as blighted as the land on which they trod. Lennie Small and George Milton are two migrants who are forced to wander the midwest in search of the American Dream, which, to them, meant a place of their own. Each recognizes that this dream will, in all likelihood, remain just that, an evanescent will-o-the-wisp that leaves them with little else but to talk about it. Many times in the novel, the huge but retarded Lennie asks George, a smallish but bright thinker, to rhapsodize about their future. To George, their American Dream is a place where no one can throw them out. To Lennie, it is a place where he can raise rabbits. And it is not only Lennie and George who reach out for the unobtainable. It is arguable that nearly everyone else has their own competing dreams, with the same chance of success as Lennie and George have--none at all. The ranch hands where Lennie and George find roustabout jobs are the hopeless in search of the unobtainable. Candy is a one-armed elderly worker who seeks security for his old age. Crooks is a proud black worker who searches for racial equality in an age that did not know the term. Curley is a nastily pugnacious man who spends most of the scenes in which he appears in a hopeless and helpless Holy Grail search for his wife who spends an equal amount of time staying out of his way. And then there is Curley's wife, who is so bereft of identity that Steinbeck chooses not even to give her a name. She wanders the book like a meandering Eve, seeking only to disrupt the ordered lives of the men around her. In her search for meaning to her life, she collides with a corresponding search by Lennie for meaning in his. When she places Lennie's unthinking paws on her hair and dress, Lennie panics and unthinkingly stifles her, setting off a chain of events that forces George to play with Lennie's dream of a rabbit warren as a tearfully tragic prelude to ending that dream. In OF MICE AND MEN, Steinbeck catches not only the gritty edginess of political and emotional instability that then was ripping apart the social fabric of a pre-World War II America, he was also telling a timeless tale that suggests that for dreams to transform to reality, those dreamers had better leave the world of dreams long enough to weigh the balance of cost versus benefit. For Lennie, for Curley's wife, the price was way too high."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a beautifully crafted short novel concerning the relationship between two migrant workers from the 1930s. The first character, Lennie, has quite severe learning difficulties and relies heavily on his friend George. Lennie is very strong and this in itself gets him into all sorts of problems. George has to come to Lennie's aid on a regular basis as a result of him getting into trouble through misinterpretations of his actions and a naviety of his own strength.Genuinely moving, the reader cannot fail to build up a great empathy with the lead characters; less so with the other figures that appear in the book- despite each one having their own set of problems.Steinbeck does a tremendous job of conveying his story to the reader, and it would be a person with a heart made of stone that would not be moved by the story's conclusion.An excellent read for older children and adults of all ages. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Aside from its stature as a classic of American literature and a masterwork of one of the 20th century's most significant writers, there is a reason why OF MICE AND MEN is an ubiquitous part of high school literature courses. This novella follows the structure of Fiction Writing 101 perfectly: Characters are introduced in broad strokes and allowed to fill in their personalities on their own. There is a completeness of scene, so much so that the story reads almost more like a play, with no action in any of the chapters taking place outside of the setting where the chapter began. (In one instance, the characters run off set, but the narrator leaves the reader's \\"camera\\" on an unpopulated stage while he describes voices and shouting outside.) Most of all, the story follows the perfect three-act structure so neatly that, in a 100-page copy, the characters are all introduced by about page 33, and the turning point happens almost precisely on page sixty-seven.But if the mechanics of Steinbeck's storytelling make this perfect for eighth grade teachers looking to fill out a lesson plan, it's his story that has put it high on the list of Books Everyone Should Read. All of the characters are given a fair chance to be sympathetic. (Only one, the violent, jealous, bullying Curley fails to accomplish that, but he fails on his own terms, not because the author needs a cardboard heavy.) The most memorable, however, is Lennie, the hulking, gentle-natured behemoth with the mind of a child, a victim swept along towards his tragic end by ironic twists of fate he could never possibly hope to understand.With characters this richly layered and one of the easiest storytelling styles Steinbeck would ever have, particularly in comparison to such later, more impressionistic masterpieces as THE GRAPES OF WRATH and EAST OF EDEN, it's not hard to see why OF MICE AND MEN is one of the rare examples of a novel written very much about its time that has nonetheless proven to be timeless."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The themes of man's inhumanity to man, the nature of friendship, and labor vs management all come shining through in this touching classic. A few reviewers worried that the book may be a little tough for children under fourteen to handle; ironically, this is a true testament to this book's enduring impact on American culture. It is too late to worry about really young children \\"reading\\" this story, because if they grew up in America watching the Saturday morning cartoons, they have already watched the movie version of OF MICE AND MEN several hundred times. That's right. Warner Brothers cartoons frequently paired a big, strong, dumb character with a little pipsqueek who comically controls him, slaps him around, or takes care of him. The little guy is \\"the Boss.\\" They got that routine straight from Steinbeck's novel. If you want examples, the most recent one is probably Pinkie and the Brain, but they have done it for years with cats, dogs, wolves, and zoot-suited gangsters. The big ox-like one is almost always stumbling into and accidentally smacking the [heck] out of the little boss in his eagerness to pursue the prey, often Bugs Bunny. \\"Which way did he go? Which way did he go?

After reading this book I felt a greater appreciation for the people who lived during this time. The book was very inspirational tome. I loved how the book made you connect with the two characters, George and Lennie, and thier hopes for the future. This book was short in text but huhe in emotions and feelings of all the charchters. Although some times I will admit that the book exaggerated the sensitivity of the character Lennie the book was still good in the fact the plot made sense with a cast of realistic characters. The ending of the book is a real life ending that wasn't far fetched. They made the events believable which causedmany emotions to stir inside you anger, fear, suspense, sorrow, and happines just to name a few. You really connect with the book. That's why I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck must have been a genius. For this book is too true to just simply read and then forget about. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; focuses on many individuals, the main characters being George and Lennie. This book has many meanings that stick out like a sore thumb. The main theme being loneliness. This book will leave you numb inside.

Read it yourself and you will see what I mean."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This was a great book. I enjoyed it from the front cover to the back. Steinbeck's desriptions made you pity the characters you were suppossed to, and hate the characters you were supposed to hate. It's not difficult to read, and the ending was a real shocker. Another thing I like are the hints that Steinbeck drops to foreshadow the futures. There are two events which mirror each other, except for the fact that they are between completely different characters. I won't say what it is, because it will give stuff away.

There are two main characters in this book named Lennie and George. These two men are best friends who travel together wherever they go. The story starts off when Lennie and George have to run away from their job in a town called Weed. They travel to a new job on a ranch where many things happen. At first the story doesn't seem too interesting, but you have to read to the end for the very best part. And trust me, it's worth it.

The other one, George, is short and kind of smart compared to Lennie. Unlike most of the other ranch hands the two are traveling together from ranch to ranch, and even more than others are because Lennie is always getting into trouble.

The story is a simple one, with a few others branching off of it. The main plot consists of a smart, young, productive man taking care of a friend who is extremely strong, large, and partially slow. It is a tear-jerking story that I feel everyone should read. If you end up liking this, the movie with Gary Sinise is just as good, if not better! A must read!I conclude with only one negative comment. If you are sensitive about profanity in books, I suggest you not read this. It is packed to the brim... Compared to the book, though, the movie is profanely mild, in fact. A surprising move for Hollywood."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This short book is a very quick read, yet is as profound as one would expect.

It arrived quickly and in the condition I was expecting.

It was so moving that some of the girls in the class were crying at the end.George and Lennie are two workers that move from job to job. George is small and clearly fairly intelligent while Lennie is huge, powerful and has the mind of a child. After some difficulty at a previous job, they arrive at a farm and begin working. They have been together a long time, after Lennie's last surviving relative died and George made a promise he would look after Lennie. However, it is clear that George is growing tired of the responsibility; he wants to be able to act like other men rather than as a perpetual chaperone.There is a crew of workers at the farm as well as the boss's son and his wife Candy. Candy is unhappy with her lot and flirts with every man around, including Lennie. There are other problems that arise and finally Lennie gets into serious trouble. George then \\"solves\\" the problem in the only way he knows how.This is a sad story and you feel a great deal for George and Lennie. Lennie is all he can ever be and George has done all he can for him. There really is no place for Lennie in the world and all available paths lead to his violent death. Modern readers also have to understand that the story was written in 1937, when the terminology used to describe people was quite different. Therefore, it is necessary for you to be somewhat insensitive in the politically correct sense when you read it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read the book in 7th grade, but didn't know what a [...] house was. I read it again, just because I remembered how fun it was to read the beautiful way Steinbeck captures street talk. What I appreciate about the book as an adult is that Lenie, the mentally retarded character, was not able to rationalize at the begining of the book and Steinbeck made no indication that he could. At the end of the book, suddenly, Lenie's able to rationalize the consequences of his actions and fears rejection because he's done something bad.

In a very well written way, Of Mice and Men shows how valuable friendship is. I was skeptical of it when I was first going to read it in 9th grade. As I read though, I found that it was actually a very good book and quite entertaining. It was written like a movie, detailed, yet very short for a novel.

He uses the two protagonists George and Lennie to convey the poor fate of many Americans of those days. George and Lennie experience this beeing hands on a farm, which is mainly leaded by the cruel son of the boss, Curley.Hope of their dream to own a farm is the only thing that gives their rough life sense. But the hope dies at the point when George kills Lennie, consequently it seems that having a dream is unnecessary if the sourrounding circumstances are not accordingly. I do not agree with the message Steinbeck pointed out.In each beginning of a chapter the place of action is described in detail followed by a dialogue. This structure reminds me of a play, at first the stage direstions and then the play. I think it becomes boring after a time, especially because there happens too less action at different locations. Using dialogues is a clever way to encourage the reader's imagination.Besides I dislike steinbecks's view of women, which he imlpies by the only feminine character, Curley's wife. He portays a picture of a trouble making, cruel and nameless object. But probably I'm of this opinion because I'm a girl.Over all it is to say that the novel cannot be put in one category. Steinbeck has his own style to impress his intention. His message is not obvious but if you read between the lines and think about it, you will find it out and then you can decide whether you agree. So this is the message i found out: Is hope right even if the situation seems to be hopeless and is our fate already predicted? Questions that need to be thought over. Finally 'Of Mice and Men'is a book it is necessary to think about."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a truly wonderful story about the companionship between two friends. Lennie and George were friends since they were both very young and shortly into the story the reader can feel this dependant state that Lennie is in since he obviously has some form of mental retardation. George is the one that has been keeping Lennie in line his entire life. However as the book continues the reader begins to realize that George really does care for Lennie and it he takes care of him out of love. The pair get a job working on a farm with other tenants. The obvious leader of the group is Slim, who starts a friendship with George at the very start. The reader is then introduced to Curley, who's father owns the farm, one immediately recognizes that Curley and his flirtatious wife are trouble. George and Lennie have plans to save enough money to buy a farm and live off the land. Another worker on the farm overhears them talking and asks if he can trade his life savings for a chance to stay with them on the farm. This shows how everyone else is envious of their rare friendship. The lives of the workers then spiral out of control when Lennie accidentally kills Curleys wife. Lennie immediately runs away but Curley knows who has killed her and they chase after him. George goes to the spot they picked as a place they are to go if they get separated. George finds Lennie crying and George comforts him while he slowly raises a pistol to the back of Lennies head and shoots him out of mercy."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The classic Steinbeck novel Of Mice and Men takes place during the Great Depression in the mid 1930's. The two main characters are Lenny and George who are migrant workers heading to a new job on a ranch area in rural Soledad, California. The first main character, Lennie, has a mind of a little child, but a body and strength of a giant. He always relies on George as a friend and a traveling companion. Lennie always gets in trouble because he does not know his own strength. The second main character, George, is Lennie's opposite in every way. George has a keen mind and is small and lean. These two companions help each other throughout the story, but it is up to George to decide the future of Lennie.The main focus of this book is based on Lennie and George's relationship and how they protect each other from the world. Lennie gets in trouble by petting the boss' son's wife. After Lennie's hand gets caught in her hair, she starts panicking. Lennie gets scared of all the noise she is making, so he covers her mouth and accidentally breaks her neck. Lennie hides because the other migrant workers found out and going to lynch him. George knew where Lennie was hiding so he took the boss' gun and shot Lennie in the head out of mercy, because Lennie would have otherwise died in a painful way by hanging.In my opinion, this novel written by John Steinbeck is a wonderful and well-written book that leads the reader on a journey through the exploration of human existence and compassion. I really felt I was living through the characters lives and habits. This book brought me into a world during the Great Depression. I felt that I was a migrant farmer watching this every time I was reading this book. I really enjoyed this book and really felt what it was like back then.

Basically, this is one of the most moving, inspiring, and depressing books I've ever read - and also one of the best. The characters, the dialogue, and the feel of the time and place are so real to me that I almost consider it a work of non-fiction; I just can't seem to read it without feeling sad for these poverty-stricken, down-and-out people trying to make their way through an unneccessarily cruel landscape without anyone who really cares about them. It can be read in a day and the story is fairly straight forward, but I wouldn't call it an easy read - it's just too emotional to fit that description. Great book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book is a very brief but moving tale that will leave you thinking. Stienbeck's mastery here is in character development. He creates a cornicopia of characters in a genius way, quick and to the point. Somehow, in such a short amount of time, he creates characters you feel you've known your whole life.The scenery is well built as well, and the story itself is interesting and timeless. It could be set in 2006 just as easily, and still be relevant. It's a very relaxing read, and flows smoothly.You wont want to put this book down, and you'll only be busy about an hour reading it. This book is just as entertaining as I'm sure it was in 1937, and can be called a classic."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I wish I was assigned to read this book in high school.This book is full of emotion and vivid details...all under 150 pages. A very quick read but has a lasting impact on the reader.

George takes care of Lennie because Lennie is mentally retarded. Lennie gets in trouble unintentionally wherever they go. George and Lennie want to have a big house where they can live so they go to work on a farm or something like that to raise money to get their house with rabbits because Lennie loves to touch soft stuff, and rabbits are soft.When they barely get there, no trouble happens but as soon as the wife of the bosses son meets them trouble happens. In the middle of the story,an event happens that seems normal but it relates to the end. In the end there is a sad ending. I loved this book i think it is one of my favorites of all time!!!

It is relatively short in length and easy to comprehend. Usually when a book is referred to as \\"classic literature,\\" I am disappointed in it but this one definitely deserves to be the classic it is.

I say read not reread, because most of them I've never read. (My high school curriculum was lacking when it came to reading quality literature and children's books, military books, and teaching books make up practically all my reading.) This book was so good and so short there is no reason why anyone out there hasn't read it yet. I loved it so much that I am heading out to borrow some more of books written by Steinbeck. Go get it!

But that's not what the story is really about. The story is really about making the right choices even when the outcome isn't always as good for you!!!

In a line of work that does not often lend itself to forming such close personal relationships, the two men are able to use each other as a support system to some how make both of their lives a little better.Steinbeck perfectly describes each scene placing the reader right in the action.

Each chapter builds upon the suspense, ultimately culminating in an ending that does not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is based on the book written by John Steinbeck in the 1930s.This novel took place in California with two migrant workers, Lennie and George. Lennie is a mentally challenged man who thinks and acts like a child. Lennie is also a very big and strong man who likes to pet soft things, like mice and rabbits. George is a small, hard working man who takes care of Lennie all the time.George and Lennie, in the beginning of the novel, are trying to run away from trouble because Lennie tried to touch a girl's dress in Weed where their former job was. George and Lennie, after running away, find a new job in a ranch where they meet Candy, Slim, Crooks, Carlson, Curley, and Curley's Wife. The five men are workers in the farm as well as friends and enemies of George and Lennie.Candy was an old swamper who was missing an arm. He was to old to work with the other men, so he just swept the rooms where they slept. He also had a dog that was killed by Carlson. Candy's dog was killed for the simple fact that it was old and smelled really bad.Curley was a small guy who used to be a former boxer and who didn't like big guys like Lennie for example. Curley was constantly picking on Lennie just for the fact that he was bigger than he was. All Curley wanted to do was fight Lennie and he finally got his wish; Lennie broke Curley's hand because Curley had punched and hit him for no reason.Curley's wife was a big flirt with all the guys working in the ranch. Her flirtatiousness got George and Lennie in trouble once again. Her soft hair caused Lennie's life.\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a great novel and movie as well. Even though the movie has some different things than the novel, they are both well written and both good stories. Other than just being a good story, it's also an interesting novel with suspension, intense emotions, and a tragic ending. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a wonderful story that should be read by everyone no matter their age."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This little gem of a book should be the de facto standard for a novel. Conscise yet detailed, moving and profound. Nobody makes me sappy eyed like Steinbeck. Definately 3.5 kleenex out of 5. For more kleenex mileage, try Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is one of the best books I have ever read. I can not believe Steinbeck can write a 107 page book and make the reader feel like they have known the character their wholes lives. It is sad to see how someone like Lennie can be treated, but great to know that there is always someone like George to be there for them. The ending is very good. I high recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The Setting for this story is Salinas, California during the 1930's. On the Salinas River, George and Lennie are camping out before they get to the ranch where they're going to work.The Main conflict of the book is that George thinks that Lennie is going to say or do something to get them fired from their job just like the job that they had before. This problem was easily solved by George telling Lennie not to talk to the boss and that if he did he would not be able to tend the rabbits when they get their own farm.The tone of this novel is kind of slow at first, but it eventually changes. When you are reading, you are thinking something is going to happen something different and more suspensful happens.Lennie Really doesn't change that much from the beginning to end. George, however, changes a lot. George starts off as a pretty good friend to Lennie, but eventually turns his back on him.To me the most moving scene in the novel was when Lennie was hiding in the brush and he invisions his Aunt Clara and a rabbit telling Lennie how he betrayed George by what he did to Curleys wife.I feel that John Steinbeck's purpose in the book is to show that even your closest friends can turn their backs on you.I learned, from this novel, that human nature is hard to deal with when you lose a close friend by backstabbing and betrayal.This novel reminds me of the time I lost a close friend from arugments, backstabbing and arugments.My overall feelings for this book are that, it is a great book to read. Even though it is kind of short, you get a lot out of it. You mainly learn about good and bad friendship. I strongly reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"After being chased from one job, George and Lennie find themselves alongside the road walking to their next job. Day after day George takes care of his friend Lennie who is a monstrous man with a mental illness. Lennie can hardly remember but one thing and that is the rabbits he hopes to tend.The hard times that George and Lennie have earning the little bit they can is hard enough, let alone this novel is during the Great Depression. The struggles they have can pull you into the novel. Would this novel be as good as it is if Lennie did not have a mental illness?I feel that this novel would not be the novel it is without the illness Lennie has. when George and Lennie get to their next job there are all kinds of things that are waiting to get them in trouble. First they show up late to work because of the bus driver, then they meet a small man that has an attitude whose name is Curley. Then Curley's wife comes around. She is a big flirt that catches Lennie's eyes. Lennie has a problem keeping his hands off of pretty soft things. These two people alone cause George and Lennie the most trouble. On the other hand George is able to become friends and gain trust with another worker named Slim.Being the way that Lennie is Curley finds some way to pick a fight with him. This creates some tension within the novel. Then when things seemed to be settled down Lennie finds himself in the barn talking to Curley's wife. If Lennie had enough sense he would not have gotten into a struggle with her. Because of this Lennie and George find themselves in the same situation they were in before. George finally realizes that this can't go on any longer and has to do something himself.I find this to be a very excellent novel to read. The characters are very likable and you can become easily attached. Without Lennie being the way he is this novel would just be some novel about two guys that worked on a farm. Lennie's character makes this novel as memorable as it is."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice And Men, by John Steinbeck was a winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962.I reed this book in the 9th grade, and I enjoyed it but now 4 years later I read it again and I understudied it better, maybe because I am more mature, and I understand life better than before.I recommend this book because of how the two men, George and Lenny lock out for each other, and how good friends they are, but also it is a sad book, it is sad because of the way things tern out. This book has the best ending a book can have, the thing that a person will do for a friend.I recommend this book to anyone, especially to people that enjoy books that make you think about things through out the whole book, and I also recommended to people that think that life is beautiful, but it can't be all the time.By, Victor Meza"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a story about two travelers that are trying to make their dream come true. The main charters in this book are, George Milton and Lennie Small. Both are the run because of an incident that happened in the town Weed. George and Lennie travel to get work so they can one day save up enough money to buy a piece of land and reach their goal. One thing that Lennie likes to do in this book is to pet soft things. He likes soft animals especially rabbits. Lennie is mentally retarded so he doesn't really know what is right and wrong. Lennie gets himself into lots of trouble throughout this book.My favorite character in this book is George Milton because he gets Lennie out of trouble. George helps Lennie all the way through their adventure and that is a true friend by your side.I could relate to George because when it comes to a good friend like he is with Lennie I'm there for my friends. George helps Lennie a lot through this book by sticking up for him and keeping him out of trouble. I have always saved my friends when they were trouble just like George does with Lennie. I help my friends when they need it the most. George helps Lennie when he gets in trouble in the town of Weed. I am just like George in a way because of how good of a friend he is to Lennie and how I am the same with my friends.This is a great book, but it is sad near the end. You can foresee a lot of things while reading this novel. My favorite part in the book was when Lennie is getting punched in the face by Curly; George then tells Lennie to fight back. Lennie then grabs Curly's hand with one fist and crushes it. The part that I least liked in the book was when Carlson shot Candy's dog to put it out of it's misery because Carlson said the dog smelled. Carlson had no right to shoot Candy's dog even if he did wanted to put it out of it's misery. I would change the part where Lennie got involved with Curly's wife. This is when things leads to trouble.I would recommend this book to others because it is a great book. This book has everything, drama, action and lots more. I think any type of person would read this novel mostly because of the story, characters and the qualities that it has.

This is a great story of two men that have a great friendship that cannot be broken.Steinbeck portrays the Depression vividly. He shows how people behaved and just treated other people.

I recommend"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"You won't get any complaint from me that this book is skillfully written, in it's vivid descriptions of settings, detailed descriptions of characters, and realistic dialogue.However, I believe this book has a bad message, and the bad message is about how it's ok to put the weak, infirm and dependent to death. It started with the discussion of Candy's aged dog. The book gave the impression that the dog's age made him no good to even himself, the \\"quality of life\\" argument that has been advanced to support euthanizing the elderly, weak and infirm.After discussing Candy's dog, the argument proceded to Candy himself, where he longs to be euthanized when he can no longer work.Finally, we come to George's murder of the retarded Lennie, which is completely justified by Slim, the voice of the one sympathetic character in the book. I believe that George was looking for an opportunity to divest himself of Lennie, and that opportunity presented itself when Lennie killed Curley's wife. It was also mentioned that if Lennie was institutionalized, it would be worse than death. I realized there are conflicting opinions about the moral nature of George, but I don't believe he was a good character.As I was writing this review, I recalled Proverbs 31:8-9 \\"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.\\" Of Mice And Men describes a world where the advocates for euthanizing the weak and infirm prevail."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men was a great book.

The there were some sad patrs, like when Lennie accidentally through his puppy because it wouldn't stop barking.

Anywayz, this book is wonderful...READ IT PLEASE!!!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Stienbeck's OF MICE AND MEN is a powerful book about the things we do for people for love. It is a simple book, done in Stienbeck's laid back, visual style. However, underneath the simple story is a powerful fable of guilt, hope, and love. The story is about two men, George and Lennie, drifting laborers of the American West, searching for work in the the hard times of the Great Depression. George is a small, intelligent, tough, suspicious man, Lennie is a tall, strong, man, a good worker, but with the mind of a child. Together, they form a team, George with his brain and Lennie with his strength. The story follows George and Lennie as they get work at a farm in Northern California, meet the other workers, some of which they become friends with. Gradually, as the book moves along, we begin to sense how the relationship of George and Lennie works. We see the protectiveness of George for Lennie, the pride he feels for Lennie's accomplishments. George needs Lennie just as much as Lennie needs George. So, when Lennie gets into trouble, through no fault of his own, jeopardizing George's future at the farm, we recognize the pain and frustration George feels, as well as the tight position it puts him into. The shattering ending, not only teaches us a lot about the things we do for the people we love, it also shows how Stienbeck has brought us close to these characters, making us care about what happens to them. In it's plot, OF MICE AND MEN is a simple, childish almost. But it evokes feeling and conversation that are far from simple and are felt by anyone who has ever loved. I highly recommend OF MICE AND MEN, a simple book with a powerful message."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I'm am a writter and I must say that this book is very well written, although it did have some shady points.

But after reading this book, I have so many deep feelings toward these lonely men who wandered around and urged for a home to stay and to be sheltered. Each of characters had dreams and see how they ended up in the book. It also describes very vividly about George's and Lennie's ironic friendship which had ended up a tragedy. If you are going to read the book, at the end you will find yourself sighing at the unchangeable fate for these wanderers. I myself like the story very much, and I had savored every details of it. The story made you not only to smile and cry, but also to think and feel. If you have not start this story yet, read it with your heart."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"As we approach the sixtieth anniversary of the first publication of Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, and given its enduring popularity as evidenced by the many stage, television, and motion picture productions, it's hardly premature to claim that the novella is an American classic. While teaching this novel over the last seven years, I have rarely found a student who did not find the story compelling, and those who did not, like Steinbeck's Carlson, could not see the novel's pathos. Because the story offers so little hope for the human condition, so little joy in the darkening bunkhouse, the little love and caring and wisdom that we do experience through George, Slim, and Lennie seem incandescently human and attractive in contrast. The greater part of the novel's appeal, George and Lennie's relationship, although far from what one could call a reciprocal friendship, intrigues the reader in the same way many comic duos intrigue. We alternately identify with the much put-upon \\"smart guy\\" who helplessly tries to cope with and control his irrational, dumb and, yet, spontaneous, child-like partner as they lurch from one self-inflicted crisis to another. While Steinbeck uses that classic comic routine so that the reader warmly identifies and recognizes the relationship, a closer look at the relationship, however, quickly reveals the novel's darker side, where George willfully dominates and controls Lennie. As we read on, Curley and his wife emerge as foils who mirror the novel's main relationship. Both couples pivot on a power struggle, on a willful monopolization and control by one partner over another. Indeed, all of the relationships and couplings in the novel turn on a power struggle. Pizer and Owens claim that \\"one of the themes in of Of Mice and Men is that men fear loneliness, that they need someone to be with and to talk to who will offer understanding and companionship\\" (Owens,146 ). While most critics agree with Pizer and Owen, none have seen or suggested that the loneliness and fear in ! the novel's characters result from the two antithetical urges that the forces of nature have encoded or programed into all its creatures. On the one hand, Steinbeck's Nature demands of its creatures competition and power to wrest the limited goods of the earth. On the other hand, Nature also urges the individual to seek community and intimacy. The novel explores how these two contradictory urges destroy any hope in man for happiness. Man, at war with himself, has been exiled from Eden. Happiness, therefore, must be an illusion because Nature's two primary and fundamental directives are radically antithetical; the satisfaction of one urge immediately excludes the satisfaction of the other. Steinbeck's peculiar understanding of the curse of Cain, as explained by Goldhurst in his seminal study, is to crave companionship from the depths of one's nature, only to destroy it by possessing it. Because the controlled other is always reduced to an object, to a means towards another's end, an equal interpersonal relationship is made impossible or, at best, an anomaly. In addition, the relationship causes an inescapable guilt in the reducer. The reduced other also experiences guilt because of an effaced and degraded self, but also because he cannot ever be controlled as much as the dominator demands. Here is Steinbeck's naturalism. A self-enclosed, non-transcendent, non-teleological natural system that provides a fatalism which when seen through the sympathy of sensitive eyes offers the possibility of pathos and beauty. Steinbeck's metaphyisical naturalism can also reinvent and reinterpret the ancient myths and symbols in the ironic light of a dark and grim metaphysic. Steinbeck's narrator establishes and characterizes George's lording of power and control over Lennie early in the first chapter: George's hand remained outstretched imperiously. Slowly, like a terrier who doesn't want to bring a ball to its master, Lennie approached, drew back, approached again. George snapped his fingers sharply, and at the sound Lennie laid the mouse in his hand (Steinbeck 9, emphasis mine). George precipitates this confrontation almost knowingly when he lies on the grass after ordering Lennie to fetch firewood. Rather than help Lennie, who must make many trips to get enough wood, George sits and whistles. Ineptly, Lennie returns with one twig and, George, knowing Lennie has indulged his passion, omnisciently declares: \\"Awright...Gimme that mouse.\\" George's emotional misuse of the power he enjoys over Lennie are many and varied; however, the incident where Lennie crushes the hand of Curley reveals the terrible irresponsibility of which George is capable. Although Slim offers to end Curley's vicious assault on Lennie, George stops Slim: \\"George put out his hand and grabbed Slim\\". (69) The attack on Lennie could have ended, but George wants revenge on Curley whom he hates: \\"George yelled again, \`I said get him.'\\" George knows that Lennie's immense and, once unleashed, uncontrollable strength could easily kill Curley, and yet, he cannot resist the opportunity to demonstrate his power over others through Lennie. Earlier George had warned Candy about the danger of \\"messing\\" with Lennie: \\"George said ominously, \`well, he better watch out for Lennie.'\\" (30) Only later do we realize that George's warning was really a threat aimed at Curley. George's life and death power over Lennie, however, is not without its drawbacks. In a confession to Slim, George begins to reveal the parameters of the central metaphysical dilemma in which each man twists. George recognizes his urge to dominate, control and rise in the social pecking order when he tells how Lennie's life was almost lost when he ordered Lennie to jump into a lake, even though Lennie couldn't swim: \\"I used have a hell of a lot of fun with \`im. Made me seem God damn smart along side of him.\\"(44) Lennie's near-death brings George to a sense of his responsibility and guilt, and he wants to \\"confess\\" his misuse of power and responsibility. Yet, that insight doesn't release George from the same urge to lord control over Lennie and increase his stature in the eyes of others. After his profound confession to Slim, George still boasts: \\"He'll do any damn thing I ---\\". Steinbeck leaves the reader to complete the boast. George has the ability as a reflective man to partially understand the forces that drive him, but he remains powerless to change the forces within himself nor the guilt that follows. As revealing as the confession is about George, it also alludes to the psychological dynamic motivating all of the characters. Slim, the God-like skinner, questions the relationship, and George explains why he travels with Lennie: He fears loneliness and the rage that inevitably accompanies human isolation: \\" \`I ain't got no people,' George said. \\"I seen the guys that go around on the ranches alone.That ain't no good. They don't have no fun. After a while they get mean. They get to wantin' to fight all the time.\\" (45) In an earlier scene, when Slim first meets and questions George concerning his companion, Slim cryptically muses as to the reason for mankind's loneliness: Slim looked through George and beyond him. \\"Ain't many guys travel around together,\\" he mused. \\"I don't know why. Maybe ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other.\\" (38) Fear- of- the-other, therefore, becomes the central existential dread that causes loneliness and negatively shapes and motivates the interior life of man. That fear-of-the-other arises from what the novel indicates as the inexorable urge to control the other. The nature of the phenomenon, however, lacks complex, multi-facted cause and effect components. If that were so we might interrupt a causal series and change human nature; rather,Steinbeck's naturalism suggests a simple, seamless, inter-dynamic manifold that molds and determines behavior,"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The ending is very sad, and it touched me deeply!!!

It really is a shame that most people don't read anything more of his than Grapes of Wrath (which is a great novel, don't get me wrong). This is an incredibly short read, hardly more then a short story, barely a novella, and yet it packs an emotional punch that only Steinbeck can manage. It's the story of George and Lennie, two down troden men in the California of the 30's. Like so many others, they dream of having a parcel of land for themselves. They're simple dream is really a desire to end the economic inequalities and maladies that plague their society. But when it comes down to it, Of Mice and Men is a a story of humanity, simple beautiful, brutal humanity. Lennie and George are shown the best and worst of man. They take part, in their morally ambigous way, in the good and ill of society. They are painfully sympathetic and you feel more emotional connected to them at the end of a short 120 pages then you would have thought possible.

They live their lives traveling to find work whenever and where they can. Lennie is a rather large man with enough strength to do hard work. Unfortunately, Lennie has a mental disability, denying him the privilege of having a higher intelligence than that of a child. George is Lennie's caretaker and best friend. George's characteristics are opposite of Lennie. He is intelligent and small. Like many laborers during that time, Lennie and George dream of owning their own piece of land. They plan to live life without a boss and make their own decisions. Lennie and George know this dream can come true, but a set of unfortunate events, characters, and Lennie's attraction to trouble begin to alter their dreams and future plans.Throughout the novel, Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck is able to depict many themes. The themes that are found include understanding disabilities, racism, loneliness, and segregation. Characters that are encountered in Of Mice and Men are creatively used as symbols to describe the themes.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels that provide good meaning and insight. I was highly entertained by the novel. Of Mice and Men is a remarkable and extraordinary book that allows you to look into different perspectives.

Yes, it was able to keep me engaged in the novel and continue reading, but it was not my favorite. That is just the begining. The last chapter touched me in a way I could never imagine possible. Even though I did not rate this five stars, I am sure many of you would. I am sure many of you would rate this ten stars if given a chance.

In the book Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck talks about the friendship between two migrant workers, George and Lennie. George is a small, wiry man that cared a lot about Lennie. He is usually the one to make the decisions and plans for their future. In contrast, Lennie is large in size, lumbering, and he has a childlike mind. Lennie&iexcl;s mental disabilities allow him to completely depend upon George for guidance and protection.Both George and Lennie shared a common dream. Their dream is to earn money to buy a farm of their own where no one ever reaches. To make this a reality, they found a job at a ranch. At the ranch, George and Lennie encounter many challenges, and they also undergo many struggles to attain their idealistic dream. The author concludes this novel with a very shocking and unexpected ending.This is a great novel to read. It is a short and entertaining novel that captures the reader's interest. It moves in a fast pace with many excellent descriptions in every scene. The novel was so well written that I was immersed into it. The author explorers the brotherhood in humans, strengths and weaknesses, and the dream we all possess. Steinbeck clearly illustrated the impossibility to achieve happiness and freedom - the American Dream, and I definitely can relate the themes to my daily life. I strongly recommend this story because it brings laugher, excitement, and tears, and it is a classic you don't want to miss."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was absolutely amazing. this novella is a great choice for readers of all types and ages. this book is basicly about friendship, prejudice, and most importantly, the American Dream. everyone has an American Dream. whether its to own land, to become famous, to have a family, or simply to belong somewhere~ everyone wants to be socially equal and have material wealth. this novella teaches the lesson that although dreams give u hope and motovation to keep striving towards the future, there is also that fear that u won't reach u'r dream and that is very true in many cases such as lennie and george's. this story is about fate. most of the events occured in this book based on being at the wrong place at the wrong time or in one word, fate. this book gets its title from a very touching poem. it simply means strong vs. the weak. i would deffinently recommend this book because it is realistic and does not have a happy ending because that is the way life goes sometimes. you don't always reach your goals in life."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was one that i wish i would of read when i was suppose to in 9th grade.

Read this book!!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Judging by its short 106-page length and relatively large font, John Steinbeck's novel Of Mice and Men would seem to be the \\"perfect\\" read for an average high school slacker. However, most high schoolers are not allowed to take advantage of the short novel because Of Mice and Men has been banned from many schools for being controversial. This may seem strange as the plot is centered around two friends, George and Lennie, who travel from place to place looking for work. However, George and Lennie aren't like most other manual laborers. They work because they have the goal of eventually buying and managing their own piece of land. Steinbeck focuses the novel mainly on their arduous journey toward achieving that goal. However, during George and Lennie's journey, Steinbeck incorporates different themes that are morally and socially controversial and ultimately result in Of Mice and Men being banned.Ironically, Steinbeck's philosophical themes that cause controversy stem from a relatively simple plot. The plot surrounds the main characters, George and Lennie, who are looking for a place to work and who eventually settle on a ranch in California. They develop many friends at this ranch and some of their fellow workers actually join Lennie and George in their quest to own land. However, it isn't long before that Lennie accidentally murders the boss's daughter in law and is forced to flee the ranch to avoid being punished. With a search party looking for Lennie, it is ironic that George, Lennie's long-time companion, is the one that kills Lennie. The novel then comes to a conclusion after Lennie is killed and the two never get to own their own land. With this plot the murder alone being controversial enough for the book to be banned, it is obvious that the reasons for the banishment are due to other themes within the book.One of the major themes of the novel that may have caused moral controversy is the relationship between George and Lennie. George and Lennie have been long-time companions and have always been there for each other. This friendship may not seem controversial on the surface but the way the two treat each other can be considered socially offensive. George, who is naturally much smarter than Lennie, often insults and chastises Lennie for being dumb. For example, one time after Lennie wanted a dead mouse as a pet, George reacted, \\" \\"\`You crazy fool...'\\" He heard Lennie's whimpering cry and wheeled about. \\"\`Blubberin'\\" like a baby! Jesus Christ!'\\" \\" Quotes like this are riddled throughout the book as George and other characters continue to insult Lennie for not being smart. This aspect of the novel will offend many readers as it is not proper in society to offend people who are not smart. These unwarranted attacks are reason why Of Mice and Men may have been banned.The novel also may have been banned because the novel negatively portrays women. The insulting description of women is a theme in the novel that can be seen through the character of Curley's wife. She is the only female character in the book and negatively represents women as she is constantly portrayed s very annoying. She is constantly nagging all the workers on the ranch and soon gains the disliking of all the workers. The workers personify her with words like \\"tramp\\" and \\"tart\\" as they think she is whorish. Morally, this portrayal is controversial because Steinbeck uses Curley's wife as a symbol for all women. It is offensive for all women to be characterized as annoying and whorish. As a result, many women may have been upset by Of Mice and Men and called for the book to be banned.Although the novel became banned in many schools, I think Of Mice and Men positively contributed to the literary world because Steinbeck had a powerful message in his book. Although controversial, Steinbeck conveyed something through his writing and that is very important. Steinbeck made people think and argue as he pointed out pieces of society that might seem offensive. Through his book, he made people take action to improve society. I think that authors should always strive for an emotional response from their readers. As a result, because Of Mice and Men sends a powerful message, the novel should not be banned and students should read it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book is the powerful story of two young men, George and Lennie, trying to fulfill their longtime dream of owning their own land. In the meantime, they work at a small ranch to try to gain enough money to buy their own land...A major theme that has caused controversy among many schools throughout the country is its bad language. According to Christopher Moore ... there are over 122 curse words in the book and is thought to be an \\"unChristian mindset\\" for children. Some other controversial themes that have caused the book to be banned in many schools are its \\"...moral statement(s), treatment of the retarded, and the violent ending.\\"... Personally, I thought that this was a very good book that showed true frienship, through \\"thick and thin\\" and I don't think that it should be banned in schools."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"First off, I thought that the novel, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was a pretty good one. Usually I can't and don't really like reading novels but I did like this one. This book has been banned before in schools and I just think that that's ridiculous. Why ban this novel? I could understand the banning if this book had themes of sex, violence, etc. but it doesn't. All the banning does is hinder a children from reading a book that is commonly referred to as a legend.I have researched on the internet as to why this book had been banned in schools across America and some of the reasons I found were because the book had parts with obscene language and violent scenes, such as the ending.I suppose that these schools do not seem to realize that the book is more than just that. The story is about a friendship between two men named George and Lennie. Some might ask the question : \\"How can they be friends after George shoots Lennie in the end?\\" Well, to answer a popular question, George did it for Lennie. He peacefully killed Lennie before Curly and his men could get to him. He saved Lennie from the torture that undoubtedly would have occurred had they found him first.Like I said before, I consider this book, as many others do, as a \\"legend\\". If schools want to ban the book because some of these \\"controversial themes\\" then the least they could do, is allow the children to read the book at an older age. They're just taking away one of the best books from them by having it banned."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Review of: Of Mice and MenOf Mice and Men is a novel about two men named George and Lennie who have the dream of owning their own farm one day. The problem however, is that George and Lennie do not have nearly enough money to pay for their own farm nonetheless pay for a decent living. George is a small dark man who is pretty smart, and his counterpart Lennie is a little different. Lennie has a slight mental disability because he nearly drowned in a river that he and George swam in a long time before the novel started. Because George felt that he did not to enough to save Lennie, he vowed to take care of Lennie for the rest of his life.The next day, Lennie and George apply for a job at a local farm. They get a job and are allowed to live in a bunker house on the farm. In the house, they meet Candy, who is a another \\"hand' around the farm, and Curley, who is the boss' mean-spirited son. Lennie and George work on the farm for the next week or so, when Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans for the farm they are going to buy. Candy vows to not tell anyone about the plans and says he will donate his life savings if he is allowed to live on the land. From that point on, whenever someone threatens Lennie or tries to make fun of him because of his disabilities, (example is Curley when he is jealous that his wife is hitting on everyone) Candy is there to back Lennie.During one of the following evenings, Lennie and Curley's wife get into a discussion about how they love to touch things that are soft. Curley's wife allows Lennie to feel her hair, and after a couple of minutes Lennie is yanking at Curley's wife's hair and ends up breaking her neck. Previously before this incident, Lennie had killed his baby puppy that had been given to him as a present. The next morning, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head as an act of mercy, to relieve him of a life, that he obviously never wanted to live.I thought that there were a couple of aspects in this novel that could have made it a banned book. An aspect may have been, who and who isn't allowed to work legally in the United States. I thought in the past, there may have been a law that said that no person with mental disabilities would be allowed to work manual labor. Because of this law, I thought they may ban this book because it is a prime example of how a retarded person got away with working on a farm and how the novel may show examples for other mentally-challenged people in the world to find jobs. Because this book, I thought promoted illegal policies, it would be banned. Also in a moral standpoint, I think this book may have been banned to relieve the public about a story of a retarded person who's life turned out so badly for him. I think this book may have disturbed many people in the past, therefore, the book was banned so when people saw mentally-challenged people, they would not relate the person to the story of Lennie in Of Mice and Men.I think this book positively aspects the literary world and its' themes should be shared by everyone that can read a book. I have many reasons why I believe this. First of all, I really liked how Of Mice and Men portrays the value of human existence. At one point in the book, we notice how Lennie has the need of a friend, yet he will cling to a stranger, such as Curley's wife, for self-comfort. In scenarios such as this one, we can see that tyranny does not come from those who are rich and powerful, and I believe that this is a very powerful concept to have the knowledge of because oppression does not come from \\"the hands of the heavens,\\" which is something everyone needs to know.Another aspect of this book that positively influences the outside world is how there is no possibility of everything happening perfectly, or \\"The American Dream.\\" There are many examples of this throughout the book. For example, Curley's wife wishes to one day be a movie star, Crooks wishes to be the hardest worker on Lennie and George's farm, and Candy wishes that he will have a friend, (George) own a large piece of land. Obviously, none of these wishes came true. The moral to this is, what makes dreams is the desire to follow their own freedoms, and dreams, as shown by Of Mice and men, will never occur. And that is something that every American needs to know, is that dreams are meant to be dreams, and the sooner you know that, the better it is; which is why this book is a positive influence to the outside world.I would recommend this book to all advanced readers because it not only provides an interesting setting, climax, and plot, it provides a great understanding of the world, and what meanings of life the world has to offer. If you would like to have a story told to you that tells you the journeys of two young men who are looking for answers to life, but get them in symbolic form, read this novel, because you look at things a whole lot differently, once you look at life from a different standpoint."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Wonderful story of friendship, sacrifice and self-denial.

George and Lennie are the pair that departs together to find work that would bring them closer to the dream of owning a farm. The dream becomes harder for George because of the continuous hassle from Lennie, a mentally disabled man. Yet the two travel together because of the loneliness of being alone and the company they bring each other. Together they find work in Salinas Valley. The dream of owning a farm comes closer until Lennie causes more conflict at their work. But this time George puts the decision in his own hands.Steinbeck explores the nature of man and friendship in his book. George's decision to end the cycle at the end of the book shows his character of understanding the situation that he was in. George understood that together their dream was unachievable. The constant struggle between George and Lennie did not help achieve their dream and put it into reality. Many times before, George put up with this conflict because of their bond and friendship together. Steinbeck shows that where there is a conflict the knowledgeable one should solve it. In of Mice and Men, George realizes Lennie probably could never truly be happy. So as a friend George tries to make Lennie's last memory of getting, \\"to tend the rabbits,\\"(105\\") in a farm with him. Steinbeck provides some insight to what a good friend is and what man needs to do for survival.Steinbeck provides superb storytelling. From beginning to end the novel makes you stick with their journey though their happiness and hardships.

Lennie kills the lady and is forced to run and hide where George told him to go if ever he were in trouble and what doess George do? HE SHOOTS LENNIE! George goes on to become a drunk and the novella has a most depressing ending. Basically, this was an incredibly depressing book (like all Steinbacks) and is the last book I will ever want to read again. My teacher calls it realism I call it flat out pessimism. It is a glimpse into the mind of a man who knew how to take a lousy story and write it well enough to sell like so many \\"great\\" american novelists of the 20th century. This was the first book I ever felt like ripping to shreds and unless you yourself are depressed or wish to become so, DO NOT READ A STEINBACK NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Now, then:Of Mice and Men Is one of the worst books I have ever read. Let me count the ways:1) It has immeasuably two dimensional chacters. Steinbeck stays so close to the archetypal \\"strong man\\" \\"seedy guy\\" \\"angry little guy\\" \\"seductive wife\\" its disgusting. he even has a token black guy! Absurd.2) An equally two-dimensional plot. Steinbeck's unbearable heavy handedness in getting his all important \\"moral\\" across completely crushes out any vestige of meaningful charcterization or subtext.3) The ending. No, I'm not about to say \\"ew!\\" What i will say is that thats what he WANTS you to think. He wants you to put down this book and \\"realzie the impossibility the america dream, and the cutthroat nature of humans in general.\\" The problem with this conclusion is the entire book is completely contrived! The most absurd confluence of cicumstances that could possible occur come togethr in this book. its all crap.There.

Serious scholars need not apply. The books are not for the people to do with Lenny and Carl.

If you're good looking for Steinbeck, I suggest the &quot;Rapes of Wrath.&quot;"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This was the first book that I actually read from cover to cover in one sitting, and was the first book that really &quot;gripped&quot; me!

Much better than the recent versions. Of Mice and Men is a classic in my eyes."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This story interested me.. It is small and concise.. while it easily gets its point across.. I think that Lenny represents the ignorance and naivity that exists in the world, while George represents the harsh but realistic voice of reason... people may take it as a simply depressing story.. but i suppose that you just have to be in a position where you can understand what the characters are going through.. Lenny knows not what he does.. his world is all he has ever known.. he has nothing but love for animals and his sadness is sincere when he kills them.. he cannot help his ignorance, but it remains there, glaring him in the face.. just as it glares each and everyone of us in the face every day.. George is your boss, or your teacher, or your parent, or authoritative figure who keeps you in line.. he is the one who claps his hands when you doze off to sleep in class.. he is the one who gives you that reality check when you begin to wander.. but at the same time, he is the most caring friend one could have.. this story is not a sad one.. it is rather one that shows the happiness of two friends who's life wouldnt be the same without each other.. the end.. which i wont reveal at this point.. is the most meaningful part of all.. some may call it sad.. or depressing.. but it isnt.. it is out of love alone that causes George to do what he does.. I would recommend this story to anyone with a little time on their hands.. it only took me an hour to read.. dont take the story so literally.. try to relate it to your life as i have done.."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I had to read this book for english class, like many other people, and found it a very thought provoking and interesting book.

I've read it probably 3 or 4 times growing up, and it still finds a way to grab hold of me. Steinbeck's characters are the most true, honest people in fiction, in my humble opinion.

It is certainly a good enough, solid story, reasonably well told, but no masterpiece. Maybe it's just that the plot element of a person killing another he loves as an act of compassion has been used too often since (e.g. Betty Blue and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest).So read the book, by all means, but don't harbour the expectations I had.

You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's novel &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is one of the best books I have read in a long while. The setting of this story is in the south were racism and prejudices are just a way of life. The story is about two men who are trying to reach their American dream of having their own house on there own land. George is the smart one who act as an older sibling to Lennie, a man who is big and strong but has a heart of a four year old girl because he's mentally handicapped. Throughout the novel George is constantly telling Lennie that he would be better of without him. They eventually get to Tyler Ranch their new place of work. While settling in there they make plans to buy the land and house with Candy, an old crippled man. At the farm Lennie is treated with respect from everybody at the ranch except for the bosses son Curley. While on the ranch Curley is always trying to stir things up with the workers, especially Lennie. While the men are having a horseshoe tournament Lennie is inside the barn with the pup he want to get. Throughout the book Lennie is constantly killing small animals on accident. He eventually kills the pup, meanwhile Curleys wife who is a constant nuisance enters the barn and starts flirting with Lennie, while petting her hair Lennie gets frightened and incidentally snaps her neck and runs from the ranch as quick as possible. You must read the book to figure out what happens next. This is a heart-warming novel that once you start reading you wont put it down. I recommend you read this book as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I had to read this book for my American Literature class and I just thought that it was going to be another boring book. I was surprised to find out how wrong I was. Lenny is this guy who is not smart but is strong. George is the &quot;brain&quot; in this duo. These two are the people who are least likely to become friends. They are the typical Freudian friends. I don't want to give any of the good parts away, but this is one of the greatest books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I personally think that this book was a very good book. Unlike the Grapes of Wrath John really opened up my eyes with this book. It opened me to realize that we all can't help what mistakes we make. We can only be responsible for the actions we take. When i read this book i realized that the world is full of racial prejudice. Not only the African American race or the White Race but as well as the Impaired or handicapped.That is why i think this was good book. The best one I have read. The only one i have read this year...."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a real interesting and triumphant book. The first few pages were really boring and I was on the verge of quiting the book, but after a chapter it started to get really interesting and exciting. This book really paints a picture in your head of loniness. I feel sorry for the fact that everybody can't experience the drama and effort that John Steinbeck had put in this wonderful/compelling book. This is one great book that everybody should experience!!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was heart-warming and sad. It is about a man named Lennie who was mentally disabled and always misjudged because of his looks. Ever since he lost his Aunt Clair, who took care of him for most of his life, George, who once told Lennie to jump off a bridge into a river and almost made Lennie drown, took sympathy in Lennie and looked after him to his dying day. Lennie always tried to make George happy and always tried to not disappoint him, but he always messed up and diappointed George. In the story George helps Lennie in his jobs and life. But Lennie never seems to help George to get ahead."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I have not read this book since high school (a long time ago), so I actually had forgotten how much I loved this book, probably more this time as it was read for pleasure.Briefly, Of Mice and Men, tells the story of two drifters, Lennie, a mentally challenged, gentle giant, and George, the man who looks after Lennie. They are just two of the many itinerant labors who search for jobs in the fields of California during the Depression. George and Lennie hope that at some point, they will achieve the American Dream of owning a small piece of land and having a few rabbits as well, because Lennie loves small little critters and having something soft to pet.'We're gonna have a little place,\\" Lennie explained patiently. \\"We're gonna have a house an' a garden and a place for alfalfa, an' that alfalfa is for the rabbits, an' I take a sack of it fulla alfalfa and then I take it to the rabbits.\\"....................\\"I like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things.\\"Lennie is extremely loyal to George, and although he has caused some problems as the two travel from place to place trying to find work, the one constant is that they have each other.\\"I ain't got no people...'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time, but you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't get rid of him.\\"George is often angry about some of the things that Lennie does, and feels burdened, believing that Lennie is holding him back in life. Lennie, in turn worries that George may leave him some day. In addition to george and Lennie, there are some minor characters in this story: Crooks, Slim, Curley and Carlson, and themes of loneliness surface again through these men. Throughout this story there is a lot of foreshadowing which occurs, preparing the reader for a some of the bad things that are about to take place. There are several issues explored in this novel: the mentally challenged individual, poverty and racism, and although the characters here are different, their issues are often the same, leading each to experience many of the same disappointments in life.For those of you who have never read this amazing story (under 130 pages), Of Mice and Men, packs a mighty punch for such a small book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I will admit that I had to read this book for school back during my high school days and it actually wasn't all that bad. I really enjoyed this book more than I thought that I was going too. It was such an interesting story about how George and Lennie worked together and fed off of each other's spirits to be able to get through each day that came at them. It is a book that I would recommend to any person who is looking to read a great book. It has the highs and lows of an old time story about two guys trying to work towards the American Dream at that point in time. Wonderful story."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I cannot remember the last time, if ever, a story and its characters brought me to tears. This is what great story-telling is all about.The narrative get darker and more intense as the story progresses, until you realize that despite your most fervent and desperate hopes, the looming clouds are going to wash away dreams that one almost dare not cherish. The sad ending does not douse all optimism, however, and ends on a note of giving one's dreams, however amended, another chance.Also, to echo what may already have been stated already, the audio narration by Gary Sinise is absolutely top notch."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Length:: 0:39 Mins"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"When I was about 11, I took this book off my parent's bookshelf, because I thought I would liked the mice in the story. I had never heard of John Steinbeck - I am not native English speaking and don't live in America. Reading it captivated me and changed the way I viewed books forever, in a way no other book ever had, and could do since. The writing is so elegant, so simple, so even and uncomplicated that at first it deceives one into believing the story was simply about two brothers and a girl. And it was - simple enough at that age for me to grasp and be moved by it. As a child, this book turned me into a reader of adult books. It was a turning point in the reading choices I made since, and my expectations of literature up to this day. When I read the book again as an adult, it had lost none of the simplicity but gripped me even more deeply, since I could fully understand the tragedy and violence. This book is absolutely essential reading, and I will give it to my children and every child I know. I am eternally grateful that it was written and that I stumbled upon it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"One of the most incredible things that I have found reading Steinbeck is his ability to manipulate my mind set and opinions of his characters. I found this most relevant in OF MICE AND MEN.Though I had nothing in common with either of the main characters, in no time I started to relate to them through their emotions of lonliness and that desperation to find an ideal to cling to and look forward to. Taking the journey with them to the farm and interacting with the other people helping, Steinbeck tells a beautifully written story through dialogue. This story has detailed, but limited descriptions of settings. I for one really enjoyed this aspect after reading GRAPES OF WRATH which has both vivid descriptions and dialogue.Through the book, the reader witnesses Lennie constantly being lectured for every action he makes but still stays loyal and warm to George. This story actually reminded me of an abusive relationship when I first started reading it. George, being the abuser, is extremely negative, and verbally abusive to Lennie. Yet, the reader can feel how much love he has for Lennie as well. At first I hated George. He reminded me of Mo from the Three Stooges. I hated seeing him be so controlling and unkind to Lennie. As the story unfolded though I warmed up to George until the last pages where I went through a stage of shock, and then anger, and then pity for George. To bring all those emotions out of someone within about fifteen pages I was fully impressed.I only wish I would've gotten the opportunity to read this in school instead of reading it on my own so I could compare perspectives and opinions on the book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck has a great talent of telling a profound story with simple sentences, basic vocabulary, and a straight forward plot. The strength of the story is in great characters and the tone of the story. Not many books have touched my life like this one. It's hard not to feel for Lennie and George and become angry at the world for there being no place for someone like Lennie at that point in time. It's a truly moving story that should be read by everyone at least once."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The title comes from the fact that one of the two main characters, Lennie, is a little retarded, but is still a kind man who only wishes for goodness. The other character, George, has more sense and knows his goals. He has dreams of buying a piece of land and settling down. He makes a continuous effort to keep Lennie's erratic behavior in check and keep him out of trouble. However, in one incident, he held a mouse in his hand so tightly that he killed it, only desiring to caress it, but not knowing his own strength. He also has a rather awkward moment with a young farm girl in one of their migrant worker jobs, who terrifies him by screaming in Lennie's presence, driving the man to shake her until her life is gone.George always tries to rescue Lennie when he finds trouble, although he eventually realizes that he cannot watch him forever. Realizing that the girl's death is just too much to handle, he relinquishes his dreams of a ranch and a life for the two of them in order to find a more direct solution to Lennie's problems.This is a story of lessons in life that force you to reconsider what you invest in your friends. Of Mice and Men is a story of friendship, of devotion, disappointment and realization. John Steinbeck tries to show how flimsy our friendships can become even if they started off with the best of intentions and how loyal we must be to keep them intact. Yet, he filters out the hardships we endure just to survive and maintain a certain distance from those whose behavior effects us in detrimental ways. Again, Steinbeck is a genius, perfecting his storytelling by delving into the minds of these two men to see at what cost they remain devoted and loyal. I think Steinbeck has captured the spirit of hopes, dreams and wishes in a truly American episode of our great West."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Yeah, they make you read this stuff in high school in a country where most kids find it challenging to read the back of a box of Cap'n Crunch. And because it's forced reading, the novel itself becomes as ossified as one of those dismembered appendages found in Eastern European reliquaries. But if you break the glass and give it a sincere read, you'll discover it's one of the greatest novels ever to come out of America, whether it's the economy of style, the simple power of the language, or its heart-breaking finality. It's not just that Lenny bites the big one, it's that George and all the other guys, they die too. And suffer more."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"One of the common themes in my top five books is loyalty. Looking at my own life experiences I can see why I am drawn to stories that honor loyalty. Steinbeck's character George remains committed to Lennie despite all the trouble and hardships he causes. I absolutely love the dream that George and Lennie share and talk about as they work to achieve it. To quote one of my favorite films RUDY, \\"Dreams are what make life tolerable.\\" Their little farm dream will always be a vivid picture in my mind. Overcoming obstacles, dreaming big, working hard, and being sensitive to those who are disadvantaged have always been important trheads in my life, and these elements are the crux of John Steinbeck's classic. I often used this book as a \\"Read Aloud\\" to my freshmen English studensts. I hope they loved hearing my George and Lennie voices as much as I loved creating them. Their voices will always be in my head and will remind me that when it comes to dealing with life's adversity, it's always better to have someone to share your experiences with, especially the most difficult ones. This book will always remain in my TOP FIVE."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I accidentally ordered this. The day it arrived, I spent the afternoon enthralled by Steinbeck's writing and his unique view of the world. \\"East of Eden\\" is one of my very favorite books and I don't really know why I've never read \\"Of Mice and Men\\" before. I vaguely remember seeing it as a play while I was in high school.A story about two men working together to attain their own version of the American Dream, it brings up many ethical questions and can lead to some interesting discussion and thought.Excellent. I no longer have to wonder why it is a classic."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"If you have never read this classic, you should read it. If you read it long ago, you should read it again.Clifton Fadiman, one of the 20th century's foremost critics, is said to have read 25,000 books in his lifetime, many more than once. \\"When you re-read a classic,\\" he said, \\"you do not see more in the book than you did before; you see more in you than there was before.\\" I've read Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men probably a half-dozen times since I first read it as a teenager. Each time, as a reader, I connect more with the characters than I did the last. And each time, as a writer, I learn something more about the stories I want to write."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is an amazing book.

He will do anything to make George happy.Curley- He hates Lennie because he is intimidated by men who are bigger than him.Curley's Wife- She flirts with every man on the ranch to make up for the loneliness Curley gives her.This book was written amazingly... obviously, it's a classic!

It was so simple to paint a vivid image in my mind.A story about the true testament of friendship, but not in the conventional way. A story about choices, consequences, lessons, control.. and how often times, the spirit is who it is.. and controlling it or a destiny, will never be fulfilled."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"im really happy with my purchase. the book was in excellent condition. it was good quality as well. thanks !"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"As an English teacher I believe this is a novel that we should all read because of its iconic status in American literature.

Raise chickens and rabbits and live out a simple yet pleasant life which isn't an uncommon theme for the time. Just a few more jobs and their dream might be realized...The story told in \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is simple and straight forward enough however the richness within is delivered in Steinbeck's ability to quickly draw strong characters and set the tone not only in each scene but for the times in which the characters live as well.The good: As stated this story is all about Steinbeck's ability to present strong characters and give the reader a good feel and understanding of the time and place in which the story takes place.The Bad: Nothing memorable.Overall: \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is worthy of the moniker \`Classic' and deserves your attention.

I thought that the book Of Mice and Men was a thrilling, two thumbs up work of art. I couldn't put it down. I learned alot from the companionship of Lennie and George, and realized how important my friends and family are to me. Lennie was the cutest thing, he made me laugh through the whole book, I just wanted to squeeze him and give him a huge hug. And the poor thing never got to tend to his rabbits. I did think that the ending was sad and I hated that Lennie had to die, but the way that the author demonstrated George's purpose for doing what he did showed how much he really did love Lennie. He wouldn't let anyone else hurt him. This book is a book that should be read by everyone. I think it can teach all people something about life and how fortunate some people are more than others. This is a spectacular book, and Steinbeck has shown a great strength through his work. It was very easy to understand and follow along. THe sentence structure and detail made everything happen. I felt as if I was actually there in some parts of the book. I almost want to think that Steinbeck had some experience in what he wrote, because he seems to know alot about what he writes.

A definite book to put on your to-do list!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Mice and men was a strange book at the start. The language was very interesting and cleverly described. The fact that I'm only 13 years of age makes it quite a challanging book for me. As we got into it, it was brilliant. I loved the way Steinbeck showed that George &amp; Lennies life was a game of chance, by George always play cards. When you play cards you don't know if your going to get a bad hand or a good one. This reflects the issues in both George and Lennnie's life. It got quite emotional when Carlson insisted on killing Candy's dog. I suppose that if I had a ill dog , I'm sure I'd want to put it out of it's misery. The end though was fantastic. Curley was beating Lennie, so George told Lennie to get him, and Lennie grabbed hold of Curley's had and crushed it with his enormous amount of strengh.

Carlson hates his dog so much that he shoots it. Lennie wants something soft to pet, so Slim gives him a dog. Lennie gets mad with the dog one day, hits it, and accidently kills it. This forshadows the killing of Curley's Wife. Curley's Wife was talking to Lennie in the barn one day, and let Lennie pet her hair. Lennie starts hurting her, and then breaks her neck by accident and kills her. He doesn't know his own strength. Lennie runs to the brush, where the saddest part in the novel happens.

Steinbeck just was not relevant to me at that age. Actually, no literature was relevant. I firmly believe that for some teenagers, a lack of life experience makes the reading of literature an exercise in futility. Of course, this doesn't stop its being assigned, much to the consternation of millions of kids (many of whom are more suited to rap videos and other mind-numbing pap). Literature is a capricious thing; you will either learn to love it, and approach it on your own terms, or hate it and ignore it for life.That being said, this is a book I wished I had read years ago. One of the things I am learning to appreciate about Steinbeck is his ability to convey multi-dimensional messages with prose that is the height of simplicity. There is no fat on his literary bones. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is such a book. Themes of friendship, oppression, and duty jockey for position in this simple tale about two itinerant laborers (one a simpleton; the other his caretaker) drifting through California looking for their slice of the American dream. I don't think it is necessary to go into further detail about the story. Many have read it, and those who have not won't benefit from a detailed description. Heck, the book is short enough that any details thrown out in this review might spoil it for the uninitiated.The introduction to the edition I read made one good point (the rest of the introduction was cutesy-wootsy to the point of nausea) that I had not noticed about the book: \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was an attempt by Steinbeck to see if he could craft a novel that closely resembled a play. When read with this in mind the story does resemble a work made for the stage; there are few set pieces in the story, but an enormous amount of dialogue. It is no wonder there are several stage and film versions of this book floating around.Finally, this book is depressing. There is no happy ending here, as death and danger stalk the pages of the story. I would be lying if I said I was not affected by some of the events in the book. I did not burst out crying, but I did feel gloomy and a little cranky after I finished reading. If you are attempting Steinbeck, you will have to visit this little novella at some point."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"All the teachers still make you read this and I am glad they make it affordable."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"While I enjoy huge sprawling novels, the stories I like best are lean and short. Not allowing subplots or extraneous characters to bog down the main story. This is one of those stories.Set in the depression, the novel is the story of George and Lennie. Lennie is &quot;slow&quot; and depends on George to do the right thing. This dependence leads to the grievous, yet inevitable, ending.I don't enjoy this work as much as I could say it is one of the most moving stories I've read. I think this is superior to The Grapes of Wrath. This is a heartbreaking work of staggering genius."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I liked it, but it was kind of sad in a good way though because no matter what George knew that Lennie was going to die so he killed him in a less painfull way.Steinbeck created really good characters because they were so believable that it could of most likely happend in real life, but for younger kids they probably won't get it because it's not in their level of reading, but it is good for young adults because they know it could happen in real life.The social issue that this relates to is definetly racism because everyone treats Lennie bad just because he is different."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Overall, I give this book 3 stars. The recreation of the 1930's in this story, gave me an idea of what it must have been like back than, with the men traveling around going from job to job and how the men would make some money and blow it off at the bars. Steinbeck showed the friction between the whites and blacks. Slavery was, and sometimes is now, a very big issue.Steinbeck described each character in a unique way. He made every character with different personality, individuality, and unique characteristics.This novel is a good book for young adults, I suppose, because this teaches us a new way of reading. We don't just read the book and discuss it, the book makes us read between the lines. The book aslo extends our vocabulary, which comes of good use."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I liked the book, but it was kind of sad in a good way though because no matter what George knew that Lennie was going to die so he killed him in a less painfull way.Steinbeck created really good characthers because they were so believable that it could of most likely been a non-fiction story.

The book takes place in the 1930's with the 2 main characters John and Lennie traveling to a ranch to work, save up money and live their dream. Lennie is a big guy that is a little slow in the mind, and has an obsession with petting soft things. George is a small guy that has known Lennie for a long time and gives him commands for Lennie doesn't know what to do by himself. Much like a Father-son relationship.I usually don't like fiction tales that take place in the past,but I enjoyed this one. The only problem is that the book starts out slow. It gives you clues that keeps you guessing and wondering.For all you readers that consider yourself a slow reader, this is a great book for you. It's exciting and short. Only 107 pages.

From The Oddessy to Moby Dick. Yet do all of us think of Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck? I know that when I say that this is your classic \\"Odd Couple\\", you'll automatically think of humor and comedy. This book however, is the opposite. It's very dramatic and can be a slight tear jerker at times. But by reading this book, you may think it is all too familiar with a flirtatious woman, a terrible boss, a guide, and the newcomers. Yet, it still uses the characters to an advantage. By making the terrible boss meet his match, and though she did get on my nerves the flirtatious woman really made, and added a lot to the story.~Norma"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is definitely now one of my favorite literature novels that I have read in English class. This book was one that I could actually picture in my head and imagine what was really happening in the story. I found myself not wanting to put it down until I finished reading it completely. George and Lenny, otherwise known as John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, were great characters and each perfect for the part that they contributed in the story. These two characters had a remarkable relationship and the way Steinbeck portrayed it told me a lot. They shared good times, bad times, and sad times together, but no matter what, there was still a connection between them. Though I was required to read it I am now very thankful that I did. It was a great novel and I would honestly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good piece of literature."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Horton Foote's adaptation of John Steinbeck's tragic tale about two migrant farmworkers in Depression-era California.

The three men resolve to buy a farm together and escape their down-trodden existence as itinerant laborers.

It had plenty of humor and plenty of good lessons that one can use for the rest of their life. Steinbeck did an excellent job. I recommend this to anyone that wants to enjoy a good book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Undoubtedly one of the finest works to come out of 20th Century America, John Steinbeck's celebrated classic remains one of the best things you'll ever read, period. We all know the story by now: George and the dim-witted but well-meaning Lennie are making their way across the American wasteland in pursuit of a dream. Naturally, things end up taking a wrong turn, with some very tough decisions to be made for almost everyone involved. Steinbeck's story still packs a punch, and the interplay between George and Lennie is arguably some of the best written dialogue between two characters, well, ever. The subtlety of Steinbeck's themes are wonderfully understated, and the final act is one of the most haunting scenes you'll ever read. That being said, if you've never read Of Mice and Men, you have been missing out. There is a reason that this book is revered as much as it is. Of Mice and Men is a masterpiece of classic American literature that everyone should read, and by the time the book gets going, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck was a celebrated american author and nobel laureate. This tale is short but provocative ideally suited for a light read before bedtime.The author's style is simple, in the spirit of Hemingway, and narrative like Faulkner. Interwoven in the story are themes of isolation, racism and euthanasia told in the relations between two drifters, George and the mentally challenged Lennie, looking for farm work.The story is captivating and tragic with an uncanny realism allowing the reader to identify with the characters and their emotional state."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men\\" by novelist John Steinbeck is a realistic story of two grown men Lennie Small and George Milton and their journey to find work and some where to live.

The story takes place during the Great Depression in Salinas, California on a ranch.Lennie is big, forgetful,mentally challenged but over all thar's what makes him so loveable.George on the other hand is the complete opposite of Lennie; he's a small, smart, and speaks his mind so they kind of balance each other out.

This story is about two men named Lennie and George. Lennie's obsession with petting soft things leads both he and George into all sorts of trouble. The setting is mostly on the ranch, where they meet some ranch handlers.I see this book as an adventure, and really fun and sad at times. My favorite thing said in the book was, \\"I wanna tend to the rabbits George.\\" Their dream is to \\"live off the fat of the land,\\" just to have a place of their own, and no boss.

The setting takes place in Salinas, California. I could not picture the story taking place any where else. I enjoyed reading this book because I was never sure about what was going to happen. The two main characters are two men. A short, boney man named George. Along with his friend Lennie. Who was a big, retarted man. George was asked by Lennies Aunt Clara to take care of him when she died. And they've been together ever since. Concidering Lennie is always getting himself and George into trouble, they've been on the run and in search of money.My favorite character in the book was Lennie. He is so sweet and innocent. Even though he gets in to trouble, he dosent mean any harm in anyway. He's just like a big kid. All Lennie wants is to live in George's and his dream farm and tend the rabbits. He always reminds George..\\"And I get to tend the rabbits, right George?\\"I liked this book especially because the author, John Steinbeck made it as if the reader was actually there with George and Lennie the whole time sharing their adventures.

PLEASE READ ITS WONDERFUL!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"As a senior in high school, looking back, Of Mice and Men has always been the book that has stood out to me. It has taught me that not everyone is living what is known as the \\"American Dream\\".The two main characters, Lennie and George show a typical close-nit friendship with hardships, goals and memories. As complete opposites they still have their mind set on the life they've always wanted, a farm with the freedom to enjoy the wealth of their own efforts. Throughout the story you learn to grow and love both of these characters despite the many upsetting situations and consequences.All of the characters in the novel in some way show their need of a companion to satisfy their lonliness and the dreams of a greater life. Steinbeck's beautiful flow and obvious foreshadowing is what keeps a reader intrigued.This book not only has a wonderful plot and storyline, it teaches people of all ages the lessons of life. We will never meet the American Dream no matter what the circumstance is, it is impossible to have the American Dream of pure satisfaction, complete freedom, and the \\"perfect world\\".This book will always remain as my favorite novel, it exemplifies the power of dreams, a desire for companionship, what we want and what we'll never get to have in our own existance. The American Dream is unattainable."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck sympathetically depicts life at the bottom of the working class, where people \\"never seem to give a damn about nobody.\\" Here it's black against white, rich against poor, and every man for himself.

They plan to pool their money and buy a small piece of land with a shack on it \\"an' live off the fatta the lan'.\\" Of course an accident stands in their way.This is a beautifully written book that can be read in a couple hours. One special attraction for me - we just returned from a vacation in California - was the local color from California's agricultural valleys."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book would have to be one of John Steinbeck's best works and rightly deserves the Title of a Masterpiece in Modern Literature. The plot concerns two itinerant farm workers named George and Lenny. George is the protective one and Lenny is the mentally challenged giant of a man.They both find jobs at a farm and dream of owning their own property one day where they will raise crops , breed rabbits and live \\"off the fat of the land\\". Sadly this dream is never realized and Lenny comes to a bad end after accidentally killing a woman. The story itself is sad and perhaps depressing to some people but it is also beautifully written by Steinbeck with nary a word out of place or wasted.He was truly deserving of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962.As an aside it was with great distress that I read that they are actually closing the Libraries in Steinbeck's Home Town of Salinas .This book is a wondrous read and it is a pleasure to discover a Master of his Craft."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I started this book in high school thinking that is was going to be boring, a stereotypical classic. When I finished it, my thoughts about it were totally different. The enthralling story takes place on a dusty California ranch, with a wide variety of characters. Steinbeck uses the most descriptive language I have ever seen an author use. His writing not only describes to you the setting, but it also puts you in it. To show more proof to you kids who think this is still a boring classic, behold: swearing! Steinbeck does not hold back in language; this is to show a large amount of emotions, as well as to give the story a flair.This is the story of two men's friendship, which they hold, despite handicaps and obstacles that block their way. A surprising ending caps off the story as a very, very good book (no wonder all the adults like it). Also, it's a short read: only a little over a hundred pages. Believe me, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I have read a few other Steinbeck novels over the years. Except for the Grapes of Wrath, I have found them too long for the point they are trying to make. Of Mice and Men is much more concise and yet provides a real punch. The punch is not so much in the ending as in the character development. In such a short piece, we have the priviledge of seeing the power of a true friendship that is based on caring and respect. The setting is vivid and intense - much like the country where it takes place. This is an excellent, quick read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George and Lennie, poor wretches traveling the country in search of work, dream of owning their own piece of land, their own piece of liberty. Never having to depend on someone else, never having to listen to what their bosses tell them to do, seems to be their ultimate goal. It all seems unachievable when they start to beg for work on yet another ranch in California. But then suddenly it all seems like a miracle is about to happen. In the face of their final redemption, they cannot help but start to plan their new life. But if they do not watch out, they might get in trouble again. Serious trouble.Like his other works John Steinbeck gives in Of Mice and Men voice to the lonely and deprived people struggling to survive in the American society at the time of the Great Depression. Although the setting of the story is quite sober and the characters do not have a lot of room to develop within the few pages this novella counts, the message is all the more convincing. The strong friendship between two men, linked together by fate, is heart-warming and honest, which contrasts even more with the violence of their surroundings. The controversial conclusion of the book reads almost as an invitation to reflect upon the true values of life.Is this book a historical illustration of the past (Great Depression) or a prophetical vision of the future? Many different opinions can be voiced, but isn't the American Dream still floating through our lives? Maybe our modern world is full of people like George and Lennie?The kind of critique voiced by Steinbeck is not always well received in the land of the Brave and the Free. It is quite sad that even today this book is banned from some schools and public libraries in America."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Much of John Steinbeck's fiction is set in the region where he was born and grew up, Salinas. Published in 1937, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was the previous work before his Pulitzer Winner \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Set in Salinas, the novella is set against the backdrop of Depression-era America. The main characters, Lennie and George, are workers victimized by social and economical conditions of the period.Steinbeck's works always received mixed reviews. He was hailed and the best writer of the 30s and 40s and received a Nobel Prize in 1962, but his critics say that his writings were superficial, sentimental, and overly moralistic. When it comes to \\"Of Mice and Men\\", many say that the narrative suffers from one-dimensional characters besides the extremely deterministic plot - that in the end its lesson turns out to be more important than the characters. Despite all these drawbacks, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is still a minor masterpiece from one of the best North-American writers.The predatory human nature is what feeds the pages of this book. Existentialism is the subtext when the all the characters struggle to survive in a inhospitable environment. Almost every characters admit at one point having had a profound sense of isolation and loneliness .By stating this, the writer proves that being powerful in eventual and dependable. Some characters are stronger than others most of the time, and the strength depends on to whom it is aimed. \\"Of mice and men\\" suggests that the most powerful kind of strength comes from the other's weakness.Another strong point raised by Steinbeck is the impossibility of the American Dream. Every character in the book dreams of a different life. They want the freedom to follow their own desires. The two main characters dream of owning a farm, that would enable them to sustain themselves and would protect them from the inhospitable world.To prove his point, the writer uses many symbols, most of them related to animals, like the mice that Lennie insists to keep. But the animals are always weaker than men. The puppies, for instance, represents the idea that only the stronger survives - in this case men.But in the end, dreams have fallen apart. The characters are different and are supposed to have realized that dreams only exist in another sphere. In the real world there is no place for them. This is the same thematic that Steinbeck would bring in many of his novels, like \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"East of Eden\\". \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a short book and a relatively easy reading, but very rewarding."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book is the best book to read if you want to know the responsiblities a friend has.

The way Steinbeck portrays Lennie and George just sets the mood. Giving Lennie his tremendous size and childish brain and having George as a tiny man with big ideas makes every situation they get into a bigger challenge.

Unlike others, I feel that this book is not too short. In its brevity, Steinbeck has still effectively portrayed the difficulties of the life of ranch hands in the 1930s.The special relationship that Lennie and George share is especially heartwarming, and is the focal point of our compassion. Lennie's childlike innocence is also enduring and when we see how he has unknowingly killed Curly's wife, we cannot help but feel that George's decision to kill him instead of letting him face the wrath of the mob is the right one. That way he will still die preserving his innocence.All in all a deeply moving novel that is both heartwarming yet tough and brutal, like the life of a ranch hand."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"My reportTravelling across America in search of who are now they do it on cycles, in cars, by bus or in time honored tradition of foot and thumb.

Steinbeckdoes a good job of writing this book as he describes people as if they were living their lives at the same level of existence as animals. But, unline the animals, these characters do have their dignity and face life without flinching. They have ideals that separate them from animals and they dream of their promised land, but it's too far away. Indeed, the theme in this book is companionship. The friendship between George & Lennie is close in that George takes it up for his feeble-minded friend and protects him above all, even his own interests. There is a deep sacred bond between these two as if they were brothers. There was great humor in the book as well as its equal share of sadness.

But they're up against some mean odds as Lenny finds his share of trouble...."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I think that this book was one of Steinbeck's better books. But I think that Lennie's character is too childish and stupid. Also, I think that George is pretty cool, but sometimes too over demanding and bossy, to Lennie. For the most part though, I thought it was a good book. I would recommend it to someone who has a special younger or older friend in their life. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it an 8.5.

I think that Steinback does a nice job of writing about how life wasn't only hard for white Americans, but also how life was difficult for African Americans. Racism...you've probably heard the word before, but, unless you've even experienced it, you don't really know what it is...well...John writes about it in this book, and I'm glad he did. Steinbeck describes (not always in a nice manner...if you know what I mean...language)what kind of abuse, both verbally and physically, Crooks (the African American &quot;stable buck&quot;) is put through, and, although it was kind of hard to read sometimes, he wrote about the truth. Racism has been, and still is a major problem in America, and it is still a humungous (don't mind my spelling of that word) Social Issue.Well...all in all, as if I haven't said this enough, I think that author John Steinbeck wrote a good good book, and I encourage you to, at one point or another in your life, pick up this book and read it. It may not involve alot of action, or adventure, or mystery, but, it does involve reality, and it well teach you alot about history.Sincerley Always,Elizabeth H."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of mice and men is written by the nobel prize winner John Steinbeck.

Everyone should read this book at least one time."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a great book that I enjoyed very much. Basically, it is about two friends named George and Lennie who try to live and work in a normal life. George is short, but very intelligent while Lennie is the opposite; he is tall and strong. However Lennie also had a mental disability that severely impacted his and George's goal. Due to the disability, George has to take extra care of Lennie and show him what's right and wrong. The only thing he couldn't stop was Lennie's love of petting soft things, like animals. This was a bad thing because Lennie always accidentally kills anything he pets. This aspect of the disability and the disability in general lead to many difficulties in George's life and many conflicts with the locals. Of Mice and Men is a book filled with suspense and action that will keep the reader flipping through the pages.Despite the magnificence of this novel, it has been banned to due certain reasons that were very controversial. The constant swearing, violence, and the setting of bad moral to others lead to the banning of this novel. The swearing starts as early as page 3. \\"He [George] said angrily,\\" ... 'Jes' a little stretch down the highway... God damn near four miles... Didn't wanta stop at the ranch gate, that's what. Too God damn lazy to pull up.\\"\\" On this page, notice how the word \\"God damn\\" was used repeatedly. This word is especially offensive to people who love and respect God, such as devote Christians. The violence that occurs in Of Mice and Men also got it banned. The killing of many innocent animals due to Lennie's love of petting soft things is a good example. Using the theme of weakness of the human mind, Steinbeck sets a morally bad example for other people. Steinbeck sends a message to the reader saying anything (and I mean ANYTHING) in the world that gets in the way of living a nice, normal life should be eliminated.Speaking of worlds, Of Mice and Men is both positive and negative to the literary world. It's negative because it sends the reader the bad message that was previously stated above. On the other hand, the novel is positive to the literary world because it clearly depicts how hard life is when living with a mentally retarded person that must be monitored constantly. The reader can actually feel the frustration and anger inside of him/her as he/she reads about Lennie doing something stupid again. I know I did when I read about Lennie continuing to pet a rat that he has already killed. A lot of respect and recognition should go to the people who have to deal with people such as Lennie. Also, the novel is positive to the literary world because it's a dang good book. Don't be fooled by the minute size of the book, it's definitely well worth the time to read. :)"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The imagery, character development and simplicity of this story create a powerful mental picture of lonliness and the need for everyone to belong.

George is the brains and Lenny the strength, they were an awsome duo. I believe that this book deserves 4 stars, i read it in high school and have read it once more the now that i am older and when u read it a second time you are able to relate to the story. This book teaches important lessons in life; it teaches the reader that there are many decisions in life you have to make and some may be harder then others. The choices you make that might effect your life, like the relationship between Lenny and George, two opposite men but have chosen to travel and live together. Life with a friend that is different from you can become intresting and probably effect your choices. You look at the choices you make in a hole new view, seeing the reality of life through choices. The outcome of this story ends on a choice that George makes that will probably effect his life forever."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read the novel Of Mice and Men, which was recommended to me by my cousin. He told me the book wasn't that long and the story was really nice. So I went to the library and checked it out. When I first started to read the book it seemed kind of boring because the two main characters where just talking back and forth, but after the first two chapters I couldn't put the book down. It was a wonderful book and I had a great time reading it. While I was reading this book it made me think about me and my friends and what friendship really is.Of Mice and Men is a story about a relationship between two friends who travel around California, working on farms. Lennie is a big, giant, strong man with the mind of a small child traveling with George, a short, smart guy who not only looks after himself but also has to look after his job and take care of his mentally retarded friend, Lennie. George is like Lennie's older brother who watches out for him all the time. Lennie does unintelligent things like carry around dead mouse in this pocket and George always yells at Lennie and gets mad at him yet, George can't go on with his life without Lennie. They travel together working hard on farms and saving up money so their dream can come true. All they want is a place of their own with chicken, rabbits, horses, and other farm animals. On their way to their dream they stop at a farm to make some money where things go wrong because Lennie likes to touch, pet, and hold on to soft things. Their dream is ruined because of Lennie's habit. Lennie likes to touch all things that are soft, and I mean all things that are soft, even a woman's soft pretty dress, or her soft silky hair, which gets Lennie killed by his best friend. George decides that he can no longer protect Lennie from the horrible things that he hadn't intended to do. This was a really hard decision for George but he knew the outcome was going to be the best for both him and Lennie.Of Mice and Men takes you through life changing events, problems, and dreams of two poor laborers who just want a place of their own, which is just like many people in the world. Many families and friends work together so their dreams can come true. This book also made think of friendship and how we treat our friends and others in the world who are different, and less intelligent then us. People treat others bad, and put them down just because they are different. Even though the ending of this novel seems sad, and heart breaking, I think George did the right thing; he didn't want his friend to live the hard harsh life, in this unkind world. After reading this book, it made me realize that John Steinbeck is a wonderful author and I loved his writing style. It simple, easy to understand, relates to life, teaches you something and leaves you with something to think about. I am a person who doesn't like to read much but when I am assigned to read for a class I tend to find books that interest me. In the future I plan to read this book again and I also want read more of John Steinbeck's novels."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I thought that this book was great. When I first opened the book and read the first page, I thought that I was in for a boring book. I being the type that hates adventures, thought that the book was well written. The book starts off with a discription of a place that is by a lake and is surrounded with bushes. As I continued to read I began to like the characters. One being smart and the other being incredibly stupid. As the story goes on many events happen that make you continue to read. John Steinbeck keeps you intersested throughout the entire story. You must read this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Let me make a declaration: John Steinbeck was a genius and a brilliant writer; however, with &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; he simply fell short. Although it was extremely well-written in Steinbeck's signature simple style, the novel was just too brief for the plot resolve itself. The resolution seemed forced and rushed. Despite this, Steinbeck did fit in an amazing amount of character development in just over one-hundred pages. I would recommend &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; over &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot; I would also strongly urge readers to shy away from &quot;The Red Pony&quot; and &quot;The Pearl,&quot; also by John Steinbeck. READ &quot;THE GRAPES OF WRATH&quot; INSTEAD!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book is one of the best books i have read. John Ernst Steinbeck must have been very proud of his book. This book charts the story of two itinerant farm labourers, named George &amp; Lennie. The way this book is constructed is excellent, and a guideline for any aspiring writer. The characters in this book are trapped in unfair circumstances, but still manage to remain heroic and sympathetic (if defeated). As they do this, they also manage to keep a sort of quiet dignity about themselves. It is an amazing study of lonliness and discrimination, and how this discrimination leads to lonliness for some of the characters. A true American classic."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I instantly fell in love with the book within the first ten pages. The characters that Steinbeck created were so vivid that they appeared to be real to the reader. It was easy to identify with George's anger and frustration at Lennie for getting the two of them fired from every job they had ever had. Even though Lennie could not control his actions, it was pure human nature to become angry or feel somewhat burdened by this aloof companion. If one is looking for an uplifting book, this should definitely not be their first choice. It was depressing to look into the bleak lives of these characters living in a barren desert-like ranch with hopes and aspirations that were never expected to come true. George even admitted on page 92, \\"I think I knowed from the very first. I think I knowed we'd never do her.\\" This was in reference to them buying a farm of their own in the future. The only thing George and Lennie ever wanted was their own property that would give them the complete freedom they always dreamt of. With other farmers always telling them that it would never happen on top of George's own doubt, it was clear that their whole life would be spent doing meaningless work which would never amount to anything. Yet, the power of friendship in this novel makes it all the worthwhile to read. Even if a tear or two is shed at the end."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was magnificent. I started it knowing how it would end, yet I was still close to tears when I put down this wonderful book.

I really like all the surprizes that the book has to offer. This book was really easy reading but it has so much to offer. The meaning within this book goea so much deeper and I really think that you need to read the book more than once to fully catch and understand everything."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This bookreview is about four stars for me. It was an unexpected story and Steinbeck works well in surprising the human mind. I ive it a four for &quot;shockingly catching &amp; daring.&quot;The characters Steinbeck created all had diffrent personalities. When the men shot Cany's dog, all they cared about was getting sleep. Candy, on the other hand, was very sad. I thought in the olden days, men don't get sad, I thought they were confident, showed off teir strength and angry. Having Candy in the story turns my point of view on the olden days.The message I think Steinbeck is trying to send out to us is that the world is not what you think it is. There is always the unexpected to keep the mind still in learning. As an author, I think Steinbeck is trying to say that you can write whatever comes to mind because your story can still be heard."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck himself thought this book was most likely his worst workings.The story line is quite intresting and humorous from time to time.Though its plagued with wordiness and underdeveloped characters.The over all message of the book is excellent and is portrayed as such."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is honestly one of the best books I have ever read in my life. There are some sad moments and some kind of sick moments but that is what makes this book so great. There are all kinds of characters that are portraid perfect.

One of which is George Milton, a farm hand who accepts the day labor and who has assumed the responsibility of taking care of his simple-minded friend Lenny. The other is Lennie Small, a large retarded man who has the mind of a child and who loves to pet soft and pretty things. Some other characters include Slim, a sympathetic a man who understands and comforts George when Lennie is killed, and Curley, a small, cocky, arrogant man who is the son of the boss. The setting of this book is in farm areas with few or little towns and vast areas of land surrounding the people that live there. I thought this book was quite interesting and a real page-turner. The book kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what Lennie would do next. I was in shocked to read some of the things Lennie did. Overall I suggest this book for anybody who likes a good book. George had heard of some harvesting jobs that are available on a nearby farm, so George and Lennie decided to walk there. They planned to camp out for the night and be at work the next morning. During the evening George was forced to take a dead mouse out of Lennie's hand because Lennie like to pet soft things. George then reminded Lennie of the trouble he had caused in the other town when Lennie tried to pet a little girl's dress.

All of the characters, are, in extreme situations, where the only salvation is work, and dream.

Not only is it short and brief (only 100 something pages), but it is very insightful and thought-provoking. It is hard to place it in a genre, since it very sad, but also sometimes funny. So i guess I'll just say it's a good book. It does not have the kind of storyline I would actually pick to read, but after reading it I learned how much I really enjoyed it. It's really good to occupy time on a long plane/car ride since of its size, and also pretty fast-paced, so you can stay interested. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read this book because I somehow missed it in high school. At first I was unsure of the language, but it turned out to be a brilliant use of the vernacular. The things I keep thinking about are these: The attitude that the men have toward animals is very similar to theirs toward women. These are objects of function that can be replaced. The irony is that they recognize themselves as dispensable animals of labor to the land owners, and still regard animals and women and black people so poorly. This is an ingenius illustration of the mechanisms of oppression."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I thought it was good that steinbeck kept it short and interesting insead of streaching it out into 500 pages or something.

The main characters, George and Lennie are ranch workers, traveling throughout California and living wherever they can find work. Although they are long-time friends, the two men are very different: George is a small, intelligent man, while Lennie is big and mentally challenged. However, they share a common dream: to own a house and &quot;live off the fat of the land.&quot; They do not wish to wander from place to place their whole lives. Lennie, with his knack of getting into trouble, seems to make this dream impossible for both of them. Finally, they hit upon yet another California ranch and meet an old man with a similar hope to buy a home. This man also has a bit of money stored away. The three men work together, all making money to go towards the same goal: purchasing their dream home. Just when everything seems to be going their way, the inevitable happens. Blundering Lennie gets into trouble yet again. Only this time it is serious. Although I won't give away the shocking conclusion of this novel, I will say this: Of Mice and Men is a great book. It is terse, simple, and still so meaningful. The 90 pages of this book really fly by. Read this wonderful classic!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"It saddens me that \`Of Mice and Men' was the second most frequently banned book in the American public school curriculum of the 1990's. While people have objected to the language, it reflects the times and the circumstances of the characters (and is better than most of what we might hear in our modern world). While the ending is horrific, the motivation behind George's action continues the theme of brotherly love and respect that has been present throughout the novel. This is a short but challenging read and prompts questions about relationships, dreams, and our attitude to life and the taking of it. \`Of Mice and Men' confirms Steinbeck's reputation as a great writer and in no way should this novel be banned."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. It was almost as though I could relate to the events of the story even though I had never experienced anything like it in my life. John Steinbeck did an excellent job in grasping the elements that went along with this time as well as telling the story. Once I arrived at the middle of the book I just could not put it down. Yet at one point I really wanted to due to content but still I couldn't. This book is definitely in the top five best books I have ever read. In my opinion the way Lennie was described and acted in the book was how someone like him actually would in real life. This book was compelling and showed how in some relationships you have to do things for the better even though you know in a way it is not the best thing. It is a great book for young adults because although it is fairly deep and deals with some hard times you really learn something about life and when you are done it really gets you thinking. This was an awesome book and when I look at what it has achieved it is no surprise to me why! I really like how Steinbeck focused on one portion of these men's lives instead of their whole lives. In a way the book almost skips to the &quot;good part&quot;. I enjoy reading when it is interesting and in a way to the point which was what this book was and my own personal preference. This book also shows how much times have changed since when it was written and it shows younger people of what used to be and mabye even what some of their grandparents might have lived through. This was an overall spetacular book with excellent clarity. I would reccommend it to anyone especially young adults. It provides insight most people would otherwise not have!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a very powerful book about friendship.

That dream comes to a sudden halt though when once again Lennie gets himself into some serious trouble. George, realizing that Lennie can not function in society brings the book to a very powerful close.John Steinbeck does an excellent job telling this story utilizing characterization. Readers meet a great many characters. We get to know each one very well, especially Gorge and Lennie. Steinbeck gives readers insight into how the characters think so that we understand why they do the things they do, such as why Slim acts so tough all the time and why Lennie can not keep himself out of trouble. By the end of the book readers know the characters so well that we can understand why they have to do the things they do."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I like the book because of how they put it. Of how they made the people look, what I mean by that is they way thay made George look like a big brother to Lennie, and they made Lennie like a baby learning how to walk, it was weird the way they made this big person look like a little baby. Also the reason I like the book to was because of the way Lennie died I know it sounds weird what I'm saying but what I mean by that is that instead of dumb people killing Lennie his so called brother killed. I also think that Lennie would have wanted it that way. Because he totally looked up to him."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"My thoughts are this book can be less foul language also even readers whom to like this book not to get much facts down in your mind.

Several readers such as the ones from Kingston, Ontario, and London, England, describe this book as boring. These same kids would find The Old Man and The Sea, or To Kill a Mockingbird boring. A young reader from North Carolina suggested that Of Mice and Men be renamed, Retard on a Ranch. Perhaps the title of his summary should be renamed, Retard from North Carolina. I'm certain that these kids resented being pulled away from their video games, and MTV, and being forced to read. I suggest that they stick to reviewing something they can understand such as comic books, and leave classic works such as Of Mice and Men to serious readers."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"i was looking for short and easy book to read for a school report and i was looking in the libary and i found this one. it was short, big letters, and easy to understand language. it was such a great novel that i read it in two days, which was good. it is such a easy novel to understand, making it good for high school students to read, making it a favorite among my classmates. friends asked me what would be a good fast novel to read and is understandable, he used it and was very glad that i referred him to it. i recommend this novel to anybody especially teenagers. thanks for writing such a good book steinbeck. justin blake"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Does this book really need explaining"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck presents so many kinds of different people with the same emotional setback: lonliness.

The story is about two Americans. The thoughts and actions of the two southerners are made open for the reader to enjoy and judge.The favorite character in the book is Lenny. He came out in the story as and was innocent person with a mental defect. It reminded me somehow of the hero in Disciples of Fortune. The amazing thing about this book is that not a lot of books are based on such unique characters. Another attractive aspect of Lenny is his physical strength and hardworking nature. Yet, despite his meek nature, he was dangerous in the sense that he even killed a woman out of fear.Steinbeck successfully created a philosophical twist to life through this story by bringing to life strong but vulnerable characters that we all can relate to."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Lenny and George are friends who travel together, looking for work during the Great Depression in America.

I wasn't bothered by the fact that it was school reading because I already liked to read, but this book simply didn't resonate for me as it did for others. I suppose you have to have a certain literary taste to find this book to be totally profound. Oh well."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I'm not sure that this story even needs a synopsis, as it is so well known. However, for the sake of completeness I will attempt to provide such. George and Lennie are drifters moving from job to job in an attempt to save enough money to buy their own piece of land. Men on of their sort were common enough during the Great Depression, and much of the novel is based off Steinbeck's own experiences as a bindlestiff in the 1920s. Lennie was simple-minded and relied almost completely upon George. It was this very simpleness that had them constantly moving from town to town, and ranch to ranch. And in the end it was this simpleness that would destroy their plans, just as they were about to come to fruition.I've been told time and time again that I needed to read this novella, that it was powerful and moving. I really felt sorry for Lennie and though I didn't like George, I respected him for taking care of his friend. Perhaps my favorite character was Candy, the one-handed cripple they meet at their last job. Yet I wasn't moved by it in the way that I expected. Perhaps my expectations were just too high or perhaps I just needed more as at just over 100 pages, this was a very short book.The novel was very simply written, which I think suited the characters and the setting. I believe that it was Faulkner who said that you wouldn't need a dictionary to read Steinbeck, and I don't know that I've ever heard a more accurate description, though I don't think that it's necessarily as insulting as Faulkner intended it to be. A book doesn't have to be populated with words and techniques that no one else understands to be good, though I admit to rather enjoying that sort of literary novel. Steinbeck relied more on the truth and reality of his subjects to stand the test of time, and they have."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"very pleased with the service and a great book. i had to read it for english many years ago and I fell in love with the story."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men, John SteinbeckJohn Steinbeck was born in California and studied literature and writing. He worked as a laborer and journalist, and wrote novels and short stories. He is best known for \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". He won a Nobel Prize in 1962 and died in 1968. This 1937 novella, like his other books in the 1930s, dealt with the lives of workers in agriculture. It is the story of George Milton and Lennie Small, two workers who travel to farms as seasonal workers. The first of these unnumbered chapters describe their characters. George is small, thin, and quick. Lennie is big and dumb and controlled by George to keep him out of trouble. The next chapter tells about the ranch that hires them, and the conditions there. One hired hand just quit. An old man talks about the owner's son Curley and his wife. The other workers are described.Slim talks to George about Lennie, a powerful worker. Hardly any of the migrant workers travel together. The others speak about conditions. Should Candy shoot his dog because its old and weak? Carlsson offers to do it. [A worker could own a pistol then.] The conversations tell about their lives. George dreams of owning his own ranch and working for himself. Candy offers to buy in to become their partner; he doesn't want to end up in the poor house. Curley attacks Lennie until Lennie ends the fight. Was there an accident? Saturday night most of the men go into town. Lennie talks to Crooks, the stable hand. Then to Candy. Curley's wife wanders in, and threatens them. The fifth chapter tells of Lennie's problem: he loves small animals to death. Curley's wife visits to talk. She too has dreams of a better life. Lennie begins to stroke her hair, she objects, and Lennie puts his other hand over her face. Did Lennie do a bad thing again? Candy find her on the ground. They will notify the police and hunt for Lennie.The last chapter has the ending. Lennie dreams of Aunt Clara and a giant rabbit. Both blame him. George finds him, and they talk of their hoped-for future. There is a pistol shot. Slim says George had to do it; and they walk away for a drink. [No mention of what happened once the police investigated. I suspect this death would be covered up to avoid publicity. Just another crazy tramp?] This short story provides the background of migrant workers. They can only own what they can carry on their back. They travel from farm to farm to help with the harvest. Was Steinbeck advocating death for the old, the feeble-minded, and social misfits? Michael Crichton's \\"State of Fear\\" explains this in \\"Appendix I\\". The 1939 movie was often shown on TV in the 1950s and 1960s. Compare it to the original novel."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"THIS BOOK WAS A CLASSIC, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE A REALLY LONG BOOK TO MAKE A GOOD BOOK THAT STICKS AROUND.

The two of them move together in order to avoid the loneliness and misery that usually accompanies nomads. Lennie is an incredibly strong and hard worker who has a mind of a child. Unfortunately for him, his strength and child-like instincts oftentimes get him in trouble. George has known Lennie since he was just a kid, and is the brains behind this unlikely duo. George dreams of a bigger life for the two of them, a life where they would settle on a small farm of their own. The questions remain, however, of how will they acquire enough money to purchase such a place and if they will be able to do so without getting into any really big trouble on account of Lennie's unpredictable behavior.This is perhaps the most poignant and well developed of Steinbeck's short novels. The characters are some of the most memorable ones in all of the twentieth century literature, and are masterfully developed and vivid. The narrative is as compact and tight as they come. Steinbeck is nothing short of a pure genius when it comes to constructing stories: each element, each sentence has its place and serves the overall purpose. This novella is a textbook example of what good storytelling is all about and will be enjoyed by both Steinbeck's fans as well as those who are new to his writings."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I downloaded this for my brother.

None of today's politically correct stuff, just a rationalistic style good book.Many modern TV themes have been taken from this book including a lot of Loony Toons cartoons.Steinbeck s George and Lennie theme is the basis for much of modern day juxtaposition ."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book was the best book I ever read and I do not read a lotI think you will like it a lotIt was my favorite book ever"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I debated about whether to write a review of Of Mice and Men - after all, it's been reviewed and dissected about 7 gajillion times, right? But then I got to thinking - if I hadn't read it because I was a little scared of reading Steinbeck, maybe others feel the same?Required reading wasn't big in Australian schools when I was a teenager, and if there was a required reading it was almost always an Australian author (Nevil Shute for example), so it's a slightly sad state of affairs that I was 30 years old before I read my first Steinbeck. I'm not a fan of 'classics' as it goes - I always thought if I read one I'd have to say lots of really meaningful, intellectual-type things about it. So I'm just going to say exactly what I thought - no delving into themes, discussions or dissections.Of Mice and Men evokes perfectly the era, the characters and the lives of roving farm workers - the writing is lyrical yet simplistic and the dialogue is liberally peppered with accent, which makes it all the more realistic.The story itself is short and simple in the telling - two friends bound by circumstance and loyalty, in a situation that is never going to end well. George is a down-to-earth kinda guy, and empathizing with Lennie is easy - after all, a gentle giant would never hurt anyone, right?There's nothing to be scared about here - it's a simple, quick story that's rich with atmosphere and characterisation. My only criticism is that it is a little too short - I wanted more!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Never required to read this book in school. Now, in my mid 50's have finally read it.

If it's tough to write a phenomenal novel, this novel \`reduction,' all the components reduced to their most basic and delicious levels, is surely a reading piece de resistance. The prose is effortlessly brilliant, the characters and their relationships works of art, particularly Lenny and George, the main characters. The descriptions of settings and the way they're used to set mood are mental beacons of clarity and brightness. The use of foreshadowing, SOMETHING bad is going to happen, causes a most compelling tension in the reader. In particular, the relationship of George and Lenny, which follows the unstated male rules about explaining or defining relationships between men, needs not an iota more from Steinbeck to be manifestly candid. Beauty, grace, pleasure, and awe in just over a hundred pages; I am grateful, indeed, to the young man who recommended it to me."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This novel surpassed all my expectations. It was assigned as summer reading and I'm so happy that it was.

It will make you reconsider your values and judgements."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"If you love Steinbeck, this is the must read of his collection.

They go to a new ranch for a job but they find that there are still complications. The Boss's son, Curley, wants to fight Lennie, and his wife is a tramp. Lennie ends up killing Curly's wife and George ends up killing Lennie. I enjoyed the story because there were a lot of twists and the story went by very fast. I recommend this book for children in middle school and high school because it has content that might not be suitable for children who are below."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men was a really good novel. The author did a great job. I think the author's purpose for writing this book was to point out that even though you love someone so much, when they do something wrong it is still wrong. You just have to make the decision. I agree with this message because it can pertain to anyone. From friends, to family and relationships, this message is understandable and in people's lives more than you know it. I think the literary elements the author handles best are the characterization, and the conflict of man vs. man. The characters in the novel are so real and dramatic. The authorhas a great point-of-view, which is in 3rd person. By using a narrator, you can see everyone's thoughts, feelings, and perspectives on the situation throughout the novel. The genre chosen for this novel, to me, was drama. it is a very good genre because you want to know what is going to happen next. this book was like i said, really good, but it wasn't perfect. There were too many curse words and so much criticism that it was just kind of mean. Lenny and George are the main characters but I think the author should've explained the relationship between them better. He should have also pointed out George's point-of-view on the \\"sticky\\" situation a little more. Overall, this novel is great and everyone should get the chance to read it. For those reasons I give it 4 stars. Hey, it's a book to read and not forget, but too much reality for perfection."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men were one of the most inspiring and touching books I have ever read. The meaning of this book was lonliness. I can definitely relate to the theme of this book because of my everyday life.The character of Lenny Smalls was my favorite. He was innocent in the sense that he was mentally challenged. This made the book even more interesting because not a lot of books are based on such unique people. What also attracted me to Lenny was the fact that he was a very big but hard working man. The authour compares him to a bear. And this is interesting to me because not all sick people are as healthy as Lenny was described. However, according to John Steinback Lenny was dangerous to mankind. He was dangerous because of his powerful strength that kills a woman as told in the book.I give this book five stars because these are actual situations that happen in real life. This book made a big difference in my life.I was able to feel the pain of being lonely from the characters of this book. It helped me to see the different reactions of the way the different people handle this lonliness."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The best-laid schemes o'mice and men often go awry, and leave us nought but grief and pain, for promised joy!\\" John Steinbeck Author Of Mice and Men used this quote as an Allusion to his book where it foreshadows events that have yet to occur.According to the quote what it mean is you set yourself up to let yourself down. In the book Of Mice and Men two characters George and Lennie have a plan to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. Therefore both characters get a land job where their dreams just scrambles in a matter of weeks. Lennie actions led their dreams to be destroyed it was when they arrived to their new job and at the time one of the workers dog just had given birth to puppies. In which Lennie asked George permission to have one of the puppies and George said yes. Within a few weeks the dog died and was witness by the boss son's wife in which she was killed at the site. Seconds after the incident Lennie headed back to where George told him to go just in case he got into any trouble, which he did, at the end. As a result George headed to the site and killed Lennie before the men got a hold of him. In all both men are in screach of identity and in my point of view each character of this book are lonely in which they have trouble finding themselves."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Most of the people I have met, usually read this in highschool.

When Lennie ruined their opportunity for jobs at Weed, the both of them had to flee far away to a near by town to find new jobs.

The short novel features two runaways who find a job on a northern California farm bucking barley. The simple plot entrances the reader who is trying to figure out how it will finish.Steinbeck creates two grown men who contrast almost entirely. First there's George, a short, squat, shart middle-aged man who has a sort of leader type personality. Enter Lennie, a giant of a man who has some sort of mental disease that renders him a &quot;dumb dumb.&quot; The two seem to create a famous mobster par, with George as the headman and Lennie as his big sidekick/bodyguard.The two men were forced to leave their previous jobs and residence because of a mistake on Lennie's part. The two soon find a job on a farm along with a supporting cast of interesting characters whose personalities are exquisitly described by Steinbeck. George and Lennie are forced to scrimp and save their money from their bare minimum jobs in hopes of someday fulfilling their dream of buying a farm of their own.Capitalizing on Lennie's mind, Steinbeck reates an out-of-the-blue plot twist at the end that reflects Steinbeck's book writing brilliance. This book never slows down, earning a grade of: Must Read"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men captures a part of American History, though not long in our past, still mostly forgotten. The Depression forced millions of people to loose their jobs, their homes, and in many instances their identities. The Dust Bowl, which spurred this Great Depression, also forced many people to emmigrate to other parts of the country, and search for employment.For our main character, George and Lenny, they too have been deeply affected by the dust bowl, and along with countless others, are searching for employment, as well as the right piece of land where they might finally settle and live. The only problem is, that they can never stay in one place long enough to find that piece of land. Lenny, who is mentally retarded, keeps getting into trouble, and George always has to bail him out; the result of which leads them both to make a run for it until they come upon a new place of employment.Their final destination, and the most promising for George and Lenny turns out to be their worst. Up until they enter upon this ranch, Lenny has had a fixation and obsession with stroking &quot;pretty&quot; animals, many of which have been mice. Inadvertantly he has killed them all; breaking their necks as they struggled to free themselves from Lenny's grip. Lenny's innocence does not allow him to understand why the animals have tried to flee. In his anger and confussion he squeezes them harder so they cannot escape.Killing animals is one thing. But when Lenny inadvertantly kills Curly's wife, George finally realizes that Lenny cannot be controlled. Knowing what Curly and the other men will do to Lenny, George resolves to beat them to it, in a more humane manner.&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is more than just a story of friendship. It is a psychological drama which plays out in our minds as we read deeper into the story. And to see it played out, I recommend the early movie version with Burgess Merideth as George, and Lon Chaney Jr. as Lenny."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Mysteries and horrors and love stories OH MY.

But this friendship is an example which shows that in some relationships you have to do things for the better, even though you know that it is not the best thing; George, who realizes that Lennie cannot be part of a society, brings the book to a very powerful close through his surprising and unexpected action.I recommend this touching, insightful and thought-provoking novel to be read when there is spare time, since once started, it won&iexcl;t be easy to put down."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and men is a book that I first raed for literature at as an obligation, but after I've gone through the first part with a &quot;long&quot; description of the setting, I really started to enjoy it. When you go through the story, John Steinbeck applies his unique tecnique to descrive the characters in a very vivid way, basing the story on a couple of intinerant workers, one of them mentallty retarded, fact that was going to kill him in a near future. The story touches as main themes, reflected in mostly all characters; desolation, discrimination, dreams in common, lonliness and violence (in various aspects). As a matter of fact, this makes a very moving story that can be enjoy by young people such as adults."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a book about two men who have a dream to buy a small home. They think they are different from other men. The two men in this book are George and Lennie. George is small, tough, and handles everything that goes on between him and Lennie. Lennie is big, strong, and not very smart. Most of the time George has to tell Lennie what to do. After Lennie gets in trouble at Weed, he and George have to hide before they can go to there next job. I really liked this book a lot. I thought the whole book was interesting. I would have never expected the book to end like it did."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is old school writing, writing from before the days of the bloated bestsellers. When writers wrote books instead of Hollywood enticements for screenplays.Lenny carries forth on the strength of a dream, a dream whose destruction is wrought by his own physical strength. George is something of a Depression era Jesus; giving hope and life to Lenny and later, destroying that life; performing an act of sacrifice and love by taking Lenny's suffering upon himself and setting Lenny free.Steinbeck tells a story without employing a \\"cast of thousands,\\" without relying upon exotic locations and eccentric characters for denouement, without gratuitous violence, prolific profanity and sizzling sex scenes. Steinbeck gives you character. Character driven by Hunger and Hope (George and Lenny), character personifying meanness (Curly) and Loneliness (Curly's wife). Steinbeck wrote a simple story that is character driven and plot maintained and scarcely over one hundred pages long. A knockout."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was the best book I have ever read and I hope to read more of his work in the future. I have heard of this book several times and we just finished reading it in my English class. John Steinbeck just described everything in the book from the setting to the hallucinations at the end. We watched the movie that was released in 1992 with John Malkovich and other stars and it was almost exactly like it. It almost seemed like I knew what part of the story it was on. Even though the movie was much different at the end, I really like the book better than the movie. The book gave me a better look at what was going on thanks to the imagination of John Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"What more do you want? its a simple paper back book, looks good, decent enough cover, what else? its a book"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"After reading this book in high school, I feel in love with this book.

The story line never goes out of style. Glad we purchased our own copy."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" features two migrant farm workers during the Great Depression in California.The book is about dreams. George and Lennie just want a piece of land to call their own, and they believe in this dream strongly enough that other characters start to buy in too. A place for soft things; a place for independence; a place for respect; a place to live in peace. This is tied in very strongly to socioeconomic status, age, and race, and the issues that it brings up about the American dream are as relevant today as they were then.The language was interesting. It is apparent that the novel was written many decades ago, and there are a bunch of turns of phrase that I had never heard before (but could guess at, for the most part).I liked the structure. One character was disagreeable and one character was mean, but there wasn't really an antagonist. It really was a good description of the best laid plans of mice and men going awry. I like this style because a lot of the injustices that happen today aren't the result of one villain's wrongdoing, but rather a system that makes people poor and hungry and where people don't understand one another. For a short book, Steinbeck does a very good job of creating empathy with the different characters such that the reader can understand their wrongdoing and still appreciate them as a person.Something that I learned: in the US, you can't execute mentally handicapped citizens for their crimes, but the Supreme Court left it up to states that practice the death penalty how to interpret that. Apparently, Texas' standard is that someone is exempt from the death penalty if they are as intelligent as Lennie Small [...]. Horrifying."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I am an avid reader of many different types of books. I have about 300 books on my kindle reader now and have had it for about two years.

Great story and a great story teller."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This story talks about Migrant Workers. It is set in the Great Depression, Lennie and George are best friends. They always travel around together looking for a job. Lennie is a huge man, but he has his mind like a little child. George is small. He is the one that puts things in order and makes decisions. They are together because they don't want to fell lonely and they wish to have their own house. In this story the characters have funny names about their appearances. For example: Lennie Small is ironic because he is a huge man (big) and strong, and symbolic because his mind is like a kid (small). When Lennie and George are in Weed, Lennie has some problems so they run from Weed and go to another job. In their new job they live in a bunkhouse. Everybody was looking at their relationship. In the new job they meet a lot of people. That is when the struggle begins. George prevents Lennie from having a conflict with some workers. But in some moments Lennie doesn't have George and he cannot guard Lennie from the provocations of a flirtatious woman. The woman doesn't have a name in the story. Probably you can find out why she doesn't have a name?This is good story. The most important knowledge that you learn from this story is the differences between loneliness and friendship. I thought that at the end something would happen, but I was surprised because other things happened. Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a true story about how people lived in the 1929 - 1930's. I give 5 stars to this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I hadn't read any Steinbeck in years, none as an adult, and had never read &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;.

I really hadn't heard anything about what any of the eighth graders thought about this book, but I, a seventh-grader, decided I would try it out because there were always a lot of people who picked this book for their projects. I later learned that they chose it because it was short, but this is entirely the wrong reason. It is a beautiful story that will bring tears to your eyes. It is about two men who have a dream that everyone says will never come true. It is also about their bond so tight that George doesn't ever leave his friend even though it would probably cause him a lot less worry and trouble. It is a truly beautiful theme which only Steinbeck can explain so well. This book is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck really outdid himself this time. Of Mice and Men was a fantastic novel. It really gets the point of true friendship across to the reader. At first, I really didn't think that I would enjoy the story. It started out with them just talking back and forth. There were a few humorous sections. But because of the conflicts and pressures that the characters faced, such as Lenny getting in trouble, the novel really started to grow on me. George and Lenny are migrant farmers that have a dream. Their dream was to own a farm. On the way to their place of business on another farm, comical things happen. I thought that it was amusing how George always yells at Lenny for doing stupid things, like carry around the dead mouse in his coat pocket. Yet George, even though he gets mad at Lenny, couldn't go on in life without him. I also feel sorry for Lenny because of his slow mind. He loves everything in the world, especially nature. But even though he cares for them, his victims would still get harmed unintentionally. I can relate to Lenny and his actions because I'm sometimes too rough with precious things, but because of these feelings of love that Lenny showed, conflicts came up which caused George to make a difficult decision. A decision that really affects his life. Situations may arise that might put friendships in danger, but sometimes the outcome is for the best. For the rest of the people in the world, read this book. If you care, and have a love for a strong friendship, I'm sure you will enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"It made my heart pulpitate and my tongue quiver in anticipation"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Never have a seen a book of friendship, companionship, love, turmoil, and heartbreak so brilliantly played out as in this incredible Steinbeck gem. These two young, brave men meander the sandy roads of California, escaping the peak of the dust bowl and searching for a job to pay for the trek from town to town. If something permanent, or even longer than a three day stint seems like a gift from the creator that Must be followed through. However, the massive and slightly askewed Lenny brings what seems to be a promising position to a terminal life sentence. Lenny vividly captures 13 year olds and strategically roofies the poor symbols of innocence until unconscious sex is the only option. Then, Lenny uses these absent bodies to suicide bomb the largest areas of tourism in Northern California. The highways, traffic jams, public beaches, and Chinatowns soon become victims of terrible attack. Lastly, in closing the story, Lenny orders and attack on a large naval base of the coast of Hawaii, Pearl Harbor.

I felt like I didn't get as much out of the book, because we had to make it last over three weeks time (one chapter between class periods) and then answer some lame discussion questions about nothing that really mattered. I can debate and analyze a book, but only when I'm finished with it. Not to mention that everyone else in my group spoiled the ending, so it was all I could do not to find out the ending until I actually got there!I'm not sure if I'm a fan of Steinbeck's writing. Perhaps it's because of how conservative I am, so I had to do a lot of censoring (as I read near everything aloud, especially when I have to analyze and remember things) during my reading. My teacher got my hopes up, saying it was a heartbreaking story with an incredibly sad ending, but by chapter five of six, I wasn't sure where the sadness was supposed to come in. The last chapter only was about six pages, so the ending itself felt rushed, and because of that, didn't feel very sad at all, which let me down immensely.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Confusing, yet satisfying, \\"Of Mice And Men\\" by John Steinbeck offers some depressing surprises. The story revolves around George, a small, well-defined man, and Lennie, a large, mentally retarded man. Together, they run from authorities from ranch to ranch with a quest for a ranch of their own. The theme of this slightly disturbing novel was lonliness. Two other themes of this novel was violence and dreams. Even though it may seem like George doesn't care about Lennie when he verbally abuses him but he really does. Two conficts in the novel are Lennie's petting problem and George's inner problems. Lennie constantly finds trouble and his angelic mind wont let him see why. George can't really help him out of it though, he taught him all he knows.

This book is a social drama filled with moral conflict that tests societal attitudes and the barriers society establishes between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The American dream, so easily attained by some, will never be achieved by most, and the rules lived by are sometimes broken for reasons society does not accept (evident in the ending).The plot is very simple, two unlikely misfits become friends, George who dreams of a place to call his own and Lennie, a powerful simple minded giant, subject to delusions. Lennie is like a child and George assumes responsibility for him as they travel doing migrant work. In the course of their travels, they meet representative members of society, those accepted and those not and although Lennie and George try to mind their own business, Lennie commits a terrible 'crime' and George must 'help' his child like friend the only way he knows how.I don't want to give away the details, but the story ends in a moral dilema. Powerful book for literary discussions, social lessons as well as moral discussion---and wonderful to read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In just over 100 pages, John Steinbeck gives readers a story rich in characterization and deep in meaning. Of Mice and Men chronicals the experience of two drifting farm hands struggling to survive during the Great Depression of the 1930's. Lenny and George dream of owning their own farm, but George, a sweet, simpleminded giant, inadvertantly keeps them from recognizing their dream.Steinbeck gives us a picture of the life of the poor during this difficult era and comments on friendship, racism, labor conditions, and the role of the mentally ill in 1930's society. The story is written is a simple, accessible style, but close reading reveals the story's multiple levels of meaning and strong detail. The characters act realistically and seem like they could be people you know. Although issues have changed since the Great Depression, the ideas Steinbeck presents remain relevant and meaningful even today. (Perhaps that's why this book is a classic? Ha. :) )Of Mice and Men is a moving account of two men who do what they can to get by. Steinbeck manages to capture the tragedy of the Depression, and the book's tones reflect this. Though not a book to read when you are already depressed, the novel is perfect for a relaxing winter evening in front of the fireplace and easy to finish in a single sitting. A person could ponder the ideas presented long after finishing the story. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book is about two guys, George and Lennie, traveling through California to get a job on a farm. Their plan is only prevented by Lennie's mentally retardation, which runs them into a lot of trouble.This book differs from other books, read in class, not only by the colloquial English, but also by the story in itself.Most of all I like the way Lennie is described in the book although there are certain passages in which the description becomes untrustworthy. Some of his statements don't fit to his behavior and the other way around. In my view the ending is not chosen very well.

I honestly hated coming to the end of this tale."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Deep down the story carries an important message about dreams and their fulfillment. The story revolves around George and Lennie, two immigrant workers, who believe that someday they will not be working for someone else, but would have their own ranch. The characters of George and Lennie are strikingly different yet they seem to be complementing each other. While, George is depicted to be an energetic man, Lennie is mentally retarted. George is shown to be very protective of Lennie. Steinbeck, very nicely depicts that the protection accorded to Lennie is not act of altruism, but instead, in a way it is a selfish act, an act that makes George feel that he is important and someone is dependent on him.The other characters also carry their story far beyond what is explicitly written about them. Crook's situation highlight a strange sense of numbness and indifference to emotions and feeling, apparently a consequence of oppression of a black American those days. Candy, the old man represents how a man clings to hope and future in both physical and meta-physical sense of the world. With his dog been shot dead, Candy is shattered only to be rejuvenated by the thought that one day he would be sharing the dream of independence with George and Lennie. Curley's wife, the nemesis of Lennie and the dreams of George and (now) Candy is a woman who carries a strong sense of deprevation. Like George and Lennie, she also had a dream, a dream of becoming an actress, which just passed her by. Her life was an empty hope, which reflects in her acts in the story.Steinbeck's descriptive style is par excellence.

The characters in this book have very deep meaning and detail that can only be uncovered by actually analyzing it. This book may seem very boring if you read it from cover to cover without stopping to think about the time period, the characters, and the setting. I would recommend this book for someone who likes to read about things that were made in the past because it refers to many things of the 1930's.

Not necessarily because I don't find American authors and classic American novels to be good, but not too many really intrigue me. This is the first novel I've read by John Steinbeck, who pretty much exemplifies the American south in a way that very few authors have done with such humor, honesty, brevity, and sadness. For such a slim novel---it's less than 106 pages, and I pretty much read the novel in one evening--- it brings such an impact that makes you feel touched, moved, and even heartbroken. The main characters, George and the dumbwitted Lennie, are to me one of the most loveable and unforgettable characters in American literature. I am not going to go on about the plot since many reviewers probably have already. I just have to say that this book is quite a memorable tale about two men who have a bond that's meaningful but quite tragic. I would assume that this isn't Steinbeck's BEST work, but if you want to start off on his light pieces of work, I'd recommend Of Mice and Men.

Since the Great Depression influences all parts of society, economy and the everday life circumstances are quite difficult for them.Firstly you have to mention that Steinbeck seems to be crazy about details. The very beginning of each chapter is decribed up to the smallest thing consequently the reader gets a good impression where the action takes place. Otherwise his description sometimes seem to be exaggerated and a special background knowlegde is necessary to understand his hidden evidences. Anyways the language Steinbeck's character use is quite pleasant to read if you like American English. Due to this language the character seem to be pretty realistic furthermore it gives the reader a good opportunity to get along with the story in general. Moreover Steinbeck created a lot of different characters, with a lot of different attiudes in addition to that a lot of trouble makes the reader turn to the next page and go on with reading. This mentioned trouble also leads to the end when George kills his best friend Lennie who is retarded. By the way this act compromises also an ethic question. Was this an act of euthanasia or just a cold blooded murder?Make your own impression and read the book but do not expect too much action otherwise you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"A wonderful story of two friends who fight with struggles, but in the end know what is best for each other.

Lennie's ends up touching her hair and doesn't let go, this causes him to break her neck and kill her. Because of this, everyone is after and wants to kill Lennie. At the very end, George kills Lennie.I would definitely recommend this book. It has a lot of action in, and always leaves you in suspense, wondering what is going to happen next.

I had fun reading of Mice and Men with the characters George and Lennie. I understand their personality by knowing their backgrounds.

Some people think the book was overwhelming because they liked it so much. Besides, I learned many more things about the book while I was reading it. To conclude, I recommend that I should give the book a five stars because its really fun and understanding to read.I understand that Of Mice and Men was the author of John Steinbeck. He is the American author who writes differnt kind of books about good and evil. Somehow, he created the book himself by working hard successfully. He even won many awards because of his novel and creativeness. However, he makes lots of money to improve his skills of writing. Also, Steinbeck was born in Salinas Valley where he works hard even more. He is the legend author who writes books among others.I think that John Steinbeck is a great author because he works really hard every freakin day.

For example Lennie has been in a fight with curley; George told him to fight back and so he did which, led Lennie to breaking Curley's hand.Even though the ending is sad, George and Lennie friendship can insipires everyone because they look out for each other.Even though Lennie is a big and huge he is a kind person.This is an excellent book written by John Steinbeck with a sad ending. Through out the pages you can see how much George cares about Lennie. I enjoyed reading this book and it has inspired me to have stronger friendship with my friends. Therefore I would like to recommend this book to those whom are interested in reading books about friendships."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I think the book was an ok book to read if it is for sfa, and you have to read it in a certain amout of time. It is very short and i think it was to easy to read for an 8th grader. It had a lot of swears in it so you can say them out loud in class and you wont get in troble. I think the worst part in the book is when Lennnie dies. I thought Lennie was funny and he did not desevre to die. And i also did not like how the book ended so soon."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I liked the book \\"Of Mice and Men\\".

In the story there are two hobo's named Lennie(retarted) and George(sane). They have a dream of living off the fat of the land. They go arould the country looking for jobs to get a little bit of money for some support. They end up at a ranch working with alot of guys their age and enjoying the stay, but not for long. Lennie has been getting george in trouble all of his life, and now was not any different. In the end Lennie kills Curly's wife and George has to kill him. In the end, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head, with Carlson's gun. I would recomend this book to everyone who likes funny, but depressing books, John Steinbeck is a very good writer."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a wonderfully honest document of how life was like during the depression. Also it showed the inner side of the life of a hobo and a retarded man. In this story both Lennie and George have to run from their past due to Lennies obsession with soft things. In their last residence Lennie had tried to pet a woman's dress and she had reported it as rape. They find a ranch to work at but there is trouble on the first day. The men are friendly except for Curly, the Boss's son. His wife is a tramp who gets all the men in trouble and Curly is not the understanding sort. In the end Curly's wife lets Lennie pet her hair but when she trys to make him stop he grips her and accidentaly breaks her neck. He runs away but George finds him and has to kill him himself. I would not recoomend this story for anyone under 13 years of age, due to the dialouge used and some of the content. This was an honest book and I deeply respect John Stienback."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of mice and men by john stienbeck tells the story of two men in california who during the great depresssion became hobos and went from farm to farm.

Throughout the story Lennie talks about tending the rabbits and livin of the fatta of the lan.

The two friends are going to find work so they could get enough money to live their dream of living off the fat of the land. Even though this dream seems like impossibility, it is the thing that keeps them going. I enjoyed this book because it is not boring like a lot of middle school books assigned to read, their are some good ideas in the book and the trouble Lennie, the retarded man, gets into because he has a tendency to pet furry things.

After that lennie is on the run and george goes after him.At the end of the book george kills lennie by shooting him in the back of the head.I would recomend this book to mature young adults and anyone else.

This was my first Steinbeck novel, and I thought it was great"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This books is on most reading lists, and it is easy to understand why. Beyond merely a 'classic,' the book stands next to 1984 as literature that remains good reading long after it was written. The language is modern, the symbolism deep, and the story short but compelling.I've read Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, a book I did not enjoy very much. If you have enjoyed one of his previous books, regardless of the experience, I suggest picking up this book. If you haven't read his other works, I strongly suggest picking this one up first."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This may be the most rambly review here, but what I can say that I enjoyed this story. The title is borrowed from Robert Burns' most famous poem \\"To A Mouse\\", and has been alluded to so often in modern culture that it has completely become its own cliche. However, the novel uses this title for a good reason as it tells a story of two people, Lennie and George, who like the poem find that their hopes and dreams will never be realized due to their unforeseen but inevitable future reality. It is very much ahead of its time in depicting laborers at the absolute end of their rope, basically blowing through jobs so much so that they are stuck forever in neutral. If you think about it each character has his own crutch that stunts any growth and which makes each day feel the same, reminding me of Brick's literal crutch later depicted in \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\". For example George's crutch is Lenny, a man he so understands and yet so abhors that he goes into each job knowing Lenny's Tourette's like tics and tendencies to clutch things too hard will likely lead to early termination or worse, yet still knows that having Lenny around definitely beats being a nomad alone. Old Man Candy's crutch is old age, as he is someone whom is so disfigured and far gone that even the ownership of his dog is relinquished from him. After you think long and hard about each character, you understand why Steinbeck makes frequent references to animals, because symbolically that IS what all the main characters are to a large extent.The depth of the characters are all fantastic for such a short story, which is amazing when you consider that there are only six chapters and six jumps of scenery/time. In many ways I think that is why a short story like this is more marketable as a book to teach in school than \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" which tells a more sweeping epic about a famous epoch in history. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is easy to imagine, easy to understand contextually, and most importantly deep enough to require speculation about the true underpinnings of the dialogue and the behavior displayed. The dream that Lennie and George had of living of the land was to them almost like a daily vitamin that would get them through it. It would help Lenny believe in a better life, and it would help George feel better about himself for at least offering Lenny moments of peace dreaming about rabbits. I guess I'm different in that I feel that George made up this story and never believes in it ever, ever, EVER coming to fruition until old Candy eavesdrops and offers monetary backing to the dream. George almost uses the story to manipulate Lennie to stay with him and trust him, and in that way I see more ambivalence in his character than most.Of course it is a tragedy, as Lennie relapses thrice (Curley's hand, Slim's pup, and Curley's wife) into what I can only describe as aggressive acts of non-malice. It seems that things that he likes he cares dearly for, he clutches too hard and in order to quiet down their pain from George he increases his vice grips to disfigure what he touches. After his last fatal encounter with Curly's sad wife, Lennie knows he did something wrong again and hides in the spot George tells him to, and has hallucinatory dreams condemning himself for negligence. Luckily he finds George and they both have a deja vu type moment of blissful ignorance before George does what is expected of him, which is to kill him for killing Curley's wife.I guess Steinbeck's main point is to tell us to loook closer before making judgments on a person's character. If given a more isolated point of view, Lennie's character is vulgar and reprehensible. However, his behavior is a result not of personality but of psychological and mental retardation. Much like Candy's dog, who is innocently shot, Lennie is innocently shot because during the time period was a lot less acceptability to the mentally unstable. There simply wasn't enough of an objective back in the '30s to look deeper the inner thinkings of the retarded and regard acts of aggression as more than simple malice. George understands this, which is partly why he is morose all the time in defending Lennie. I also believe that Steinbeck makes sure to give George and Lennie a backstory to prove that George's intentions were mainly good, and that at the end George was giving Lennie as much mercy as possible without turning himself in as a murderer's accomplice. Very interesting for as little pages as it was."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This action packed book was filled with laughs, and tears. George Milton and Lennie Smalls are best friends.

There are so many more uplifting works of fiction out there for our young people to read or hear."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"One of the first things I noticed while reading Of Mice and Men was a sense of comfort on the part of the narration; the descriptions and character development seemed so natural that the sense of realism was undeniable. Although there is much that Steinbeck keeps to himself in terms of his main characters, I found Lennie and George to be well-rounded and honest - simple men trying to keep their heads above their water as they pursue (to different degrees) what qualified as \\"the good life\\" for two migratory farm hands.Much to my surprise, I had no real emotional response to the novel. I tend to be a very emotive reader, and more often than not will respond passionately to what I read. However, Steinbeck has left me feeling completely neutral; I was not particularly invested in the characters or events of the book, and found the conclusion neither satisfying nor disappointing. In the end I'm willing to consider this neutrality a positive result of the trial - I didn't hate the book, so I'm more open to reading something along the lives of Travels with Charlie, but I also didn't love it, so I doubt I'll be tackling The Grapes of Wrath anytime soon."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is a great book, especially if you actually understand the symbolism.

I had through it been a good book because how George took care of Lennie. Lennie parents had both pass away. So his aunt had taken care of him and so she had asked George if he could take care of Lennie because is was going as well. George and Lennie had gone out to go and work at a farm so that they could have money because they could get a farm. George is a small dude and quick and dark. George is a smart guy that took care of Lennie. Lennie is a big guys that is slow and always said thing over and over again. George and Lennie was train hopping so they could go to a next town and look for a job. Once they got to the weed and they had ask the bus driver if they could catch a ride when him out to the farm called buck barley. There was a guy there that named Curley and he had always tries to pick a fight with Lennie because he was the biggies dude and Curley was the smallest dude. Lennie wanted a puppy from slim dog-named lulus. So Slim had gave him one of the pups and George had told him to leave it with the mother because it would be sick and die if you don't leave it with the mother. Lennie tries to bring it in the bunkhouse where everyone sleeps. George had told him to go and put the puppy back because it well get sick. Curley's wife had came into the bunkhouse and tries to ask the guys if they saw Curley around.

Soon, their friendship is tested, as Lenny's naive iniquities impede George's ambitious plans of &quot;living off the fat of the land&quot;.

Steinbeck is a genius."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of mice and men was an astounding novel that was worth reading. Of mice and men was a very touching novel with two main characters named George and Lennie. George would probably be considered the brains of the outfit and who is the shield that protects Lennie from trouble. Lennie on the other hand is the bronze, he is extra strong but has a deformity in the mind. Both have a goal in mind, which is to save enough money in order to purchase their own farm. This is where they both try to find decent jobs where it requires brains and bronze so that George can keep an eye on Lennie. They get many jobs but the majority of them do not go as well as they hoped for. But towards the end they find a pretty nice job with a very nice lady who is wed to a hot-tempered guy named Curley. Well Curley's wife does do a lot of metaphoric phrases in the novel, such as comparing the the whole country to mutts just basically states the direction in which curley's wife addresses the inhabitants of the entire country. The job that was with Burley and his wife should have paid for the farm if Lennie had not done what he had done. For this Lennie gets into trouble when George is not looking after him and Lennie does something extremely disastrous. What happens in the end though is a very touching scene but I will leave that for you to read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I found the Book &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; very interesting. After looking at the relationship between Lennie Small and George Milton, it made me think about the friends I have. In todays society we mentally, verbally, and emotionally hurt the feelings of many mentally or physically impared people. But in this novella, George looks over his very close friend Lennie who has a mental illness. George and Lennie have been together for a long time, but Lennie is always causing troubles. I feel that George is just like many of us. He forgets that Lennie has a mental illness and can't take full responsability for his actions. I feel that the language was very descriptive because it was at a level that most everyone can understand unlike a lot of books. I feel that some parts of the book could have had a little more excitement but for the most part it was a great book. I would recommend that everyone read this book. It shows how people who are slow or have mental abilities feel and act to certian situations."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Imagine lying in the grass with your head facing the stars, a stream trickling by. You can hear the stream seem to lull you in, and you feel the pleasures of a hot, crackling fire, being managed by someone else. Sounds perfect, right? Well, for George, in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, it is anything but perfect. George is taking care of a man named Lennie, who is mentally ill, and dangerous at that. After grabbing a girl and not letting go, Lennie, under George's strict supervision, is helped to flee. They find a job at a farm in the country, and things are going well- at least, that's how it seems. This book combines distinguished writing with a remarkable plot, summing up to a great, touching ending.At the beginning of each chapter Steinbeck describes the setting of the chapter. This technique is fine for some, but bad for others. This style forces the reader who isn't interested yet to read about the place that is being described. If Steinbeck waited a while to explain these things, readers would really be interested in what they were reading (whereas in the beginning of the chapter this isn't so). However, some people disagree and like to have lots of description so they know exactly what they're reading about. A perfect example is the beginning of the second chapter. After explaining the setting of this room in great detail, Steinbeck pauses. Then he goes on to say, &quot;The door opened and a tall, stoop-shouldered old man came in. He was dressed in blue jeans and he carried a big push-broom in his left hand. Behind him came George, and behind George, Lennie.&quot;But after the beginning of each chapter, description dwindles to a perfect amount. The book really flows with dialogue and description combined. The dialogue is used in such a critical way, and Steinbeck really took advantage of the fact that he could express whatever he wanted through dialogue. This writing style also makes the readers able to suspect things, rather than to be told things. Readers are left to figure it out for themselves, making it more believable as well. At the end of the book, it is hard to understand what is happening until you read the dialogue that followed the action. This was a great aspect of the book.Another clever thing Steinbeck established in the beginning of the book was a theme of a farm with rabbits, in which George and Lennie are to live off the fatta the lan'. It is shown very clearly (also through dialogue) that this is Lennie's dream, what he lives for. It also gives the reader hope, which makes people want to continue reading- they want to find out if this dream or wish ever happens. It is a sign of a good author that he can convey emotions so strongly. One of the most touching books, Of Mice and Men stands out. Steinbeck was gutsy in his choices as a writer, and because of that, the ending doesn't make the reader necessarily feel sad, the reader feels moved. Something Steinbeck does a good job of is making readers change their mind so many times about what they think of Lennie, and if they feel sorry for George, admire George, hope Lennie dies for George's sake... the list goes on.This was one of the best classic novels. It is a good book to read if you're looking for something that can draw you in in a short time, and it is hard to put down once you start. Of Mice and Men is definitely a classic worth reading- and re-reading. It is amazing that Steinbeck was able to write this story with such a compellng writing style, gripping plot, and high level of emotion in so few pages."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"It was a good book and I enjoyed reading it.

Never has there been written a more precious piece of tragic literature that seems so far away from the classic form of tragedy in its noble form, but surpasses its noble cousins by its down-to-earth credibility and realistic plot and setting. This is a tragedy that lives here and now, its language is fitting and almost poetic in its vulgarity and its humane simplicity. Whoever finds this language inadequate closes his eyes before the truth of reality. And he has difficulty in recognizing a simple human being and his basically tragic situation. George is a real tragic hero, who dwarfs Antigone and Oedipus because he is a simple human being and a real man. I will read this novel again and again."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In the book Of Mice And Men Steinbeck uses a language that a common person would. I say this because he does not use many fancy words to try to make his book seem like a better book. He also tells about how life can sometimes be mean and hateful like the many times George gets mad at Lenny because he is slow and can not remember things too well. Steinbeck also writes about how life was for two guys during the great depression, and how people had to travle from place to place looking for work. He also writes in this book about how guys would save their money up and go into town on the weekend. Personally I like this book because he tells how life was during the time of the great depression."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men was an assigned reading in my class.

George and Lennie are two &quot;itinerant workers&quot;, but not as the rest, they have one to look after the other. A very important fact of the book is that Lennie is mentaly retarded and George looks after him. He changes to a parental-figure when he calls Lennie's atention &quot;Give it here&quot;. They arrive to a &quot;ranch&quot; where they start meeting people, such as Curly, he is the son of the boss and is really angry with Lennie, maybe because he is larger and stronger. Lennie could't measure his strength and because of this he kills inocent animals such as the little pub. He shared a dream with George, this one was: having a little ranch and rabbits Lennie was going &quot;to pet them&quot;. But they couldn't make this dream come true because a horrible thing happend, Lennie killed Curly's wife. She wanted to show him that her hair was fine so she &quot;took Lennie's hand and put it on her head&quot;. As he couldn't control himself he stroked it to hard. The ending is really impresing and in some way sad. But why did George do that? Please read this book, if not you will be sorry about it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book is about two guys going from field to field for jobs. George is a small man that protects Lennie. Lennie is a very big man with the mind of a child. The story takes place on a field in California. I disliked the book because to me it was stipid. George is always yelling at Lennie and telling him what to do. Then what George does to Lennie at the end is sad and mean. you would need to read the book yourself to make a decision on it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's novel \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a great book to read for anyone who wants to read a book that won't take hours to read.The setting is in the Salinas Valley in the 1930's. The main characters, Lennie and George, are running from the ranch they had previously worked on. They must now find another job to work at. They do find a job on another ranch and everything is going great, but when Lennie, a man without many brains, kills the bosses wife, everything goes terribly wrong. The two workers who are saving up their money to buy some land of their own, must now find jobs elsewhere. In their trek to find another job George decides that Lennie and his temper are becoming too much of a hassle to their plans, and he must kill George in order to live a somewhat normal life.The book is somewhat difficult to follow, but in the end all of the pieces that were unknown come together to form a complete story line.The plot of the book was very interesting. It was an adventurous, yet it was still suspenseful. Steinbeck had the character's perfect for the setting in the ranches of the Salinas Valley. Lennie and George were both portrayed as migrant workers and they were on a mission to save up money and buy a ranch of their own.The overall quality of the book is tremendous. It has plot twists and things that nobody would expect to happen that happen regularly. It is very much a mysterious ending and until I read that George shot Lennie I was convinced that they were going to get away with both of the murders that happened at the two different ranches. Although it was a great book, it shouldn't be read by young children because of the fowl language. Jason Hegstrom"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I thought this book was overrated and disappointing. The plot was undeveloped and lacking and the characters were not lifelike. the ending was abrupt and silly. Overall the book was a major disappointment and not worth my hard earned money."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Today, Lennie and GeorgeOf Mice and Men (Steinbeck Centennial Edition)would be occupying Wall Street. Two drifters wandering about, looking for work and hoping for more than sheer survival. They perform odd jobs for pitiful wages and get fired whenever Lennie gets into trouble.Lennie is a buffoon. Big, strong, and sweet--he loves animals and follows George around devotedly. We do not know why George originally began taking care of Lennie, only that he cares for him more than anyone else in the world. George is constantly frustrated by Lennie's forgetfulness. When Lennie gets in trouble, George must try talking his way out of it.It would be easy to give away too much Of Mice and Men's plot. A short novel that can be read in a single sitting,Of Mice and Men (Steinbeck Centennial Edition)is infinitely simpler thanThe Grapes of WrathorEast of Eden. While read the former in school, the latter two are avoided for length and time. To all those who read it years ago, Mice and Men goes down quite nicely as an adult."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Book is in very good shape.

Lennie ends up killing the bosses' sons' wife which leads to an unforgettable twist that will shock you. I really enjoyed the book. The only thing I didn't like was there were a few boring parts that described the scenery but there's a reason for that. this book if for young adults because of the Aurthors writting style.

But there will be several obstacles to avoid such as Curley,the boss' son, and his wife sho has an eye for the men on the farm. I liked the book because it showed the struggle that George was going through with all the troubles with his friend Lennie. The author really elaborates the two characters and makes it seem that you get to know them. This is a really good book and I recommend it to the high school students. Because of the content of the book I don't recommend it for the yougher ages. But don't be misled, this book is still excellent and I recommend it. This book may not be very long but such a good book doesn't need to be with the adventure this one packs."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The story oif Mice and Men is a good book because there is never really a dull moment.

The novel, Of Mice and Men was assigned to us about 3 weeks ago. I never would have picked up this book if Mrs. Pearson had not required us to do so. I thought the book was touching and emotionally moving. When I finished reading it, I felt like I had lost a friend. Steinbeck created very likable and realistic characters. I also think I have grown after reading Of Mice and Men. I realized how love can hurt and relationships can be on more than one level. George would rather kill Lennie out of love than watch him suffer and live with no freedom. To me, that is true love and companionship with another human being."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men could possibly be the most extrordinary piece of literature that I have ever read. John Steinbeck chooses perfectly fitting words when he is describing actions and settings. He paints a a very detailed picture that successfully informs the reader of all the events pertaining to the story. Steinbeck's writing pulls emotions out of his characters. By doing this, he provokes strong feelings from the reader.**note** Some events in this book may be considered emotionally disturbing and I would strongly recommend anyone with any kind of emotional controversy not to read this book!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck captures the sensitive relationship of two close men very well. His portrayel of both men leave space to form your own opinion. Steinbeck's works are not so pulled tightly together that you can't take time to figure out the story, but he does like to mess around with words, which makes his writing so interesting! A perfect piece for any articulate reader!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"As I read other's reviews, it gave me the chills as I saw how badly others had interpreted Steinbeck's sensitive and yet descriptive writing. They thought the ending was terrible because they only saw the literal meaning, not the secondary meaning behind it's symbolism. To call this book boring is to call the bible unholy. You will be gripped by the unexplained phrases and sentences left to your own thoughts and feelings for interpretation, and though it is a novella, you will find you read it slowly to get the meanings. I loved this book and my only complaint was that I wish it were longer."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I liked this book, Of Mice and Men, more than any book I've read in a while. This book was a fast paced easy to understand book that was great for a person like me who doesn't like books all that much.

I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read or hates to read, I don't think that it matters. Anyway fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I gave this book 5 stars because I thought it was excellent. I think the key (well, one of the keys) to a great novel is memorable characters. I guarantee you will never forget George and Lennie, they have survived through history (you know all those cartoons with a large, bumbly character saying &quot;Duh, George?&quot; to a smaller, smarter character?) But I digress. The point I want to make is that I respect other people's reviews, no matter how many/little stars there may be. But the only condition is that their points have to be well thought-out, and have clear reasons why they did or didn't appreciate the book. I cannot stand to see people putting one star and then making a comment such as &quot;It sucked&quot; or &quot;Don't read it&quot;. Now I wouldn't mind it at all if they had given mature reasons for disliking it. The point is, put a little oomph behind your opinions :-)"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This story is very depressive, but interesting as well because in my oppinion it offers two inportant views about the reality of poor people during depression time in the U.S.A. .

All the chacters in the book are very simple people living a simple life as much as possible in that time frame. The main plot in the story is about a man who is a little different from everyone else, and he is trying to fit in. He finds out when trying to fit in he does some things that aren't really the right things to do. The poor man is a little different than the others and was just trying to get along with everyone and others didn't want to except him.The theme of the story is that some people are different. That means that people should think about that and give others chances to fit in. Readers find the theme in this book to be important because this is a real life situation that almost everyone will have to face and, most of the time, people react in the way they shouldn't. The theme is demonstrated throughout the book, and it is simple to understand how people react when they are not in their normal situation."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George and Lennie are the two main charcters, in this novel. They portray the lives of everyone in that time.Steinbeck has kept a lot of adjectives describing how the sorroundings were calm and peaceful, but then desturbed by the arrival og George and Lennie into the novel. There is also alot of authority in this novel, mainly signalised by 'spurs'. The boss, Curley and Slim wear spurs that shows they have a higher status than the rest. Curley uses violence throughout the novel, trying to prove himself to the rest,as it seems he is a little insecure, almost, although he is the boss' son. Slim is a nice guy who earns the respect of others not through violence but through the simple fact of him being a nice and thoughtful guy, he also seems a more brain - using person, unlike Curley who uses his fist. Steinbeck has kept two characters that were thought to be outsiders in that time, Curley's wife(who was not good or important enough to be given a name or identity,and Crooks. Curley's wife is a woman, and in that time women were thought to be of lower importance compared to men! Crooks is a black man, he is also thought as less important, Crooks is a nice guy who craves for companionship, but only gets racism (except fro Lennie). All the main characters hold on to a dream of one day owning a farm, of the own. This was the dream of many men in those days. This is certainly one of the most touching novel I have read. A novel about two friends who try to survive, in a time where who you are does not matter. It came a shock to me how steinbeck ended the novel. But it was a powerful novel, which should be understood."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"A well written book with an original plot, and a book that displays the importance of friendship and doing what needs to be done.

So powerful and affecting, it is a crime that some schools keep the book from teenagers who would undoubtedly find the story hugely important and compelling.

George would look after Lennie and keep him out of trouble. People weren't to social with lennie because of his mental disorder, they thought he was stupid, and caused troubles.

I came close to tears a couple of times. Steinbeck made a career of lovingly and vividly describing both animals and people in pathetic circumstances.The story is really moving. Sinise's array of voices is both deep and broad.

Above all I think the story was great."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I have read \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck; a great and interesting story. This story takes place in Salinas, California. The setting includes a dusty ranch with a broken-down farm, bunk house along with an array of characters who are very different in their own way but somehow have to cohabitate with each other in order to survive on the ranch. The time period that this story took place was in the 1930's during the Great Depression. The two main characters introduced in this novel were Lennie Small and George Milton. George is a very small man and smart but Lennie is big and retarded. The main idea \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is two men on continuous adventures to seek jobs and new lives and to fulfill their dream.Lennie was the type of person who loves rabbits and soft things which starts alot of conflicts. Whenever Lennie would get in trouble, George would try to get Lennie out of trouble and in the story, Lennie seem to start many problems. On page 8, \\"that mouse ain't fresh, Lennie; and besides you've broke it pettin' it\\". (Says George talking about Lennie killing the mouse) (Steinbeck page 8). I would recommend this novel to 8th graders or above because this novel contains alot of profanity and I feel that 8th graders and above can be very mature. I feel that if you read \\"Of Mice and Men\\", you can visualize of how life was like in the Great Depression. I love this book and I believe that you will love it too!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" was first published in 1937 and has been adapted for the stage and screen. It's set in mid-1930s California and opens beside the Salinas river, a few miles outside Soledad. The book focuses on Lennie and George, a pair of migrant workers who earn a living on the state's farms. George is the dominant character of the pair, as Lennie isn't quite capable of looking after himself properly. Although big and strong, he has a poor memory, panics easily and doesn't always understand what's happening around him. All he wants out of life is to have his own farm with George, look after some rabbits and \\"live of the fatta the lan'\\". As the book opens, the pair are on their way to a new job; they had to leave their previous job and go on the run after Lennie was (falsely) accused to rape. Things don't go smoothly for the pair when they arrive at their new place of work. It's clear that the farm owner's son, Curley, and his wife are going to be the source of a great deal of trouble.\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a very short book - a great deal shorter and much easier than I'd expected. I had a great deal of sympathy for Lennie, who was based on a real person : in an ideal world, he shouldn't have been leading the life he was living. Similarly, I think George was placed in an impossible position at the end of the book - though I couldn't help but wonder how George himself saw things. As I was reading the book's climax, I couldn't help but think of something Candy had said to George earlier in the book, regarding his dog.I'd definitely recommend this book, particularly the Penguin Classics edition if you can get your hands on it. Susan Shillinglaw's introduction for this edition really set things in context for me. However, I wouldn't necessarily recommend reading the introduction first - it does contain a couple of spoilers."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"a book that made me put tear stains on the book.About a big stupid man and a quick sharp-witted guy,looking for a good, happy way to live.Both have ambitions for a farm, except it keeps on slipping away from their grasp.It's great, but I gave it 4 stars.I have a feeling that about 1 out of 3rd of the book are details explaining the world around them.Goes veeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrry slow."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"By far, one of the best books ever written. I felt as if I was in the book taking part of the adventure. John Steinbeck has made it clear that he is among the elite writers in the margin between William Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe.The feeling you get is indescribable when you read this book. The story of when George and Lennie will have their own land, and Lennie could finally raise rabbits - just gives you your own sense of liberty.Please, if you are sensitive and/or depressed, be aware. This book is great, but very depressing."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\"In this story there are two very good friends, George and Lennie. They are on a journey for a better life. Lennie is mentally ill so George teaches him right from wrong on the way. They are leaving a little town and going to another town in search of a better job. Several of Lennie's habits get then fired from their last job so they hope that they will have better luck in the next one. Lennie makes quite a few mistakes but no matter what George manages to over look them until Lennie makes a very big mistake which leads to a SHOCKING ending."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"First published in 1937, this masterpiece of the Twentieth Century still resonates strongly today. The book is ostensibly the story of two men's friendship, but the themes which Steinbeck explores extend much further than is normal for a book of only one hundred or so pages. Hope, fear, love, justice, and friendship are all touched upon by Steinbeck's flowing prose. In addition, Steinbeck touches upon subjects which still impact on modern society to this day; racism and sexism. The book is also interesting for its representation of agricultural life in 1930s California.The story offers the reader a fly on the wall's perspective as the two main protagonists, George and Lennie, take up their new jobs on a ranch in California's Salinas Valley. George is small and quick-witted, while Lennie is large and simple-minded. George tries his best to look after Lennie and to keep him out of harm's way and Lennie rewards him with loyalty. In the end though, George is unsuccessful in his attempts at helping Lennie avoid trouble and Steinbeck leaves it up to the reader to consider the consequences of this failure.In 'Of Mice and Men' Steinbeck experiments with a genre of his own creation; the play / novelette. With this knowledge in mind, the book takes on a different aspect and the descriptions and dialogues appear to have been written with the stage in mind. This is just one example of how Steinbeck's mastery of literature becomes apparent upon reading this book.This book deserves to be read; for Steinbeck's hard-hitting prose and his use of realistic dialogue, and also for his classic exploration of what friendship means."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"+++++This novella, by Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck (1902 to 1968), was first published in the world when it was in the grips of the Great (Economic) Depression (that began in 1929 and lasted through most of the 1930s).This dark tale presents a human world that contains jealousy, cruelty, loneliness, rootlessness, poverty, and shattered dreams. It is a parable about two men, George and Lennie, striving for a better life; who long for self respect, independence, freedom, and work that they enjoy.Lennie is a mentally deficient but a big, strong man who has a childlike innocence and is fascinated with soft things. George, who travels with him, is his protector. The only thing that they have is each other. George explains: \\"I got you to look after me and you got me to look after you.\\"Their dream? To own their own place and \\"to live off the fatta the lan'.\\" However, their plan to reach this dream does not work out. The title of this short novel gives this away. It's from a phrase in a famous poet's 1785 poem: \\"The best laid schemes o' mice and men [often go awry].\\"I felt that this novel was so balanced and thoughtful in structure that it's a work of art. However, others may feel that this makes the book predictable.The entire novel contains little narration. Instead Steinbeck relies on the words and actions of the characters (in which there are seven major ones). In fact, on examination, I found for each chapter (there are six untitled ones) that most pages (after an initial description of the setting) contain all dialogue with short introductory phrases.This novella is filled with the words of migrant workers and ranch workers of that time period. Examples include: bindle, cat house, swamper, jailbait, booby hatch, Jackson fork, and jack-pin. It is not necessary to know the meaning of these words to follow the story but for the curious, I recommend keeping a dictionary nearby.Finally, there is a 1992 movie of the same name that is based on this novel starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.In conclusion, we all have a dream. This book effectively illustrates how life and fate can alter that dream!!(first published 1937; 6 chapters; main narrative 105 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Ahhh, literature, that type of thing that is good and great but then is forced to be read in a high school classroom and thus ruins it for everybody...No, indeed, this book is really great. What I find most compelling about it is that Steinbeck has not only a great understanding of who his characters are, he has a lot of sympathy for all of them, even the unsympathetic ones like Curley and his wife. All told, this is a loving, caring shoutout to those lost individuals who found themselves in the era with no real property and no real future, which back then did not make them men.I reread this recently after several years, remembering I had read it in high school, and I must say I enjoyed it much more the second time around, being able to just immerse in the story and allow Steinbeck's rich imagery to flow without picking it apart. Hopefully more people use this approach, because it deserves at least a first reading on its own terms and not an instructor's.--PolarisDiB"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men follows two men in their pursuits through the Great Depression. One of the men, George, is the average quick-witted man. His traveling partner, Lennie, is beyond kind and only has the best intentions in mind, but is mentally challenged and has an ogre-esque build. He represents the innocence of man, but even though his intentions are for the best they often create trouble. Lennie and George are in search of work, so they become ranch hands at a farm. They desire the same dream as most Americans at this time, the American Dream. They wish to own a small farm, work for themselves, raise animals, and \\"live off the fatta the land\\". This novel follows two men in through evil, innocence, death, corruption, loneliness, companionship, strength and weakness.America was founded on opportunity. Early Americans emigrated from different countries for work, religion, freedom from war, and several other reasons. The poverty stricken was in search of land and wealth. George and Lennie only wanted to own a piece of land and \\"tend the rabbits\\". All that mattered to them was being self sufficient and have the joys of life. They were in search of opportunity, just as Americans are still in search of today."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck tells this timeless story, entitled Of Mice and Men, of two fiends who are going from one farming job to another. One of the main characters, Lennie, is mentally retarded and is taken car of by George, the other main character. The two can't keep a job, because of Lennie's illness. He doesn't know how strong he is, and he's very strong, so when he gets mad he inflicts pain upon others, without meaning to. In the climax of the book, Lennie does something that is unchangeable, unwonted, and unforgivable. Steinbeck leaves you off with a jaw-dropping, tear jerking ending.The descriptive writing, the shocking ending, and the wonderful characters have you on the edge of your seat until the end."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Good book.

The reviews I read concerning this book mention it's directness and compliment the author the simple writing style that takes you away from the first to the last page. Well...it's all true. I truly liked this book. Simply written but with so much meaning and depth. One of the books everyone should've read!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"When John Steinbeck wasn't trying too hard to propagandize (as in, say, The Pearl, or The Grapes of Wrath), sometimes he could tell a really good story. That is certainly the case in Of Mice and Men, which has excellent characterization and the closest thing to a plot that Steinbeck got until much later in his career. While it has many of the same thematic elements as his other books from this period, it can best be read as a story about friendship, having someone else with whom to share the joys and sorrows of life. Of course, for Steinbeck, it is mostly sorrows---it is a tragedy, after all, and a particularly depressing one. One could argue that the ending isn't entirely bitter, but bittersweet, since Lenny's end is at least a happy one (or at least as happy as George is able to contrive for him given the circumstances)...but the real tragedy lies in George's fate. Still, this is a somewhat remarkable novel from Steinbeck, well crafted and immensely powerful. This is one that you will keep coming back to, as I have a couple of times since I first read it in school (one of the very few books I had to read for school that I actually enjoyed). Steinbeck surpassed Of Mice and Man probably only with East of Eden."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I am so very glad that I read this book as an adult for the first time (and had no real idea what it was even about).

Once you know the ending it will stay with you forever.This book it a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. The author did a wonderful job of bringing the characters to life. I was able to feel a connection with the people in the book.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"**This review may contain spoilers**Oh, boy, it's \\"Hamlet Syndrome work\\" time again. I define \\"Hamlet Syndrome work\\" as a work of literature that has been analyzed, dissected, and discussed so thoroughly that it's hard to say anything new or original about it. Steinbeck's enduring novella \\"Of Mice and Men\\" (hereafter OM&M;) certainly qualifies. OM&M; has permeated life and society's consciousness, at least American life and consciousness, probably because it unpretentiously depicts the main existential question of life: Is it worth living? Should we bother living? At first glance, OM&M;, from its title onward, seems to suggest NO.We have the classic split personality \\"brains and brawn\\" duo in George and Lennie. Despite their respective qualities, they could be considered life's hopeless losers. They are impoverished migrant workers and even fugitives because of an assault the mentally handicapped Lennie inadvertently committed upon a woman. Despite his vast strength, Lennie is a high-maintenance, perpetual man-baby who needs almost constant supervision. George profanely complains about the burden Lennie poses. Like just about all the other characters in OM&M;, they feel isolated and desperate, or at least they would if they didn't have each other. Nevertheless, defying the odds, George manages to wrangle himself and Lennie farm worker jobs.Things seems to settle down well. George and Lennie have saved money from previous jobs. The grizzled, dejected old custodian Candy has some money. Perhaps together they can buy a slice of earthly paradise: a rabbit farm where Lennie can live safe and secure and pet his animal friends. But the boss's ostracized, belligerent son Curley and his bored, ignored flirtatious wife eventually turn out to be serpents lying in the way. Lennie, again unintentionally, cripples one and kills the other. Earthly paradise goes up in smoke, but, some may argue, George mercifully gives Lennie a way to an otherworldly paradise.OM&M; portrays the apparently dead-end, humdrum, lonesome, hopeless rural world of Depression-era America. But like some great works of literature, it finds hope where there is no hope to be found. Despite their hard-luck lives, George and Lennie together function as an effective unit. They nurture a dream and keep going because of it. Candy helps bring their dream tantalizingly close. Slim, the manager, sympathizes with the duo and does what he can to protect them. George's mercy killing of Lennie after his manslaughter may be the kindest thing he ever did for Lennie. He keeps the dream alive for Lennie even as he shoots him in the back of the head. Slim arranges to have George's homicide appear to be self-defense and even be a shoulder to lean on as George glumly contemplates his \\"freedom\\" from Lennie.OM&M; seems to show life as an inevitable tragedy. However, it shows subtle suggestions that it need not have happened. Mainly, if George had supervised Lenny a bit more carefully, or had other characters like Crooks the shunned but dignified African-American stablehand (with whom Lenny had struck up a grudging friendship) watch out for him a little more, things may have turned out differently. OM&M;, I think, implies that life could be better and worth living if we WERE a little nicer to each other, cared a little more for each other, helped each other a little more. This solicitude, coupled with our capacity for hope in even the bleakest situations, is the key to bliss. Therefore, if God sees our hopes, our plans, our resolve, maybe He really isn't laughing. Maybe He is actually rooting for us."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck is a book about dreams and shattered dreams. Many schools have this book as part of their curriculum which is great.This is a rather short book. John Steinbeck wrote it in such a way that you can imagine the two main characters life before the book begins. Also, (and perhaps tragically) you can imagine life after the book concludes.Dreams, depression, companionship, work, and trust resonates through the main characters.Wonderful classic.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\""},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George and Lennie are two itinerant farm workers moving from one California farm to another. The two of them move together in order to avoid the loneliness and misery that usually accompanies nomads. Lennie is an incredibly strong and hard worker who has a mind of a child. Unfortunately for him, his strength and child-like instincts oftentimes get him in trouble. George has known Lennie since he was just a kid, and is the brains behind this unlikely duo. George dreams of a bigger life for the two of them, a life where they would settle on a small farm of their own. The questions remain, however, of how will they acquire enough money to purchase such a place and if they will be able to do so without getting into any really big trouble on account of Lennie's unpredictable behavior.This is perhaps the most poignant and well developed of Steinbeck's short novels. The characters are some of the most memorable ones in all of the twentieth century literature, and are masterfully developed and vivid. The narrative is as compact and tight as they come. Steinbeck is nothing short of a pure genius when it comes to constructing stories: each element, each sentence has its place and serves the overall purpose. This novella is a textbook example of what good storytelling is all about and will be enjoyed by both Steinbeck's fans as well as those who are new to his writings."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was required reading at least twice in grade school and I never complained.

It's downright terrific, in a tragic way. Moreover, it's easily readable within a single afternoon."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I think Gary Sinise's reading of Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is outstanding! He brings each of the characters to life for the listener. It's truly amazing how he can drift from one character to another so easily, keeping the dialogue moving so naturally. The story itself is wonderful. Steinbeck was a very visual writer - describing characters and places in such a way that you actually feel like you have met the characters and visited the places."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck deserves a standing ovation for this book. It tells so much in so few pages. It's a tale about two laborers working at a ranch to merely have something to eat. It quickly becomes more complicated than that, as Lennie - the slow-minded giant - proposes an idea: a house, a farm, and, of course, the rabbits. At first, it's just a dream, but then it becomes a possibilty as they get together with an elderly man who happens to have some money.

The story combines American history along with tragedy and a marvelous plot. I immensely enjoyed this book. John Steinbeck not only conveys the simple concept that Lennie, a mentally ill man, is not just another responsibility that George must tend to, but a true friend. The book touched me and was the first to draw tears from my eyes. It was remarkably well written and is the finest short novel I have ever read. The only downside to the book was that it was very depressing, especially in the last thirty pages when the plot deeply saddens. I have decided to read other Steinbeck novels because of the deep emotion the book shares with the reader."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is an extremely well written novella about itinerant farmer workers in 1930s California. The piece is tightly crafted with nary a needless word, the dialogue is so vivid that you feel like more like you're eavesdropping on people standing beside you than reading fiction and the story is poignant and controversial: you could have a good debate with someone about the motivations of the characters.And yet, I have to admit that I admired the novella more than I enjoyed it. It has more foreshadowing than almost anything else I've ever read, enough that I could quickly piece together the scraps I've picked up by accident (as so many people read it, especially in high school). This quickly gave me a pit in my stomach as I was reading. This proved to be a serious distraction. I could recognize the art -- I bought another Steinbeck while I was still reading it -- but it's even heavier than I anticipated. (This is a testament to how the subject matter is handled, but it is just overwhelmingly raw.)One thing I'm surprised that more of the other reviewers don't mention is how much it reads like a screenplay. The work was quickly turned into a stage play and no wonder: virtually everything takes place through dialogue. Even the backstory, which writers usually describe, is maneuvered into a slightly implausible conversation. (It seems like George is too cautious to tell everything he relays to a farmhand he just met.) And the written descriptions feel like stage directions: \\"On one side of the little room there was a square four-paned window, and on the other, a narrow plank door leading into the barn.\\""},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"What makes a big book? Not physical length. Knowing this novel's reputation as one of Steinbeck's masterpieces, I was astounded to lay hands on its mere hundred pages. Not scale of setting, either. The entire novella takes place in and around the bunkhouse of a California farm, and contains fewer than a dozen characters; it is so compact that it might almost have been made for film, television, or the stage (and it did in fact succeed in all these media). The people, furthermore, are by no means important or powerful; Steinbeck tells of ordinary itinerant laborers, bindle stiffs, living precariously from job to job. In this, the book is similar toTHE GRAPES OF WRATH, but deliberately avoids its epic scope, preferring to show a few characters in intimate detail rather than to suggest the displacement of multitudes.Yet I have no hesitation in calling the book big. Without any effort or overt symbolism, Steinbeck shows something simultaneously particular and vast. His characters are individuals, very real yet bound to one another and to us through their common humanity. The novel speaks to a particular time -- the American West in the late thirties -- and yet seems timeless. It takes a specific corner of California (\\"A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green\\") and makes it a kind of oasis of simplicity, as in the marvelous opening scene where the principal characters choose to spend a night sleeping under the stars rather than arriving too soon at the farm.And nothing could be bigger than the heart of Lennie, the simple-minded giant who comes to the farm with his friend and protector George, but whose confused feelings and ignorance of his own strength get him into trouble. The bond between him and George is not fully explained, but it is palpably filled with a kind of love. Lennie's inability to articulate his feelings is shared by all the other characters to some extent; this is a world in which men keep themselves to themselves and move on alone. But their very inarticulateness gives their underlying emotions an almost primal power. Truly, this is a big book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"My good mate John at Matilda's book store in Mount Waverley loaned me this audio book and I was totally mesmerized by it. I always knew that Gary Sinise was a great actor but I had no idea of just how good a book narrator he is. He recites all of the character voices himself and you would swear that there must be different people speaking, such is his mastery of the English Language, dialect and enunciation. I listened to this book through my stereo headphones and it was like Mr. Sinise was in the room with me reading this book aloud. A true masterpiece and thanks a lot John for this audio book.I think you have great taste in Literature."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's 1937 novella OF MICE AND MEN is one of the most poignant stories of friendship between men ever written in American Literature. It is also among the most important illustrations of the desperate feelings shared by those who lived in the Depression-era Dust Bowl regions of California. The story of the protective relationship between small, street-smart George Milton and large, child-like Lennie Small still fascinates us today; it has been made into no less than three feature films, the last one being only a dozen years ago, and it remains one of the five most-read books in Junior High, Intermediate and Middle Schools today around the country.At a spare 107 pages, this book is short on words but high on symbolism and feeling. John Steinbeck was a master of getting his point across simply. He also excelled at creating simple but sharply-drawn characters who lived, walked and talked like those with whom he had come into contact in real life. When one reads a book like OF MICE AND MEN, he or she is transported back to those times, by an author who actually lived the life of many of his protagonists, including the ones in this story. Yes, John Steinbeck did dig wells in his native Salinas during the Dust-Bowl period. He then gave us some of the most compelling and readable pieces of literature in our nation's history, and OF MICE AND MEN is among the most important of his works.MOST RECOMMENDED; ESPECIALLY FOR AGES 12-14"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men was short, but rivoting.

Lennie is, well, &quot;different&quot; in that he loves to touch soft things. He has the mind of a two year old. George does his best efforts to look after Lennie, although Lennie does get into a lot of trouble. After being chased away from their previous town, George and Lennie get new jobs in hopes to someday own a ranch of their own.Though this book was written well and the plot was good, I didn't like the story line.

Try it out and see what you think."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a morose tale of the unfulfilled dreams of workers. George Milton is an itinerant laborer with big dreams. He takes care of a mentally disabled man named Lennie Small. Lennie's name is ironic because he is a huge man who unintentionally harms living things because he can't control his own strength.George and Lennie stick together and have just fled from a work site where Lennie horrifed a woman and was accused of rape. He was innocent of the crime, but he put quite a scare into her. George is annoyed and overwhelmed with the responsibility of keeping Lennie out of trouble while pursuing the American dream of carving out a place of his own. He motivates Lennie by telling him of a plan to own a ranch and to allow Lennie to take care of some rabbits.The men came to work on a ranch. They meet some friendly people, but the boss has a son named Curley who is the ornery antagonist of the story. He has a coquettish wife who causes trouble by flirting with the hands and arousing the jealousy of her husband.Steinbeck masterfully uses foreshadowing in the story. He shows how Candy reluctantly allows his old dog to be killed. He also shows how Lennie kills a mouse and a puppy. It is clear that Lennie is destined to have trouble because of his inability to control his tremendous physical strength.Hopes run high as Candy and Crooks want in on the plan to run their own ranch. The dreams are shattered when Curley's wife can't stay away from the barn. She invites trouble by asking Lennie to stroke her soft hair. Lennie panics and strangles her. George knows that Lennie's fate has been sealed. He can see no future for Lennie. He mercifully shoots Lennie to put him out of his misery.This story is symbolic of the chimera of the American dream. Many laborers thought they could rise to the top of society. Instead, race, crippling injuries, prostitution, gambling, and a variety of other setbacks stymie the attempts to get ahead. In Steinbeck's world, a working man can't get a break.This is a good book with an interesting plot. It has a social message and is a critique of the troubles and overwhelming obstacles that face the working man. The only criticism I have is that the plot is a bit far-fetched. It is hard to imagine a scenario of a huge man-child like Lennie causing so much havoc.

The story is based on two men and their struggle in life. One man, George, small in nature, looking over his large friend Lennie. This is a definite must read for anyone. This story is very popular and is frequently used as a beginner's read by many high schools across the nation.George and Lennie first set out to find new jobs after being forced to flee from their current jobs. At first you are not told why they were fleeing but you knew from the dialect that something bad had occurred and Lennie was to blame. Lennie was a friendly, child-like dimwitted man. What he lacked in brain power he made up tenfold in brawny. He had a large muscular build which enabled him to be a good worker. George on the other hand, was the complete opposite of Lennie. He was small but definitely smarter than his counterpart Lennie. George looked out for Lennie and tried to keep him out of trouble, albeit an impossible task.While reading the story you inevitably know the ending before you even get there. At every turn you are expecting the well intended Lennie to do something horrible. George tries to keep him in line and is successful for most of the story.The main idea is the search for happiness. George and Lennie are working to save enough money to buy their own land and work their own fields. George constantly reassures Lennie that they can achieve their goal and Lennie can have his rabbits to tend to. If Lennie ever slips up then George has to remind him of the future they intended.John Steinbeck has a tremendous ability to set up a visual representation of his story. In the beginning to every chapter, the landscapes and surroundings are vividly detailed making the reader actually believe he is there watching the events take place. Steinbeck follows his structure throughout the book. Each chapter sets up the scene and the conversations between characters tell the story for the remainder of the chapter.Each character in the story is well described. Always described upon first entering the story. Steinbeck also ensured that each person was flawed in some way. Each one had their good traits and their bad. George and Lennie seem to be the good guys in the story even though Lennie is a walking nightmare waiting to happen.You can tell George and Lennie develop a loving relationship. Lennie listens to George and George in return keeps an eye on Lennie. This is definitely a heavy burden placed on George. Finally, in the end Lennie slips up. He kills the boss' daughter-in-law. The event that was being set up all along. A lynch party is sent out to find Lennie. Ultimately it is George that find Lennie. George is forced to kill Lennie for his discretions. Lennie died at the hand of George whilst being promised that brighter future yet another time.Steinbeck makes it seem as though we're all searching for that brighter future that's just out of our grasp. This is one of those books that you can't put down. Although it is not a long read, it is extremely well written."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Was basically &#34;wandering&#34; around he kindle store and remembered this book from required reading in high school.

I thouroughly enjoyed reading this book, for many different reasons. For instance, Steinbeck uses a storyline that grabs the attention of all ages, young or old. In the begining, we are introduced to George and Lennie the novel's two main characters. They are fleeing from their former hometown in search of a new job opportunity on a ranch located in the Salinas Valley. The two fathem a dream of owning their own ranch one day with lots of acres and rabbits. They work out a plan to earn money so this dream can be fulfilled. While on the ranch the young childish Lennie is objected to numerous situations, in which they put George in akward posiitions. George's loyalty is constantly tested throughout the novel. With a surprise ending their dream seems to fade away. This book is one everyone should read, because it teaches the meaning of friendship and the &quot;American Dream&quot;."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Inspired by Steinbeck's centennial celebrations last year, I picked up a copy of \\"Of Mice and Men\\" because I had read it was a thriller of sorts. As a mystery fan and writer, I am always interested in sudden apocalyptic d&eacute;nouements. I read the book in a couple of hours and, let me tell you, I'm still thinking about it two days later.The story of George Milton and Lennie Small - who was, in every sense of the word, a \\"brute\\" - develops fast up to its high climax, and its end hits you like a thunderstorm. They are a couple of illiterate men who travel together, going from ranch to ranch in the Salinas valley at the time of the Great Depression, and \\"buck barley\\" for a living. They have no home or family, but they have each other, and they have a dream, which is repeated as an omen throughout the story: to save enough money to buy their own ranch and \\"live on the fatta the land.\\" George, with a small physique, has assumed the role of caretaker of Lennie, who is mentally retarded but naturally (or unnaturally?) strong. This trait of his had cost them their last job, but no matter what, they continued to stick together, true to their dream and their promise of honest friendship. Two days later after they arrive at their new place of work, the picture is totally changed and - in order not to give away the ending - I'll say so is the dream.This is an excellently crafted novella, where every single character, event and word has been assigned a key role; and only a writer as talented as Steinbeck could have achieved it. It no only takes full manageability of the writing craft, but also an implicit trust on behalf of your readers in order to accept such a moralizing tale. Personally I like Steinbeck's omniscience, and anyone who knows about the context of his lifetime would understand why he thought a writer should always offer something for the betterment of mankind.\\"Of Mice and Men\\" offers a perspective into us. It is a rite of passage from dreams to reality and back, an understanding of the true nature of friendship and the shattering reality of its breakage, where the pieces can no longer be picked up because they are no longer important. A novel that will make you want to hug the people you consider your friends."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Stienbeck's Of Mice and Men, was a great, disturbing read. You immeditaly love innocent Lennie and kind, hardworking George. But this book has a dark, sad message. People like Lennie and George truly never win, no matter how hard they try. And, for those who asked, the reason George killed Lennie was that Lennie couldn't function in society. George had tried to take care of him, but they always ended up on the run. If they got away this time, soon they would be on the run again. So George did the kindest thing possible. Rather than let Curley and the men kill Lennie while he was frightened and upset, George was with Lennie in his favoriter place, talking about their wonderful dream, their own private Eden. He made Lennie feel happy and safe. And then George, rather than letting Lennie suffer, took up his suffering and killed him quickly and painlessly. George cared for Lennie so much that he would rather suffer than have Lennie suffer. It is obvious that George loves Lennie, despite &quot;giving him hell&quot;, and wants to protect him. When he can't, he makes sure no one will hurt Lennie. Sad, beautiful book is too great for a mere review to describe. Also, see the movie with Gary Sinise and John Malkovich, and you'll cry even harder - they perfectly capture their characters!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is a wonderful book about life in the 1930's. Steinbeck tells about two men trying to make money and live on their own land, as many men drempt of back then. This was shown through one metaphore of Lennie (one of the main characters) wanting to tend to the rabbits. The rabbits really represented them being free.The characters in this book were really unique. George and Lennie are the main characters and they always stick together. Lennie is mentally sick, yet George sticks with him. The characters were a very beliavable pair because how they acted and their dreams of being free were very realistic.This is a good book to read for young americans and i gave it four stars. Although it is only 107 pages long there is a lot of content and makes you want to keep reading it. Many people dislkike the language in the book, but other people dont realize that this book shows the language that everyone hears in our society every day."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men, written during the great depression, explains, in beautiful detail, the life of two homless men. The book takes place on a ranch in Soledad, California. George and Lennie are the main characters. These two homeless men travel around the United States looking for work. They find it in Soledad. George is small and has all the brains bteween the two friends, Lennie is tal and slow but &quot;One hell of a strong worker,&quot; according to George. I canit say anymore. They dream of making enough money at this ranch and buy a small plot of land with a small house on it. It's a short book with only one hundered and eighteen pages. It is one of the best classic,s I've ever read, (the others being The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series.) The main and supporting characters are George and Lennie, Slim, Crooks, Curley, Curley's Wife (she doesn't have a name), Carlson, and Candy. I'm not going to tell the end but I will say that it is quite depressing, though a great book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a really great book. Steinbeck really does great job in describing the area around the farm where it takes place. This story takes place in the mid 1930s to early 40s. He tells of a river flowing from mountains with green trees, and of how the farm looks. The barns where they put the horses and all the crops that they harvest are big ones by the way John Steinbeck describes them. The story is based on two men from California. They travel with each other and work together to make money. Lennie is a big man who is strong but has mind of a child. He is always getting in trouble at each farm. Then there is George, is a short man who works hard. He more less takes care of Lennie as if he were a big brother to him. George is always telling Lennie about how one day they are going to get their own little place and raise rabbits, horses and chickens. I don't know how they're going to stay alive with the way that Lennie keeps on killing animals. He kills everything he gets. He pets them too hard and he ends up breaking their necks. On the farm where they're going to work there is a man by the name of Curly. He is the boss's son. He doesn't like Lennie from day one. He doesn't like men taller than he is. Of Mice and Men tells the story of two poor laborers trying to get by. They worked all their lives but didn't get a thing from it but trouble. This shows how many families and friends work together to make their dreams come true. Half the time it doesn't work but for some it does. They have the &quot;American Dream&quot; of owning their own farm but that never came true for Lennie and George, although it could have. The novel is easy and understandable. It's not that long and can be read in 3-4 days. The ages that I would recommend it for are 14 to 19. If you would ask me I would tell any one to read this book. I hope to read this book again some day and to read more of John Steinbeck's books too. I would watch the movie after you read the book to compare them to see how much they're alike and how much they're not."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In so few pages Steinbeck creates two characters who you fall in love with immediatly. Goerge and Lennie make the perfect pair for the classic Steinbeck book. This is the story of two travelers who have a dream such as anyone else. Along the way they meet both highs and lows as they strive toward their retirement dream. The excellent combinatiion of george and lennie makes for many laughable situations that will make you smile with sad stories that touch your heart. This is one book that you can really get into and feel for the characters. You won't be sorry to read this short novel that is sure to get your applause at the unexpected and imprezzive ending."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I am a teenager and I love Of Mice and Men. In a English class of today you are bombarded with feminst literature and other works that you become satiated with this genre. It is a breath of fresh air to get a novel about male bonding and the trials and tribulations of farm workers of that time. Steinbeck adds a hint of a Shakespearen Tragedy to this masterpiece which puts it in the category of great classics to be cherished forever. This novel is a must read and you will enjoy it for years to come. I will end this with a final thought. It is very short and it can be read in a day and is good to use if you have procastinated on a book report. :-)"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is one of those books that, having read it, remains in your mind and soul for quite some time. Having seen both movie versions of the book recently prompted me to read this masterpiece once again. The book moves quickly and smoothly; before you know it, you are at the end of it. Relatively short, this book is a delightful way to spend an afternoon."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck wrote this classic gem in 1937. It's been a Broadway play and there have been several adaptations of it in movies and TV. I was generally familiar with the story but this was the first time I actually read the book. Wow! I was completely blown away! This is the story of a two lonely and alienated men who work as farm laborers, drifting from job to job in California. Lennie is gentle giant, physically strong but mentally retarded. George guides and protects Lennie but also depends on him for companionship. Together, they have a dream to someday buy a little farm where they can grow crops and raise rabbits and live happily ever after. This, of course, is not to be as the title suggests. &quot;The best laid plans of mice and men&quot; is a line in a poem by Robert Burns, which describes how a field mouse's world is destroyed by a plow.Steinbeck's narrative voice is seemingly simple in his descriptions of nature of as well as the details of the bunkhouse. His characterizations of the people are magnificent. We meet the other workers, all loners, and appreciate the beauty of the unique friendship between Lennie and George. We meet Candy, the old man who is outliving his usefulness. We meet Crooks, the black stable hand, shunned by the men and therefore turning to books for companionship. We meet the cruel Curley who taunts Lennie into a fight. And we meet Curley's wife, another lonely soul who uses her femininity to get the wrong kind of attention.There's tension in every word and I found myself holding my breath, knowing that something awful would happen, my eyes glued to the page, the world of Lennie and George deeply etched into my consciousness. I was pulled right into the story, wanting to shout warnings as I saw the inevitable consequences. The ending was incredibly sad, but yet satisfying. It couldn't have ended any other way. It's a small book, only 118 pages long. But it is a masterpiece and I will never forget it. I give it my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck remains properly on the reading lists of high school students because of the regional imagery through succinct dialogue. Unlike \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" Steinbeck brings us swiftly into each moment, never letting us linger too long before walking us to the next place.The American Dream has many variations, but always, it is about independence and the pride of being one's own man. Lennie and George want this independence more than most men, but have less than most men to get there. In their case, it isn't a white picket fence, but a farm where they can raise rabbits.Lennie is not a bright man. He desires to care for someone and to be loved, but is unable to think past his own fear. George tries to protect him, but he too, although smarter than Lennie, is managed by his insecurity and foolishness.The story surrounds Lennie and George's efforts to get and retain work on ranch near Soledad, and more so, toward their American Dream. The big picture is always with them, but it is the day-by-day difficulties they have with being outsiders. Their intrinsic inability to be free is sheer tragedy, as they both fail again and again to make the right decision.It's a lonely story about two men who hope more than they can think, who are destined by their misery never to enjoy true companionship and happiness.Few books are as thematically pure as \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" which follows Man's search for self and meaning carefully. It is harsh in language and image, and the abstract ideas might be too much for younger readers to comprehend, but any intelligent teen will gain from it where John Knowles' \\"A Separate Peace\\" and J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" leave off.I fully recommend \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Book Review How does the common man look at mentally disabled people? In reading Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men one could find out. Steinbeck wrote about two men traveling around California working on farms. The couple is a dynamic one. Lennie is a gigantic man that has the brain power of a small child. George is a small man that looks after Lennie and tries to protect him. \\"We kinda look after each other.\\" Said George. \\"He ain't bright. Hell of a good worker, though. Hell of a nice fella, but he ain't bright. I've knew him for a long time(p.34).\\" This book does a great job showing how society doesn't understand the needs of mentally disabled people. I also believe that it shows that every man can have a role in society. This book is a must read. Almost everyone has come into contact with a mentally disabled person once in his or her life. Or, if not a mentally disabled person, a person that is just a little slow. One of the many great things about this book is that everyone can relate to it. The social significance is immense and I believe people enjoy reading meaningful books. Another thing I enjoyed about this book was George and Lennie's lingo. \\"I... ain't gonna say nothin'. jus' gonna stan' there(p.6).\\" Steinbeck was born and raised in California and many of his books take place there. Like Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck wrote other books about men that work on farms, such as Tortilla Flat and The Grapes of Wrath. George and Lennie find jobs on a farm in the Californian countryside. Lennie loves to pet things and that obsession always gets the couple into trouble. Lennie is a handful for George and is pain for everyone around the farm. A horrific crime is committed by Lennie. The men on the farm could not and did not want to deal with Lennie and his behaviors. \\"He ain't cuckoo, said George, he's just dumb as hell, but he ain't a crazy(p.39). Even thought Lennie's brain does not function at a high level he could still help others. There is a man on the farm named Crooks, Crooks is an african american that has a bad back. Crooks is mean and shields everyone away, but Lennie opens him up and brightens his day. \\"I did'n't care much, said Crooks. \\"Lennie's is a nice fella(p.82). Even thought Lennie is slow he still can befriend a person. People read to broaden here knowledge and understanding of the world. What this book taught me is that mentally disabled people have different needs than those of us that do not have an impaired brain. And that society needs to help them find a role in the community and in society because every man or woman has a purpose. If you want a great book to read Of Mice and Men should be at the top of your list."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I am a tenth grade student and I recently read \\"Of Mice and Men\\" for a school project. I thought it was an excellent book. I felt that the author, John Steinbeck, did a first class job with this novel. It portrayed the relationship between George and Lennie in a way that made you become very attached to the characters. You wanted to read more to find out if they ever accomplished their goals and to see if their dreams became a reality. George and Lennie are complete opposites; George is a small, quick intelligent man, while Lennie is a man of huge dimensions but has the brain of a child. Throughout the story Lennie acts in ways that infuriate George, but George will always be there for his friend because he knows Lennie needs him to survive. Lennie can buck barley like no one else because of his pure strength, but would probably starve to death if he didn't have George to provide his daily meals. I think that has to do with why this book has been banned in the past by schools across the country. Some people may be offended by how the mentally challenged person is shown in this story. It seems as though the view being expressed is that people with mental problems can't do anything for themselves. They are also a constant threat to others because they cannot control themselves. Lennie didn't realize what he was doing was wrong until it had gone too far. These are stereotypes of mentally retarded people that some people may believe are reinforced by this novel. They are lead to believe that this book is discriminatory towards the mentally challenged. Parents whom believed this did not want their children reading this book because they did not want them to be exposed to these types of ideas. Also, Curly's wife does not fit the traditional mould. She is unhappy with her marriage and is not completely loyal to her husband like a conventional wife should be. She is always flirting with the men that work on the farm. Some adults believed that this was unacceptable behavior to expose to children. I don't think that a school today would even consider banning this book because cultural standards have changed greatly from when this book was first published in 1937. I also don't believe that this book should have ever been banned. It is a great book that takes you on an emotional roller coaster. Once you get started it is almost impossible to put down. The ending is also written to perfection. It is unpredictable and is incredibly moving. I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it anyone."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Written in 1937, when the Depression was still affecting all aspects of the farming community, this powerful novel depicts the lives of migrant workers--grim, pessimistic, and offering little hope for an improved future. Focusing on two characters who arrive in the Salinas Valley during peak season, Steinbeck creates touching scenes between Lenny, a big, severely limited worker who does not know his own strength, and George, a whippet-thin man who serves as Lenny's constant companion and protector.Both Lenny and George have dreams of one day living on their own farm, where Lenny, who loves the feeling of soft things--even dead mice--wants to take care of rabbits. George hopes one day to benefit from his own hard work on his own farm and to create an environment where Lenny can be safe from his own impulses. As Steinbeck brings the characters on the ranch to life, he shows how every person there has dreams of a different life but few opportunities to change the lives they already have. Some are physically handicapped from accidents on farms, while others are emotionally handicapped by lack of opportunity or their own personal limitations.Life is lonely, uncertain, and harsh but George tries to make life for Lenny more bearable by allowing him to have one of the new puppies in the barn. When Curley, the boss's son, brings his flirtatious wife to the farm, he introduces a new element which eventually leads to a tragic ending. Women are considered dangerous to the status quo, as they reinforce the need for \\"soft\\" elements in lives that otherwise offer little softness.Giving vivid pictures of the natural surroundings while also creating vivid pictures of the interactions of these men, Steinbeck shows that even among those whose lives offer little hope, there is a desire to take advantage of each other. Crooks, the black stable hand who is forced to live alone in the barn, undermines Lenny. Carlson takes advantage of Candy's love for his old, smelly dog and causes pain to Candy. Lenny's puppy, Candy's dog, a heron capturing a water snake, and dreams of their own farm all become symbols which add to the drama of the conclusion. In this powerfully sad novel, Steinbeck offers little hope that the lives of these men will improve and even less hope that they will ever be able to control what happens to them. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from end to end. I give it a 4 star rating because of... oops this is still the introduction! I hope you enjoy this review and read the book!The book is mainly about two men named Lennie and George and their travels to reach their dream of building a great farm and \\"livin' off the fatta da lan.\\" I like this book because just by reading it you know that John Steinbeck put his heart and soul into this book. If \\"Of Mice and Men\\" were a food I would describe it as rich and satisfying. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that especially in the beginning it would go away from the story and describe the landscape it in great detail. Don't get me wrong! I like detail but it took too long to get back to the story. Speaking of detail. When the detail in then book was focused on the story it gave it an amazing effect! The character development in this book was also very good. From main characters like George to main characters like Crooks, John always let the reader know lot about the character. Finally, the dialogue in the book is excellent. Everything is said right and right at the correct time. WOW! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an enriching story but can handle a little tragedy.This concludes my review of the book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck. For all of you who decide to read it... ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read this book aged 15 for my GCSE English literature exam. Right from the start I fell in love with Steinbeck's unassuming, delicate language and his vividly real characters. The theme of loneliness on the &quot;ranch&quot; where the main characters work really haunts the reader, and we feel great sympathy for the barren lives lead by the characters - matched by the bleak, dusty Salinas landscape. All the main characters suffer from some form of prejudice, which in turn isolates them from the main thread of communication in the mid-west community - from Lennie, who is punished for his mental disability, to Candy, punished for his age, the negro, Crooks and the &quot;jailbait&quot;, Curley's Wife. Each character suffers such absolute desolation in the face of promminence, I couldn't help feeling such strong empathy for the tragic people who inhabit this book. It is a credit to Stenbeck's unique eye for socialistic views and values that he draws such desparing, but neccassary, attention to the &quot;abused&quot; little man of 20's America."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Overall, John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is really a good book. Even though it's rather short, it delivers its message quite well. The book opens with George and Lennie near the Salinas River south of Soledad, California. Lennie is a big, loveable guy who isn't very smart, but is easily pleased. Lennie loves to stroke soft things, and has a mouse in his hands that he accidentally killed by petting it too hard. Lennie's portrayal is extremely sympathetic and sentimental, but I couldn't help but like him, regardless of his flaws. George is the little man behind Lennie; he acts as the big man's brain in guiding him and keeping him out of trouble. The two travel and work together and have a friendship unlike anything most other characters in the novel have ever experienced. The book really got me to feel like I knew the characters, especially Lennie, and to pity them. The underlying theme of man's innate loneliness and his need for companionship is a bit dark and pessimistic for my taste, but is delivered tactfully with the repeated story of George and Lennie's farm where Lennie will be able to tend rabbits while the two live off the fatta the lan' offers hope so the book can be easily stomached by someone with a more optimistic worldview. All things considered, I would definitely recommend this book for everyone to read; the ideas behind it should be considered by all."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"My 7th grade son with reading problems needed to read this book for english class. This was very helpful to him. He followed along in the book as it was read to him and was able to absorb and actually enjoy the story. I will be buying more books for him this way."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"It took me a measly three hours but yesterday afternoon I read for the first time John Steinbeck's classic tragedy \`Of Mice and Men', a novel that, while written in 1937, still holds so true today. Steinbeck's accounting of sheer loneliness and desperation is so brilliantly captured that the reader is brought to tears (for me in a literal sense) to realize that this is all these people had to live for, a pipe dream that refused to die. The story focuses mainly on George Milton and Lennie Small, but as you read you'll notice that a few supporting characters play a big role in the heartbreak that this novel conveys.George is a small framed man, lean and dwarfed in comparison to his companion Lennie, the tall large strong man, but what Lennie has in strength and size he lacks in smarts. He is, for lack of another word, mentally retarded. But Lennie does possess a simple soul and a heart of gold, which alone makes this tale all the more tragic. George, in fulfillment of a promise he made to Lennie's Aunt Clare, takes care of Lennie, taking him with him to work in the fields bucking wheat and the like. When they make it to their next job they find that they aren't the only ones trying to find a better lot in life.First they meet Candy, an older man who's been injured on the job and thus kept around for sympathy's sake. He sweeps the living areas and lives his life one miserable day at a time. He's slipping into uselessness and the very thought of amounting to nothing digs deeper and deeper into his soul. Crooks is the negro stable hand, an outcast from the others not only because of his skin color but also because of his disability, being crippled due to a horse accident (he was kicked in the back) and thus he spends most of his time alone in his room. They also meet the boss's son Curly, a jerk of a man who is so insecure about his size and his marriage that he's willing to throw it down with anyone he sees, and he sets the blunt of his rage on poor Lennie because of his size and his demeanor.To me the most interesting and even heartbreaking character is that of Curly's wife. Ostracized by the working men because of her husbands temper and disregarded by her own husband because of his carelessness and blatant jealousy she's left all alone with no one to talk to and no real place to call home. She's regarded by the men as a tart, a floozy who wants all the wrong kinds of attention but in all actuality she just wants any kind of attention she can get for any kind is better than no kind. After the tragic circumstances involving Lennie and Curly's wife the author makes a statement that to me sums up this poor woman when he says that \\"all the meanness and the planning's and the discontent and the ache for attention were all gone from her face.\\" She was alone and desperate just like everyone else.The one thing that kept these stock of characters going, Lennie in particular, was the prospect of getting out, of getting their own place where they could plant and cultivate and \\"tend rabbits\\" and be their own men. When this idea is shared between Candy and Crooks they too jump at the idea of getting away from it all and feeling whole again, feeling complete and being far away from the loneliness of it all. The worst kind of loneliness is the kind you feel even when you're around other people for its then that you know you're truly alone in every sense of the word.Most people are aware of the horrific ending, but in case you are not then I will say nothing further on the subject. Just know that this novel is one of the finest pieces of American Literature and is sure to bring tears to your eyes. While this is just barely over 100 pages it still magnificently captures every emotion and feeling that can possibly be provided here. The characters are brilliantly crafted and their innermost demons are bared all for us to see and to relate. I will never forget this masterpiece and will recommend this to anyone who enjoys good reading. It's a quick read, but it's not one to soon be forgotten."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Because it is more &quot;socially relevant&quot;, The Grapes of Wrath is the Steinbeck novel most often pushed on students - who promptly get turned-off by him. Don't let that happen to you. Of Mice and Men is his second best novel (the first being East of Eden) and it has everything that makes Steinbeck great. It is a short, fast read so you might as well give it a chance. The story itself is so archetypical as to be almost mythic - there is Lenny, the good-hearted, strong simpleton; George, his protector; Curly, the short, cruel, bully and his dangerous wife.Also, if you've ever seen a Looney Toon wherein a big, dumb character says something like, &quot;Tell me about the rabbits, George&quot; that is from this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book about Lennie and George, two quite different types, is a book which never will be too old. It has a timeless theme, which is as relevant today as it was when Steinbeck wrote it. Whwn I sat i the sofa back home, and read the last pages, my father suddently saw the book I was reading. He read it when he was younger, and liked it as well as I did. So there we went on chatting... The theme of the book is discussable, but it contains several subjects which encourages readers in all ages to read on. True friendship, the American dream, mercy killing... I would have given the book 5 stars if it wouldn't have been for the hard beginning. Continue reading, it gets better! Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"An outstanding, chilling, and thought provoking book that helped to shape my thought processes as an adolescent when I read the book for the first time, Of Mice and Men is Steinbeck's most succinct piece.

Over the years, Mr. Sinise has made John Steinbeck's work a part of his life, being involved with it in various mediums: live plays, a film, and this audio recording. As a result, he seems to have developed a deep connection to this story, and a lively and powerful rendering of the characters is what results. It is the perfect performance of a perfect book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"One of Steinbecks shortest novel, but one of the best.

This is even stranger considering I was an English major in college. I guess my profs figured I had already read him in high school.No, I never read him until, on a whim, I checked out a copy of The Grapes Of Wrath from my local library, and found out what I was missing out on.I'm not going to talk a lot about Of Mice And Men here, simply because I suspect there is not a lot to be said that hasn't been said already. I just want to say that if you're someone who avoids reading &quot;the literary stuff&quot; because you think it's going to be too difficult, this is probably the book to change your mind. In prose of beautiful simplicity, Steinbeck tells a story that will break your heart. If you have a heart and a mind, you will probably be impressed with this.

Just as the book got good one of the main characters accidently kills another. I wasn't expecting this.This author has a way of describing characters that made me relate to them. This made the story more interesting, so did the climax. I couldn't put the book down and the climax was the best part. this authors descriptive writing kept my attention with a great chapter book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I like it. The narration was simple but vivid; the characters were crude but touching; and the story was short but long lasting. I enjoyed seeing how the relationship between George and Lenny had become. It's one of the classics and well worth considered as 'classic.' It touched upon the human spirits, upon our needs for companionship, our needs for emotional support, our needs for things other than food, clothes and shelter. I believe Steinbeck drew a lot of materials from his years as a laborer. It well depicted the depression during that time period. Those who gave it one star should have looked deeper beyond just the story of who did what, when, but looked more carefully at WHY. George shot Lenny because he knew too well that others would certainly punish him and in the process torture might even be unavoidable. Since George cared for Lenny so much, he decided to prevent all that from happening himself. The gun he used was the same one used to kill the old dog. Why? Because it's a metaphor. Lenny was depicted as a parallel to the dog: of being no use and no one wanted it/him except the owner. The end touched me and I did cry for George and Lenny. It's very true that a lonely heart can kill a person. That's one of the reasons George was with Lenny. To me the book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"What more is there to say about this great American classic? I feel like everything has been said. In just one word, it's great. The characters are really well built. You have no choice but to feel their misery. They all have their own little something to add. I don't what i could add except that I really enjoyed this book and it is definetely worth reading."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I have read the book and i've really enjoyed reading it. I think it's a heart-touching book because it helps you to realize there are important things in life for which you have to fight. The book relates about 2 men, fighting for their dream. these men Are George and Lennie, which are really well interpreted in the movie. My favourite character is George, he is responsible and small. The book gives you many messages, my favourite one is to fight for dreams and happiness. Even if some people don't make their dream come true, some would do. I've goven 5 stars to this book because i've had fun reading it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"No one can describe human mind with such an ease. It leaves a everlasting effect on reader's mind. All human relationships are perfectly interpreted in this little book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This tiny Steinbeck classic, published in 1937, is still considered one of the most stunning, impact producing works ever written. It continues to knock my socks off. And more than likely, always will. If you've never had the pleasure of reading this timeless classic, you really, really should."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I recently read this book for my 7th grade English class. At first I was hesitant about reading a classic. As soon as I got into the story, I soon found out that this book was not just a classic but a wonderful, excited and touching tale about two lonely farmers searching for friends. This book has an astounding ending that everyone will be touched by. Being on 13, this review must show how this book is appropriate for every age. I highly recommend this book. Steinbeck has an interesting writting style that sometimes is difficult to read but he gets his points across fluently. Enjoy this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book never ceases to amaze me. I was never bored by it either. Most expositions in books don't have a very long attention span. I love reading how these two totally different men go around looking for jobs yet never seem to find one. Yet for this book they land one at a farm being farmhands. The ending can be very/not very predictable depending on what type of thinking skills you use, yet the book is great. Get it and you will be amazed as I was too."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was way better than I expected. I especially loved reading about the childish things that Lennie did. Whenever you read about his actions, you'll probably let out a little laugh. This is a good read beginning to end.&quot;Which way did he go George? Which way did he go?&quot;"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I thought that this book was a great book. I thought thatbecause it expressed the feelings of every character in a certain waythat was so real and it made me feel so into the book. THe part where i really got into the book was when Carlson went out and shot Candy's dog and i started talking to the book because i think that that was really rude. I started to cry when i was watching the movie when Carlson shot Candy's dog because candy was with that dog for a long time and i thought that it was really mean that Carlson thought that it would be ok that he shot the dog. Even if the dog is deaf Candy took care of it and didn't let anything happended to it. He really loved that dog. I also liked how they made Lenny sound so hopeless and how he reacted to the puppy and how he was just like my 6 year old sister. She always comes up to me and says if i do this can you give me something and it is kind of the same as Lenny wanting to tend the rabbits if he did something good... Lenny did live a hard and wild life including that he always had something going on in his life that got him in trouble. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes short and exciting books read this one. I guarantee you that you will not be disapionted, and if i were you i would run out and buy a copy of the book Of Mice and Men right now......... Thank You!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I re-read this book recently because my daughter was reading it. I was struck by the power that Steinbeck packed into this short book. Steinbeck does a masterful job of contrasting the relationship between Candy (the ranch's janitor) and his old dog with the relationehip between George and Lennie. &quot;Tell me again, George...&quot; At first, Lennie is the only one who wants to hear the story about the farm that he and George hope to have some day. By the end of the book Candy and Crooks want to believe in the dream, too. At the end of the book, reality creeps back in and tragedy stikes.Today's readers should read this book with a knowledge of the historical times of these characters. The historical context will help readers understand the predicament faced by men like Crooks, Candy, and Lennie."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"After racking my brains trying to read William Faulkner, I decided to give this short, simple, touching story a try. Steinbeck is a great author to read after Faulkner; his easiness of style cures the headache Faulkner's vortexes of plot development cause. This novel, which was written to read like a play, contains the memorable characters of George and Lennie. Lennie's phrase, \\"Are we gonna have rabbits George?\\" has been immortalized. This story is easy to read and enjoyable; however, one cannot help to sympathize with the loneliness of all its characters. I recommend this book, but I classify it in the \\"Literature Light\\" section of the books I've read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I expected this book to not be good at all but it was excellent..the relationship between george and lenny touched me..it is an excellent book with many themes"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of mice and Men is good because it is a thin book that tells a long story. John Steinbeck's description fits the incident that is to occur very well. It is straightforward and sounds very true to me. The beautiful world that Lennie and George have imagined is not possible to be obtained at that time. Their tragic end is well painted in the portrait of the circumstance that they are in. It has called upon my sympathy, making me feel naturally how unfair that society is. It is a book that will not take much time to read, but it will definitely tell you something."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book, Of Mice and Men, was a very exciting book to read. George and Lennie were two nomad men that went from job to job trying to make a life's living. Lennie is a kid trapped in a man's body. Lennie is disabled and acts like a four year old kid. George is a &quot;small and quick and dark of face&quot;.I liked this novel. It showed how life could be hard in many different ways. How they went from job to job trying to make a life's living. Also how George dealt with Lennies problems. Lennie's wouldn't think and get in trouble.I would recommend this book to kids that love adventure. This had plenty of it. Lennie and George went everywhere to work."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"A perfect example of John Steinbeck's skills as a writer. In only a little over hundred pages, John Steinbeck quickly sets up a storyline and relantionship that comes to a heart-cutting conclusion that gets you far deepr and sharper then most novels that'd need hundreds of pages just to delude its characters that'd you'd feel as much for as Lennie and George, this novel's two main protagonists.In a short summary George and Lennie are simply two rootless drifters-for-sale who go around and pretty much take up any job available. George is \\"small and quick and dark of face\\" while Lennie is a magnificently large and powerful giant with the mind of a mentally stunted child. Lennie and George are very much outcasts from society, but when it comes to George, such a rootless life is of his emotional chaining to the Lennie whom he knows that he cannot leave behind. George stresses to Lennie that, if it wasn't for him, he could live an easy, comfortable lif, complete with a woman. But he knows however, that he cannot leave Lennie behind, this great man-child.This relationship, based on both George's disdain and regret for having to put down his chances for an easy life to help guide and protect Lennie and his own love for this great giant, not to mention the duo's own fantasial dreams of someday having their land, a place to call their own, is simply moving, something that just gets you. And as one reads on the power, the depth, that runs under this relationship, only just furthers your empathy and appreciation of the relationship that these two share. All of this coming down to an ending that could quite possibly end up being one of the most, if not the most, emotionally quick, puncturing, and sharp ending in all of the history of literature. And only a great writer like John Steinbeck could possibly ascend to the demands of such a great task.Anyhow, it comes down to this simple message; buy, read, and watch your eyes get teary."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"At age 28, I am finally reading through all of the 'classic' novels, and Steinbeck has a solid handful of &quot;must reads.&quot; He seems to have written a lot of shorter novels that wring a lot out of you emotionally. In light of that, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a novel that is many things at the same time: touching, tragic, and funny.The story revolves around a couple of characters who seem to have shown up in my chief medium of knowledge as a child, cartoons. The big, dopey gentle-hearted giant and the quick-witted smaller man who seems to begrudgingly take on the role of care-taker for the dopey giant. The thing is, the care-taker needs the dope in just as real a way as the dope needs the care-taker. That is the touching part of the story, as this truth is slowly revealed about George (the care-taker.)The book is also tragic with liberal amounts of shocking twists and turns, including a totally unpredictable and tragic ending. I really want to see how they did that on that big-screen. Read the book and you'll see what I mean.It's also a funny story in that Steinbeck just has a way with subtle humor, and he has a great medium to express this humor in the dopey character of Lenny. He's like the big cartoon Abominable Snowman that wants to pet nice things and be tender towards them, but ends up crushing them unintentionally. Well, I guess that could be taken as mean or cruel, too, but I take it as funny.In all, I rate this story highly because I found myself very involved with the characters and cared how it ended, which in my mind is what a good story should do."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a touching story about two main characters, George and Lennie. George is a small, dark man with \\"sharp, strong features.\\" Lennie is his total opposite. He is a giant man with a shapeless face. You can tell Lennie is mentally disabled when George and Lennie have a conversation. Lennie loves to stroke soft things but his power overcomes him. He has been stroking a mouse, who because of Lennie's power, died. George and Lennie have to go to a farm to work.We meet Candy (Curley's wife), Curley, Slim, and Carlson at the farm. Curley is extremely overprotective of his wife. Slim and Carlson work at the farm. Slim gives Lennie one of his puppies. Candy overhears Lennie and George discussing their plans to buy land. He offers to pay his life's saveings if they let him live there also. They make a pact that no one knows of.Slim goes to the bunkhouse to find Curley mad. Curley cannot find his wife, Candy, and is suspicious. Slim yells at Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching foran easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie breaks Curley's hand. Slim warns Curley not to pick on Lennie.The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie, Candy, Crooks, and Curlye's wife are still at the farm. Curley's wife sees the cuts on Lennie and suspects that Curley and Lennie have been fighting. She comes to this by noticing the cuts on Curley also. This amuses her. The next day, the puppy Slim gave to Lennie is killed by Lennie by one of his stroke attacks. Candy comes to comfort him. Lennie tells her that he likes to pet soft things, so Candy lets him stroke her hair. I think we know where this is going.My favorite character is Lennie. He is just so innocent that I like him. He doesno mean any of the things hedoes. I do not like Candy because she was trying to get Lennie in trouble with her husband and was amused that the men got into a fight. That is just wrong. My favorite part in the book is the ending. I cannot tell it to you because that will just ruin it for you! I would change the ending.The book is good. I recommend this book to anyone that likes to read. I feel the way Lennie does at the end of the book. He feels bad and so do I. Also, I can relate to George and Lennie because they are best friends and I have best friends also. I think a person that gets emotional a lot will like this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Set in Depression-era California, &quot;Of Mice &amp; Men&quot; is perhaps the most cleanly and concisely written of the great American novels. Reading it, in fact, is more like reading a short story or, more precisely, a tragic play. (Note how Steinbeck begins almost every chapter with a description of the place in which the chapter's events unfold, almost like stage directions.) Steinbeck's creation of the man-child Lennie Small, his description and development of the dream shared by Lennie and his guardian-friend George Milton, and the foreshadowed, heart-wrenching conclusion are all sublime.A must-read and must-own. (And wonderful to read outside on a beautiful afternoon in September, with sunlight like California's all around. Feel free to call in sick ...)"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Twice, once in a Junior High English Class and again in High School I was required to read John Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men.\\" Each time I have read it since, I have enjoyed it more and more. It is a brief, easy-to-read but emotionally resonant novel about two migrant workers set in the California countryside. As with most of Steinbeck's classic work, the prose is very discriptive while not being clunky or overly verbose. The themes of friendship and brotherly love are apparent on every page and aren't as emotionally manipulative as many books that try to be today. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read. Unlike many alleged \\"classics\\" I've been forced to read in class its actually a great book and I had no problem reading it outside of class (I couldn't say as much for A Farewell To Arms, but oh well :-) ). I would recommend this book for anyone from a mature junior high reader up. The violence might be a little much for someone younger than that (and might be a reason why the book has been, unfortunately, banned so many times)."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This one's the most touching, in my view, of all Steinbeck's contributions to small joys in my life. The trap of human experience snaps shut too soon on two men you rapidly come to love."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and men, by John Steinbeck, is the tragic story of two men who share the same dream of someday owning a farm. it was written in 1937, a time when certain topics we consider acceptable would be considered contriversial. one topic that the story explores is mental retardation, which probably was a new and scary topic to explore at that time. Racism was addressed throughout the book, a topic that probably wasn't shown in literature at that time. Finally, sexuality was talked about many times in the novel. I can imagine that this was a major reason why the book was banned. Because of its themes of mental retardation, racism and sexuality, Of Mice and Men was banned from bookshelves.One theme that would be considered controversial from a social and moral standpoint is mental retardation. Lennie, one of the principal characters, suffers from this illness. in 1937. the time when the book was written, it is possible that retardation was an idea that wasn't addressed very often. When Steinbeck wrote about it in Of Mice and Men, people didn't know how to deal with it. At the time, people who were mentally retarded were put in hospitals and often didn't live normal lives. But Steinbeck wrote the book in a way that Lennie lives a fairly normal life, with some help from his companion George. This theme is also the cuase of Lennie's downfall. When he kills Curleys wife, all the men wanted to kill him. George killed him so that he wouldn't have to suffer a horrible death.With Lennie dies the two friend's dream of owning a farm of their own.Another Controversial theme that is explored in the book is racism. Crooks is the only black man on the ranch that George and Lennie work on. he has a crooked back because when he was a kid he was kicked by a horse. Throughout the book, the men on the ranch refer to him as a nigger. He is not allowed to be with the men unless he is working or playing horseshoes. He lives alone because he is not allowed to have a bunk with the other men. But Crooks is used to this because he has faced racism his whole life. Through the character is Crooks, Steinbeck is trying to draw attention to the problem of racism and the alienation of the result of prejudice.Throghout Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck makes many sexual references. George would always say to Lennie that is he didn't have to look after him that he would be able to go to whore-houses every once in a while. Also, whenever the men on the ranch would talk about Curly's wife, they would call her a tart, which is another word for a whore. People in the 1930's were very conservative about sex. They weren't as open about it as we are today. When Steinbeck brought these sexual references to his novel and people read it, they must have been uphauled to see it in literature. People would just ban the book because they were not used to reading the sexual themes.Of Mice and Men was banned when is was published for many reasons. But the main reasons are for themes of mental retardation, racism and sexual references. People were not willing to deal with these subjects publiclylike we do today. The novel pushed the boundries and said what was not supposed to be said It is a great novel and it has made an amazing positive contribution to the literary world."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck truly outdone himself this time by writing one of best pieces of literature ever recorded by the English tradition. This is a story about two guys named Lenny and George who live in the 18th century and just try to make enough money to survive. They encounter many problems but they also make friends along their journey. George has a problem dealing with Lenny because of Lenny's mental illness and because he gets George in trouble too much. Steinbeck really makes you feel like you're in the book with the characters and adds a sense of setting that we can all picture in our minds.I was never able to put down this book because I always wanted to know what would happen next. The suspense is unimaginable and the story seems so real that it's almost like Steinbeck was actually there following George and Lennie around. Read this book and you will discover the hardship of life in the 18th century for Lower Class men with no families, no home, and no long term job. They have to move on to job to job and get paid about 15 cents a day. They also encounter a lot of danger throughout the story and makes the reader wonder what will happen next.

It sounded like George and Lennie were good friends. Sometimes while reading I felt bad for Lennie. I liked the way it was written, but the cursing was pretty bad. I just liked the way they were always together. For some reason I liked really Lennie. It felt like I knew or have known someone like him. I think he was a little miss treated in the book, but its only a book. It kind of made me feel sorry, but I don't know why. George seems like a real nice guy for Lennie to travel with.

This is a story about two completely different men who are as close as brothers. George is a small, wiry man who travels around from state to state working on different ranches, earning up some money. Once the work is done at one ranch, he moves onto another. Most of this story takes place on a ranch just a few miles south of Soledad, California. Lennie is the mentally challenged gentle giant who George looks after. George is a caring man, and promised Lennie's Aunt Clara that he would look after Lennie; so Lennie tags along with George and works very hard. While the two are working at this ranch near Soledad, disaster strikes. One day, Lennie was sitting in the barn playing with a new puppy he got, when the boss's son's wife came into the barn and started talking to Lennie. Lennie was in love with soft things, and when this girl mentioned how soft her hair was Lennie wanted to grab it, and he did. This sent the girl into a panic, and when she jerked away she broke her neck. Lennie got scared and ran away, but the girl's husband went after him. Lennie was killed because of his mistake. This book has a tragic ending, but it is a great story that shows how important friendship really is."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Despite the length of this novel, it contains a powerful plot that will leave any reader heart-broken. The author describes the settings in such detail you can almost smell the alfalfa. As far as the plot goes, he leaves room for your imagination to fill in the blanks and gives the plot life through drama and issues that any worker would face during the early 1900s. Of mice and men, it is a must-read for any reading level.The setting is based in the early 1900s, where Lennie and George, the two main characters, work for a new employer on a swamp. The author creates great detail not only through words, but also through the actions of other characters. For example, the author never once mentions Lennie's mental disability. Instead, he uses actions and dialogue to show that he is. John Steinbeck is a magnificent author, and he has my regards."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice And Men\\" is one of those classics that demand a certain amount of appreciation; in this case, for John Steinbeck's style. A short yet powerful read with a surprise ending, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" will leave you wondering.\\"Of Mice And Men\\" tells the story of George and Lennie, an unlikely pair of two California drifters. George is small and smart; Lennie is huge and, despite his size, no smarter than a young child. Tied together by a bond of hope and family, they share a single dream: to someday own their own acre of land, making a living for themselves and leaving the hired-hand life behind.Yet Lennie's inability to make the best decisions without George's help can lead to losing jobs and losing their dream. After fleeing from one of Lennie's \\"bad things\\", the two men find themselves on a ranch in the Salinas Valley. If they can just keep the jobs and George can keep Lennie out of trouble, they might just be able to fulfill their dream. But a too-friendly woman and a man itching for a fight stand in their way.True to his reputation, Steinbeck has created a classic book. But in some areas, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" disappoints. Yes, it does have those little twists of verse-like words and descriptions that make Steinbeck's work sparkle. (Notable quote: \\"As happens sometimes, a moment settled and hovered and remained for much more than a moment...\\")But the ending will completely throw you off. It's totally unexpected, and the tension leading up to it is a little shallow. Overall, I felt that the book didn't go quite deep enough for it to be really, truly stunning.Due to the character choice and setting, I found it hard to connect to real life. I couldn't really get that in-the-book feeling that you can find in books where you really connect with the main characters. For me, that really lessened the amount I liked this book.This book is best for older readers; kids in middle school may not be able to connect with it; find it boring; or not appreciate Steinbeck's powerful storytelling style.If you're looking for a book full of action and suspense, this isn't the one for you. Likewise, if you want an easier read that ties things up at the ending, you'd be better off elsewhere, despite this book's short page length.

Lenny and George, two complete opposites manage to stick together and care for each other in the hardest of times.

A Must Read!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck writes beautiful prose in this very short book. The story unravels rather quickly and the strong connection one feels with the characters is created from the very first pages. The story is about two friends that travel together looking for work on farms in California. Lennie is a very large man with a feeble mind and George is Lennie's keeper who dreams with Lennie about eventually having a small piece of land where they can have animals and live from it. The book is written using the slang of the 20's and Steinbeck uses incredible imagery throughout the book.

It's impossible to read this without feeling that you have finally accomplished something, like seeing the Grand Canyon or crossing the Atlantic. It is a beautiful tale, written with great economy, and incredibly has little or no purpose beyond its universe of emotional trial and loss. There is no ideological mission, no politically correct mission. There is no propaganda, which is an incredible thing, given its subject matter. Here we have the real McCoy. In case you had forgotten why books were written or why people read them, take the afternoon off and give this a whirl. You've got two characters, there is lots of love, and then there is a killing."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men was a excellent book.

George is small and quick-witted. George takes care of Lennie, but Lennie always finds ways to get them in trouble.

The other main character, George was a tiny, smart guy. George was taking care of Lennie because his Aunt Clara had asked him to when she died. My favorite character was Lennie, because he was very funny. I really enjoyed this book because you never really knew what was going to happen next, kind of like a mystery.

The setting is mostly on the ranch, where they meet some ranch handlers.I see this book as an adventure, and really fun and sad at times. My favorite thing said in the book was, \\"I wanna tend to the rabbits George.\\" Their dream is to \\"live off the fat of the land,\\" just to have a place of their own, and no boss.

There are conflicts and solutions all at the same time.My favorite character was Lennie because even though, he was really mentally retarded, he was kind and did nothing out of harm. He knew that George loved him by giving tough love while on the ranch. All he thought about was the rabbits. \\"I get to tend the rabbits\\" was my all time favorite quote because he always said it to remind himself what he was going to do when they got off the farm.

The main idea is that Lennie, who is short tempered, and very big, and George, who is small and in charge of things, go on an adventure to get money and \\"Live off the fatta' the lan'.\\" Most of the setting takes place at a small ranch with many more characters, and in the woods. I thought this story was very appealing when it came to the settings.Although the story was very exciting and fun, there were a few sad and suprizing parts which you will love if you read it. My opinion on the book was that the beginning was kind of boring, but got better as you went along. Some of the language in the book is used from before I was born and there was cussing in it too. I guarentee that by the end of the book, you will remember the names Lennie and George. I hope you will read this book!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I first read this book in High School, after a couple of years I decided to read it again.

I feel that it would be impossible for a reader not to be totally involved with the characters presented within the pages. Steinbeck does a wonderful job of painting a picture with words, and this book is no exception. And, I'll wager that even you guys may shed a tear or two before it's over. The only advice I have to give is, make sure you read this book before watching the movie, and allow your imagination to run wild."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George and Lennie are two guys who travel together from one farm to another for work. George made a promise to Lennie's Aunt Clara to take care of Lennie.

He can't talk to the boss' son, Curley because George has a feeling that he's going to start trouble. Curley's wife, jail time waiting to happen, live on the plantation and Lennie gets into some trouble with her.This book was great. It was easy to read, and hard to put down. John Steinbeck describes his characters very well. I liked Lennie because he's so innocently stupid. He loves soft things and things that are beautiful. It was one of our required reading books in tenth grade and I wish that I \`d read it then."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"of mice and men\\" is a wonderful story about two friend companions who struggle to survive together while moving from job to job. Both characters have the dream of buying their own land so all their troubles can end. One of the characters, Lennie is mentally challenged , George is like his older brother for he takes care of him. Since Lennie is mentally challenged he causes many problems everywhere they go to find work. Lennie's incredible strength and mental difficulties prove a thread to everyone and everything that surrounds him, even his loved ones. Unfortunately the only thing they find is trouble when they get to the farm they are headed. The ranch owner's son, Curley is very ill tempered and sees Lennie as a thread for him and his wife. This gives the story a twist that leads to a shocking ending. John Steinbeck truly captures the emotions and thoughts of these two characters, it lets you see how it is to be isolated from everyone , and also how it feels to have an enormous weight on your shoulders of having to care for someone every where you go. I really recommend this book for it is a very touching story and the relationship between lennie and goerge is just beautiful and amazing. This is truly a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"What is great about this novel is it's simple plot yet complex psychological interplay of the characters who affect each other like a woven mesh. All of them have good intentions but tragedy was inescapable. Real life stuff. Great read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"When I first picked up this book I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. I did the one thing you shouldn't do, I judged a book by its cover. As soon as I started reading my mind was changed. I felt attached to Lenny but I also felt George's pain for having to be with him at all times. The book also teaches history. It describes what it would be like to live like George and Lenny. I have a strong attachment to this book because it was the first book I read that brought a tear to my eye."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Has it been a while since you've read a book that you'll always remember? The book Of Mice and Men is just that, one you'll never forget! It's about two men named Lenny and George. They travel from work farm to work farm trying to get work. When they end up at a work farm, and things seem great, they even make plans for the future with another man they met at the work farm. An accident happens that will change their plans, and even the way they thought they felt about each other.Lenny is a fairly large man, and isn't the smartest person alive. Although he has a very kind heart, he accidentally tends to kill mice. Lenny, always does what he is told, or at least when he remembers what he is told. Lenny doesn't have the best memory either. Even with Lenny's small faults, he's a very believable character. However, George isn't as believable. George is a lot smaller than Lenny, but very smart. He takes care of Lenny and himself, trying to keep both of them out of danger. That still doesn't change the fact that George would tell Lenny to do dangerous things, so he could look smart. Also, George doesn't think Lenny is responsible and would never give Lenny the money that he earned working on the farms.I absolutely recommend this historical fiction book. Once you read the first two chapters, you're hooked on the book! I think what made me enjoy the book so much was the very ending, how much of a twist it had, and how it made the reader feel. On a scale of one to ten, I'd rate this book a nine. This book is one of those books that will just leave a mark. Books don't get any better than that!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Short enough to be considered a must read for everyone but still a compelling story. Another steinbeck instant classic every bit as good as Cannery Row or The Pearl"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book I read was Of Mice and Men. It was written by John Steinbeck. The main conflict of this book was for these two men George and Lennie to make their dream of farming their own farm and where they could raise rabbits come true. They would travel from farm to farm and do work on different farms to make their living.In this book there were many things I liked and a few things I didn't like. The book was very exciting to read. It was so exciting because I was always wondering what was going to happen next and I didn't want to put the book down. I really felt like I was actually in the book. I felt this way because Steinbeck described everything so well, and I could picture every scene that happened. The main conflict interested me a lot. It interested me because there were many obstacles that Lennie and George had to face throughout the book and I just wanted to see if they could make their dream come true. I thought that the characters felt very real. They seemed real because Steinbeck gave the right amount of descriptions about each of them. The ending was very satisfying. It was a bit sad and I think it could have been better but if it ended differently the book wouldn't have been as good.The author John Steinbeck's writing style is unusual. The author's voice is a narrative style and it's written in the way the characters actually spoke. The characters talk like poor, uneducated people. The author uses vocabulary in an interesting way. He uses poor grammar and slang words to speak like the characters. The author uses a lot of dialog in this book. The two main characters speak to each other a lot. I think that the author is a very good writer because I could actually hear the voice of the characters. He describes things but he doesn't go overboard to make it boring.Compared to other books that I have read I would rate this book an eight out of ten. I give it this rating because it was a very good book and held my attention but there were a few parts he could have changed, like the ending. I recommend this book to any guy or girl. It is a very fast and good read.Overall this was one of the best books I have ever read. I would put this book in my top twenty favorite books. I've read another book by Steinbeck called The Pearl that I didn't really enjoy. I hope other books by Steinbeck are this god. Some other things that happened in this book was that Lennie wasn't very educated and George would always have to look out for him. Lennie loved to pet soft things. He would catch a mouse put it in his pocket and pet the mouse and squeeze it so hard that the mouse accidentally died. This would upset George a lot."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In less than one hundred and ten pages John Steinbeck will acquaint you with an entire farm full of people and make you believe that each person filling it is a desperate loner. In the same number of pages some authors use to kick off a story, Of Mice and Men builds such suspense that you'll develop the hiccups with the irregular breathing you'll take up from holding your breath and then exhaling. This is Steinbeck's most well known novel, and although it is heavy on dialogue, it's entirely about loneliness, and about the inherent flaws in everything down to nature itself.A few miles south of a city named Solitude in the Spanish tongue, sit Lenny and George: Two wandering immigrant workers desperately clinging to their own American dream of someday living off the fat of their own piece of land. The latter is scrappy and sharp and with a quick wit while the other is a large dull man with the intelligence of a child and the innocence to match. They're both on the run and need new jobs, and so they turn into a farm and make friendly with the cast of characters.Since this is a short book, anymore would be a spoiler that would jeopardize the readers' incentive to pick up this fine novel. I can tell you that it's written beautifully. It is a book of Men and Mice, of dogs and rabbits, of jealous husbands and discontent wives, of old men and young fit farmhands, and then despair. I can't read the first page without hearing classical music and I stop every time to think of the warm water flowing through the river splashing against my face, the sun beating down on my head, and the feel of the grass by the river bank. None of the characters' emotions are ever described, but you feel them at every turn. Your heart will twist with the plot and you might even feel the thermostat drop a bit when you've hit the last page.The story's fast pace might buck you occasionally. In the name of expediency Steinbeck would have characters pop in and out of each others life in a very convenient - and unrealistic - matter as though he were writing a play, which this story was to be originally. If I didn't enjoy the quick transition from one scene to the next so much, I might consider this a flaw, but considering the alternative (having characters and the readers bumble around for pages on end) I can forgive it and see it as a quirk. John Steinbeck has captured the quick clip manner of writing and penned a classic. His book has touched countless with his study of the universal theme of loneliness and will doubtless bound countless more to his pages. This is a timeless classic and one you can read in a single sitting."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Set in the 30's, right after the Great Depression, Of Mice and Men, takes place in Salinas, California, mainly circling around 2 field laborers, Lennie and George.They are the complete opposite. Lennie is gigantic, like a huge gorilla, but has the mind of a kid. While Lennie, is rather short, and 'dark of face', seemingly 'sculpted precisely.' The 2 may seem to make a very unlikely, and dysfunctional pair, but in fact, they are reasonably good friends, but at times, argue a lot. Maybe at the fact of Lennie being a bit retarded, for when he was only a young kid, he got his head banged real hard on something.But either way, they cling to each other, in the ugly face of alienation and loneliness. They get work when they can, for they have a grand plan. To own a few acres of their own land. The whole package. Have their own log cabin, a vegetable field, a cage for the rabbits, for Lennies loves those rabbits, generally their own land they can roam freely upon without hesitation or reluctance or fear.But when they start working around Salinas, for the boss of the son of a guy named 'Curley' whos only bent on giving George and Lennie, especially Lennie, a hard time, their dream, now really appearing to be merely a dream, begins crumbling before their eyes. It is within their posession; their grasp of harnessing and achieving. But when it is all said and done, not even George can prevent Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things he firmly taught him to follow, nor the seductive grace of a beautiful woman--Curley's wife.This was my first John Steinbeck book that I have read and finished, and for deciding to pick the book up and read it in the first place, I am very glad for that. After finishing it, I was granted with a heightened sense of admiration and respect toward the author, and I plan to read many more of his books. Read this book--not only for entertainment and insight into things, not to mention that A grade in your English class, if you ever happen to stumble on having to read this book or having a mandatory book report assigned on it--but also for the heightened sense of love for literature and admiration and respect towards the author, which this book gave me, and I gurantee, will also give you if you read it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George and Lennie are best friend.

The style of writing was the hardest part to understand.

Lennie is an extremely large man, but he is not to smart. George is a small man, but he is smart, so he watches out for Lennie.The two man men are drifters. They travel around to different ranches.

I was recently touched by means of words in merely a book. No more than three weeks ago I finished this book, and I must admit that while reading the book, it did not grasp me. Yes, it was able to keep me engaged in the novel and continue reading, but it was not my favorite. That is just the begining. The last chapter touched me in a way I could never imagine possible. Even though I did not rate this five stars, I am sure many of you would. I am sure many of you would rate this ten stars if given a chance. There is so much for one to explore and ponder within this novel, it is fraught with questions. I believe this book can not be missed and I do not usually say this, because I am one to believe that not all people have the same taste for books, as all people do not have the same taste for chocolate, and I recomend this to everyone.

In the book Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck talks about the friendship between two migrant workers, George and Lennie. George is a small, wiry man that cared a lot about Lennie. He is usually the one to make the decisions and plans for their future. In contrast, Lennie is large in size, lumbering, and he has a childlike mind. Lennie&iexcl;s mental disabilities allow him to completely depend upon George for guidance and protection.Both George and Lennie shared a common dream. Their dream is to earn money to buy a farm of their own where no one ever reaches. To make this a reality, they found a job at a ranch. At the ranch, George and Lennie encounter many challenges, and they also undergo many struggles to attain their idealistic dream. The author concludes this novel with a very shocking and unexpected ending.This is a great novel to read. It is a short and entertaining novel that captures the reader's interest. It moves in a fast pace with many excellent descriptions in every scene. The novel was so well written that I was immersed into it. The author explorers the brotherhood in humans, strengths and weaknesses, and the dream we all possesses. Steinbeck clearly illustrated the impossibility to achieve happiness and freedom - the American Dream. I definitely can relate the themes to my daily life.

Smart and witty George finds them jobs, but Lennie has a tendens of messings up things even if he doesnt want to. Of mice and men is a stor of two friends sharing a common dream. But this dream reaches a terrible climax at the end of the book.. Really a good book !"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"On the surface this allegorical tale is a short and simple story about the fate two friends encounter when they hire on in a new ranch to buck barley\`. As Lennie and George are two poor wandering labourers their friendship is based purely on their companionship. The friendship is sustained by its complexity which has evolved as a result of the the influencing factors of the relationship. What makes this friendship very poignant is their awareness that this is their unique asset and that this sets them apart them from the mass of other casual labourers who are sad loners as a rule. George looks after Lennie who is retarded, but also big and awesomely powerful. Lennie doesn't mean any harm but he gets into situations where he becomes confused and he invariably panics. Consequently, the calamitous potential of his physical power looms constantly. One of the first things they witness in the bunkhouse is that an old dog, the time-honoured companion of the disabled old Candy, is shot by one of the other men with the declared purpose of putting him out of his misery. The dog's owner Candy is against this but gets no support from the others and has to endure the ordeal in a state of crushed acquiescence. They wanted to get rid of him anyway because he caused a smell in the bunkhouse which, of course, puts a question mark over the purity of the asserted altruism (the old story of pragmatism first and principles later). George and Lennie have their own modest version of the American Dream in the shape of a little ten-acre farm they dream about buying. But the \`bindle bum's' existence is a repeating short cycle of earning a little and then frittering it away on short-term whims to make life bearable. When Candy hears about the little farm he informs them of his savings and asks to be part of it. The sudden and very unexpected feeling that the realisation of the dream is within their grasp causes a sort of incredulous euphoria and the mantras are repeated more often and more zealously. But catastrophe is always looming and when it happens, George saves Lennie from a terrifying ordeal by taking Lennie's life at that moment when Lennie is in a state of bliss, induced by George, dreaming of the farm. This novella is written in a very concise manner. In spite of the brevity, the story and the characters are plausible. The themes seem to me to definitely have a universal aspect but they are also unique to the setting."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck is the master of targeting the deepest emotions that we can experience each and every day. In Grapes of Wrath it was poverty. In Of Mice and Men it is the depth of friendship. How far are you willing to go to honor the bond that you have forged with your best friend? This classic is short, three or four hours worth of powerful dialouge that will leave you breathless. Skip the Sunday matinee' this weekend and read a true winner."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men by John SteinbeckThis story is about two men, Lenny and George, trying to make a living on their own. Smart and witty George finds them jobs, while slightly retarded Lenny helps accomplish the work with his ox-body structure. When tragedy hits this motivated duo, Lenny goes into hiding. The book ends in a terribly sad game of cat and mouse.This book was slow-paced at first, but the tables turn as you get further into the story. The characters were well portrayed and the conflicts of the story are exciting and keep you on the edge of your seat. The plot thickens after a while and forces you to keep reading; its hard to put this book down! Of you like classics with twists, turns and devestating disaster, this book is for you. I hope you enjoy this novel!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is an excellent book with a sad ending. The book focuses on two main characters George and Lennie. George and Lennie have a great friendship throughout the book, which inspires all. The reason they have such a great friendship is because George takes care of Lennie. Lennie is a lovable character that turns out to be a little slow and without George would not survive. George must treat him like a kid throughout the book just to try and keep Lennie out of trouble. These two friends are constantly getting into trouble in the book, but it is usually an accident. Lennie is behind all the trouble, and even though he is a strong and gigantic man, he really is very loving and kind. The two men go around working on farms so they can save up enough money to by their own farm. This dream is what motivates them and sets them apart from all others in the book. (...)This was an excellent story ending in tragedy. You immediately fall in love with George and Lennie and their close friendship. As you learn about Lennie more and discover his very loving inside, you appreciate greatly what George does for Lennie. George is the definition of a friend and you do not find out until the end just how much he cares for Lennie. (...)This book was on the banned book list because of its language. The language was too much at times, but did offer a taste into how life really was. It was not needed though to reveal the theme of friendship at the end. So I can understand why this book would be challenged. I myself enjoyed it to the highest degree, and therefore would recommend to anyone who would not mind the language."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was a very intriguing novel. There were both strengths and weaknesses to either the plot, charaterization, and readability. The book was a very easy and smooth book to read.The book was about the life of a man whose mind seemed intangible. The story plot did not quite explain how he got that way, however, did make some excuses for the way he was acting. In the beginning or throughout the book, the story did not explain how Lennie's Aunt died. Throughout the book, though, I got a pretty good feel for who Lennie was and how he thought of certain situations.This book held my interest during the whole book because of its dialog, characters thought process, and the question what what would happen next. John Steinbeck did an excellent job of showing the good sides of egotistical people and how they deal with others.This was a great book to read and would be really good for a sequel. It showed that there are different types of people in the world and that there are conflicting personalities at times. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to just sit and read a book in one sitting."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I've never had to work on a ranch, but I got a chance to when I read OF MICE AND MEN, by John Steinbeck. Through the entire book I also felt the great bond of friendship between Lennie and George, the main characters. The friendship is always present, in good or bad times, until the last act pulls the two apart.Of all the characters, I'm only going to tell you about the three of them that stick out in my mind. The first of these three is my favorite, Lennie. I like him because of his attitude towards everything. He is presented as a lovable dolt with the mind of a child and the body of a giant. He underestimates his strength quite a few times, the last of which gets him killed. Lennie will do anything George says. George id a small man will sharp, quick, features. He and Lennie were originally traveling to California together because Lennie had gotten in trouble and needed someone to look after him and George wanted money. They both want a farm they can live on together. The last character I have is Curly, a mean-hearted man and the rancher's son. He is also the first person Lennie hurts."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I had to read Of Mice and Men as summer reading for my freshman year in high school. It's a very good book. Overrall, I enjoyed it. There were just some little things I couldn't handle. Because I'm very sensitive, I wasn't comfortable with certain scenes in the book. I had trouble reading those parts and I couldn't understand why it happened that way. John Steinbeck did a good job on this one, on the other hand. It's well-written and interesting, it just has some flaws. I still own the book and I still read it every now and then. But it will never be classified as one of my favorite books. I recommend it for anyone, but if you're like me, and you have trouble reading about violence and troubling scenes, you might want to hold off for awhile. I don't want anyone to miss out on a book like this, but I don't want anyone to become upset over it, either."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Most people have read this book already - most likely because they had to in school.

The first time around I liked it. But that was all. I just liked it. This second time around, I realized that I love the book.It's Steinbeck's style to write simply. Those that are wise know that it's not truly simply. There's a moral to everything he writes-there's a message. I learned a lot through this simply written book.Our two main characters are Lenny and George.George: Quick-witted and hard working. He's a man with a dream and he's determined to get there. He hasn't always been this way, and his perspective has drastically changed over the years.Lenny: A simple minded man. He doesn't understand the world around him and he uses George as a crutch. He's a big guy who usually scares people and he has a habit to ruin things by mistake. Thus, he's a loving person.Once again, the pair has been run out of town because of Lenny's misunderstanding. George intends to raise enough money to get their own place and be relatively far away from society. This is the their last hope. The question is, can Lenny handle it?This is, of course, an American classic and for good reason. There is so much depth and reason. I loved reading the short tale and as mentioned, I learned a lot and gained insight."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Classical short American book, The story develops in the California State ranches during hard economic times where migrant workers long to attain the American Dream having not a cent in their pockets, The development of the main characters, George a wise migrant worker and Lenny a mentally disabled fellow at his care is rather good as well as the depictions of the settings around the town of Soledad in Central California which surpasses the quality of the plot which was all the way fitted to suit a climax in the tragic ending from whose I could not grasp its underlying message. Friendship, the American Dream, Justice, and racism are all element and values that have shaped the American nation to the current time and are subtly touched in this book as a part of the scene where the action takes place"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"One of my all-time favorite books. Appropriate for maybe thirteen years and older. But don't at all think this is a book intended for teens, it's got some adult themes and has a crazy ending worth reading."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Thought of as one of the great novellas of our time Of Mice and Men promised much. I never read this in school; but I have read Steinbeck, especially the masterful Grapes of Wrath. This entire story takes place in about 24 hours. We are warned early of Lennie's great strength and his mental slowness and every act in the book leads to his death at the hand of his friend George at the end.In one scene in the middle of the book Lennie and George begin to realize their dream of owning a farm only to see it dashed about 20 pages later. I just didn't care. I certainly had a hard time picturing Lennie; a man so strong he can crush a man's hand in his own and snap necks by accident. I also have never known anybody with Lennie's type of mental problems before. Learning disabilities are varied and complex. Lennie was described in a way that I had no reference point, I just couldn't picture the character. Being so short there was little time for me to develop a love and interest in the characters and their destinies. Lennie and George felt very two dimensional in a character-driven drama."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book was shipped very quickly, and I appreciate that so much. This was required reading for my daughter, who is a freshman in high school. I also appreciated the fact that it was much more economical, than purchasing a new copy. The book was a little rough, as far as appearance goes, but it is definitely usable! Thank you!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men was a fairly good book. I just read it for my Honors English 9 class for my reading list over the summer, and I knew pretty much what was going to happen since my sister read it a few months ago for her English 9 class, but it was still a very good read. There were parts in the story that at first i didn't understand why that needed to be in the book, but they are actually really important in the overall story and they help to understand why certain things are happening.Everyone who worked at the farm didn't really know what was wrong with Lenny, but they still accepted him for who he was and didn't judge, so that made me wonder what it would be like if everyone was like that now. There is always someone who has to be a jerk and try and ruin someone's life, and in this book it was definitely Curley. Everyone was fine with Lenny until the end when they realized what he could do, and then they took things way overboard.If you're planning on reading this book, then I strongly suggest having some tissues with you at the end."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read this book yesterday and I am still reeling from the effect that the ending had on me.I have a friend who hates books that make her feel anything. She says she reads for entertainment and not to educate herself. If you are one of those people (those simple, scared people) then don't read this book. It'll break you. I don't think that I breathed once during the last chapter.But if you're a person that wants to broaden your horizons and learn something about the world from a book, I suggest you read this book right away.I will never be the same. And I'm glad of that."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was the only book I've ever read that made me cry.

It is an amazing novel and I strongly suggest you read it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of the Steinbeck books I've read this year, Of Mice and Men is far and away my favorite, maybe even my favorite book of all time. The story itself is incredible-- two men of the poor working class wandering from town to town and job to job, hoping to raise enough money to one day buy that piece of land they've always wanted. Lenny's character is the most dynamic in the book, and through his childishness and puerility you find yourself very attached to him. I won't ruin the ending for anyone reading this, but I will say that there is no happily-ever-after ending."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"After studying this for GCSE in England I was amazed, a book which really touched the depths of my heart. Don't miss out on this stunning book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is without a doubt one of the most beautiful stories ever told. Over and above Steinbeck's recurring theme of the tragedy within the poor working class, he was able to grab at the heart of compassion within every human being. I think it is impossible for anyone not to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The story tells of two men who are almost opposites but still share the same dream of having their own piece of land. Georg wants it for the freedom of being his own boss and as a refuge from roaming between farms. Lenny wants it to fill a simple longing, to tend rabbits. The two of them travel in a world of lonely men who don't seem to have any reason for living and don't have the drive to change this themselves. But those that Lenny tells of the dream want to share it and contribute towards making it come true. Even the retarded Lenny becomes some kind of a leader because he offers a dream of a better life. But the dream is broken by a involuntary chain of events that plays on Lennies weaknesses.Georg goes to extremes in helping Lenny and never gives up. In the end he resorts to the only means left to protect Lenny from the raging men who want to torture him by &quot;shooting him in the stomach&quot;. I thought that even though the end was sad and full of broken dreams it was the most beautiful part of the story because it culminated the love and friendship of Georg, who killed Lenny out of pure love, friendship and protectiveness. A strange paradox.The only point that I find to be weak in the story is that it doesn't really explain why Georg is so protective of Lenny. He says he does so because his aunt asked him to and for that reason alone he gives up his opportunities of a stable live and a woman to love and is forced in to wandering because Lenny keeps getting them into trouble. For a guy like Georg that is intelligent and well liked by others I don't find this promise to be a strong enough reason. In fact is was unreasonable of the aunt to burden him with this promise."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of mice and men was one of the greatest books I have ever read. It was a tragic and enticing book. I would give it a 10 and recommend it to anyone. the two main characters are George and Lennie. Lennie is huge and George is very small and well defined. They are traveling together to work on ranch. In Weed were they are originally from, Lennie got in some trouble after touching a girls soft red dress. She began screaming and Lennie got so scared all he could do was hold on.

The character Lennie holds a place in all our hearts as we traverse the odd little ranch-hand world of the early 1900s. This story takes you back into the lives of two of the most intriguing characters readers will ever come across. The plot twists and turns through interesting predicaments, one after another. Only to arrive at its gripping, and depressing, yet cheering, but melancholy, and still joyous ending; all wrapped up with a sense of foreboding that makes you wish for a sequel...but want to let it be at the same time.

Steinbeck offers a simple narrative that appears to answer many questions, but the real answers probably hide between the lines - explicit explanations are few and far between. The characters and events are soberly presented, and this only serves to further obfuscate the multiple layers of a book which, through its suggestive terseness, borders on myth. In fact, myth itself is built into the work under the guise of a dream that George conveys to Lennie, and then to the old Candy; a dream that gradually loses its significance for the very man who devised it. \`Of Mice and Men' is that dream: hope alternates with sadness, and it's not entirely clear if there will be a resolution, after all."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George and Lenny are two men traveling while striving to support themselves and make a home together. The message that I gathered was that high hopes and dreams for a better future could make a miserable today more tolerable. The main characters are George and Lenny. They are best friends and watch over each other as they travel together. Lenny is unable to take care of himself because of his mental disabilities. George sees him for who he is and is his true friend regardless of the negative things Lenny does. Lenny is an extremely large man and does not understand his strength and the harm he is capable of causing. This leads him to the conflicts that occurred between Curley and his wife. This is the one thing that Lenny did that could not go unpunished for. It is George that did the right thing for his friend Lenny in the end.I can really relate to this story from a personal experience of my own. My good friend from my childhood always had so much going for him. I don't think he even realized all that he was worth and capable of. Based on his actions it was plainly obvious that he did not see this. He started using drugs, then selling drugs, and then the last straw was when he put himself in the hospital by overdosing. His parents were blinded by what a good kid he was; they didn't understand what was happening. I knew he would be upset with me for telling on him, but it was the most loving thing I could do to save him from his destructive path. He is now clean and sober and has numerously thanked me for caring enough to bring the problem to the surface. So, like George, I looked past what I didn't want to do and did what was best for my friend.I really enjoyed reading this book because Steinbeck was so descriptive with his choice of words in this novel. I could actually picture each event in the story like I was watching a movie, but better. I love books like this because they are the ones that I can't put down, which makes reading so enjoyable. My favorite parts of the book are every time George and Lenny talk about their dream of having their own farm with the rabbits. It seemed like such a beautiful dream. It made me wish that I had a farm of my own. I didn't like how the novel ended with George and Lenny because they were so close and I hoped that they would remain friends forever. I wouldn't change anything about this book because it was written by a great author and is a classic, even today. It ended just the way it was meant to because any other way would not have given the same message about friendship.I think that everyone should read this book at least once in their life because it is an excellent work of literature. It is full of excitement and adventure that would keep anyone's mind occupied and entertained. This novel is not really directed to a certain type of person. Each character is different and unique. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a great book that I enjoyed very much. Basically, it is about two friends named George and Lennie who try to live and work in a normal life. George is short, but very intelligent while Lennie is the opposite; he is tall and strong. However Lennie also had a mental disability that severely impacted his and George's goal. Due to the disability, George has to take extra care of Lennie and show him what's right and wrong. The only thing he couldn't stop was Lennie's love of petting soft things, like animals. This was a bad thing because Lennie always accidentally kills anything he pets. This aspect of the disability and the disability in general lead to many difficulties in George's life and many conflicts with the locals. Of Mice and Men is a book filled with suspense and action that will keep the reader flipping through the pages.As you all may know, Of Mice and Men is currently banned from schools for reasons that are unknown to me. Whatever those reasons may be, I stand firmly by my position that the novel should not have been banned. The only reason I can think of to ban the novel is that it morally sets a bad example for the readers. One of its many themes is that frustration can have an impact on people, like George. Using this theme in his novel, Steinbeck sends a message to the reader saying anything (and I mean ANYTHING) that gets in the way of living a nice, normal life should be eliminated. Despite the negativity of this message, I believe that every person who reads this novel is old and mature enough to not take that message too seriosly and to not implement it in their lives. In my opinion, there are only two reasons why people read. One is for the sheer fun and enjoyment of it. The other is that sometimes, people have to do it in order to get something done. Notice how using a novel's themes in life is not included in the two choices. However, there are exceptions. There are definitely books that DO have an impact on someone's life, but in most cases this does not occur. There aren't too many books in the world that are powerful enough to change the way a person thinks or acts.Speaking of worlds, Of Mice and Men is both positive and negative to the literary world. It's negative because it sends the reader the bad message that was previously stated above. On the other hand, the novel is positive to the literary world because it clearly depicts how hard life is when living with a mentally retarded person that must be monitered constantly. The reader can actually feel the frustration and anger inside of him/her as he/she reads about Lennie doing something stupid again. I know I did when I read about Lennie continuing to pet a rat that he has already killed. A lot of respect and recognition should go to the people who have to deal with people such as Lennie. Also, the novel is positive to the literary world because it's a dang good book. Don't be fooled by the minute size of the book, it's definitely well worth the time to read. :)"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a great book that I enjoyed very much.

Whatever those reasons may be, I stand firmly by my position that the novel should not have been banned. The only reason I can think of to ban the novel is that it morally sets a bad example for the readers. One of its many themes is that frustration can have an impact on people, like George. Using this theme in his novel, Steinbeck sends a message to the reader saying anything (and I mean ANYTHING) that gets in the way of living a nice, normal life should be eliminated. Despite the negativity of this message, I believe that every person who reads this novel is old and mature enough to not take that message too seriosly and to not implement it in their lives. In my opinion, there are only two reasons why people read. One is for the sheer fun and enjoyment of it. The other is that sometimes, people have to do it in order to get something done. Notice how using a novel's themes in life is not included in the two choices. However, there are exceptions. There are definitely books that DO have an impact on someone's life, but in most cases this does not occur. There aren't too many books in the world that are powerful enough to change the way a person thinks or acts.Speaking of worlds, Of Mice and Men is both positive and negative to the literary world. It's negative because it sends the reader the bad message that was previously stated above. On the other hand, the novel is positive to the literary world because it clearly depicts how hard life is when living with a mentally retarded person that must be monitered constantly. The reader can actually feel the frustration and anger inside of him/her as he/she reads about Lennie doing something stupid again. I know I did when I read about Lennie continuing to pet a rat that he has already killed. A lot of respect and recognition should go to the people who have to deal with people such as Lennie. Also, the novel is positive to the literary world because it's a dang good book. Don't be fooled by the minute size of the book, it's definitely well worth the time to read. :)"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I am a 16 year old High School Student who read The book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck as a school outside reading assignment. At first I resented this assignment but after I read the first 15 pages the last hundred flew by all in one sitting. This was a great book. It was a short read that keeps you entertained to the very last page; once you pick it up I doubt that you will ever put it down. One thing that I loved about this book was the relationship between George and Lenny. These were two totally different people. George was a short man with a strutured apperence while Lenny is a very large man with a round and unreconizable apperence. These two friend complete each other in that they compensate for each others errors. For example George is the intelligente one and Lenny is the really dumb one and George is always having to clean up after Lenny's mistakes. Even though sometimes George could be a little mean and unsimpathetic I believe that this was true friendship.This novel takes place in southern California by a town called Weed. George and Lenny are ranch workers that go from ranch to ranch just looking for jobs. There are many very interesting charaters in this novel that add to the story. Curley is a character that adds alot of drama and action to the novel. Curley is the bosses son who was just married and feels that he must prove something to his new wife. He likes to pick on big guys becaues he is a good boxer and is a short man himself, so naturally he picks on Lenny. This fued that goes one way from Curley to Lenny and is very entertaining.In many schools across the country this book was banned. I do not understand why this book was banned because it does not contribute negatively but without a doubt positively to society. It contributes positively because it provides the read with many lessons about friendship and trust. I would highly recommend this novel to everyone of all ages. If you are looking for a short but awesome read for a weekend, because that is all it will take, this is the book for you. Between Steinbeck's deep description and great talent in weaving a tale you'll be more than satisfied with his novel.I rated this book with a five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is about two friends, George and Lennie. \\"George is small and quick and dark of face\\", while Lennie is \\" a man of tremendous size and has the mind of a young child.\\" Lennie has a mental disability, although his devotion to George is very strong. George returns this loyalty and obedience to Lennie. However, Lennie often gets himself into trouble, sometimes harmless and shameless, but other times very serious.This novel exhibits many controversial themes from a moral and social standpoint. One of these themes is that women corrupt and cause evil in society. George, repeatedly through out the book, tells Lennie to keep away from their boss', Curley, wife. George is convinced that she, along with the rest of the women in the world, will cause trouble and are evil. However, Steinbeck portrays her as a helpless character who hates her husband and her life. Although Steinbeck may want her to seem innocent, she is not and her flirtatious actions towards Lennie, virtually, cause her death, as well as his.Another controversial theme exhibited in this novel, is racial segregation. One of the main characters, Crooks, is isolated from the rest of the men on the ranch because he is black. Steinbeck depicts him as a lonely and miserable man. He lives in a room separate from the other men, next to the barn, and is denied the basic rights that the other men have, including playing a simple card game with them. However, Lennie does not understand the problem with skin color and insists on spending time with Crooks. Lennie often gets scolded by George for his actions, but Crooks is left with most of the blame, simply because he is black.Although, this book is controversial, I believe it positively contributes to the literary world. This book is thought provoking and teaches the reader to be thankful for their friends, while accepting others, no matter what race they may be. I would suggest this book to anyone who understands what friendship is and how powerful it can truly be."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Although many people view Of Mice and Men as a classic, there are some who disagree. The novel was banned and challenged in many schools throughout the country because of explicit language and profanity. After finishing the book myself, I strongly disagree. The language used in Of Mice and Men is nothing new, and most definitely not something that teenagers have not already heard before. One of the characters, Crooks, who happens to be an African American, is quite often referred to in the novel as inferior and is treated much differently than the other characters in the novel. That is perhaps another reason why people may have challenged the novel. Personally, I feel that Of Mice and Men positively contributes to the literary world because of its status. Many critics feel that it is a classic and I feel it should be treated as such. The idea of companionship is demonstrated throughout the book, and I feel that is a positive force. As shown in the novel, everyone needs someone to talk to, one cannot go throughout life without friends to confide in and have fun with.

Of course this was a high school book and in high school evidently they feel every book we read either has to deal with a political issue or some sort of horrid death. and of course, this book is no exception. long and short, retarded guy and his not retarded friend are wandering around while he wants him to tell him about the rabbit farm they'll eventually have. then they meet up with a guy's farm, he accidentally kills a slut and...his best friend shoots him in the back of the head. yep. that's about all you need to know. there i just told you the whole story. so if you have to read it for school, just sparknote it. i know people out there will say \\"no, this is an american classic!\\" but let me ask you, WHY is it an 'American classic'? Because it hits political buttons. all these would be classics have something to do with political buttons. books such as to kill a mockingbird, lord of the flies, 1984, all these novels involve horrid deaths for little reason more than to consider them 'classics'. and because five pretentious critics gave these books great reviews back in the 50's, we're now forced to read them even today. For the actual book, it has one of the stupidest endings i've ever read in a novel, the characters are uninteresting, and this should not even be at a garage sale for a quarter, let alone an 'american classic'. of mice and men gets 1 dead friend out of 5"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and MenOf Mice and Men was a good book, I recommend it to anyone who likes a good short book.

I personally felt that he could have done a lot more with this book, even though everyone in the US (practically) read it. The characters, to me, lacked a personal touch, and even though Lennie and George traveled and lived together, there was something missing in their relationship, along with their relationship to everyone else in the book. They lacked a closeness, a togetherness. The story to, me also felt like it was held together by just a few plot &quot;enhancers.&quot; Although Steinbeck described the setting and plot thoroughly, to me it lacked a past, present and future. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; did hold my interest and kept me reading past our deadline.

Curley, for example: an agresive and unsensible guy, Candy a respected and very sensible person, Curley's wife, a lonely woman, who needs afection.

The one I most like was Lenny, because besides being mentally retarded, he was a very nice guy. I also like very much the way Steinbeck combined violence with authority and friendship.

As we read the book, we started realising how hard life can be when youre living and working on a ranch. We also realised how important it is to have dreams and someone to share them with. 'Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world ' this frase, is what we think what the whole book is based on. There are several characters in the book that feel recognised by this frase. Such as Candy and Crooks. Candy was an old man that had only one hand. Ever since his dog was killed he started feelling empty and lonely. After coming to an agreement with George and Leannie, he became part of their dream. Violence was a key point of this story. There were many scenes of violence and agression. for example: the last one when George finds Leannie in the bushes and then kills him because Carson and Curly were eventually going to kill Leannie since he had previously killed Curleys wife.

They also have to face lots of troubles, includins the murder of the bosse's daugther in law. Because of this, george has to kill Lennie, if not , he would be violently murdered by the girl's husband.

The relationship between George and Lennie was very complex and interesting. The ending was difficult to understand at first and very sad -- I have to say that I cried because I knew what was about too happen and didn't want to face the reality. But this book was about reality. It showed hard it was to live in the 20's, on a ranch. It showed how tough it was to face life alone, surrounding by people who have spent years covering up thier scars and building up defenses. The dirty language, which I didn't like, was also reality of the situtation, I guess. And in the end, the reality was hard to take. It was a type of love really. If you read what George said in the last couple pages, it becomes clear. He was saying 'I love you Lennie, and I can't bear to have you suffer and know that you'll never get those rabbits. I love you so much that I'll do somthing to you that hurts me more than you'll ever know.' In the end, I think George 'died' that day too.

Both were traveling in southern California looking for work. While traveling they would have quite an adventure. One of the major problems between the two is that Lennie is simple-minded and touching things, like women, and their clothes. Lennie had no control over what he did sometimes. He would do things like tell other people about George and his future plans about buying their own house. Of the two I liked George.George is very short-tempered. He would yell at Lennie and hit him to make him remember and understand things he would tell Lennie. When they were at the river in the beginning George was scolding Lennie about not drinking water that wasn't running and when in trouble to come back by the river and hide in the bushes. Lennie was no smart man, but he tried to listen to George. I remember I would sometimes yell at my little brother because he would do things he had been told not to, but did anyway, like going outside without asking for permission. My little brother wasn't dumb but just wouldn't listen sometimes. I would yell at him not to be mean, but for his own good. Just like George is to Lennie.After reading this book I thought it was good. Good because of how the author started and ended George and Lennie at the same place, which was unique. The two friends were in a forest with different types of animals and a river and at the end they came back because Lennie got into big trouble and went to go a hide. The most interesting part was when Curley and Lennie were fighting. At first, Lennie was getting beattened pretty badly and then all of a sudden Lennie let out his anger. Having a child-like mind Lennie was unaware of his powerful strength. The only part I didn't like of the book was of how Lennie talks about rabbits too many times. That is what I would change about the book if I were the author.Since I like the book I would like others to read it as well. This kind of a book applies to all. It can also teach kids that they can be friends with anyone no matter what kind of a person they are."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I like a variety of authors including this one.

AkkarPeriod: 1Of Mice and Men is a tragic story about the life of two different people. George, a short guy who is really mature, and Lennie, an enormous adult, who thinks like a toddler, have a goal. Their goal is to settle down in a land with many acres after getting a job somewhere successfully. Finally, George gets a job, and he has to protect Lennie from wandering around and his immaturity. Later, George kills Lennie because he knew he could not stand living with Lennie.I liked this book. It shows how two totally different people live together. The character of George and Lennie was interesting in this book. It compares Lennie's immaturity and George's mental adulthood, which made me understand them more. Some examples in the book of their character comparison are when George gets mad at Lennie, who doesn't understand his anger. Quotes, such as,&quot;'I like'em with ketchup.' Lennie said. 'Well, we ain't got no ketchup,' George said&quot;, compares George and Lennie's behavior.George and Lennie's goals were interesting to read about. Their goal was to &quot;live in a small house&quot; where Lennie could &quot;tend the rabbits&quot;. Their dream almost came to life when I read it. It was so descriptive and dramatic. Suddenly, when George killed Lennie, I felt sad, for now their dream was spoiled. This book was so interesting to read.My Favorite part of the book was when George and Lennie got the job. I thought they would not get a job, because in the book, Lennie &quot;lost every job for George&quot;. When they got their job, I was amazed to read how happy they were.

The two pitiful symbiotic characters, George and Lenny, provide for a fun, easy-to-read, yet meaningful storyline. The two migratory ranch hands exchange entertaining back and forth dialogue that only Steinbeck could produce, himself having toiled many long days and hours on California farms and ranches. Through all of their adversity, Lenny and George tragically cling to that which we all do at some point, the American Dream - theirs being \\"to live off the fatta the lan' an' have rabbits.\\" Although not on the same Pulitzer Prize level(but what is?) of The Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men manifests itself as the classic paradoxical tale of hope and despair not to be overlooked."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I was in 9th grade when i read this book for the first time and i was very impressed. In my opinion this book is one of the finest books ever written by an american author(Steinbeck). It takes place in the early 1900's where 2 friends find a job helping out on a farm. They meet several interesting people there and run in to some problems. Throughout this movie they are in search of what they refer to as the fat of the land or the american dream. All around this was a great book and i highly recomend it to anyone who hasn't yet read it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck has been a puffer fish of modern novels. He lacks gravitas and pens the worst endings ever.How mainstream America has come to endorse such a Luddite is beyond my comprehension. (Also America's hugging of John Grisham equally discombobulates me.)I don't know where Steinbeck gets off blasting a dimwit in the back of the head with a pistola. The book was great as far as the character portrayal went, word choice, metaphors, but the ending was jacked.I'm furious to read books such as these. Steinbeck acknowledges a problem with society and so he 'corrects' it. FYI Stein, you can't just kill problems.Lennie is a poor dull-thinking, massive ogre who travels from farm to farm with 'friend' George. They stop at one farm where Curley and his 'soft fist' presides.Curley is a wee man and he picks on Lennie. Lennie counterpoints by shattering Curley hand altogether. The story is entertaining, and going good.Then Lennie gets a little overzealous and kills a woman. Whoops! He had no idea because he is not mentally there. He is a kind man who thinks as a boy and is still trapped in the stage William Blake referred to as Innocence.Steinbeck takes unecessary measures to get Lennie out of the picture and uses George as the tool.I've said it before and I'll say it again: If Steinbeck wrote a proposal for a plan to 'deal with' retards it would be written well but would be substanially devoid of heart and humanity.Nobel Prize or Zombie Lies? Are people actually READING his book? Something seems puffer fish and cursory about his esteemed station in society as a literary great."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book goes back to the depression.

The book opens witht the two friends camping out in the woods while traveleing to their new job location. They are running from an angry mob looking to lynch them since Lennie allegedly \\"raped\\" a women. The truth is that Lennie has the simple mindset of a young child and needs to touch everything to fully understand it. He went to touch the woman's dress and wouldn't let go. Now that Lennie and George are making camp in the woods for the night, Lennie entertains himself by catching mice. He likes to hold and pet them, but he squeezes too hard and the mice keep dying. (At this point, I felt a little betrayed by the title of the novel. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" sounds emotional and philosophical with powerful hidden messages about mankind and life as a whole. Who knew it was a about some big guy who goes around crushing little animals because he likes to pet them?) Anyway, George and Lennie reach the ranch and meet all of the other ranch hands, including Candy (an old cripple in charge of maintenance) and his dog. At the end of the night, when the men return to their quarters after work, they complain that Candy's dog stinks and they don't want him around. They also think that it is cruel to le the dog live in misery, since he is old and bilnd and can't eat, so one of the men takes the dog outside and shoots him in the back of the head. (Get the tissues ready--a real tearjerker!) However, another dog on the ranch has just had puppies, so Candy can raise a new one. Lennie also wants one so that he can hold and pet it. Sure enough, though, Lennie holds the dog too tight and crushes it to death. The boss of the ranch's son, Curley, has a new wife that lives on the ranch. She tries to console Lennie about the loss of his pet by letting him touch her hair. Big mistake--doesn't she know this guy's track record? Anyway, Lennie holds on too tight and breaks her neck. Now a new angry mob--the hands on this ranch--are chasing after Lennie. He ends up back in the woods where the novel started out. (In this sense, the book starts to come full circle.) George has always loooked out for Lennie and tried to protect him, but not this time. George has gun, and shoots Lennie in the back of the head. (Not exactly a happy ending.)Liking and appreciating this book comes with looking at the story in retrospect. Hidden somehwere in this grim tale are messages about relationships, companionship, survival, suffering, and human emotion. The concept of the American Dream is also woven through the book, since George and Lennie have hopes of earning enough money to buy their own land. Their dream seems unattainable, until George kills Lennie and revives his own chances of success. Overall, the story is certainly unique and it's interesting to see how the book became a classic. I haven't put it at the top of my list, but it is a good read. ( And it's real short!) Enjoy."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a story about a man named George and his mentally disabled friend Lennie. Lennie gets into trouble because he loves to pet soft things, but he doesn't know his own strength, and George has to bail him out all the time. Lennie causes harm but he honestly and truly doesn't mean to harm anything, but in the end it costs him a lot.I can relate to George in a way. I have had to resume responsibility for a family member. She was younger than me, and we were close, so I felt like I had a responsibility to act in her best interest. This is the same way George feels about Lennie. He feels responsible for Lennie's actions.What I like most about this book is how there are different types of conflicts. For instance, Crooks had conflicts with the other men because he was black; meanwhile, George has conflicts with himself; he was faced with different problems that only he can solve. For instance, he has to decide for himself how to deal with Lennie. No one can help George with Lennie because they don't know how to handle Lennie. They don't understand him like George. If I could change something about this book I would add more details when major things are happening. For example, I would add more details to the incident that happened with Curley's wife. The author says \\"she struggled violently under his hands. I would have used a metaphor like, \\"she struggled like a mouse trying to escape the grasp of a lion\\" to make the piece more colorful and exciting. I would have used more similes and metaphors to make it more visual and powerful.I recommend people read this book. It has a lot of good conflicts, foreshadowing, and morals. If you are a person who likes stories about friendships, dilemmas, and morals, you will like Of Mice and Men."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is not only my all-time favorite Steinbeck, but probably my all-time favorite book.

I had to read it for school (if I didn't read it I would had a 1) and almost all the class found it boring. It's funny when Leenie (principal characters who does stupid thing. George say's in one part to the owner of the ranch &quot;I'm not saying he's bright, he ain't, but he's as strong as a bull.&quot;) but the theme doesn't make it a pleasure to read. The book is easy to understand and doesn't have difficult words. The story is about to people, George and Leenie, who are itinerant workers who go to one place to another to find job. They have a dream but it's very difficult for them to make it true because of Leenie's dumbness. When they're working in ranch problems happens because of Leenie. The entire story is about that subject. To finish my review ill tell you not to spend your time reading this book when there are better books (unless you have to read it for school). I could only recommended to Steinbecks fans."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I do not know what all of the fuss is about this book. Every single page I read was an absolute yawn.

They are two nomads roaming throughout the state of California for a farm to live off of. The two men's names are George and Lenny. George is a small, keen, bossy type of guy. George tries to be very independent but one day his Aunt asks him to take care of her nephew, Lenny. Lenny is a contrasting character compared to George. Lenny is an outcast to society because he is depicted as to be incapable and inferior to American citizens. Lenny is a tall, robust, mentally challenged human who deep down is very caring and sensitive toward his feelings about George. Although these two men are lower on the social class structure, they have one thing that many people take for granted, hope. Without hope these two men would be the stereotypical poor man trying to live their lives day by day. They find a job on a farm, whose the owner's name is Curly. While George and Lenny work there, Lenny encounters Curly's wife who he was a life changing experience with. After Lenny has the experience, George's life will change forever.I highly recommend this book for all types of readers. This book has loyalty, trust, and most of all friendship. This book is very descriptive and paints visualization in your mind of how the characters are thinking and what the scenery is like. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat just waiting to know what will happen next because it is so intriguing. The book is all around phenomenal and is a classic for middle school- high school kids to read. The author of this book shows the hardship and the mindset of each and every character during the Depression. The only comment I'd like to say about this book is that it needs to be a bit longer. The book is very short which makes the plot go by a lot faster than it should. The ending is the best part of the book. The only way to find out the ending of the book is to read it, but it is a classic. It will leave you stunned and surprised of how the characters lives play out."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book is really great. I really enjoyed reading it. It really showed true friendship between the main characters George and Lennie. Even thought they were different in many aspects. George being the \\"normal\\" one... as for Lennie being mentally handicapped. Lennie even thought being mentally handicaped obeyed George and had great respect for him. And even thought as George had short temper he still managed to control himself and see that Lennie really needs him. As for the case of when Lennie killed the girl, George helped him run away and end his suffering by shooting him behind the head. But George new Lennie was a great guy, not to be a killer. As he, George, said to Lennie on his last moments \\"think about the rabbits\\"... so we now know Lennie died in peace, thinking about his farm full of rabbits.I really recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read about a great friendship. Even though these guys were poor and low classed and had nothing to live for, they still had hope. They still had dreams of one day having/owning a farm of their own. This book is really touching and its great to read. So if your thinking about reading a good book in the future... you should read Of Mice and Men."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George's mentally challenged companion liked to pet soft things.

George explains to one of the hands, Slim, that he used to be mean to Lennie but he can't do that anymore. Lennie is a good worker.

It was an inspiring and affective book, one of the most impressive stories I have ever read. This is a spectacular book based on the best of friends who went through thrilling and sad striking events together. The theme of this book is based on loneliness, which i really can't relate to but have experienced it before. Everyone experiences loneliness once in a while. The characters played impressive parts and they were all acquainted with the theme. the characters that interested me the most were Lenny and Curley's wife. Lenny was a mentally ill-ed strong man who was dependent of George. Curley's wife was a lonely woman because she never had her husband around and she always stood home alone. She was trying to make friends with the only person she new would talk to her, Lenny. She wasn't aware of Lenny's strength and was murdered because of his fetish towards soft things.From the reactions i received myself towards this book I give it five stars.

It was a class requirement but I would've borrowed it from a library or bought it from a bookstore. It is a literary classic about two men trying to survive the great depression. The book also has great context and include passages where you could make world -to -text connections. The format of the book is sequential and foreshadows various times in few events. It also is short (great for those people who don't like to read long novels) and manages to compress a detailed story.

George and Lennie have an unusual bond and travel together, George taking care of Lennie who is mentally disabled. George's life would be much simpler without Lennie, and yet he sticks with him, even fleeing with him from the last ranch after Lennie was accused of rape. George knows Lennie didn't mean any harm; he only likes to touch soft things like mice, rabbits and puppies (and in this case, a girl's dress). Unfortunately his feeble mind and brute strength are often a deadly combination for many of these creatures he loves. The girl was unharmed, but frightened and cried rape. The two men escaped and moved on to another ranch where they found work and dreamed of buying their own farm someday where they could \\"live off the fat of the land.\\"\\"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley.\\" (The best laid schemes of mice and men / Go oft awry.) - a line in a poem by Robert Burns which inspired the title.Steinbeck's writing is simple and descriptive.

The relationship between small George and big dumb Lennie was complicated. George looked after Lennie and I could only imagine his horror in making a decision that would affect both their lives in the end of the novel.The writing is Steinbeck's style. It can be descriptive and detailed about life in California. He uses actual dialect in his writing. This book is used in schools obviously to introduce students to Steinbeck's writing style and plot.The story of Lennie and George is about friendship and family ties. Sometimes, you don't need to be with actual relatives. George promised to take care of Lennie, the lovable giant. Anyway, this book is short and not an easy read. I found the book to be entertaining and enlightening but also tragic, sad, and realistic too."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a novella by the great American writer John Steinbeck. Somehow, I avoided reading this very short work through my years of public education and over the course of 1-2 hours recently rectified the omission, in the course of which, I realized that I had seen a cartoon adaption of the leading characters (\\"I used to have a friend. I petted him and squeezed him and he don't move no more.\\")The book is the tale of two California drifters, George and Lenny; George being the brains behind the duo and simple minded Lenny, a huge beast of a man, the brawn. The two men show up at a Salinas valley farm as day laborers, bringing in the barley harvest in an effort to \\"raise a stake\\" for purchase of their own small farm. Here we meet a collection of characters, richly drawn by Steinbeck, whose interaction lays the foundation for this excellent tale.I compare this work very favorably with Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea, a novella of comparable length and quality. Both are quite short, yet very powerful in the emotions they stir in the reader."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's classic novella \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" a tale of struggle during the Great Depression, follows the unlikely twosome of cynical George Milton and simpleton Lennie Small. The pair's friendship and dependency appears to be dichotomous, but in my opinion it could be argued that either a greater friend or more dependent on the other. Because of Lennie's fondness for petting soft things and getting in trouble, the pair travel from Weed, California to Soledad in order to make their dream of living off the fat of the land come true. Amidst wonderfully described and unique characters, the story of their friendship is superimposed atop various other friendship-themed sub-stories.Much like Steinbeck's usage of dreams throughout the novella, the selection of Gary Sinise as reader is a dream for any listener. His style, tone, and delivery is no less impeccable than what would be expected from an actor so talented and diverse. He conveys the lonely nature of many of the characters, the pervasive desperation of the times.Regardless of criticisms about language and/or questionable material there is no denying the powerful themes in \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" nor is there any doubt of its status in the pantheon classics. Given Sinise's dedication to the source material - he was also in the movie - there is no doubt his rendition amplifies the inherently powerful tones. With a running time of somewhere just over three hours, this is a perfect story to get lost in, to immerse yourself in a simpler time, while on a long weekend drive through rolling, sun-drenched wheat fields.Jason Elin"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"It's easy to see why Steinbeck's classic has been the subject of study for so many years; it's a master-class of literary form. Clean prose and simple storytelling, no added unnecessarys. Even the metaphor is unfussy.But Steinbeck's true gift lies in characterisation and his understanding of dialogue. When his characters speak and act they betray themselves for who they are. The reader listens and sees, gleans a past from the characters' voices and gestures. The power of the novel comes from the intimacy the reader has with these characters, and it's a testament to Steinbeck that in such a short book he reveals so much.Everyone should meet Lennie and George at least once, and if you do, you'll never forget them."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book has a different way of showing love and the relationship between the protagonists.

If for some reason you don't enjoy it, the book is such a classic you will have something wonderful to discuss - your critique on the book.I'd imagine you will simply enjoy this."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I'll say it right up front: If you can read this classic novel without shedding a tear, you are one hardcore, cold, heartless person.Since nearly every kid had to read this one in school, do I really have to give a synopsis of the plot? Okay, just in case: During the Depression, two displaced workers find themselves landing a job on a ranch in California. One of these workers is George Milton, bright but down on his luck. The other workers is Lennie Small, a huge ox of a man who also happens to be mentally disabled. George and Lennie are best friends, with George looking out for Lennie in hopes of keeping the simple-minded fellow out of trouble.Unfortunately, keeping Lennie out of trouble is easier said than done.I'll leave off any further synopsis, for those who have not had the joy of reading this novel. It's truly an American classic that everyone should read.Steinbeck is definitely an opinionated writer, and I've always felt he did a good job of presenting his views without slamming the reader over the head with them. Others, generally those diametrically opposed to Steinbeck's views, often say otherwise. I consider myself middle-of-the-road socio-politically, so maybe that's why I feel the way I do."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men was written by John Steinbeck. It took place in the early 20th century. This story starts off with two characters near a stream. There names are Lennie and George. Lennie is slightly retarded and George is his long time care taker slash best friend. These two friends have a dream of owning there own farm one day. But first they had to make money, so they left on a small journey to find a job. They had a couple of jobs but Lennie couldn't control himself during the jobs so they got fired. They finally found a job at a farm. Lennie got into a fight. But they got to keep their jobs. Lennie messed up again, and accidentally killed Curley's Wife. Lennie ran back to the stream. The other farmers gathered and went to kill Lennie. George got a gun and killed Lennie before the farmers did. But Lennie was happy when he died because he was thinking of their dream farm.For the most part of this book I like it. It was a good story. I liked the conflicts. I felt bad for Lennie, because he's really a genital giant and it's not his fault that he freaks out when people scream. He also couldn't control himself and I felt bad for him because of that. Some thing I didn't like about this book was it said Jesus Christ a lot and that offends me. But other than that the book was easy to read and it was short...that's the way I like it. I liked the tone that the book was written in, old country slang. I like how the author wrote. I do recommend this book if you ever want to read a short and easy book. And overall it was a good book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of mice and men is a classic that will remain in our hearts forever. This is a tale about two friends, Lennie, who is big and strong but suffers from a mental deficiency, and George, the guy who always gets Lennie out of trouble. George wishes he didn't have to deal with Lennie's persistent knack of getting them fired from their work, but on the other side he and Lennie had always been together since Lennie's aunt died. This is a nice short read for people looking for good writing. Steinbeck puts great detail into character development and attitude. The characters in this book I find all have their own unique qualities, even the minor characters. George and Lennie are a perfect example of a ragtag duo seeking work. I hope this book will impress you as much as it did me."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck tells this timeless story, entitled Of Mice and Men, of two fiends who are going from one farming job to another. One of the main characters, Lennie, is mentally retarded and is taken car of by George, the other main character. The two can't keep a job, because of Lennie's illness. He doesn't know how strong he is, and he's very strong, so when he gets mad he inflicts pain upon others, without meaning to. In the climax of the book, Lennie does something that is unchangeable, unwonted, and unforgivable.

Of Mice and Men shows the depth and love between the odd couple in just over 100 pages. My one warning to you before you read this book, it has a very sad ending."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I've noticed in different high schools I have worked at that this book is stil universely read with good reason. I recently went through a Steinback phase after driving by the Steinback museum near Salinas on the 101 (California).This book does so MANY things well it's really a template for how to write a complete novel. At the simplest level, the plot is quick and fast paced and used effectively to stregnthen the other elements of the book. The prose is perfect as the tone is appropriate throughout. There is dread in the air when we are unsure of Lennie's actions or future and a calm in the scenes where we see friednly interaction between the two main characters. The book is touching and the characterization makes these people real and emotional. Finally the themes of percieved right and wrong, being your own person, and idividual freedom are all touched upon expertly.Bottom Line: There is a reason why this has been made into a play, a movie, and is mandatory reading in high school. If you are looking to read a \\"classic\\" and want some lighter reading that won't consume too much time then this is for you."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read Of Mice and Men twice before setting out to write a fair review of it, simply because it was that strong of a book. It ranks among the few novels that have brought a tear to my eye. The entire story is just constructed so beautifully, I was truly blown away by the time I finished.The characters are all memorable and very interesting, as are there relationships. Lennie is a lovable (albeit slow) giant, and I felt complete anxiety when his fate was still unsure. George is an average man who would probably just blend in with the crowd in life were it not for his large companion. And while these are the two main characters, the entire cast is just fabulous.I actually don't have a single complaint. The format is compact, and I can honestly that this is one story that I will read and re-read over and over.This novella is a must-read instant-classic for absolutely anyone. It's a touching story with relevant themes that will really get you thinking."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of mice and men\\" is a story about two friends as different as fire and water. George smart and calm on the one hand- the unpredictable childish Lennie one the other hand. In the time of the great Depression they are trying to make a living as farm workers with the dream of owning a farm. But Lennie's clumsiness causes problems all the way through. Because of him they had to leave the last farm. Hence George organised a new job on a farm, where the story is set.Remarkable is John Steinbeck's fascination for symbols. Every effect of a scene seems to be reasoned and prepared. In the beginning the surrounding is described in a detail. If you'll think about it and take your time you'll find the image Steinbeck tries to create. The style is pretty easy. The book consists mostly of simple and short dialogues. That makes the book comfortable to read. No time is wasted by the narration of unnecessary things. It keeps you reading on and on -looking forward for the next incident.The characters are well created even if you'll have the feeling that some of them are brought in to get the story ahead. Many characters appear at a single moment, which may confuses. But all in all they look real and the reader can form his opinion about each character.So you'll rush trough the book of 100 pages...expecting an powerful and fantastic ending - an expectation, which shall not be fulfilled!! Steinbeck initiates an abrupt, unspectacular ending. I was disappointed and somehow left in the dark... Aside that the book is absolutely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is such a wonderful little piece of fiction. Steinbeck is an absolute marvel in his use of imagery, and his ability to paint the lives of ordinary men in such bright colors is unparalled.This book is short, but a gamut of emotions packs its pages. Not only is the reader exposed to anger and exasperation, but humor, despair, and a reintroduction to the human condition as well.The characters of George and Lennie are classic, and in my opinion, can easily be compared with Fitzgerald's Nick Carraway and Jay Gatsby as far as memorability goes.Steinbeck, undoubtedly, has written a slew of great works including \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Cannery Row,\\" but if ever there is a story you should read by this man, it is \\"Of Mice and Men.\\" Its simplicity alone is genius and there is a lot said about power and how it is abused and lorded over the weak.Good things come in small packages...and for those high school kids out there who think it sucks...I've been there....Just give it a few years and you are likely to better understand its importance with age (and the same goes for \\"The Great Gatsby\\" while I'm on my soap box)."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In this short story, Steinbeck describes the friendship of two very different men during a period of migrant farm work in early 20th century California. This friendship is marked by a shared dream to buy a small plot and \\"live of the fat of the land\\". The two characters could not be more distinct -- one, George, is a short wise man, with rugged and sharp features; the other, Lennie, is a large and strong man, gentle but with very limited wit.Steinbeck's description of characters and nature is very simple and clean, especially of the other farm workers in the farm where Lennie and George are just arriving. It is a world of loners, like Candy who is injured and old but still looking for a place where he belongs, and Crooks who is a deformed black man who is ostracized by the other workers (and carries a lot of resentment for it) and buries himself in books.There are quite a few underlying themes in the story, most of which question the value of life and dreams, especially as one is getting old or one's dreams seem to be fading away in a second. Lennie is caught in a situation where his great dream to tend rabbits in their land is shattered by an encounter with the wife of the farm owner's son that gets out of hand, and so the story unfolds to its tragic ending.The ending is exceptional, shoking and leaves one reconsidering the book for a while. The most impressive characteristic of the ending is the lack of change in style; Steinbeck continues its clean and direct prose and is able to construe a believable and meaningful ending in just a few pages.I highly recommend this short novel, it is a little over 100 pages and you should be done with it in a 2-hour flight. It is a great intro to Steinbeck's writing style, which, along with The Pearl, in my opinion, makes a great combination of Steinbeck's short tragic stories."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is a great book--two very different men brought together by certain circumstances. I love the way the characters compliment each other. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Men and Mice is a story about the dreams and friendship between two men during The Great Depression. George, who is \\"small and quick,\\" faces many problems trying to keep Lennie, who is a large man with the mind of a young child, out of trouble. George and Lennie share a dream to own land and raise animals. To keep this dream, George does what he can to keep Lennie's strength and obsession with soft things under control. The friendship George and Lennie had was a quality many men could not find at that time with anyone but was something that was needed in their times of loneliness.Reading this book showed how life was during The Great Depression for those who cared for someone who was mentally challenged and had the responsibility for watching over their well being. It took patience and kindness on George's part to carry on the responsibility of care for Lennie. George had to take Lennie everywhere he went and constantly made decisions on his behalf in the best interest for him. In our days the challenged are taken care of, not only by family members but also by society. One does not have to worry about the responsibility for them as much as George did for Lennie. I can imagine how one's life was affected in those days when the responsibility was all on one.I enjoyed reading this book because it made me realize the importance of friendship. Many characters in the book went through loneliness and expressed their need to have a companion. My favorite part of the story was anytime Lennie would talk about the rabbits and the reactions of those he told it. Being a big man with the brains of a child made his obsession with the rabbits as well as all soft things humorous as well as sensitive. Though the times in which they lived in were rough and depressing, Lennie brought a bright and funny twist to it that made the reader enjoy his character.People who have friends and companions will like this book best. It will help them appreciate having someone around to share their good and bad times. In reading this book we feel the sorrow and jealousy of those who needed that friendship and that's something no one wants to experience."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book showed me the value of friendship.

I enjoyed this book because it's a simple book about common men. Almost anyone can relate to the characters in this book, which gives this book worthwhile to read. I recommend this book to anyone looking for book that they can really relate to themselves."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I like Of Mice And Men by John Steinbeck because the definition of the characters was so realistic. I also liked the fact that it was in the novella form so the possibility that the story might drag did not happen.I would recommend Of Mice And Men not only to afficionados of Steinbeck, but to virtually anyone who enjoys real-life prose."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, set in California in the 1930's, involves two main characters, Lennie and George, who work together to achieve their dream of owning their own farm. Lennie, mentally handicapped, loves to touch soft thing, which plays a major role in the novel. At one time, George, Lennie's partner, used to force Lennie to inflict harm on himself for George's own amusement until one day when George told Lennie to jump into a river, where Lennie almost drowned. George and Lennie begin working on a new ranch because they had to flee the former ranch t because of Lennie's actions. On the new ranch, the duo meet Candy, an older man who feels that his services are of minimal use at the ranch. One day, Candy overhears George and Lennie talking about their idea for a farm. Candy says that he will give him their life savings if he can go with them, and they figure that if they work one more month on the ranch, with Candy's money, they will be able to buy their own place.The book uses numerous symbols to portray its messages. The farm that George describes to Lennie, where they will grow their own food and tend their own livestock, is one of the most powerful symbols in the book. It is so powerful because it makes the reader want to believe that the characters can accomplish their dream. To each of the characters the farm represents the possibility of freedom, independence, and protection from the world.Of Mice and Men is also on the Banned Book List because the book contains uses of profanity, and because of George's mistreatment of Lennie. By banning or challenging the book, people try to limit access to the book because they find the book unfit for a certain group to read. This book does contain profanity, but it is done so in a manner that makes the book seem realistic of the times. The book does a wonderful job of portraying the hardships and dreams during the Great Depression in California. When people try to limit access to a book of this caliber, they take away from another individual's enlightenment."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George and Lenny are laborers.

From my point of view, I believe that this book's not just written upon the subject of discrimination of our social society, but it is written to show the loneliness of people and the effects of being lonely.. For example, the wife of Curley, the son of the owner of the farm, acts of more flutterishly toward because of her isolated life from the people of the world, and her preference of attention from everyone caused from this loneliness..., and also the old man Candy kept his dog to escape from his own world loneliness. The main characters George and Lennie are also affected by being lonely. George has a habit of petting everything because from petting something you are sure of the fact that you are touching something that is alive, to enjoy the feeling of being next to someone escaping from the loneliness. George also tries to escape his loneliness by thinking of his dream house, where everyone will be happy and satisfied of their life. Of course I'm not saying that the idea of the book is not written upon the subject of prejudice but I'm just expressing my own opinion. So no hard feelings -_-;; lol"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is the first Steinbeck I've read and I have to say, it was an absolute pleasure. I found the descriptive style curt, while still being beautifully evocative. There is a lovely sense of space and movement to his backdrops.The two characters Lennie and George make for an immediately adorable duo. Lennie's childlike glea and innocence makes you want to just stop and hug him from his very first line. You feel an overwhelming urge to want to protect him from the big bad world that George is all too aware of.The journey details their search for work as farm handlers and their ambition to fulfill their dream of one day owning their own land. Lennie must surely be one of the great literary characters of the 20th century. He's looked down upon as a weirdo by most of the people he meets, when in fact he's too good for them. He deserves better.A philosophical novel that's impossible to put down (I read it in 1 day), I found it a great introduction to Steinbeck. A classic to be recommended without reservation."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The reason I chose this book was because we had to read it in school.

This is the type of book that gets you hooked and you cant stop reading.

What captured me the most is the dream shared by George and Lennie and later the others. A dream of having ones own places, a dream of having someone to be there for you.

The \\"nigger\\" don't know how to talk to others without pretending to be angry, the \\"tart\\" don't know how to communicate without flirting. Nobody undersand what is in the others mind, yet at the end of the day they are actually the same people sharing the same dream.It is a very well structured story: from the killing of Candy's old dog to the killing of Lennie; from Lennie's anger about the puppy's death to the Candy's anger about the girl's death.I believe this story is still relevant today.

I saw the story as a picture of the ugliness of humanity, apparently harmless but capable of atrocity if pushed to the edge of one's weaknesses. Even the \`competent' friend in the story, George, could not achieve his dreams. He was impotent to find happiness. I thought the story was fascinating. I could not put the book down, and I read the book in about three hours."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I am from BLA high school in the bronx and I thank my teacher MS. Solomon for giving us this book to read. This book tells the story of true friends and how hard it was during the great depression. From this book I have learned that sometimes you just got to do what is best for you and your friend. This book always has a new surprise. The author uses symbolism and foreshadowing to tell the story. As the story goes on the better it gets. I have read this book twice and I can just keep reading it over and over because it tells such good details and information. Reading this book you will feel as if you were there because the action never ends you will keep being surprised until the last sentence of the book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is a little book, less than 200 pages, that packs a big punch. John Steinbeck tells the story of George and Lennie who travel around the Mid-West in the 1930's working as day laborers on large farms. George is small in stature and &quot;street smart&quot; while Lennie is large, strong and &quot;intellectually challenged&quot; to be politically correct. George and Lennie depend upon each other for companionship. They are a kind of family. Lennie looks up to George as a big brother. George admires Lennie's physical size and strength. You get the impression that one would be lost without the other. George spends a lot of his time keeping Lennie out of trouble. Lennie wants rabbits to raise and George wants to be his own boss. They know where a little farm is for sale. It's just what they want. George and Lennie need six-hundred dollars to make this dream come true. For a while it looks as if the dream can become a reality. Then trouble comes in the form of a woman. The ending, while you know what is coming, is a shocker.This John Steinbeck classic is just as powerful in it's message today as it was in 1937. George and Lennie together represent every person who has ever had a dream that they secretly knew was just out of their reach. Together they support each other and keep their dream alive.I had not read this book since high school, some 40 years ago. I finished it in one setting."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I thought that Of Mice and Men was a good book. I enjoyed all of the action that took place. Especially when they arrived at the ranch to work. Between all of the fights, the girls, the puppies and the work it was very interesting. I thought that it kept you wanting to read it. I also think that Linnie made the book because you never knew what he was going to do or what was going to happen next. I enjoyed the book and I hope you will too."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a thrilling book which grabs your seat and makes you want to read all the way till the last page of the book. A classic John Steinbeck novel, it never ceases to excite readers with its unpredictable story. Two main characters, George and Lenny, starts off the journey with a dream but without the resources, they are left with nothing but their dreams. Of all friendships that started, George and Lenny's were the most unpredictable one. George, a small built guy with brains, and Lenny, a big built muscular guy but is no where as smart as George, were complete opposites. Throughout the book, George has no choice but to control Lenny is everyway and Lenny, being the strong man that he is, is not able to control himself without George, Lenny is lost in his world of his own which makes total chaos. To me, it is without a doubt that the best part of Steinbeck's writing is his ability to get into people's heart and able to play with their emotions. Throughout the novel, there are many wicked twists and that's what makes this novel enjoyable. As I started reading the book from the first page, the feeling of happiness was what I felt, but as it heads for the end, I felt the feeling of remorse and sadness. The novel itself, has a complex meaning behind it, a meaning which cannot be expressed by words, but can only be expressed by reading it. This is perhaps one of the classic novels. The novel was and I think still is banned from a couple of places in the world, and sometimes, it gets you thinking, why would they want to ban a book? Is it something the government of don't want to reveal to the public? Whatever it is, this is a classic novel that will always be part of America's history in literature."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"It took me 27 years to read &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; and when I finally did, I realized what I had been missing for all of that time. This is easily the perfect novel. The pace is brisk, the flow sound, and the characters real. There are no loose ends in this text -- it is tied together as tightly as the bags of barley that the men buck in the fields -- and it poses such universal questions as: &quot;What is justice?&quot; &quot;What is friendship?&quot; This novel is not long, but it is one that you will think about long after you have finished reading it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"BURN the Catcher in the Rye, for all I care. Of Mice and Men went from being what I thought was stupid, to what is now one of my favorite books of all time.The story is simple, beautiful, and meaningful. So many morals pop up that tell you what life should be like, and how unjust the world can be at times. When I saw the movie version of this with Gary Sinise and John Malcovich, I almost cried.George and Curley's wife were my favorite characters, both reaching for something they could've had, but can never posses. With each sentence your spine tingles, and you die to find out what's going to happen next.Things surprised me. Shocked me.

Despite this book's classic reputation, I never read this in school, and really had no idea what the book was about. I really enjoyed it - and was truly shocked by how sad it was.

One is the fact that the copy I received was scratched and skips in many different parts.

Gary Sinise does a good job reading the different parts."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I just finished reading this novel for school. It was such a heart warming story about George Milton and his mentally retarded companion Lennie. They begin working on a ranch that they desire to eventually buy and overcome many obstacles while working there. The ending of this novel was totally unexpected to me and I love when stories have a twist. The movie was just as great! I think I will read the Pearl next because it's in my closet and John Steinbeck has such an original writing style that makes me want to keep reading. I highly recommend this book if you enjoy classics. Everybody has to read this book some time in their life, so go out and get it!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck, a name that will remain in the literary history books forever. His writing is broadly criticized and marveled at; he was one of the most controversial writers of his time. Despite the dark veil he often wrote behind there are many gems of wisdom to be had about the way life was, and is. I have read other books of his such as: East of Eden, The Pearl, and The Red Pony. I am no stranger to his style or his brilliance, both of which make the beautiful tale Of Mice and Men all that it is.Life was hard for the wandering laborers of California, maybe more so for George and Lennie. Although both are good men at heart they find stiff opposition in the eyes of men who cannot overlook the fact that Lennie is different. With the strength of a bull and the mind of a child Lennie does not see life the way most men do. He travels with George, who is tasked with the endless job of protecting Lennie from himself and a cruel society. They lead a simple existence, traveling from farm to farm working as laborers to keep their place on the edge of time. But even this misfit pair have their own ideas, they share the American dream and a longing to be their own masters. Standing between them and their goal though are the cold eyes of a world that has hardened itself and embraced greed along with arrogance. Despite Lennie's ever good intentions he always manages to get himself into trouble, not because of faults of his own but because of the differences of others. And ultimately it is Lennie's fear of getting in trouble that leads to their downfall.In this novel there is nothing that I can complain about. Steinbeck's laid back sense that he creates when storytelling is almost always present in this novel. This is not to say that the book will bore you, quite to the contrary, it will reach out to you and envelope you in the plot and familiarize you with the characters until they are old friends of yours. This book is short, only about 100 pages, however that is all that is needed to tell a tale that will lead you on an incredible journey, a journey through the territories of the human soul: joy, love, excitement, and finally sorrow. This book is a good read for anybody, and is an exceptional read for those that can grasp the underlying brilliance in this seemingly simple story.To say it all in a word, bravo. Bravo to one of the best writers there ever was or will be. I am honored to award this book a five star rating, in fact I consider it a privilege to be able to bestow my opinion of this masterpiece on others. And I urge whoever may read this simple review, Of Mice and Men is a book that will try all human emotion and in the end leave you with much more than you started with. Sometimes like putting a pet to sleep, all that can saved from the best of friendships is the dignity of what there once was. This novel demonstrates better than ever that in life there are mice and there are men."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"THE BOOK WAS OLD & A BIT WORN BUT IT GOT THE JOB DONE.

What makes it so good is the fact that the plotline is interesting, even if it does get thrown away in a suprise ending, it is intresting to read about until that point. It is short, you can read it in 1-2 days, and LA teachers love it because it is one of those novels that gets you to think 'critically'. It's a win-win-win. Great story for your entertainment, short if you are short on time, and gets you to think.

George is the brains of the outfit, that constantly finds himself getting the duo out of the trouble Lennie has created for them. With dreams of obtaining their own land George and Lennie seek work on a new farm. This farm seems to unlock the final door to obtaining their dream property. Unfortunately, the death of a beautiful womam brings a new stain in their realtionship.Steinbeck is a great storyteller. The one thing I did not like about the book is the ending.

As the readers soon find, their home, the &quot;land of the free,&quot; is not a paradise of simple people seeking even a decent wage to live by. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; illuminates the fundamentally brutal nature of American society during the despression, and the effects of this society on every day people, rich or poor.

What a powerful novel. It's hard to find this sort of caliber fiction in the popular market today. In a time of early rugged individualism, in the years of the Depression, here come Lenny and George. They are an oddity to the field workers they join to garner a living. It is all too transparent that the clumsy, oversized, highly-challenged Lenny needs his pal, George. He is lost without him, a walking tragedy that needs constant monitoring. What is less clear is why George continues his relationship with Lenny. Often George ponders what life might be without him. Might it be that rugged individuals experience a loneliness that is too painful?Steinback's novel reads like a stageplay. One cannot differentiate the description of props from the description of experienced reality. Outside the text of the powerful drama, Steinbeck ends a chapter by context, noting a truck's passing on a distant road, or the noises of animals outside. The result is fascinating, enlarging the drama, and including the reader therein. Some years ago I read \\"Cannery Row\\", but I only vaguely remember it. This work will stay with me.The characters are real, walking into the barn, and the play right off the fields as Steinbeck studied them; Slim; Candy; Crooks: Carlson. Of course, there has to be Curley, let alone his nameless wife. They all knew she was trouble, except Lennie. And therein lies the tragedy. A mouse? No problem. A puppy? Hmmm. A woman? Big problem! The tragic ending severs a relationship. But Slim offers hope, another chance.A wonderful, powerful story of the human condition."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"'Of Mice and Men' was written in 1937 by John Steinbeck. To me, one of his finest works.The setting is in the Gabilan mountain area of western California and although no specific dates are mentioned, probably around the time of the great depression. The two main protagonists are George and Lennie, two drifters that travel the area looking for seasonal work at harvest time. George is a small cunning man while Lennie is giant of a man, but with the mind of a child. Their wandering lifestyle is fueled by their dreaming about better days ahead and having their own place...as Lennie puts it, \\"Can you imagine such a place, living off the fat of the lan'?\\". However their future is about to drastically change in ways they can never suspect (or understand) and the dream is about to be shattered forever.Subjectively, I loved it all; the finest of writing, that not only features exquisite descriptive passages of barns, horses and of lazy, late summertime afternoons, but also the unique characters that go into making this depression era tale. And although the book is really just a longer, short story (just over 100 pages in length) it is the ever-so subtle increasing tension coupled with the real personalities, that makes this wonderful novel so hard to put down.If any complaint, it would be that the tale is so short; it's all over almost as soon as it's begun. However, it's quality over quantity. Easily, 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book has a crazy twist to it and the whole way it covers ideas on racism, jealousy, competitiveness, and every man's dream of just 'living on the fatta the land'."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This was my first book by Steinbeck and it surely won't be my last! Classic literature written so well that I was in the story seeing, feeling and living it along side the characters!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Lennie and George, migrant workers who move from farm to farm looking for work, are good friends despite their differences. In a cruel world, where loneliness and desperation rule, the two friends are joined by a special bond of a common dream. The dream of owning their own land wasn't a matter of a property, rather it was about a peaceful world where friends are totally devoted to each other's protection. In a sense; it is the family that Lennie and George never enjoyed.John Steinbeck explores deep subjects of existence and man's helplessness with a symbolic genius, reminiscent of Kafka's. Steinbeck used a simple story to depict weakness, loneliness, aging, desperation and existence. The dream was so profound and real that the world is incapable of understanding the emptiness that follows, when a dream is crushed.Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a fascinating emotional roller coaster that leaves the reader dizzy and flabbergasted. Most characters see their own dreams die in front of their eyes; the readers will be left with some critical moral questions unanswered.Since I read that book, I'm still pondering and re-examining George and Lennie's dream that existed to help them live in a harsh world, more so, than to achieve the dream itself. Dreams are what keep us going, so when they are aborted, regardless if we chose to or if we are forced, life will never be enjoyable again."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Again a very classic work by John Steinbeck. This is a must read for everyone. The story is real and draws you in. It isn't a book that you will read and forget.I have enjoyed all the Steinbeck books that I have read, (Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, The Pearl). John Steinbeck's works are a must have for all bookshelves.I highly recommend this and all of Steinbeck's works. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men opens with a perfectly 19th-century-like description of a creek. We almost expect a respectable bourgeois couple to emerge from the trees discussing a ball or an engagement. Instead we get Lennie and George:\\"So you forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you again, do I? Jesus Christ, you're a crazy bastard!\\"\\"I forgot,\\" Lennie said softly. \\"I tried not to forget. Honest to God I did, George.\\"\\"O.K. - O.K. I'll tell ya again. I ain't got nothing to do. Might jus' as well spen' all my time tellin' you things and then you forget 'em, and I tell you again.\\"\\"Tried and tried,\\" said Lennie, \\"but it didn't do no good. I remember about the rabbits, George.\\"It's hard to appreciate, I think, just how steeped we are in these archetypes now. They are instantly recognizable to the contemporary reader. George and Lennie are popular culture.Of Mice and Men is a long way from Dickens' fixation with the workaday dilemmas of the faintly well-to-do, which is in itself a far cry from the country gentry of Austen and Bronte. Some of Hardy's better novels dwell on the workers, but never quite believably. Though his father was a stonemason, his fingers aren't dirty enough. And it has always seemed to me that Faulkner's portraits of working folk bear the imprint of a soft-handed gentleman, the brilliant observer with fingernails stained by ink, not dirt. Doubtless I am missing others.So along rolls the Great Depression. Steinbeck is right there to chronicle it. (Avoid the dreary In Dubious Battle, which reads like a museum-piece.) Steinbeck's fingers might not have been callused - evidently he, too, was more observer than doer - but he wrote as if they were. Lennie and George have come to stand in for a whole generation, while the depiction of the black stable buck Crooks is especially poignant today, mere hours after America's first black president has delivered his first State of the Union address.Steinbeck is no master stylist. He uses too many apostrophes in the hunt for accuracy of dialect and his descriptions are sometimes flat and leaden. But if you read with your spine as Nabokov suggested, Of Mice and Men is an unbridled pleasure. It recalls the joys of childhood reading, the kind that highfalutin literature and pedantic high school English teachers often kill. Of Mice and Men is finely-rendered tragedy coated in a working man's dust and sweat.George said, \\"Guys like us got no fambly. They make a little stake an' then they blow it in. They ain't got nobody in the worl' that gives a hoot in hell about 'em - \\"\\"But not us,\\" Lennie cried happily. \\"Tell about us now.\\"George was quiet for a moment. \\"But not us,\\" he said.\\"Because - \\"\\"Because I got you an'--\\"\\"An' I got you. We got each other, that's what, that gives a hoot in hell about us.\\" Lennie cried in triumph."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a true classic, and I recommend it for all the English teachers out there. John Steinbeck is a legendary author, writing in vivid detail about life in the old times and the hardships and true values of living. This book can act both as a history lesson and an English lesson.I before have read it, and as a 7th grader my English teacher assigned this version of \\"Of Mice and Men\\" to us. Out of pure experience my English teacher told us that for teens this is one of the most favored books out of the many we have, are, and will read this year.This story, set in the Great Depression, to me is a must read for everyone out there, and everyone can learn from it's rich literature. The book is copious with all types of \\"literary devices\\", including many similes, metaphors, hyperbole, and personification! Steinbeck also includes and adds clever foreshadowing leading to the climax.As you probably know there are also some out there who hate it and complain of its shortness and sadness. Not everyone will love a book, but you can still improve both reading and your writing techniques from it.As my recommendation, if you are a extensive reader who enjoys classics over and over again, you should definetely buy this. This Penguin Books version is neat, easy to read, and is eye-catching to young teens.If you are one of those who buys a book, reads it once, and then just abandons it on a lonely bookshelf in a corner, then it would be more affordable and better to check it out form your nearby library. If you then deeply enjoy it like countless readers have, then you might want to consider purchasing it.All in all, if you love classics, like to read, or just want something new to try, I am pretty confident that you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I used to have a considerable classroom library (I have since switched schools and there is no Silent Sustained Reading program at the new school) and I always would hand this book to any kid that said he or she hated reading and \\"there's nothing good to read.\\" I had a hard time keeping this book on the shelves and since I had an \\"honor system\\" check out plan this book kept on disappearing on me since the students seemed to have felt it was worth keeping and I had to make runs to the local used book store to re-stock it.But, I hadn't read it in a while so I decided to see if it was still one of my favorites.If anything, this book is more powerful than it was before. The loss at the end is more powerful, both the loss with Lennie and with the loss of a dream. Themes abound, such as the loss of the American Dream, loneliness, friendship and the responsibilities of friendship. Perhaps, even some religious themes with all of the events starting on a Friday and ending on a Sunday.But, all of that would be pointless if the story were not well-written and poignant. It's short length only serves to heighten the power of the story.One of the best American novels. Period."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"My son needed this for school, and it was perfect.

I'm not a reader, however, when I started reading this I couldn't stop and I came in the next day with my homework and the next few week's homework assignments done as well. I love this book mainly due to the fact that it balances out Drama while also telling you a bit of history of the Great Depression while also making it easy to read, unlike &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; which in my opinion is very difficult for me to read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Yes, I loved it.

Awsome to be able to download the book from the classroom!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck wrote a great book! John Steinbeck wrote, Of Mice and Men.There were these two hard working farmers at a ranch in California. George was a medium built guy that was trying to make a living by barely making any money. George also had to support his friend, Lennie. Lennie was a very tall man, and bucked barley all by himself. Lennie had a mental disorder, and was always getting bullied around. George and Lennie's dream was to own an acre of land, and make a better living. George and Lennie used to work at a ranch in Weed before Lennie started to cause some problems. Which they later had to move to a farm land in Soledad, California. All the workers in Soledad weren't married. Candy the old man, has only one arm and has been working there for a while. Candy doesn't paid much. Candy helps George and Lennie out by giving them his entire life savings, and he would also join them in the land. Crooks the black stable hand, he had different cabin to himself since the color of his skin. Crooks told Lennie that he won't own any land because a lot of people have those big dreams, and their dreams would fail. Slim is the mule driver, and everyone would go to him for any advice. He was known as the \\"peacemaker.\\" Curley was the boss's son; he always wanted to start a fight with Lennie because he likes fighting tall men. One of Curely's hands is full of vaseline with a glove on it to keep his hand soft. He is married to a young girl. He doesn't even give any attention to her. Curley's wife flirts with all the workers on the ranch, and the workers try to ignore her, so Curley doesn't get jealous. George told Lennie to always stay away from her, but one day Lennie does the wrong thing making George and Lennie's dream to owning a land a very slim chance. I think Steinbeck should have developed his characters with more details. The plot line had a lot of suspense. Each time the chains were clinging there was something good going to happen, or something bad going to happen. The book has a lot of suspense making the reader want to read more. I enjoyed reading this book because from the beginning the story had a lot of suspense. There wasn't one part in the book where I thought that this was boring. The book always had me on the edge of my seat! I like reading suspense and mystery books. I wasn't expecting the book the to end like the way it did. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading suspense or mystery books. The book has a lot of racial slurs and profanity. I give this a book a 5/5!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"this book is the best book that i have ever read in my life, and its very easy to read and understand. you will enjoy reading but the ending is kind of sad thou"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was teriffic.

I applaud the teachers and school district administrators who choose good books as required reading for their students."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Very poignant...I read this book because my sons' 9th grade English class is reading it & I had never read it before.

Over the years, and on his way to the Nobel Prize, Steinbeck wrote many fine books. OF MICE AND MEN is one of his best. It tells a simple tale of George and Lennie as they travel together and face the challenges life throws in their path. This novel is complex in its simplicity. One must read it carefully or one will miss Steinbeck's crucial points. It is deserving of the acclaim is has received in the decades since its original publication. Once you have read it, memories of George and Lennie will not easily fade from your memory."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is a story about George and Lennie. George is a small man, he is smart, and underneath it all, he loves Lennie. Lennie is a huge man, but was born a slow man, and he sort of reminds you of the big guy in The Green Mile.Lennie always gets into trouble, not on purpose, but because he likes to pet things, like mice, and sometimes women's dresses if they look like they would feel nice. That's how they got thrown out of a few of there jobs, and is the basis of the book.There is some foul language in the book, but regular working folk don't really mind eachother's bad language, and the bad language brings you farther into the book, like you were actually working on the farm. For a short book, it packs a lot of surprises that I wasn't expecting at all. The end is truly sad, and it left questions, but that's what a good book does in my mind.John Steinbeck really brought you into the minds of both George and Lennie, and described each character very well. I am looking forward to reading Mr. Steinbeck's other novels.Mark_Sigel"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck's book Of Mice and Men is one of the most incredible works of American literature.

I read this book with my class and I normally hate the books we read but this one was so good, I read it during the summer also. John Steinbeck created an incredible picture of both the setting and the charcters. The ending was so unexpected and such a surprise that many of the people in my class ended up crying along with me. It became my favorite book and I definitly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"From the first page I fell in love with John Steinbeck's way of writing - his humble and delicate language.In this sweet novel Steinbeck has created an interesting set of characters and he chose to set the novel a few miles south of Soledad (loneliness in Spanish) in the 1930's. It tells the story of the two friends, George (the smart one) and Lennie (the dumb one), whom have no family, and no place that they can call \\"home\\". To make a living Lennie and George work on the different farms around, trying to save up money. They have a dream of buying a place of their own. A piece of land where they can grow their own crop and where Lennie can have rabbits. It is this dream that keeps these two friends going.This short novel captures your attention easily. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a touching and sad story about friendship and the need for everyone to belong. Well written and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The story of Steinbeck's life makes me think that maybe he was lonely like George and Lennie. It seems like he writes from his own emotional experiences. He does such a good job of writing Mice and Men that I think it's a shame if everyone can't appreciate the effort he takes to make us understand that sometimes our best laid plans go astray."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I thought that this book was great. When I first opened the book and read the first page, I thought that I was in for a boring book. I being the type that hates adventures, thought that the book was well written. The book starts off with a discription of a place that is by a lake and is surrounded with bushes. As I continued to read I began to like the characters. One being smart and the other being incredibly stupid. As the story goes on many events happen that make you continue to read. John Steinbeck keeps you intersested throughout the entire story. You must read this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Time after time steinbeck has been able to tell a story and capture my attention with great words which flow off the pages.

And it will challenge you to ask questions you never though were there to ask."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is sad, linking novel, which shows the human side of two men, and the compassion that they share for one another. The novel isn't an indept character story, but a relationship story, a bond between two men, and how far one will go for the other. Foreshadowing is evident in the book, and at just over 100 pages, you know what is going to happen within the first 30, but that isn't the point. Steinbeck wants us to look at life from a different side. He wants us to see the awful situations that present themselves to people, and how those certain people handle it. Although Of Mice and Men is a simple read, the message and inpact the story leaves with you, will go far beyond the thin paper pages it was typed on nearly seventy years ago."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books! John Steinbeck had created a wonderful and haunting story about various Western farmers. Loneliness is the major theme in this novel. Steinbeck captures the true essence of what it's like to be sad and unfulfilled. And the friendship between George and Lennie is both funny and poignant. It was especially touching when George decides that he can no longer protect Lennie from the horrible things that he hadn't intended to do. Who can resist a novel with such strong message and symbolism? This is one of the best pieces of literature ever -- a true American classic!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book \\"of mice and men\\"was a very odd book.

The two main characters are Lennie and George, Lennie is a big man that is mentaly retarted and George is the complete opposite, he is a short hardworking man taking care of Lennie as a fovor to aunt Clara. Two themes that the novel distributes is lonliness and violence. Lonliness was shown in this novel when George and Lennie are without the society hiding to keep Lennie safe.Volience is shown by how George reacts to Lennie in many situations one when Lennie kills curlys wife.

Also, there is violence when Lennie and Curley's wife are in the barn together. He was feeling her hair and she started to scream and Lennie ended up breaking her neck and killing her.

The protagonists are Lennie and George. They travel together from farm to farm because George has to take care of Lennie who behaves like a child. First the characters are described in a superficial way and the reader can not feel like the caracters do. But in the end of the novel every character becomes multilayered and now the reader can follow the actions that take place. So the reader is able to foreshadow the continue of the character's life. The last chapter is the most important chapter because the novel ends &aacute;t the same place where it starts. To me, it seems to be the sane thing with life: Every ending is a new beginning. So we can use John Steinbeck's novel as a help for life and for us to understand how we should treat other human beeings. It's a timeless novel because Steinbeck writes about problems that exist in every generation built by human beeings.

This helps to keep the book short but you still get a lot of good information. George and Lennie are the two main characters. They are labor workers and travel from farm to farm looking for jobs to make money. They have an amazing friendship, which everyone at the ranch admires. Steinbeck puts a large emphasis on the importance of male friendship in the novel. They are trying to make enough money to buy there own land so they can be free of always having to worry about having a job or not. George is a small man who keeps up with Lennie.

The scene of the book was in the country, were Lennie, the main charecter, looked for jobs with his friend George to make money and fufil there dreams. George would look after Lennie and keep him out of trouble. People weren't to social with lennie because of his mental disorder, they thought he was stupid, and caused troubles. It was a struggle for Lennie to get by and stay out of trouble, and ended up in a tragic ending. I recomend this book to any one who likes to read. This book made me want to give any one a chance and dont judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Not much more can be said about John Steinbeck's novel 'Of Mice and Men',that hasn't already been said. The book portrays the classic struggle to achieve the American Dream, and while watching 'American Beauty' I found numerous parallels to 'Of Mice and Men'. The main characters in both of these works struggle with the status quo, and end up dying because they are unable to conform. 'American Beauty', in my opinion, is a modern day 'Of Mice and Men', showing the confusion and strife of middle class, white-collar life, instead of the struggle of the lower class, blue collar life portrayed in Steinbeck's novel. The industrialization and growth of the middle class since the baby-boomers of the 50's has brought our country towards a more suburban life. However, we constantly thrive to be more than we actually are, as reflected in American Beauty. A family tries to live at a higher than possible standard, and ends up falling apart. While Steinbeck's novel reflects the opposite, the underpriveleged class trying to live at a simple level, both works are the same story, told at different times and with different circumstances. The two works present us with a common theme: the limits of society. As hard as it is to accept, there are some things which we just cannot achieve."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book really mean something to me. it tells me that goal are set by many people.

And after you do, you HAVE to see the movie! It's 10 times more better and is somewhat more interesting."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I loved of Mice and Men. The relationship between George and Lennie has a very special meaning. The twists and turns of the story kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is Steinbeck's classic novelette about two itinerate farm workers in central California, George Milton and Lennie Small. George serves as the \\"guide\\" or father-figure for the simpleminded, large, and strong Lennie. Both have dreams of having their own place and farm; but, tragedy stops them. As they reach for their dream, they are denied (\\"The best laid schemes o' mice and men Gang aft a gley,\\" Robert Burns, 1785). George finds that he is so attached to Lennie that he can't let the mob get to him. He discovers that it is his terrible task to free Lennie by the only means available to him. Steinbeck gained national prominance with this work with its beautiful use of language and its realistic portrayal of itinerate farm workers in the 1930s. He was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature. It is one of the major works of literature of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I have mentioned previously in review of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath that he had an ear for the language and circumstances of the drifter, the loner, those who live on the edge in seemingly fabulous California. This is not the California of the Chamber of Commerce hype but it is part of the history of the West Coast nevertheless. Of Mice and Men is in that same vein although there is probably a little more pathos to the characterizations of Lenny and George than Steinbeck gives to those in Grapes. But the dreams are the same. And why shouldn't they be. It may very well be that the best laid plans of mice and men go awry but, damn, we don't have to like it and what it does to the human spirit. And neither does Steinbeck. Read this book, read all of Steinbeck's books."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read it in the 9th grade which was about two or three years ago. I loved it. I thought it very well written. I love George and Lennie. I love George's hate/love relationship with Lennie, and how he takes care of him and look out for him even though Lennie gets him into a lot of trouble. I loved the ending and how Lennie was thinking of the farm that George and him have dreamed about. I cried at the end of the story it was so amazing yet terribly sad.

He was not a man of many words, however, his detailed descriptions of life on the streets of Springfield, Massachusetts during this time were both numerous and vivid. Although a time of poverty for most, descriptions of life's struggles during this period provide something of a romantic setting. People were in it together. With this in mind I decided to read Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men.\\"How could a novel about individuals so impoverished that they would find work on a farm miles from home, live in row bunk houses, be paid little for their labor, and have little potential for the future, be considered uplifting. I guess because they were in it together. Despite continual complaining these individuals exibited the ultimate in tenacity; after all they had no choice in the matter. They learned to live with one another and despite obvious dearth of education there instinct was to watch and care for one another; well with the exception of one jerk.George Milton and Lenny Small are drifters. Family friends for many years George has taken it upon himself to care for the severely mentally challenged Lenny. Their dream is to one day buy a farm of their own and live off the fat of the land. Lenny's handicap makes this somewhat impossible for he is constantly getting himself into trouble. Both his emotions and large stature make it necessary for both men to constantly pick up and leave for yet another work location. They are not alone in this lifestyle since their acquaintances exhibit similiar weaknesses in addition to their lack of income.I found myself asking myself the same question. Are people's values really much different today when compared to our depression era counterparts? Not really. When we find ourselves under stressful situations we tend to appreciate the fellowship of others, to visualize their dreams as our own, and to hope and plan for a better tomorrow."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I first read this book for a secondary (high) school class and was instantly captivated by it. Revisiting it recently has reminded me again why the book is such a literary masterpiece.The first thing that one notices is that the book is remarkably short for all the hype that surrounds it. Yet the book's short length is deceiving, because Steinback packs in a great narrative, some masterful descriptive pieces and a wealth of insight.The plot revolves around the idea that the \\"the best laid schemes o' Mice an' Men, gang aft agley (often go awry)\\" - a reference Robert Burn's poem \\"To A Mouse\\". Set in the Great Depression era of the 1930s, the narrative recounts the fortunes of its two central characters, George and Lennie, who set out with their own version of the American Dream and end up falling far short. The reader is caught up in this tight and simple - but incredibly moving - storyline as the protagonists, seemingly oblivious, march inexorably towards their tragic fates.To Steinback's supreme credit, the main characters readily engender sympathy from the reader despite the shortness of the book. Side characters are also extremely convincing and pack a bigger punch than they would in the hands of lesser authors. The character and plot development is accompanied by an abiding sense of unease, arising from the air of lingering tragedy that Steinback manages to create. Furthermore, the matter-of-fact descriptions that punctuate the narrative add an element of rawness that makes the entire tragedy believable.Of Mice and Men, although short, left me thinking about the big things; about dreams and about destiny. It is truly a modern classic - masterful in style and timelessly relevant. I cannot recommend it more."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men can be interpreted at several levels. It is quite symbolic in nature, serving to show how oftentimes dreams, hopes, can become difficult obstacles. Although Steinbeck narrates in a simple voice, the prevalent themes--isolation, loss of the American Dream, importance of friendship--give the novel a wider range of meaning. George and Lennie's failure to meet their dreams could be aligned with the context in which this novel was written--that is, the many struggles of the migrant workers to find their ideal form of life in the times of the Depression. Lennie's \\"living off the fat of the land\\" is akin to many of the people traveling from Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl to California with bigger and better dreams of daily work and life.The story begins with George and Lennie running away from the town of Weed in California. George is small in stature, but has a \\"street smart\\" persona about him that helps him get himself, and Lennie, out of predicaments. He needs this because Lennie, who is slow in mind but tremendous in size and physical strength, often unintentionally gets them in some sort of trouble, such as accidentally touching a girl's dress. Lennie has a fondness for animals, which shows his innocent intent, but has just gotten blamed for a rape in Weed, which he and George come into the town of Salinas to get away from. They are searching for work to get them back on their feet and moving again. The new ranch could be a solution, but George has to look out to be sure that Lennie doesn't get them in trouble, and he also has to make sure others don't try to get Lennie in trouble. There is the bully on the ranch, Curley, who tries to pick on Lennie when he doesn't speak up. George, although seemingly resenting the fact that he has to be Lennie's parental-type figure, seems to relish in this role. He not only helps Lennie, but helps to keep Lennie's dream alive by telling him it is possible, but helping him relive that dream by repeatedly saying it to him, \\"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family. They don't belong no place... With us it ain't like that. We got a future.\\" While on the ranch, George and Lennie begin to find themselves, but not without potential problems from others, such as Curley and his wife. In the end, George has to make a decision that will effect his own livelihood, his own dream.Although small in size (the book is only a little over one hundred pages long), this is a book that teaches about the importance of hope and the essence of sticking together with those who mean the most to you. Another great literary experience from Steinbeck, one which I definitely would recommend giving a try."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is one dealing with many themes and elements of the story. The action of the novel takes place on or near a ranch in the Salinas Valley of California, south of San Francisco. The time period is never stated, but it is probably during the early 1930s, the time of the Depression. The nomadic wandering, poverty, and despair that George and Lennie embody are all indicative of that time. The dominant mood of the story is that of expectation which is developed through the dreams of the major characters. There are also other moods evoked through the actions of the characters reflecting sorrow, pity, and brutality. The novel ends on a tragic note. The tone at the end is definitely one of depression and frustration. Loneliness is a key element in this story. Many of the characters admit to suffering from profound loneliness. George sets the tone for these confessions early in the novel when he reminds Lennie that the life of a ranch-hand is among the loneliest of lives deep .The fact that they admit to complete strangers their fear of being cast off shows their desperation. In a world without friends to confide in, strangers will have to do. Each of these characters searches for a friend, someone to help them measure the world, as Crooks says. In the end, however, companionship of his kind seems unreachable. For George, the hope of such camaraderie dies with Lennie, and true to his original inference, he will go through life alone. The characters are made helpless by their isolation, and yet, even at their weakest, they seek to ruin those who are even weaker. The novel suggests that the most visible kind of strength, that used to oppress others, is itself born of weakness. The title of the novel, Of Mice and Men, is a reference to Robert Burns' poem entitled \`To a Mouse\\". This book is a classic work of literature and one I would recommend to all."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"At 17 years old, I have had to read too many assigned books for my liking. The books are always loved by teachers, hated by students.Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is one of two books that I've actually enjoyed reading (the other being Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte). I first heard of this book when my sister had to read it for school and then watched the movie with her when she rented it after finishing the book. I read the book when I was in the 8th grade. It wasn't assigned to read in school until the 11th grade.I enjoyed the parallels that were scattered in the story. My favorite parts of the book are the beginning chapter and the end chapter. The beginning shows a peaceful place full of life and nature. There are birds and water and plants. When men finally come into the picture, it's to trample on that. At the end, they show the same setting, but fill it with how men have destroyed it and bring death into the picture, foreshadowing the future.For those who haven't read this book, I implore you to read it.For those who have and didn't like it, I hope you give it a second chance."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is one of his greatest achievements in literature. Not a particularly long book, it does do a lot with the 100 some-odd pages it has. The story starts out with introducing us to the two antagonists of the novel, George and Lenny. These two are an oddity in Depression-era California because for one, farm workers nearly always traveled alone and because Lenny is mentally retarded. The two are on their way to getting another job after having been run off their last one. The goal of our antagonists is to one day earn enough money to buy their own farm and live of the \`fatta the lan'.' This will soon lead to the novel's major theme of despair. During their short time on the farm, George and Lenny meet many characters, all with their own personal despairs. Candy is the old swamper who, like his dog, is outliving his usefulness, and fears he will be disposed of, also, like his dog. Curley is a young man with a chip on his shoulder. Feeling he will always be ridiculed, no matter what he does or who he marries, he is always pugnacious and looking to prove himself by fighting bigger guys. Curley's wife dreams of stardom. She is pretty and was always told she could be famous. She now resents living on a farm and not having a chance to live out her dreams. The old Negro, Crooks, has turned to books for companionship after years of neglect by all others. So set in his ways, he rails against himself for even thinking that anyone could be his friend after Lenny and Candy visit him. All of these characters, along with all of the minor farm workers, feel like they each have their own personal story of despair that they could share with you. When George finds out that Candy has money put away and is interested in investing in the farm with him, it seems like the dream could become a reality. But, if you know anything about Steinbeck, this cannot be the case. Lenny eventually gets himself into some major trouble, shattering all of their dreams and George faces an impossible decision which will change both their lives forever. It's amazing how such a succinct novel could have you caring so much about the characters by its conclusion. Steinbeck makes his characters full and real and makes their pain the pain of the reader. Again, this is a masterful novel and a must read that gets my full recommendation."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Having taught at an inner city school with extremely reluctant readers, I always found joy in witnessing kids get into this book. I have had students confess they had never before read a \\"chapter\\" book, but they actually read this one.Steinbeck's characteriztion, his timeless themes, and his crafty step into a deeper world of symbolism and realism reach to students...I highly recommend reading it with the audio tapes as well.

I found it on the shelf of my mother's bedroom. My mother was suprised to see I had taken it upon myself to read such a book at the age of 10. I wanted to read an adult book, and the slim package of this book seemed undaunting, and unintimidating. I think it opened me up to a world of literature at a young age that has made me love books for a lifetime.Steinbecks masterpiece is a book you could never forget. It will make you cry, and and laugh.As the two men in the book are faced with challenges, and the ultimate challenge you sympathize with each character, their struggles, and the consequences they each face.It's a good book for a young adult, but anyone who has never read this must."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"If you ever wondered what the ultimate devotion of a true friend is like, then Of Mice and Men is the book for you. In this novel John Steinbeck explores the interesting lives of two men, Lennie and George. Lennie is a man with a big body and an even bigger heart. Lennie is the kind of gentle giant who loves anything soft. George is the opposite of Lennie. George is a small dark man with sharp features. The two men travel to California in search of work. When they arrive at a ranch they find more then just work. They make new friends, new enemies and get into trouble. Lennie has a learning disability and is a little slow, and George said he would always watch out for Lennie. In their time at the ranch they meet a few different characters, one of which is a woman who happens to be married to the bosses' son Curly. Curly is a small jealous man who picks fights for random reasons. Curly's wife is a flirtatious woman who loves the attention she receives from the men on the farm. One event that shows Georges strength and the lack of his ability to make good judgments, was when Curly stormed into the bunkhouse accusing Lennie of having and affair with his wife. When Curly throws a punch Lennie catches his fist and easily crushes it. This event only added to Lennie and Georges problems. George and Lennie are working to save money so they can live a life they always dreamed of. After a series of unfortunate events the plot takes a sorrowful turn. This is a very entertaining book that has a little bit of everything: comedy, drama, action, suspense and tragedy. This book shows what a true friend would do for another friend. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. We can all learn from Lennie and George"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men (By. John Steinbeck) Reader ReviewReviewer: Abigail RoncoThe book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck begins with two men walking towards a farm down a long dusty Californian road. One, George, is \\"short with dark features\\"; his opposite is a giant of a man with a \\"shapeless face\\" by the name of Lennie. Steinbeck set this story in America, during the Great Depression. In a third person point of view, this novel intertwines the lives of two men who share something more than just meals together with the lives of people on this Californian farm. Together their future is shaped by a golden dream, dastardly deeds, and accidents.The characters in Of Mice and Men appeal to the time they have been written into. As you see the story progressing you realize these men have retreated into themselves because they are alone. Without companionship these male humans lose feeling. In America today we are becoming materialistic, will retreating into physical objects subject us to losing feelings just as the people in this time period did? Will we be alone by choice? I bet that if George didn't have Lennie he would have become an empty shell just as the other men had become.Of Mice and Men's plot is centered around George and Lennie, two men striving to survive during the Great Depression of America on a California farm. Other people then get caught up in George and Lennie's affairs. The situation accidentally triggers a rockslide that changes the people's lives forcefully.The style that John writes in is a descriptive one. His work can also be a little dry because of lack of action throughout the storyline. Through the entire book John seemed to get a kick out of eluding and teasing the inquisitive mind. Told from a 3rd person view of George and Lennie, Of Mice and Men doesn't get into the inner workings of their minds but brushes the surface by describing fears, likes, dislikes, and their reactions while living on the farm.While reading this novel I saw that there were many underlying messages and one seemed to stick out the most to me. That one was Candy's dog being shot in the head to put it out of misery. The message was, that once you are no longer useful to society, you become a burden that needs to be gotten rid of. If you read in between the lines you can foretell some of the events or a general idea or feeling that there is something that will happen. I think this way of writing nudges the reader to react to the mental challenge, creating a splendid work of art rather than just a book.Overall...John Steinbeck's creation Of Mice and Men is one of splendid perception that more people of our time should engage in reading."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"i absolutely LOVED this book. i was assigned to read it for a school report, and i must admit, when i first recieved the assignment i thought it was going to be a very boring book. However, as i was reading it, i grew to love it. I began to feel as if i knew the characters personally. I began to feel their triumphs and their tragedies, their hardships and their accomplishments. The two main characters, George and Lennie, are best friends and travel together. Lennie is mentally challenged and relies on George for everything. George openly accepts this responsibility and in turn relies on Lennie for someone to talk to. Lennie and George could be seen as the two parts of one man. George is the mind; Lennie is the body. Neither can exist apart; to kill either half is to kill the whole. I was so engrossed in the book and the characters' lives that by the time that i reached the suprising, dramatic last few pages of the book, i was crying. The last few pages are very sad and show how much they really care for each other. In a final act of love, George does something for Lennie that truly shows how much he cares for him. I will never forget this book, and it has left me with a lasting message about friendship and love.

In the book Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck talks about the friendship between two migrant workers, George and Lennie. George is a small, wiry man that cared a lot about Lennie. He is usually the one to make the decisions and plans for their future. In contrast, Lennie is large in size, lumbering, and he has a childlike mind. Lennie&iexcl;s mental disabilities allow him to completely depend upon George for guidance and protection.Both George and Lennie shared a common dream. Their dream is to earn money to buy a farm of their own where no one ever reaches. To make this a reality, they found a job at a ranch. At the ranch, George and Lennie encounter many challenges, and they also undergo many struggles to attain their idealistic dream. The author concludes this novel with a very shocking and unexpected ending.This is a great novel to read. It is a short and entertaining novel that captures the reader's interest. It moves in a fast pace with many excellent descriptions in every scene. The novel was so well written that I was immersed into it. The author explorers the brotherhood in humans, strengths and weaknesses, and the dream we all possess. Steinbeck clearly illustrated the impossibility to achieve happiness and freedom - the American Dream, and I definitely can relate the themes to my daily life.

Full of surprises, sadness that you will never experience with bunch of papers, the cruelty of love, and the unpredictable final.

It deals with really interesting subjects such as dreams, loneliness, authority and violence. I believe this are the main themes the book has, these are the things that the author wants us, the readers, to find out. George and Lennie, the main characters, are itinerant workers, they both share a dream. This dream is the most important thing they have, it gives them the hope that things in a future would change, that they would have a house &quot;An'live off the fatta the lan&quot;. This two characters are very different, George is &quot;small and qick&quot; instead Lennie is a huge guy, mentally retarded. Although all the differences they have,they travel together and share lots of important things. Every character in the novel is lonely, and I believe this is one of the thing that had more impact on me. The fact that no character had any real friend, nor a family, no one to talk with, no one to hear you. I think that this is why, some parts of this novel are really sad. &quot;Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the lonlinest guys in the world, They got no family. They don't belong no place&quot; This is said by one of the main characters, George.

Illustrating the fierce love between two friends, Steinbeck takes the reader on a journey through the poverty stricken lands of the West. These two friends, George and Lennie, are the two main characters of the novel, and their journeys from job to job hold only one thing in common: they keep their dreams to one day own their own little patch of land. Because of Lennie's combination of mental retardation and incredible strength, he often gets into troublesome situations and ends up leaving town. George always goes with Lennie, but in the tragic end, George realizes that he cannot keep protecting Lennie from the world.There is much to this book, but it can easily be read as simply a sad story. I found it very readable, and I have always kept it close to my heart. There are some instances of foul language and inappropriate situations, but they in no way are distracting to the overall thematic content. Steinbeck's evocative language and beautiful descriptions are breathtaking. The story is not so complex or farfetched that it becomes unbelievable, and I highly recommend it to anyone that is considering reading it. I truly do love this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George Milton, a little man physically, tried to receive a harvesting job along with his close friend Lennie, who on the other hand, is a giant of a man physically, but very slow mentally.

Steinbeck is mostly known for his great attention to detail and his sense of social justice in Of Mice and Men. George is a small man, who not only has himself to look after but also has the job of looking after and caring for his mentally delayed friend Lennie. George said, \\"Whatever we ain't got, that's what you want. God a'mighty, if I was alone I could live so easy. I could go get a job an' work, an no trouble.

Even if the subject matter of Of Mice and Men had interested me, I still would have given the novel a one star rating because of my criticism that I will explain in this review.I am giving this novel a one star rating because it has a lot of vulgar dialogue. There is an average of about 4 profanities per page.Secondly, even if I were to set aside my moral views of this novel, I still would choose to give this novel a one star rating. In my opinion, the plot structure is not all that good. The climax and resolution could have followed directly after the first 1/3 of the novel. There are too many conversations that seem to fill up space with unnecessary dialogue which describes the backgrounds of characters and personalities that do not play a significant role (if even a role at all) in the outcome of the story.Furthermore, Of Mice and Men has too many characters for its very simple plot. In my opinion, the advantage to having a lot of characters is to create intricate subplots which play a significant role in the outcome of the storyI do not insist on reading action-packed stories. In fact, I sometimes prefer stories that are mainly comprised of dialogue. However, I do always want to see that there is a CLEAR DIRECTION in the conversations that progressively leads to the climax. In my opinion, the dialogue in Of Mice and Men did not meet these criteria. In fact, mid-way through the novel, I really felt as though the story was approaching a dead-end, and I think that John Steinbeck probably felt the same way. Therefore, he made the climax take a sharp turn off course just so the plot would not slam into a wall.Due to the offensive content and weak plot structure, I do not recommend Of Mice and Men."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"&quot;hey dortch do i git do dend da wabbits dortch&quot;"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I gave this book a one star for the cursing!

Memorable characters. Excellent ending. Colorful setting.

That character is taken from this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice And Men? Oh no, no, no. Of Genius and Sheer Brilliance is so much more fitting. You can read it in about an hour, but be ready to read it three or four times in a row. It is splendidly entertaining. You root for these guys, a little down on thier luck, to win. All you want is for this big goof Lenny to get his warm so he can be warm and loving as he is deep down inside and raise him some rabbits. I'm reminded of the Abominable Snowman character from the old Bugs Bunny cartoons. I'm gonna hug him and pet him and squeeze him and love him... But anyway, this is short, simple and very easy to read. However, the easiest thing to do is enjoy this novel. Yes, you are a little upset and disappointed when Lenny is killed, but it's still one of the best novels ever written."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Very quick read.

It was short so I figured, \\"I'll just read this first and get it over with. I mean like, it seems kinda boring.\\" It just didn't seem to make much sense from what i read from the descriptions. When I read it, the first chapter was so relaxing and the setting was described so perfectly. Automatically, I was whisked away back to the 1930's in a quiet farming area in the rural areas of CA. I absolutely loved reading this book. It was such a good book! There were many themes that could be easily picked up. And from those themes, it helped explain certain attributes about different characters and the kind of society Lennie and George entered. In the end of the book, George makes a very large sacrifice that effects himself and a lot of the people he works with. It may also bring you to tears. It definitely brought me to tears. I don't think I saw it coming. I guess it was sort of... ironic. Enjoy your read!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This story is a simple one in many ways. It's about the Depression, class relations, friendship, and how we treat people with disabilities. It has as much relevance today as it did when it first came out. I read it years ago, and I still remember it. As another reviewer mentioned, it says a great deal about the importance of Steinbeck's message that Lenny has been recreated in so many Warner Brothers cartoons -- he's an archetypical character.I loved how vividly Steinbeck brought the reader back to the Great Depression. He really showed how difficult that time period was, and the way the &quot;American Dream&quot; has been sold to people who will likely never reach it. The relationship between Lenny and George was absolutely wonderful -- I loved that George did try to take care of Lenny, even if I didn't like how he treated him at times. All the characters were full bodied, three dimensional people. The choices Steinbeck had them make seemed sensible. This novel is essentially flawless, and I would reccommend it to anyone over the age of about 12 -- it does have some rather serious themes, so readers who are very young, even if they can read it (its' written in fairly simple language) might find some parts disturbing. If you didn't read this book in high school, read it now -- you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I like it how john steinbeck picked the characters. George being the smaller individual who had the brains and was a nicer looking guy and Lennie being the very big strong guy with being mentally challenged. george could have went back on his word to lennies aunt and left him to be put in an asylum but he kept his word and took care of lennie and soon became best friends with lots of trusts in each other. Curley's wife now presomed to me as a kind of girl or woman that sleeps around alot a\\\\or thats how she acts when she was first introduced but come time to the end she was just looking for somebody to talk to. Curley was a little different he always wanted to picked a fight with the new people that are bigger than him so he would be known as the head huancho.this story was well put together as a wrighter for john steinbeck having his life time thirty years or more years between our time life is pretty much the same beside the migratoty workers which there are still some around."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George and Lennie are very good friends.

He got himself into alot of trouble because he could not understand many situations. Lennie's main concern was to pet nice things and that is what got him into the most trouble. With his size, Lennie did not even understand his own strength. George took care of Lennie. He did all the thinking that Lennie could not do himself. He had patience with Lennie, while other could not. No matter what he still stuck with Lennie and took care of him. Together, they had a dream and wanted so bad to reach it that they felt it was always within one step their grasp.This book showed the greatness of friendship. I would recommend this book to my friends because it shows the meaning of friendship and patience. This book is about dreams and how important they are in pushing someone to reach them."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Fiendship is very important to everyone.

I usually do not enjoy reading, but this book was able to keep me interested and I actually read it in one sitting, this book is one that you really cannot put down once you pick it up. The simplistic storyline allows readers of all levels to enjoy the story and not get lost, yet is not too simple that the novelette becomes boring.At the start of the novel, we are introduced to George and Lennie the novel's two main characters. They are fleeing from their former hometown because Lennie has gotten the duo into trouble again. It is not that Lennie is a troublesome character, as that he is unaware of his physical strength. This physical stature combined with his nave nature, which is due to his mental disability, causes many problems for him and George. The two dream of owning their own ranch one day with many fields and rabbits for Lennie. To fulfill this dream they work on a ranch to earn and save money. While on the ranch Lennie is subjected to many awkward situations. George's loyalty to Lennie is often challenged by his friend's mishaps, he always remains true. Twisting the plot al the way to the end, Stienbeck creates a novelette that teaches us the meaning of a true friend.

I didn't like the way the story was written, because that isn't really my type of book.

Our story starts with two friends, Lennie and George, getting run out of town because Lennie accidentally killed another person. George is smart, short, and skinny. George's companion, Lennie, is big, strong, and simple minded. The journey begins in the town of Weed and ends a few miles south, in Soledad. Interestingly, the book ends the same way it started, with the two friends getting run out of a town. John Steinbeck has done a great job of developing all his characters by giving them strong backgrounds. Steinbeck also explains the personalities of his characters extremely well. In particular, Steinbeck has written an exceptionally interesting individual, the stable buck, Crooks. He has a strong work ethic, a pleasant and kind demeanor.Why did these two friends get run out of town? What happens at the surprise end of the book? Those are a couple of questions that might be going through your head. If you read this book you can find the answers to all of these questions and decide what type of book Of Mice and Men is.

The water is warm too, for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool.\\" (Page 1) Lennie,though mentally retarded,is a loveable character who everyone will enjoy reading about. George is a strict, yet caring person towards others, and is the \\"caretaker\\" of Lennie.I had no complaints towards the book, except it repeats the same things a fair aount of times.

In this book, it is about George and Lennie, who, people would call odd, because no men would travel together anymore, during that time period, which is, 1930's I guess (I forgot). This book shows the bond of friendship and the hardship that grown up has to get over with. It starts out with getting a job at a ranch, we soon discovered that the tall and strong Lennie has a mind of a child, which makes things worst, once they got their job at the ranch. George, who is Lennie's companion, really wants to keep Lennie out of trouble, but sometimes trouble comes without you knowing it. Soon, after some time, things gets worst, and an surprised ending wraps the story all up."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is definitely the best short novel i've ever read, and it is probably my second favorite book (Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov is first.)Steinbeck's portrayal of the offbeat friendship of George and Lenny is deeply moving and engaging. This book is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck's writing style is fantastic, and this story lends itself to dicussion in high school classes. It's not overly complex, but the issues raised are limitlessly debatable. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as GRAPES OF WRATH because MICE doesn't have the same epic feel, but still it's a fantastic book that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"&amp;#65279;Overall, John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is really a good book. Even though it's rather short, itdelivers its message quite well. The book opens with George and Lennie near the Salinas Riversouth of Soledad, California. Lennie is a big, loveable guy who isn't very smart, but is easilypleased. Lennie loves to stroke soft things, and has a mouse in his hands that he accidentallykilled by petting it too hard. Lennie's portrayal is extremely sympathetic and sentimental, but Icouldn't help but like him, regardless of his flaws. George is the little man behind Lennie; he actsas the big man's brain in guiding him and keeping him out of trouble. We all has someone likeGeorge to keep us out trouble from time to time. The two travel and work together and have afriendship unlike anything most other characters in the novel have ever experienced. The bookreally got me to feel like I knew the characters, especially Lennie, and you begin to feel like yourin the story with the characters. The underlying theme of man's innate loneliness and his need forcompanionship is a bit dark and pessimistic for my taste, but is delivered tactfully with therepeated story of George and Lennie's farm where Lennie will be able to tend rabbits while thetwo live off the fatta the lan' offers hope so the book can be easily stomached by someone with amore optimistic worldview. I do have to say this is one of the best book I have read. All thingsconsidered, I would definitely recommend this book for everyone to read; the ideas behind itshould be considered by all."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I thought Of Mice and Men was a good book so thats why i gave it a 4 out of 5 stars. The people in the book were relastic and they seemed like they would be the type of people that lived back in the 1930's. Also how they talked seemed like that would be how they talked back then. In this book there was racisim so that is the social issue in this book..and yea..i don't really have anything else to say but it was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I liked the book alot, for being a required book to read in a junior english class, it wasn't a bad selection. My favorite character is probably, George, cause I mean he stuck with Lennie almost to the very end and he put up with all this problems.The plot of the book is interseting because the time period their really wasn't much to life when your a traveling ranch hand. I like the slick ways of Slim, he's also an interseting character. But, most of all out of the whole book I want a old dog that can't see and can't even walk because their so useful...joke. Good decision to kill that dog it probably was in pain.But the book dispite it's few slow parts I believed it to be an awesome book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book has great story about how two men with very different personaliltes get along. They travel together trying to earn enough moeny to live out their dream. It shows how no matter what happens they have a friendship which connects them in some way. They have a wonderful frienship and stand by each other. Lennie is not the brightest man and can be a little aggrivating but no matter what George is there to help and protect him."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book has great story about how two men with very different personaliltes get along.

I fully recommend this book by John Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is by far my most favorite John Steinbeck novel. Of Mice and Men takes place in California where we meet Lennie and George; they are both farm workers going from farm to farm working in the fields. Both Lennie and George are both two different people, but they each have their own strong points and weak points; Lennie is strong, but has the brain of a five year old, George is smart, but not strong like Lennie. A lot of times, George decides for Lennie, and Lennie is almost never left alone by himself. So they come to a farm and do some work, but the farmers wife comes around, and she is known for messing around with the other farm workers, so he keeps his wife on a short lease. As the story progresses, George and Lennie feel their friendship come closer, and you start to care for Lennie because he does not know any better, so you feel sorry for him. Now one night, Lennie is left alone, and the farmers wife comes to Lennie who is in the barn, and hurts one of his animals, so he takes him in his arms and violently shakes her, eventually killing her. The Lennie tries to bring her back to life, then failing. So when George comes back to the farm, so now everyone in the farm goes hunting for Lennie. So with shotguns ready to kill Lennie, George looks for Lennie and eventually see's him, and rescus's him from his misery; killing him with the shotgun.It is a sad tale, but yet very warming and yet very good. This is an American classic, but yet still very good even as old as this book is. A definite read, I have read this book three times and yet it stills one of my favorite books by John Steineck"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is a great classic. I loved hearing Gary Sinise narrate the book he does an excellent job. This has always been one of my favorite books and this is the best way to \\"read\\" it. I listened to it on my way into work and my way home."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I knew the title, I knew the name and background of the author, but somehow I didn't have to read this book in high school. It's never to late to catch up on the classics!After finishing \\"Of Mice and Men\\" my first reaction was that it was a very fast read, and it was a bit overhyped. I found Steinbeck's writing style a bit choppy, not an easy read (meaning the true-to-life exchanges were both irritating and believable).After a week of reflection, I am beginning to appreciate the work more, and can understand the \\"classic\\" classification. Some of the content is coarse for middle school, and it may have been intentionally left off the reading list (or perhaps kept out of the library) of my Virginia school, but I recommend (re)reading this one as an adult. Like works of Shakespeare, Steinbeck's work is likely better understood with life experience."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read this book with my 17 year old son for school. He was reluctant to get started and the dialect in the book was challenging for him. However, the author's word choice, symbolism, and snapshots created through the words provided excellent learning opportunities for my son. We journaled each chapter writing a summary, reaction and predictions. I enjoyed watching him grow throughout the book of friendship and the infectious power of dreams."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"George and Lennie are drifters, moving from rural property to rural property, they go wherever work takes them. They stay for as long as their luck lasts, doing whatever the current job demands, but come what may George and Lennie stick together. George is small, fast to loose his temper and smart. Lennie is big, always affable and dim-witted. Lennie needs George to look after him, and George sometimes wishes that he was able to live life free and easy, free to gamble and booze his money away. Lennie's slow wit often gets him into trouble in the rough and tumble, male world of the rural society. Now \\"a few miles south of Soledad\\" George and Lennie are about to start a new job. Before they enter the property the two camp out overnight so George can enjoy the scenery. This proves to be the calm before the storm as the two are about to experience life-changing events.This is a short book, being just under 100 pages, but it contains much to be thought about. Steinbeck describes in detail the harsh way men choose to live. He notes how, in this environment, some men rise to become leaders, being hero-worshiped in such a way that their word becomes almost gospel in the minds of other men. But Stienbeck, through the friendship of George and Lennie, also notes that there is another, more caring way for men to live. Of course even those who follow a philosophy of caring live in the real world of struggle in which circumstances are not easy to resolve, and Steinbeck is well aware of this. Steinbeck's beliefs are informed by his knowledge of Christianity, but one does not have to slavishly follow that religion to agree with what he is saying. This book was first published in 1937, but is contains ideas that have finally flourished in the New Age Men's movement of the late Twentieth Century.This book is stylistically interesting. Steinbeck deliberately wrote his prose in a way which imitates plays (drama). Events take place in a set 'scene' and characters enter, interact and leave. Dialogue, rather than action, is emphasized. The author, indeed, later wrote a theater version of this story. He did the same thing with the book _The Moon is Down_. Through Steinbecks skillfully woven dialogue we gain a good understanding of his main characters and Lennie is one of his most poignant creations. The climaxes of this tale, and there are more than one, are also memorable.John Steinbeck is of course a famous author and this is one of his most well known novels. I am glad to say I did not find it in the least disappointing and I am very happy to award it five stars."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"A powerful short story by Steinbeck that,like many of his novels, occurs in his hometown of Salinas, California.Lennie and George, the protagonists have a mutual care for each other. Lennie is a flat charcter. He does not change throughout the story- introduced as an innocent naive man, he dies so too. George, on the other hand, changes. Despite his short temper and rough character, his primary goal is to protect Lennie. His fraternal figure grows at the denouement where he ironically kills Lennie out of love. While admitting to sometimes making fun of his friend, George shoots Lennie to spare him from the brutal killing of a mob. Out of mercy and compassion, George always cares about his friend. Always reminding him of their dream- a farm where they can live together away from the mockery and ruthlessness of the world. This was also the last conversation he had with Lennie. Instead of rebuking him for \\"doing something bad\\"-accidently killing Curley's wife- he talks to him about this farm. Steinbeck chooses the unrealistically innocent character of Lennie to foreshadow that his destruction is inevitable no matter how much George looked after him. The reader sympathizes with Lennie from the beginning but at the end George becomes the real hero- sacrificing even his friend to save him.During the story, there are hints of George's constant care and sacrifice. The reader learns that the two friends have been roaming around and unable to settle because Lennie causes them to be fired constantly. George is always anticipating the worse, ordering Lennie not to talk on their job interview and designating a place for Lennie to resort to in time of trouble.Overall, the touching story of friendship and companionship is another one of Steinbeck's strong and powerful books. George and Lennie were never able to realize their American Dream of buying a farm. Now that Lennie is gone, the reader wonders whether George will pursue this dream by his own or will he abandon. After all, Lennie was a big part of that dream.The title of the book refers to Robert Burns' \\"To a Mouse\\", who while farming disturbed a mouse's nest.But Mousie, thou art no thy lane,In proving foresight may be vain:The best laid schemes o' mice an' menGang aft agley,An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,For promis'd joy!Clearer Translation:But Mouse, you are not alone,In proving foresight may be vain:The best laid schemes of mice and menGo often askew,And leaves us nothing but grief and pain,For promised joy!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book keeps you wanting more until the last line in the book. Would highly recomend to any age group."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book, Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, is about the adventures of two best friends that are meant to take care of each other. Their names are George and Lennie. George always has to take care of himself as well as Lennie. Lennie is a challenged individual, but he is the sweetest man. He really means well. The way he talks and acts reflects that he is a little boy stuck in a strong mans body. Lennie is by far my favorite character in this book. Lennie has an obsession with touching soft things. At the beginning of the book it starts with Lennie having a mouse in his pocket which he accidentally kills because he strokes the mouse to hard. He felt horrible. George, who is always taking care of Lennie, is more of a dad to Lennie than a friend. He was asked by Lennie's Aunt Clara to look after Lennie when she died. Throughout the story George continues to look after Lennie wherever they go.Both George and Lennie have a life goal of having a place of their own with land, a house, and animals. They have a place that they can buy from an older couple, but they need to get six-hundred and fifty dollars to buy it from them. They are working to get this money so they can run off and escape from the working world and \\"live offa the fatta the lan' (Steinbeck 56).\\" Throughout the book they travel to find a place to work so they can get the amount of money that they need in order to buy that piece of land. They find a farm that will take both of them as workers and that is where the majority of the story takes place. Most of the people that are working at the farm really like George and Lennie, except for the farm owners's son, Curly. Eventually Lennie and Curly get into a fight. Lennie accidentally crushes Curly's hand. Another incident between Lennie and Curly occurs toward the end of the book that angers Curly to the point that he is ready to kill Lennie.I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. One because it was easy to follow and always kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I could not put the book down. I sat down and read the entire book all at once. Another reason is because it was one of those books that are short enough that you can sit down and read the whole story in a few hours. The book also had an interesting story plot. There was one part of this book that I did not like. I was disappointed when Steinbeck made Lennie look like a bad guy for part of the story. An example is when Lennie kills the mouse at the beginning of the book. Lennie has good and honest intentions. I felt so bad for him that I almost started to cry. Lennie felt horrible every time he did something to hurt someone or something in the book because he did not understand his own strength. I really like how George is a father figure to Lennie and how Lennie really appreciates George. Lennie understands that George will always there for him. The two men give each other a reason to live. George and Lennie truly value each other's friendship. I recommend this book for all boys and girls, child or adult."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"If you want a great story written in a direct way without page after page of verbal dead space, as one so often finds, not overly long but absolutely complete in its telling I highly recommend \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In a royal blue, cloth-covered slipcase reminiscent of denim.

I believe only a paragrah or two was omitted from the book in this recording, so you get the complete story.

From my honors students to my students who can barely read, this book is always a favorite, and they all enjoy the power of Sinise's narration."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck is one of my favorite American authors, I've read most of his novels. I hadn't read this book since 10th grade, so I bought a new copy and read it again. I like the imagery and characterizations. It's a good story, plus it is a good book to read when you want to read \\"literature\\" but are intimidated by the 800-page Russian or British books. (Or likewise, Grapes of Wrath) The major problem I have with this book and much of Steinbeck's works are that the majority of women are portrayed as [prostitutes] who let their sexuality cause evil. Even on the back of this novel, it says something like \\"George protected innocent Lenny until a flirtacious woman...\\" I'm just tired of Steinbeck's view of women as evil sexual temptresses (East of Eden, Wayward Bus) or [prostitutes] (Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday)... definately worth reading though."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I have to say this. I am not into this kind of stories. It was a good story though. But I am more into the Go Ask Alice, Beauty Queen, Naked Lunch stories.

You have to like to read to truly enjoy this book. It is an ok book. But if you truly dont like to read, I recommend you check out the movie. It is basicaly the same but without the reading.

The setting of this story is in the south were racism and prejudices are just a way of life. The story is about two men who are trying to reach their American dream of having their own house on there own land. George is the smart one who act as an older sibling to Lennie, a man who is big and strong but has a heart of a four year old girl because he's mentally handicapped. Throughout the novel George is constantly telling Lennie that he would be better of without him. They eventually get to Tyler Ranch their new place of work. While settling in there they make plans to buy the land and house with Candy, an old crippled man. At the farm Lennie is treated with respect from everybody at the ranch except for the bosses son Curley. While on the ranch Curley is always trying to stir things up with the workers, especially Lennie. While the men are having a horseshoe tournament Lennie is inside the barn with the pup he want to get. Throughout the book Lennie is constantly killing small animals on accident. He eventually kills the pup, meanwhile Curleys wife who is a constant nuisance enters the barn and starts flirting with Lennie, while petting her hair Lennie gets frightened and incidentally snaps her neck and runs from the ranch as quick as possible. You must read the book to figure out what happens next. This is a heart-warming novel that once you start reading you wont put it down. I recommend you read this book as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck, what more needs to be said. This is one of the best books (and movies) about United States history that has been written. Yes, this is a hisory book! But don't be discouraged. This is like no other history book ever written. It tells the story of the U.S. at one of her most vulnerable times. It has been seventy-four years since the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, and still blacks are treated as slaves. The only thing that counts to the vast majority of this era is wealth and power. People who do not conform to what is considered the social norm are outcast and treated as second class. This is the setting of John Steinbecks classic novel of the american experience. This is a must read, and most of you who attended U.S. schools must have read it already.

It was way to slow-paced and to short. I would recommend it to other kids our age, especially those studying the depression. This book is probably believable for the time frame, but since it is written like a play it can get very confusing in the long dialogue scenes. This book has a lot of great symbolisms but that alone does not make a good book. You would be better of checking this out from a library then buying it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In the book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck two older men, Lennie and George, living as a hobo during the Great Depression in the 1930's struggling in life and trying to find a job. Lennie and George are running away from their old town of Weed because a woman charged Lennie with rape. Lennie is a little bit retarded and likes to touch soft things. George is Lennie's Aunt Clara died so now he's the responsible guardian.There are two main settings in this great novel. First, in the brush where they stay one night. There were many trees and bushes. There was also a pond where the two of them drank from. This was important because if Lennie ever got in trouble George told him to come to this place. The other setting was the ranch where they got their money. The people on the ranch were the boss, Curly, Carlson, Curly's wife, Candy, Slim and Crooks. The two of them bucked barley and there was Crooks house, the bunk house, the main house.George and Lennie are hobo's so they travel together. George always tells Lennie that they're going to \\"live off the fatta the lan\\" (Steinbeck pg.105) which means they're going to have nuts and berries and Lennie can feed alfalfa to the rabbits. George isn't physically strong but he is mentally and Lennie is physically strong but not mentally so they help each other all the time.I would recommend this book for 8th-12th grade students and adults because it has some language that isn't appropriate for younger kids. I would also recommend the audio tape that goes with the book because Gary Sinise, the narrator, expresses the characters excellently. I loved this book because it shows how people dealt with conflicts and how they acted and worked in the 1930's."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Christopher W, Student @ MLMS\\" Livin' off the fatta the land.\\" was my favorite saying as it was peppered throughout the story. (Steinbeck page 14) This and many other phrases you will find yourself saying over and over after reading Of Mice And Men. John Steinbeck is a great author really throwing you into the book. You will find yourself hanging on to every word that George says and laughing harder than ever at Lennie's child-like way of life. Steinbeck will make you feel like you are in Salinas California in the 1930's. You will really feel like you are working on a ranch during this hopeless time in the Great Depression.Two lonely men wandering the roads together looking for work with one thing in mind. They find work but not without trouble. Curly, the ranch owner's son is very hotheaded and causes a lot of trouble. Lennie who is strong physically, but mentally retarded stirs things up as well. The ending is sad but wonderful.George is small and very wise. Lennie is huge, but retarded. Curly's wife uses her femininity to get attention. Curly is easily agitated and hates big people so he and Lennie have some problems. Curly is always looking for a fight.I would recommend this book to any mature middle school audiences and above. It is a vivid description of life during the Great Depression and two men just trying to make a living with all the troubles along the way. You will always remember \\"Livin off the fatta the land.\\" (Steinbeck page 14) and \\"the rabbits George don't forget about the rabbits\\" (Steinbeck page 14). This is a phenomenal book and a great read. You will find your eyes glued to each and every page the whole way through."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Title: Of Mice and MenBy: John SteinbeckReview by: Da'Vaughn L. MurrillThe title of this phenomenal book is \\"Of Mice and Men\\". John Steinbeck, the author of this book, wrote it with great expertise. The usage of his words really depicts the Great Depression (1930's) that led both main characters on their quest to be independent and to live on their own farm. John Steinbeck knows how to hook his readers and keep them on edge. This book takes place in Salinas, California where you can imagine the rolling hills, wildlife, and serene ranches and scattered farms as far as your imagination can take you.The first two characters you meet are Lennie and George. Lennie is a bit slow about the brain. He travels with George. George handles all the business type things while Lennie stays silent. These two are seen throughout the story. When George and Lennie get on their job site (where most of the story takes place), they meet some more people. The first person they meet is the boss. The other characters are Candy, Carlson, Slim, Crooks, Curley, and Curley's Wife. George and Lennie (mostly Lennie) will run into problems. When I read this book, it had me on edge and almost over it! There is also evidence of foreshadowing throughout the book, letting you know that something is bound to happen. My favorite quote in the book is from Lennie; \\"Come on, George. Tell me. Please George. Like you done before. [Steinbeck. (pg.13)]\\" This book is intensifying! I would recommend this book but only to those of a mature nature do to the violence, strong language, and racial slurs."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\", by John Steinbeck was a great book. It took place on a ranch in California during the Great Depression. Lennie and George are two hobo's who look after each other. Lennie is mentally retarded and George looks after him, and continually gets him out of trouble.On the ranch there are a few more important characters. Curly, a \\"used to be professional boxer\\" who is the bosses son and very small in stature, is always picking on Lennie, an overgrown, retarded guy. He hates everyone who is bigger than him. Slim is a tall nice fellow with an ageless face. People just automatically respect him, and his word is law. Carlson hates the old swamper's, dog. Carlson said the old dog stunk and was useless. There is a black stable buck named Crooks. Curly's wife is considered a \\"tart\\" and is always flirting with all the guys.Lennie and George travel everywhere together. Lennie is very forgetful and doesn't know his own strength. George is a smaller guy who takes care of Lennie. The real idea of this novel was love and companionship. Most hobo's traveled alone, but not George and Lennie, they have each other. George may come across as a mean, grumpy man but really it's a form of tough love. He really does care about Lennie.The two hobos plan is to live is to \\"live off the fatta the lan'\\". (Steinbeck, pg. 14) That means they want to be free and own their own land. They won't have to answer to anyone else because they'll have everything they need right there. I strongly recommend this book to mature readers, There is a lot of profanity used."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In John Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\", the main characters Lennie and George are on the run from their last job and are trying to find a new one. George helps Lennie throughout the story, because Lennie is mentally retarded. The setting is in Salinas, California in the 1930's. George is smart to help Lennie, but sometimes becomes frustrated with him.Lennie and George are working on a ranch with a lot of people they have just met including Curly. Curly is a small person who dislikes tall people. Lennie is tall and begins to have problems with Curly. Curly doesn't know that Lennie is mentally retarded. Curly also has a wife who lives on the ranch and the workers call her a \`tart\\" (Steinbeck pg. 28).George and Lennie dream of someday owning a farm of their own. There will be chickens, crops and rabbits and other things. Lennie is in love with anything soft. THis dream keeps Lennie and George going through hard times.I enjoyed this book because of the suspense. I also loved the characters involved and I recommend this book for anyone interested in the Great Depression."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck really led me to love the book \\"Of Mice and Men\\". He really described the ranch in California very well; this is where characters Lennie and George lived throughout the story. He told us that the men: Candy, Slim, Carlson and of course Lennie and George lived in the bunk house. While the boss, Curly and Curly's wife lived, along with the cook. This book depicts racism a little describing how the only black man Crooks lives in his own bunk house alone and gets ignored. Steinbeck also led me to enjoy Lennie and his childish ways. Also how he always said, \\"rabbits George rabbits\\" (Steinbeck, pg. 16).Throughout the story you hear about Lennie and Georges' dream. They want to own their own ranch. They're going to have a win mill and a barn. They want to have small collection of livestock. Lennie wants to feed the rabbits alfalfa. They want to be able live and work on their own land and not someone else's. They want to \\"live offa the fatta the lan\\" (Steinbeck pg.14).The real main idea is about love. Even though the story is about two hobos traveling during the Great Depression; they need each other to survive. As they say in the book \\"you got me and I got you\\" (Steinbeck pg. 104). In the end you can really tell they loved each other and needed each other to stay alive. No matter what happened they were true friends and would always be there for each other.Anyone would love the book by just hearing how Lennie talks. When I read the book it was with a book on tape. This made me enjoy the book even more. This also made me understand it even better. It really showed that Lennie was slow and I could tell that anyone who heard him could know he was slow. This is also another reason why George was so tough on Lennie. I do recommend \\"Of Mice and Men\\" to anyone. The book is very good. It shows companionship, trust, love and care. I think anyone could just fall in love with the book just like I did."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Tyler W, Student at MLMSIn Of Mice and Men. John Steinbeck really explained the life and turmoil of a hobo during the Great Depression. Through his story of Lennie and George, he describes their journey of trying to fulfill his dream. Steinbeck describes in great detail the setting of a ranch in California. The ranch is comprised of a main house, a couple of bunkhouses and a barn.The main characters are the are the hobo's Lenny and George. Lenny is kind of retarded and cannot take care of himself. Lenny is really big with a very bulky frame. George is not very big and takes care of Lenny. He promised Lenny's aunt that he would take care of him. Lenny likes to touch soft things that sometimes get him in trouble.The main idea in the story Of Mice And Men is George and Lenny goes from town to town looking for work. Lenny often allows his urges to get them in trouble. They were running from Weed after Lenny's charged with rape and come to this ranch. George always reminds Lennie that they will \\"live of the fatta the land.\\" (Steinbeck pg. 14). George tells Lenny that the ranch will have \\"A kitchen, orchard, apples, and peaches, and a few berries\\" (Steinbeck Pg. 57)I would recommend this book to all middle school reading classes. It's a great book especially with the tape recorded by Gary Sanice. The book had some curse words in the book but I think middle school students should be able to deal with them. The book also has some funny parts, which make the book fun too read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In \\"Of Mice and Men\\" John Steinbeck takes us back to The Great Depression in Salinas, CA. It revolves around two main characters Lennie Short and George Milton. Lennie a huge, muscular, mentally challenged hobo. George is a short but smart hobo and takes care of Lennie ever since his Aunt Clara died.They are on the run from a town called Weed because Lennie loves soft objects and ended up touching a girls dress. Now they found a farm and are living in a bunkhouse that they share with many other men and Lennie has problems with the boss\`s son.They have a dream of one day owning a farm, with rabbits which Lennie loves; he always fantasizes and tells George \\"An' have rabbits George!\\" Steinbeck pg.14. This story is full of action and keeps you asking for more.I recommend it to mature readers and trust me you will love it. George and Lennie looking after each other is a great story of friendship with a surprising ending."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Title: Of Mice and MenBy: John SteinbeckReview by: Da'Vaughn L. MurrillThe title of this phenomenal book is \\"Of Mice and Men\\". John Steinbeck, the author of this book, wrote it with great expertise. The usage of his words really depicts the Great Depression (1930's) that led both main characters on their quest to be independent and to live on their own farm. John Steinbeck knows how to hook his readers and keep them on edge. This book takes place in Salinas, California where you can imagine the rolling hills, wildlife, and serene ranches and scattered farms as far as your imagination can take you.The first two characters you meet are Lennie and George. Lennie is a bit slow about the brain. He travels with George. George handles all the business type things while Lennie stays silent. These two are seen throughout the story. When George and Lennie get on their job site (where most of the story takes place), they meet some more people. The first person they meet is the boss. The other characters are Candy, Carlson, Slim, Crooks, Curley, and Curley's Wife. George and Lennie (mostly Lennie) will run into problems. When I read this book, it had me on edge and almost over it! There is also evidence of foreshadowing throughout the book, letting you know that something is bound to happen. My favorite quote in the book is from Lennie; \\"Come on, George. Tell me. Please George. Like you done before. [Steinbeck. (pg.13)]\\" This book is intensifying! I would recommend this book but only to those of a mature nature do to the violence, strong language, and racial slurs."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Two friends linked together by circumstance and a shared dream, travel the country looking for work as farm laborers. One is clever, and the other is dumb (but as strong as an Ox). They form an unlikely bond in an attempt to create a stable life, and a place of belonging.The book is beautiful in the simplicity of story and message about the need for everyone to belong somewhere, and dangerous in its final tragedy of wasted life. The friendship between the two main characters may be complex, but the writing certainly is not. It is just great storytelling.A quick read with a wonderful understanding of our need to be loved and belong. The friendship and the heartbreaking conclusion will stay with you long after you have finished."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"When this book begins, it seems to be a simple, realistic view of two farmhands during the early part of the century. However, it is soon evident that through these people and thier lives so unlike ours, something about the human character, and even ourselves, is revealed. Even though he kills the girl, I feel that there is something about Lenny that makes you feel for him and want to shelter him from anyone who means harm. I enjoyed this book immensely, but I warn you--after reading this book, you will feel sad and depressed. Even now, I feel terrible for Lenny, the fictitious character that I've never met."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was just the bomb. I just can not see how anyone could ever write such a telling, sad, touching, realistic story in just 110 pages.

If you like tragedy, comedy, suspense, or irony, you won't be able to put &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; down"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"One man's struggle is another man's accomplishment. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is an intriguing book, which should be recommended to all due to the moral of the book, teaching you about friendship, and overcoming struggles.\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a touching tale of the friendship between two men set against the backdrop of the United States during the depression of the 1930s. The book draws a reader such as myself due to friendship that triumphs over the odds. After analyzing the reviews, I came to understand that \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was not just a book, but also rather a novel of its time. Many students and adults in the world read \\"Of Mice and Men\\" today. A book, which catches the eye of all ages is a book worth reading due to it meeting the standards of various styles of audiences.The author uses variety methods of influence such as overgeneralization, bias, stereotype, and association in the novel. The novel examines many of the prejudices at the time: racism, sexism and prejudice towards those with disabilities. The significance of Steinbeck is that his writing treats these issues in human terms. He sees society's prejudices in the sense as separate (individual) problems and his characters attempts to escape from the prejudices. Steinbeck illustrates overgeneralization in the comment, \\"if you jus' happen to get in trouble like you always done before...\\"(pg. 15). This personal quote is considered as an overgeneralization due to Steinbeck prediction another's behavior. Another example illustrated was association, \\"guys like us that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family\\"(pg. 13). Steinbeck was a man with a great deal of imagination due to him speaking of hard work for the characters to come.Steinbeck states, \\"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the lonesome guys in the world\\" (pg. 13). This demonstrates validity and accuracy because Steinbeck illustrates the farming land in California where he was born. This quote also leads one to the belief of Steinbeck's background of always being away from family. Steinbeck also states in the novel, \\"Hit the jackpot\\" (pg. 10). This quote leads to Steinbeck's work being accurate because of the California gold rush.After analyzing others reviews, I want to believe that I agree with others reviews posted on Amazon.com. Prior to reading this book, I learned a great deal about Steinbeck and his significant novels. Steinbeck was a man who wrote many great novels which are being read even today in high schools around the country. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a thriller, a gripping tale that you will not set down until it is finished.\\"Of mice and Men\\" is a book which I not only recommend to students, such as myself, but also to a variety of audiences'. People should continue to read \\"Of Mice and Men\\" because it will not only teach you about friendship, but also about overcoming struggles.Senior English Student 2010"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"First and foremost, let me note that my review and negative rating has absolutely nothing to do with the supposed swearing in the book. The fact that people mention the word \\"damn\\" and \\"hell\\" with the ocassional insult don't and shouldn't constitute as heavy-duty swearing. It is in no way inappropriate for ninth graders - most ninth graders use far fouler language in everyday life than that mentioned in the book. The way that Crooks is referred to (some prefer to call in the \\"n\\" word) is not always an insult - it is simply how people called others of different coloring. I just felt that I had to explain my reasons, that's all. Moving on, the book isn't entirely bad. Steinbeck's ideas are convincing, and even though slightly depressing, I (as a reader), felt that they were not expressed entirely well. I found the repetition of certain words, purposeful or not, somewhat badly done. It just did not achieve what could supposedly be the intended effect.The characters could have been described in a much more detailed manner. Since this book was probably written with the goal of a novel easily adapted to theatre, the fact that description was toned down was understandable - but still, it felt very lacking. Though the description used for George and Lennie made it easy to picture the two main characters, again, the repetition of certain words really detracted from the passage as a whole. One thing that gave the novel the impression that it was rushed was the fact that some characters that were introduced in the beginning of the chapter two didn't really play a part later on. For instance, the Boss, Curley's father, seemed to have importance in chapter two, but he faded into obscurity after that. The dialogue, on the other hand, is quite fluid and natural.Even though the conflict in the book was very obvious, it could have been worked on and produced with much more profundity. The ending as it is is powerful on its own, but I can't help but feel that something is missing.All in all, that concludes my review. Please take into account that this is not meant to offend anyone: it is simply my opinion."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"If you read some of Steinbeck's work, you will soon discover that he has some wonderful short stories, i.e.: his writing is much more extensive than a few good novels. The present work is somewhere in between a short story and a novel: it is a novella about 120 pages in length.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" has over ten million copies in print. Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the quality of his short stories, which are exceptional. In general, his stories are very detailed and descriptive, and it is clear that he had a natural flair or gift for writing. The present work is good and rates among the best, but do not stop with the present work since he has many more.The story dates from 1937 and is about two migrant farm workers, George and Lennie, who have the goal of working together to save to buy there own small farm. The title is taken from Robert Burns's famous poem, To a Mouse: \\"The best-laid plans of mice and men go oft awry (or astray).\\"The short story describes a few days in their lives as they work on a farm and it describes what can \\"go astray\\" in their plans. Will their hard work be for naught or will they reach their dreams? The story is made complicated by Lennie's slight mental disability. Many of the other characters are equally flawed, but in different ways, and when brought together the result is an interesting story.This is a quick short read and an excellent introduction to Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I will not spend a lot of time in detail here, but I have always loved this story although the ending is hearth wrenching. That just goes to show you how real it is, realistic, dramatic and gripping tale set in an America that was not so long ago. If you are a younger person wanting to expand the fictional horizons of your library this would be a good book to start with. I first saw the TV movie of it when I was in Junior High and never forgot it. Years later I bought this Centennial Edition and now have probably read it four times. It is just one of those stories that has so much power with the power of love, but also carries a world of pain. Don't read my review any more just go read this novel if you have not already!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a very compelling story that illustrates the bond between two individuals. The story starts with George and Lenny working on a farm in a town called 'weed'. George is a very intelligent man and Lenny is a mentally challenged giant. One day while at work, Lenny sees a woman with a red dress on and goes up to talk to her. He gets into trouble when he goes up to her because he does something he should not but does not realize that he is doing anything wrong. He and George then have to run to another farm because they do not want to get caught for what Lenny has done. They need to keep working because their ultimate goal is to own a ranch of their own where Lenny can raise rabbits and they can both live off the 'fatta the lan.' They get to the next ranch the next day and meet the people around there. There is a very nice man, 'Slim', and poor black man and old man, and the worst character of the book, a mean, cocky man, Curley. They work at the farm for a few weeks until Lenny gets in trouble again with an incident similar to the first. The story ends shortly after this and is ended in a very well way. This book is one of the greatest books I have read, not to mention it only being 107 pages long. Steinbeck is a great author and has produced many great books including 'The Grapes of Wrath,' another great novel of his. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to be able to read a story in just a short couple of hours. This is the shortest book that I've ever read but also the most touching and realistic book that I've read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read this book as a choice in literature class. Reading usually isn't my thing but this book caught my eye. I enjoyed watching the movie Simon Burch and the plot seemed to me as if the movie was based on the book Of Mice and Men. Although Simon Burch is based on the book A Prayer for Owen Meany, the significance of this book ties in with Of Mice and Men. This book is based on an everlasting friendship between George and Lennie. George is a short man and somewhat smart. Lennie was a tall and muscular man; but seems younger because of his retardation. They were two men with a dream looking for work. George keeps his eye on Lennie all the time, sort of like a father figure. Every time they get in trouble they run from it, trying to look for more work. However, one day Lennie gets them into a circumstance George can't get them out of. George has to decide what to do."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I absolutely loved this book! John Stienbeck combines a true story of friendship and intertwined unavoidable circumstance along with tragedy, to show realistic fallout. This is a perfect read for those who want to expand their knowledge on the Great Depression! The symbolism in this book is outstanding; the title alone is a testament to that. I'm not sure I found the play script format very useful."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck's book was a book everyone should have to read to understand life during the depression. It was a good read, but since it was so short it was over almost before it started. The symbolism in the book is outstanding, but there are many long and drab dialouge sceens. It is a predictable book that would be better checked out of a library, not bought."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read this book as a school assignment and it is one of the few good reading assignments I have ever had.

It is unfogettable in so many ways. I first read this book in 8th grade and loved it. I then read it again in 9th grade and loved it twice as much the second time around. The characters in the book, George and Lenny are complete opposites, yet at the same time they are a pair. They are both outsiders who need eachother in their hard times and good times. Lenny, being not quite as intellegent as George, goes through a lot. He depends on his friend George to back him up whenever he does something wrong. George on the otherhand is independent. As said before they are completly different people, but in a sense the same. The main story line is very interesting. It has many twists and turns that are completly unexpected. There are some times in the story you will need to pick up a box of tissues and others when you will just laugh. It is an all around great book. I could not put it down, it took me only but a few hours to read the whole thing. And even after you are finished reading you could sit there thinking about what the book actually means for hours at a time. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is in the mood to enjoy an easy read, but yet at the same time a book that has meaning."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The two main characters in the story are Leonard Small, and George Milton. They have one dream: to own a peice of land they can call their own [with Lennie (who is Leonard) tending the rabbits]. To get land, you need to purchase it. To purchase, you need money. So Lennie and George have been going from town to town, mostly because they can't stay in one place too long before Lennie makes a mistake, forcing them to flee. They get jobs at a ranch. They make friends, such as Candy, the swamper, Slim, the skinner, and crooks, the negro stable boy. However, life isn't so peachy keen at this ranch. The flirtatious wife of Curley, the bosses son, is a threat to everyone who works there. For Curley is a very possessive man, who will beat anyone up, who is bigger than he is (maybe even Lennie). Will Curley's wife, who doesn't seem to have a name, cause trouble for George and Lennie, maybe evening ruining their dream? Will Lennie's ignorance to his own strength cause trouble at this town also? Well, you should read the book to find out. The reason I didn't give five stars to this book, is because I think the end was too sudden. It didn't seem right. Maybe you will think differently if you read the book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This review goes for the audio cassettes. Gary Sinise's voice is really incredibly versatile and convincing. I was amazed by the emphasis in his Crook's monologue &quot;Books ain't no good... A guy needs someone to be near'm...&quot;. Also George's &quot;Guys like us are the loneliest guys in the world...&quot; and of course Lennie's and old Candy's. Such different characters and he can display such a variety and richness of detail in the voices for each of them. Really something to hear."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of mice and men is a surprising book. What we mean by this is that as you go reading it, you create your own expectations, that end up having nothing to do with the book itself. The fact that one of the main characters, Lennie, is handicapped, makes the story more real. We all know that it is very difficult to consolidate a relationship with a mentally [disabled] person, but the situation John Steinbeck creates and develops, presents more problems and difficulties than you would normally find in a person with those characteristics. This makes the book more moving and touching. The main themes of the story are: loneliness, which all characters have in their own way, dreams, which has a considerable importance in the story, violence, not only phisical, but psichological too, and authority, in the different relationships the book presents. Each of these are developed along the book, causing an effect of reflection and pity on the reader. In conclusion, this is a moving, interesting, and quite shocking book, which we recommend for anyone who loves reading really well written stories, but can yet put up with a sad, unexpected and disappointing ending."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is undoubtably the best book i have ever read. Like The Grapes of Wrath (another great book by Steinbeck), he ends the book with events that are so emotional you can't get them out of your head. I love how he writes (and i don't know why one of the other reviewers wrote about how annoying the &quot;long&quot; descriptions of the scenery are, because they last only a page!...keep in mind that the pages are small and the font is relatively big). his characters are so believable and they are funny in this book too. I laughed out a loud at least three times.

It will move you."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book Of Mice & Men, by John Steinbeck, is one of the saddest and most moving books I've ever read. I could barely get through the fifth chapter without bursting, and when I'd done THAT I cried hysterically. I won't give anything away... but let's just say it's downright sad. This story is cyclic, which means it begins and ends in the same place. It centers around two main characters: Lennie and George. You can probably read the whole plot by scrolling up the page a little and reading under \\"synopsis\\", but I'll tell you some things anyway. There are a lot of other characters who go in and out of the plot throughout the story, and affect the lives of Lennie and George. George is very simple-minded, and he likes to pet soft things... like mice. This gets him into a lot of trouble in more then one instance, as you can imagine. A lot of people, especially 60 years ago, didn't understand Lennie's condition, and so this book gives a really good overview of the way people thought and felt and acted during that time period. There was a lot of cheating and a kind of every-man-for-himself attitude, but not with Lennie and George. That's what makes this story unique.The reason I titled my review \\"The hungry 30's\\" is because in school my English teacher is constantly reminding us on how \\"the book ECHOS the times of The Great Depression\\". And honestly, he's right, Of Mice & Men is just DRIPPING with grimy adjectives and... et cetera. You kinda get the picture from reading all the other people's reviews. It's true that this book is in the top ten banned books in the country list... but you know what? Last week (the week of September 26th thru October 1st) was Banned Books Week (I was told that Librarians get really pysched up about that)!So, I guess what you're all wondering is why on earth I'd give a book that got me so UPSET a five-star rating. Well, everyone (adults anyway) is always saying that kids today are so... jaded and numbed by the world and... videogames and the things we see on TV. I say, read more books like Of Mice & Men, and there will be no more numbness! You gotta cry your heart out once in a while... It's good for your soul."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"One of Steinbeck's greatest stories, Of Mice and Men tells the tragic tale of two ranch hands--the small leader George and his large, retarded friend Lenny--struggling to survive in central California during the depression. While George looks out for the two, Lenny's innocent curiosity and brute strength prevents them from settling in one place or realizing their dream of owning their own farm. It is the type of heart warming story only Steinbeck can write and the realistic description and charged emotion throughout is unbeatable. This is one of my favorite Steinbeck stories because it can be enjoyed with a quick, cursory reading, but there are several other levels to explore within the novella if you choose to spend the time. It is a very short story--perfect for a junior high book report or a relaxing afternoon on the couch. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This really is a perfect story and you should set aside an evening to make sure that later in life, you'll have read it.

Rarely in history has so perfect a novel been written, has an author so brilliantly made use of language and story, have characters so vivid and human and real been created. This does not mean merely Lennie and George, but the secondary characters as well; any of them could have their own novel, so complete has Steinbeck made them. Even Curley's wife, who is not even given a name, comes to life for the reader in ways that few authors can achieve. The ending will leave you breathless and overwhelmed.The story? Simplicity itself. Two men, seeking something better than they have, bound by friendship in a world where such a thing is rare in the extreme. It's a theme that resonates at the very definition of humanity itself, and which Steinbeck handles with the touch of a master.It is hard to rate such a book; it deserves ten stars. There are other good books about friendship out there, but fine though these may be, they will forever be in the shadow of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;.

The sort of story that depicts a cruel, unfair, appalling world in the most sensitive and loving way possible.In short, a classic.The story is of George, a small, sharp man, and his friend/protege Lennie, a huge, muscular gentle giant with dull wits, who wants nothing more than peace and quiet and little animals. His grandest dream is to someday own a farm with George, where they can have animals -- and Lennie can tend the rabbits. George and Lennie stick together, even after the unthinkable happens and Lennie's strength betrays them both. And when it does, George has to make the most difficult choice he has ever made, one that will haunt him forever -- a choice where there really is no \\"right\\" answer.This is a read-in-one-sitting kind of book, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's light reading. It's powerful, immensely so. It shows, all at once, the hopelessness of human hatred, the helplessness of those caught in it, and the strength that can come through even despite these things. The ending may leave you crying, but it will not leave you depressed, even though all the things that happened are tragic, even though there is no escape now from the spiral of monotony and pointlessness that rules the lives of the workers. Somehow, the author pulls it off.And for that, it is a classic.Rating: Masterpiece"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"It's undisputed that Steinbeck's novel is a gem of its own rights. Add to that Gary Sinise, a great actor who very obviously has a soft spot for this particular book (Gary Sinise has done Of Mice And Men on stage as well as for the movies) and it's magic that is created.One man's voice turns from narrating to snarky to hatefilled to sad with a burden too heavy to carry in the span of moments. It's a brilliant interpretation Gary Sinise is delivering. I couldn't stop listening and was carried to a place where sycamore leaves were rustling under my feet. Amazing!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"From the first page I fell in love with John Steinbeck's way of writing - his humble and delicate language.In this sweet novel Steinbeck has created an interesting set of characters and he chose to set the novel a few miles south of Soledad (loneliness in Spanish) in the 1930's. It tells the story of the two friends, George (the smart one) Lennie (the dumb one), whom have no family, and no place that they can call \\"home\\". To make a living Lennie and George work on the different farms around, trying to save up money. They have a dream of buying a place of their own.. A piece of land where they can grow their own crop and where Lennie can have rabbits. It is this dream that keeps these two friends going.This short novel captures you easily. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a touching and sad story about friendship and the need for everyone to belong. Well written and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This stellar classic of American literature is about the sustaining power of dreams, the synergy of partnership and the heroic sacrifice of one man for another who needed help just to get through the day. Steinbeck's masterful novella is played out by a pair of itinerant farm workers traveling together during the Great Depression. The large, muscular and mentally challenged Lennie is dependent on the small but world-wise and devoted George. The villains are the vicious and newly married Curley, son of the ranch owner, and his trampy wife (who remains unnamed throughout the book.) With the financial help of Candy, a fellow worker, George and Lennie's dream of owning a small farm seems within grasp, despite Curley's bullying of Lennie. But the emotional bullying of Curley's wife proves destructive to the gentle giant. In the end, George and the farm hands remain loyal to Lennie despite an horrific crime he accidentally commits.Film and stage versions have mutilated the roles of Curleys' wife and Lennie, softening her to appeal to the female audience and hardening Lennie, but the evidence of CW as an unsympathetic character is there on the page: a) the mistrust of her by the reliable and world-wise George and the other men; b) her frequent visits to the bunkhouse where she has no business; c) her provocative posing in the bunkhouse doorway where the sun exposes her legs through her thin dress; d) the gloating pleasure she takes in watching Crooks, the black stable buck, shrivel in fear over her threats to have him lynched; and e) the way she titillates the vulnerable Lennie by sitting close to him in the barn, encouraging him to caress her hair, knowing full well her closeness will stimulate him. She's a vicious tease, getting off on her sexual power over men.Many have touted Curley's wife as a misunderstood victim of her times, but making excuses for her would be a travesty. She's one of the earliest examples in American literature of a well drawn female villain, an archetype of the otherwise powerless slutty female using her sexual power over men to gain some sense of control in a world where women had little power outside narrowly defined roles.After threatening Crooks with lynching, Curley's wife goes after Candy and Lennie, demonstrating her power over them as well. At the beginning of the scene she comments about the \\"weak ones\\" (her words) being left behind while the others went to town. By the end of the scene, she has asserted animal-like dominance over all three men through emotional bullying. Together, both Curley and his wife fulfill the villain role in this drama, and of the two, the wife is the more destructive. Curley is a physical bully whereas she is an emotional bully, viciously attacking \\"the weak ones left behind\\" and gloating over her conquest.((...She turned at last to the other two.Old Candy was watching her, fascinated. \\"If you was to do that [lie about Crooks to get him in trouble], we'd tell,\\" he said quietly. \\"We'd tell about you framin' Crooks.\\"\\"Tell an' be damned,\\" she cried. \\"Nobody'd listen to you an' you know it. Nobody'd listen to you.\\"Candy subsided. \\"No ...\\" he agreed. \\"Nobody'd listen to us.\\"Lennie whined, \\"I wisht George was here. I wisht George was here.\\"Candy stepped over to him. \\"Don't you worry none,\\" he said. \\"I jus' heard the guys comin' in. George'll be in the bunkhouse right now, I bet.\\" He turned to Curley's wife. \\"You better go home now,\\" he said quietly. \\"If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was here.\\"She appraised him cooly. \\"I ain't sure you heard nothing.\\" [meaning nobody would listen to him]\\"Better not take no chances,\\" he said. \\"If you ain't sure, you better take the safe way.\\"She turned to Lennie. \\"I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself.\\" She slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And while she went through the barn, the halter chains rattled, and some horses snorted and some stamped their feet. [Even the animals sense she is dangerous.]))What is there to misunderstand about such cruelty? Perhaps CW's apologists are confusing the screen/theater versions with what Steinbeck first put down on paper. Perhaps they're projecting onto her their personal desires that women always remain the warm, cuddly, \\"sugar-and-spice\\" creatures of the fairy tale. Perhaps they should watch FATAL ATTRACTION and get a stronger dose of female villainhood.It is condescending toward women to assume they're incapable of being strong villains.Every villain has reasons for their cruel, antisocial behavior. When the villain is male, who makes excuses for him? Why should we excuse CW as a \\"misunderstood?\\" Because of her gender? No, that's a double standard.The book celebrates the anti-heroism of George, who devoted his life to the comfort and well-being of the meek and vulnerable Lennie. It would be a sad mistake to dishonor that noble intent by warping the story into some statement on female victimhood, as the '92 film did.BIRDBOY-1: Prince (BIRDBOY: STORIES FROM AN AMERICAN ORPHANAGE)[...]"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Published in 1937, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a novella written by Nobel Prize-winner, John Steinbeck. George Milton and Lennie Small, are migrant workers during the Great Depression. George is a witty, intelligent man who looks after his giant counterpart, Lennie.Lennie is a kind, mentally handicapped man who has an obsession for stroking soft things. But because of his size, he possesses super-human strength and cannot control it.The two characters are fleeing the town of \\"Weed,\\" California because Lennie was accused of rape for touching a woman's soft dress.They both share a dream of owning their own homestead. George wants to be his own man and Lennie dreams of holding and tending to his own rabbits.Being hired on a ranch, they soon find themselves intimidated by Curley, a pugnacious man with a massive inferiority complex who immediately takes a dislike to Lennie because of his size.During the course of the story, Curley's wife becomes infatuated with Lennie. She is a provocative, but lonely woman who flirts with the ranch hands to fulfill her dreams of becoming a movie star. One night, Curley comes to the bunkhouse and starts taunting Lennie. He takes the abuse until George gives him permission to defend himself and crushes Curley's hand.One of the ranch hands, Candy, offers to help George with the money to buy their farm if he can help tend to it, and they are ecstatic as their dreams of freedom are about to come true. Leaving Lennie behind, George and Candy ride into town to buy the land.Lennie is given a puppy and can't abstain from holding it. Inside the stable, he accidentally kills it by petting it too hard. At this time, Curley's wife enters the stable to be alone with Lennie. She finds out that Lennie's passion is stroking soft things and offers to let him stroke her soft hair. She panics when she realizes the untamed strength of this large man and begins to scream. Lennie panics in a fit to make her be quiet and accidentally breaks her neck.I don't want to give away the ending, but I urge you to read this gripping story.This is genuinely a true to life story by John Steinbeck, and below is a statement made by him in an interview in the New York Times in 1937:\\"I was a bindlestiff myself for quite a spell. I worked in the same country that the story is laid in. The characters are composites to a certain extent. Lennie was a real person. He's in an insane asylum in California right now. I worked alongside him for many weeks. He didn't kill a girl. He killed a ranch foreman. Got sore because the boss had fired his pal and stuck a pitchfork right through his stomach. I hate to tell you how many times I saw him do it. We couldn't stop him until it was too late.\\""},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Thanks to someone who callously spoiled the ending for me, I was able to appreciate most of the symbolism and themes that led up to the ending. Typically the topic of \\"great American dream\\" don't appeal to me in literature (such as in Death of Salesman), because it brought with it the innocence and naivet&eacute; of a much too bygone era. (Today we have Occupy Wallstreet and the class warfare of the 1% vs. the rest). But this novella captured the desire of every man not to make it in vast fortunes or greed, but for a little bit of independence, a little bit of one's own earth and sky. The message hits the spot at this time."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Due to its simplicity, it is almost easy to overlook John Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\" as one of the premier works of American literature. Yet calling it simplistic does great injustice to a story that so eloquently captures a time and a way of life, a story that drifts quickly into being and all too quickly ends. Even though it is short, the impact of Steinbeck's novel lingers long after in the reader's conscience and heart.\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is the tale of two men, George Milton who dreams of owning his own place one day, and Lennie Smalls, the idiot with brute strength who sticks to George like glue. Because George feels responsible for Lennie the two travel together in a time when most men would set out on their own. Certainly George's life would be a lot easier if Lennie were not in tow, but that's the lot he's accepted, even after having to flee a town because a woman accused Lennie of rape. From the very start both George and Lennie are leery of their new position and premonitions abound that disaster is constantly around the corner. Steinbeck crafts a unique blend of characters, all of whom capture quintessentially the dialect of time and place, as George and Lennie's premonitions come to fruition, and heartbreaking decisions must be made.This short novel is difficult to put down and is easily read in very short time. Steinbeck's writing is effortless and lyric, his chapters beginning with vivid sensory descriptions of place to set the scene before his characters enter to bring life to his words. There is nothing forced in Steinbeck's novels, especially his California set pieces that help define regionalism and naturalism in American literature. Many would crown Ernest Hemingway as \\"the\\" American author, but Steinbeck more rightfully holds that place, in my opinion. While Hemingway did capture brilliantly the voice of the Lost Generation, Steinbeck achieved more to define America and American literature in his novels, as evidenced with this masterpiece. It is one of the best works in American literature, one that can be read and reread and seem new each time."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The tension and pathos in John Steinbeck's \\"playable novel\\", \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is palpable. It tells the story of George Milton and Lennie Small, two itinerant field workers in 1930s depression era California. Milton, a cynical, intelligent man, by a combination of habit, intent, solicitude, friendship, love, loneliness and, one might even say, bad luck, has allowed himself to become the surrogate father or brother for his companion traveler, Lennie Small. Small, (undoubtedly a name chosen by Steinbeck for its irony) is a retarded adult with the social skills and gracelessness of a young child, trapped in the body of an enormous and physically powerful man.Forced to run away from their last job when Small was wrongfully accused of rape, Milton and Small have now found a quiet farm and a crew with which they hope they work long enough to accumulate a stake. They want to buy a small piece of property that they can farm for themselves. Lennie's sole childlike dream for retirement is to live with his friend George and \\"tend rabbits\\". But, once again, Small's complete lack of adult social skills and the failure to understand the magnitude of his own strength undermine their dreams when Curley, the owner's mean-spirited and small-minded son draws Small into a fight and his lonely wife uses her attractiveness and feminine wiles to draw him into a conversation that ends in tragedy.\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a short novella. At only 118 pages, it can be digested in a mere two to three hours. Written as a \\"playable novel\\", the story is told almost exclusively in dialogue with the intent that it would translate easily into a three act play. Such small bits of narrative and exposition as exist in the story actually serve more by way of stage directions and hints as to the scenery backdrop that might be used in the live stage production that Steinbeck envisaged when he wrote it.But for all its simplicity and brevity, the power and pathos of the themes of helplessness and loneliness embodied in Steinbeck's story are not to be denied. As with so many other classic novels that I've finally had the good sense to read over the last two years, I feel like I've not only come late to the party but all of the other party-goers have already come and gone. Well, I'm sure I wasn't the only one but if you're one of the few people who read and enjoy classic literature in the English language, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" deserves a place on your must-read list. It will be a hard-hearted reader indeed who comes away from \\"Of Mice and Men\\" without a lump in the throat.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"As a teacher, I purchased this audio CD of Of Mice and Men and absolutely loved it. I used it with my 10th graders, and they enjoyed it so much, that every day they asked if we were going to listen to the CD and read the book! I noticed that my most reluctant readers were actually overjoyed!Gary Sinise does an excellent job voicing the characters and the CDs were pretty easy to navigate. I fully intend on using the audio CD's with my students from now on! My sophomores from last year are still asking when I'm going to teach Of Mice and Men, even though they don't have me anymore! I was extremely satisfied with the quality of the CD and excited to be able to bring John Steinbeck to my students attention, which is extremely important, considering we live within miles of where the book takes place and where Steinbeck lived (Salinas/Soledad). I highly recommend purchasing this CD!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"It took me a measly three hours to read John Steinbeck's classic tragedy \`Of Mice and Men', a novel that, while written in 1937, still holds so true today. Steinbeck's accounting of sheer loneliness and desperation is so brilliantly captured that the reader is brought to tears (for me in a literal sense) to realize that this is all these people had to live for, a pipe dream that refused to die. The story focuses mainly on George Milton and Lennie Small, but as you read you'll notice that a few supporting characters play a big role in the heartbreak that this novel conveys.George is a small framed man, lean and dwarfed in comparison to his companion Lennie, the tall large strong man, but what Lennie has in strength and size he lacks in smarts. He is, for lack of another word, mentally retarded. But Lennie does possess a simple soul and a heart of gold, which alone makes this tale all the more tragic. George, in fulfillment of a promise he made to Lennie's Aunt Clare, takes care of Lennie, taking him with him to work in the fields bucking wheat and the like. When they make it to their next job they find that they aren't the only ones trying to find a better lot in life.First they meet Candy, an older man who's been injured on the job and thus kept around for sympathy's sake. He sweeps the living areas and lives his life one miserable day at a time. He's slipping into uselessness and the very thought of amounting to nothing digs deeper and deeper into his soul. Crooks is the negro stable hand, an outcast from the others not only because of his skin color but also because of his disability, being crippled due to a horse accident (he was kicked in the back) and thus he spends most of his time alone in his room. They also meet the boss's son Curly, a jerk of a man who is so insecure about his size and his marriage that he's willing to throw it down with anyone he sees, and he sets the blunt of his rage on poor Lennie because of his size and his demeanor.To me the most interesting and even heartbreaking character is that of Curly's wife. Ostracized by the working men because of her husbands temper and disregarded by her own husband because of his carelessness and blatant jealousy she's left all alone with no one to talk to and no real place to call home. She's regarded by the men as a tart, a floozy who wants all the wrong kinds of attention but in all actuality she just wants any kind of attention she can get for any kind is better than no kind. After the tragic circumstances involving Lennie and Curly's wife the author makes a statement that to me sums up this poor woman when he says that \\"all the meanness and the planning's and the discontent and the ache for attention were all gone from her face.\\" She was alone and desperate just like everyone else.The one thing that kept these stock of characters going, Lennie in particular, was the prospect of getting out, of getting their own place where they could plant and cultivate and \\"tend rabbits\\" and be their own men. When this idea is shared between Candy and Crooks they too jump at the idea of getting away from it all and feeling whole again, feeling complete and being far away from the loneliness of it all. The worst kind of loneliness is the kind you feel even when you're around other people for its then that you know you're truly alone in every sense of the word.Most people are aware of the horrific ending, but in case you are not then I will say nothing further on the subject. Just know that this novel is one of the finest pieces of American Literature and is sure to bring tears to your eyes. While this is just barely over 100 pages it still magnificently captures every emotion and feeling that can possibly be provided here. The characters are brilliantly crafted and their innermost demons are bared all for us to see and to relate. I will never forget this masterpiece and will recommend this to anyone who enjoys good reading. It's a quick read, but it's not one to soon be forgotten."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This popular high school or college required reading written by Steinbeck was one book I have never read. Neither have I watched the movie (1940) or newer versions (1981, 1992). What intrigues me is ALA has listed the novel as top sixth 100 banned books during 1990-1999. How can popular novels written by a famous author who earned a Presidential Metal of Freedom in 1964 received banned and challenged review years after initial publication? Perhaps it was a typo until I confirmed:\\"Of Mice and Men\\" was banned:Syracuse, Indiana, 1974;Oil City, Pennsylvania, 1977;Grand Blanc, Michigan, 1979;Continental, Ohio, 1980Skyline High School, Scottsboro, Alabama, 1983.The book was challenged:Greenville, South Carolina, 1977;Vernon-Verona-Sherill, NY, School District, 1980;St. David, Arizona, 1981;Telly City, Indiana, 1982;Knoxville, Tennessee, School Board, 1984Steinbeck wrote the novel at his house in Los Gatos back in 1937. It was an era of depression; migrant workers and poverty persisted in the US. Steinbeck had dropped out of Stanford earlier to work on the Sprechels Sugar Ranch in this area as a farm hand. He observed the workers behavior and wrote about them. They represented low education and economically poorly people who would do anything to survive. He accurately described the way things were with no flowerily words.The plot of the novel was quite simple.George Mitton (witty, small) and Lennie Small (big man with small brain) both dreamed of acquiring a little land of their own someday. They also were in need of each other. This was in the middle of the depression years among many poor migrant workers searched for work. As low social class they got no respect in the society. Steinbeck showed his sympathy and concern for the down trodden the way we are concerned with homeless and jobless today.Paired with both accusations and past accidents these two went to work at a Ranch. It was there the readers were introduced to some interesting characters, all seemed to evolve around rancher's son Curley. Curley is the bully, always ready to pick on those weaker people, but was an insured failure in a big way. He failed to be a respected boss #2, husband, and a man. His wife (name never mentioned) knew what was missing in life. She tried to get Lannie's attention in taking her. It led to her accidental death. There in the barn among the dark, dank smell of hay the one event after another began to unravel.The end of the novel was worth contemplation and debate. Lennie Small hid in the brush and awaited his frightful punishment. George Mitton had to make a decision; he took matters into his own hands by ending Small's life. The tragic ending could have been averted. Some writers sometimes believe the ending of a novel to provide vicarious happy endings especially targeted for youth. Steinbeck ended it as a tragedy.Could in the novel George Mitton run away in the novel from the crime scene with the woman? Would George have waited for justice to be meted out by a bunch of gun carrying migrant workers who were ready to shoot Lennie? To some readers true literary tragedy is distasteful. This may be one of the reasons that the novel was challenged by many parents if not banned?I thought Steinbeck experimented with novel structured like a play. He believed the writer's duty and served as watchdog of society. To satirize its silliness, to attack its injustices, to stigmatize its faults. He achieved this goal remarkably well in this novel. In fact the book was in the form of a play (1937) and ended as an opera (1970).In retrospect, throughout the novel there were words or vernaculars of improper conduct, vulgar language, presentation of low social class characters which can be objectionable to YA or their parents. I list some examples found from the six chapters including but not limited to:1.Live off the fatta the lan', 2. Bustin' a gut, 3. Cat house, 4. Health issues like pants rabbits, 5. Shove out of here, 6. What the hell's he got on his shoulder, 7. Crack and flop, 8. Goo-goos.The urge to control other's lives and restrict what they can read appears to be just below the surface. People may deny that they want to censor books and mouth platitudes about appropriate reading material, but the end results are challenges to books in schools and libraries.I would hesitate recommending this book at junior high or grade school. Outstanding novel like Of Mice and Men rises just above the safety threhold and basic functional reading to which some teachers or adults would restrict youth to read. As for YA a novel teaches much more than the mechanics of reading, the vernaculars used actually helps to stimulate critical thinking skills. As teenagers they are old enough to discuss and debate the meanings of the vulgar language as it applies today. For college age patrons, they are old enough to vote and fight for America they should be allowed to read as they please."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Imagine lying in the grass with your head facing the stars, a stream trickling by. You can hear the stream seem to lull you in, and you feel the pleasures of a hot, crackling fire, being managed by someone else. Sounds perfect, right? Well, for George, in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, it is anything but perfect. George is taking care of a man named Lennie, who is mentally ill, and dangerous at that. After grabbing a girl and not letting go, Lennie, under George's strict supervision, is helped to flee. They find a job at a farm in the country, and things are going well- at least, that's how it seems. This book combines distinguished writing with a remarkable plot, summing up to a great, touching ending.At the beginning of each chapter Steinbeck describes the setting of the chapter. This technique is fine for some, but bad for others. This style forces the reader who isn't interested yet to read about the place that is being described. If Steinbeck waited a while to explain these things, readers would really be interested in what they were reading (whereas in the beginning of the chapter this isn't so). However, some people disagree and like to have lots of description so they know exactly what they're reading about. A perfect example is the beginning of the second chapter. After explaining the setting of this room in great detail, Steinbeck pauses. Then he goes on to say, &quot;The door opened and a tall, stoop-shouldered old man came in. He was dressed in blue jeans and he carried a big push-broom in his left hand. Behind him came George, and behind George, Lennie.&quot;But after the beginning of each chapter, description dwindles to a perfect amount. The book really flows with dialogue and description combined. The dialogue is used in such a critical way, and Steinbeck really took advantage of the fact that he could express whatever he wanted through dialogue. This writing style also makes the readers able to suspect things, rather than to be told things. Readers are left to figure it out for themselves, making it more believable as well. At the end of the book, it is hard to understand what is happening until you read the dialogue that followed the action. This was a great aspect of the book.Another clever thing Steinbeck established in the beginning of the book was a theme of a farm with rabbits, in which George and Lennie are to live off the fatta the lan'. It is shown very clearly (also through dialogue) that this is Lennie's dream, what he lives for. It also gives the reader hope, which makes people want to continue reading- they want to find out if this dream or wish ever happens. It is a sign of a good author that he can convey emotions so strongly. One of the most touching books, Of Mice and Men stands out. Steinbeck was gutsy in his choices as a writer, and because of that, the ending doesn't make the reader necessarily feel sad, the reader feels moved. Something Steinbeck does a good job of is making readers change their mind so many times about what they think of Lennie, and if they feel sorry for George, admire George, hope Lennie dies for George's sake... the list goes on.This was one of the best classic novels. It is a good book to read if you're looking for something that can draw you in in a short time, and it is hard to put down once you start. Of Mice and Men is definitely a classic worth reading- and re-reading. It is amazing that Steinbeck was able to write this story with such a compellng writing style, gripping plot, and high level of emotion in so few pages."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Besides being a great classic, (I wont review the book because most people have done that here), Gary Sinese's reading is flawless!

Mainly because there are really no new authors out there that have caught my interest lately. I also want to expand my horizons, and read things I might've never given the time and day when I was in junior high and high school. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" appealed to me pretty quickly, from reading the back of the book and seeing how long it was. I wanted to give it a shot. Boy, am I ever glad that I did. This is an AMAZING book.Written by John Steinbeck, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" tells the tale of two men who travel together all the time, hoping to own an acre of land and a nice home they can call their own. George is a smart man who always seems to have things figured out. Lennie is a giant with a mind of a young child. George looks after him, but it is not easy. Lennie always seems to get himself in some kind of trouble, and George is always the one who has to help him out. And when they find jobs on a ranch, George finds out just exactly how fast the best laid out plans can vanish into thin air. The ending is unforgettable and shocking.The writing was very well done. Characters were very interesting and brought their own characteristics to life, leaving it very easy for you to tell them apart. I also liked the dialogue. Though the plot may not be the most complex one, books don't have to be complex. In fact, sometimes it's much more difficult to write the simplest book or story. Nothing fell short in this masterpiece.I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read. Sure, there's a chance that you may not like it. This is very true. But look at it like this: the book is only about 107 pages long. (Pending on which version you have.) How many books do you know that are that short? Which means that if you don't end up liking it, chances are that you didn't waste too much of your time on it. I was pretty sad to finish the book so quickly, but then again, it will be an easy one to re-read over and over again.\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is one of my new favorite novels. It's just a shame that Steinbeck is no longer here. All the good ones always seem to come and go very quickly. This is a book that I will read over and over again. I loved every word, every paragraph, and every page. Enjoy \\"Of Mice and Men.\\" And if you don't, well at least it's a short read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I feel Of Mice And Men is an excellent book. It is also a great movie! My favorite character was Lennie. I felt sorry for him because he was slow. George is the kind of big brother I would love to have, he watches out for him, gets him a job, and does not take advantage of him even though he could. Slim is a guy that everyone looked up to, I would respect a man of his degree. But Curly.. I would of took his stupid boxing trophy and stuck it right up his....well you know what I mean. I liked Candy, he was a good old man, but everyone bossed him around because they knew he would not do anything. I would prefer this book to whoever likes a mellow, old time book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is a very beautifully written book. It's the first Steinbeck book I've ever read, I started yesterday night and just couldn't put it down until I had read it. The words are vividly descriptive and the characters almost come alive in your mind. Steinbeck sort of fades in and out of scenes by describing what is happening in the surroundings, making it a very pleasant experienced to read this book. He picks you up gently in the start of a chapter and puts you down just as gently in the end.The plot is brilliant, I love the story about this odd couple travelling together, the dilemma, a story told with a vivid and subtly humorous language.This is absolutely a 5 star book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"When I first read the book I was in high school, I never enjoyed reading until I was assaigned to read this book. I couldn't put it down at night. This is my all time favorite novel. I think that the book described the true meaning of friendship. Lenny and George were total opposites and what kept them so close was the love they had for each other and their frienship. I also saw the movie and I recommend it. This novel made me cry and laugh. I think that everyone who reads this book will be touched by the wonderful characters. There are so many great written novels and this is definitely one of the best."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This novel makes a strong universal statement about loneliness. It portrays two men who have no family, no place to call home and no plan or goal in their lives. They work and work and then they have nothing to show for it. You get this idea in novel when George says to Lennie, \\" Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family. They don't belong no place. They come to a ranch an' work up a stake and then they go inta town and blow their stake, and the first thing you know they're poundin' their tail on some other ranch. They ain't got nothing to look ahead to.\\" (Steinbeck 15) Also, many other characters demonstrate loneliness. For example, Curley's wife. She claims that she is always alone while her husband is out watching over the workers and that a girl her age cannot handle being locked up in the house all day. Another character is the slave that also works on the farm. He is forced to stay in his own room and is very segregated from the rest of workers. This is a result of the discrimination during the time in which the novel is set. Also, the other workers experience loneliness because they, of course, live the same life that Lennie and Georger live. The author John Steinbeck chose to set the novel a few miles south of Soledad, which is Spanish for solitude and means anger and loneliness. He describes in detail the life of many men who worked on ranches."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Yeah, I said it; this book is better than The Grapes of Wrath. It's also better than East of Eden. In fact, it's the best thing Steinbeck ever wrote. The author's use of interesting, human characters, quick dialogue and fast moving scenes is breathtaking- This is the only novel I have ever reread immediately after finishing it.I will not discuss the plot because everyone else has always done that. I will only say that this is one of the four or five most important books of my life thus far. It opened my door to American literature, and really gave me an appreciation for reading.After reading this, I was excited to read Steinbeck's \\"best\\" books, but it turned out I had already read it. Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, while both quite good, were both a little bit too long. Of Mice and Men, on the other hand, is not a word too long or too short. It's a beautiful, short character study, and you will be better for reading it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book illustrates the friendship between two friends and the mountains they have to climb together. Lennie and George bring the story to life. I felt like I was in the book, so griping. I'm glad it was on my school reading list. This book will always be a classic.By Fletcher Falls 17 years old"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book pulls you in and won't let you out until you have read through the last page. It captures your heart. It is the story of George Milton and Lennie Small. They struggle together to fight the realities of the American society. All they want is to own a farm of their own with horses, chickens, cows and rabbits. George is short tempered but always looks out for his friend Lenny. Lenny is mentally ill to a degree and thinks like a kid, but he has unbelievable strength. He is a giant man. When he is scared he pets anything soft. It may be a dead mouse that he always carries in his pocket, a dress or a woman's hair. This book is written in a poetic form. It truely shows the struggle of men looking for jobs what the jobs consist of when they get them. Their relationship is stronger than any other relationship. They are bonded together by the care they have for each other. Unfortunatley, there is a time when you have no control of your friend's fate..."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck remains properly on the reading lists of high school students because of the regional imagery through succinct dialogue. Unlike \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" Steinbeck brings us swiftly into each moment, never letting us linger too long before walking us to the next place.The American Dream has many variations, but always, it is about independence and the pride of being one's own man. Lennie and George want this independence more than most men, but have less than most men to get there. In their case, it isn't a white picket fence, but a farm where they can raise rabbits.Lennie is not a bright man. He desires to care for someone and to be loved, but is unable to think past his own fear. George tries to protect him, but he too, although smarter than Lennie, is managed by his insecurity and foolishness.The story surrounds Lennie and George's efforts to get and retain work on ranch near Soledad, and more so, toward their American Dream. The big picture is always with them, but it is the day-by-day difficulties they have with being outsiders. Their intrinsic inability to be free is sheer tragedy, as they both fail again and again to make the right decision.It's a lonely story about two men who hope more than they can think, who are destined by their misery never to enjoy true companionship and happiness.Few books are as thematically pure as \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" which follows Man's search for self and meaning carefully. It is harsh in language and image, and the abstract ideas might be too much for younger readers to comprehend, but any intelligent teen will gain from it where John Knowles' \\"A Separate Peace\\" and J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" leave off.I fully recommend \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"There is not a wasted word in Of Mice and Men. An unforgettable and brillaint work by John Steinbeck. It is clear why this is a classic. Every emotion on the spectrum is represented somewhere in this concise and gripping story of the enduring and heartfelt friendship/guardianship between Lennie and George. I loved it, and to think this was first published in 1937, it feels like much more modern writing. Reflecting on novelists since, it is clear that Steinbeck was ahead of his time and an early pioneer of captivating American writing. Splendid and tragic."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is an attractive book about two men named George and Lennie. It is also interesting to read because it talks about how George and Lennie develop a common friendship among each other. George is short and takes care of Lennie because Lennie has a mind of a child. They both use to work in a weed but they had to leave because of an incident that had occur. They went to a new weed in Solidad where there they had many dreams ahead. In the new weed they met new people which made George and Lennie Friendships grow even more. For example Lennie has been in a fight with curley, George told him to fight back and so he did which, led Lennie to breaking Curley's hand.Even though the ending is sad, George and Lennie friendship can insipires everyone because they look out for each other.Even though Lennie is a big and huge he is a kind person.This is an excellent book writen ny John Steinbeck with a sad ending. Through out the pages you can see how much George cares about Lennie. I enjoyed reading this book and it has inspired me to have stronger friendship with my friends. Therefore I would like to recommend this book to those whom are interested in reading books about friendships."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"An outstanding book. This book is a decent look at humanity. It is a simple explanation of human nature. All of these are descriptions of a novel I recently read by the name, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by a well-known author John Steinbeck. I would rate this book 8 on a scale of 10 because I learned so much about the way we treat others and their reactions, told through a man who has had much experience with the subject. Lennie, a big dumb, jock, was born slow, mentaly incapable of reacting to daily life. After George, a caring yet riggid man befriends him early in child hood, the two become traveling partners and best buddies. George becomes weary of Lennie's childish ways and misachievous antics, which continually causes the pair trouble and forces them to skip around the country.\\"That ranch we're goin' to is right down there about a quarter mile. We're gonna go in an' see the boss. Now, look-- I'll give him the work tickets, but you ain't gonna say a word. You jus' stand there and son't say nothing. If he finds out what a crazy ... you are, we won't get no job, but if he sees ya work before he hears ya talk we're set. Ya got that?\\"This story is special because all aspects of diction, from all characters are described in simple English. The story had no useless vocabulary or pointless explaining, just a plain dexcription of the people. The story also uses vivid imagery when George tells Lennie about how they were going to own a ranch and Lennie can raise rabbits. Steinbeck reveals the simle truth about racism, dgradation, and jelousy. People in the book are struggling to overcome an obstacle that holds them back. At their final stop, they meet all types of people, which teach them about diversity and how to deal with it. The story's resolution reveals how humans deal with the sorrow of our society. The outcome may shock us, yet it seems just in it's own irony. I sincerely suggest this book to those looking to explore humanity and to those who would like to know what friendship and loyalty is and if you liked \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" or \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", you will like this book because I, Jamil Faruque a student of Falls Church HS, have read both of these books which shows similarities with \\"Of Mice and Men\\""},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Certainly for a short book of 100 +/- pages \\"Of Mice and Men\\" punches above its weight. The dreams and aspirations of working people, when well told can but full of poignancy and emotionally taut. That's definitely the case here. The language seems authentic. The setting is beautifully set and the dialogue paints as much of a picture as the descriptions that Steinbeck is so skillful and subtle at presenting.The boss's son, Curley is angry, small with a chip on his shoulder and jealousy triggered by a wife with a wandering eye who flirts full of entendres and innuendo with the men on the farm bringing immediate conflict to what seems to be an almost idyllic boarding house for farm workers in 1930's California. Contrasting with \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" here there seems to be fairness between boss and worker and clear rules of behavior, maybe even a code that everyone understands. If you show up for work on Saturday you get fed that night and all day Sunday before starting work Monday. The world appears better 5 to 10 years after Tom Joad and family first arrived in CA in \\"Grapes\\".Big simple Lennie and smart little George look out for each other; travel and working as a team. Other workers see it as strange but respect and admire the bonding and friendship between these two. This is an easy story to like - fully expressed dreams of having your own place, working hard but controlling your destiny and sharing that with your best friend are near universal aspirations and told by Steinbeck it comes out beautifully. However I couldn't escape the lingering thought that different from other Steinbeck books this one felt a bit more dated. Lennie as big, big hearted but violent and feeble minded and George as diminutive smartaleky but warm hearted seemed a bit cliched. As a youngster I saw lots of books and movies with \\"the big lug\\" and his smart sidekick always looking out for each other but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. We don't see big people as less smart or small people as more intelligent. In fact it may be the opposite.Of course it's a great story. I loved the emotional pitch and the powerful ending but I'm left wondering if it has the timelessness of his other classics."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Though a short novel, Of Mice and Men is one that everyone should read. Steinbeck's strong moral viewpoint and incredible prose come together in a terrific novel.The Good: Of Mice and Men is succinct with a strong moral viewpoint. The migrant workers envision a society where they can have their basic needs fulfilled and work their own land. Their needs are simple, yet they cannot be consistently fulfilled because of their position at the very bottom of the social ladder. As with The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck here concerns himself with the well-being of the worst off Americans. While the basic economic and social system seems to be set against the migrant workers, the workers themselves envision a world where they can live together and share the fruits of the earth they till.Steinbeck proves himself once again to be a master of unassuming, delicate language. He describes the Salinas Valley in such concrete, yet haunting words. The characters are so vividly real. Their dialogue is so natural and unassuming. The friendship between George and Lennie becomes so real in the text that the ending it simply heartbreaking. Steinbeck is simply a master crafter of the English language.The Bad: Some people might be put off by the sad ending. I do not consider it a drawback. In fact, it is the only coherent ending the novel could have had.The Bottom Line: Of Mice and Men is a novel that shouldn't be missed.See more of my reviews @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book is short, but man it packs a touching message.

This little gem of stink can be summarized, \\"Isn't it tragic that in this world there are just some people that we need shoot like the old stinky dogs that they are, but thankfully we have good friends who will love us enough to do the murdering.\\"That's profound? There's nothing profound about that. It's silly, misguided and sentimental to be sure. It's also evil. But it's certainly not profound.Now it might be that Steinbeck hates the world and hates George and hates what George does and that M&M; is an anguished cry against an unjust world. However, this secret message is unlikely to be discerned from the text and the average reader will come away thinking, \\"It's jus' too bad that sum folks is better off not bein' born'd.\\" This is clearly the impression the book makes upon most Amazon reviewers. And even if the message of the book were \\"life [is bad]\\" instead of \\"murder the less fortunate\\" it would hardly salvage this vile little creation....It has its share of ham-fisted heart-string pulling and the occasional pastoral description of a shrubbery or a creek, but that's just not enough to make the painful few hours wasted upon its pages worthwhile..."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"During the first chapter of the book.

While reading the book, sometimes it was hard to follow what the character was trying to say. Because, the book was set in the early 1900's, they talked with a myriad amount of slang and was difficult to read. There was also some foul and offensive language.I liked the book because it was very descriptive with its actions. When the author was describing a situation I could picture it down to the last detail. When you can picture what you are reading it makes things more enjoyable. Each character had their own distinct personality that stuck with them throughout the entire book. One thing that I didn't like about the book was the ending. After the biggest event in the book it suddenly came to an end. I wish the author would have went a little further before bringing the book to a halt.This story is full of emotions.

Set during the Depression, Of Mice and Men spans four days and follows the lives of George and Lennie. Lennie is mentally retarded, acts like a child, and is innocent. At the same time, he doesn't know his own strength. He likes to pet mice, but ends up killing them by accident. George travels with Lennie, has always looked out for him, and protects him whenever he gets into trouble. They both share a dream that many people held during the Depression: owning their own farm, and knowing what tomorrow will hold.What is so depressing is the way that the weak are treated in this story. Every man is for himself, and no one cares about anyone else, especially the weak. For instance, Candy's dog was shot because it was old and it stank, even though it was very special to Candy. After the only thing he had was shot, Candy began to think this might happen to him when he gets too old to work, so he took up George and Lennie's dream of owning a farm.This book is very sad because dreams are presented as foolish fantasies that will never happen. George, Lennie, and Candy never do get to have the farm and the rabbits they wanted. Curley's wife, evil and selfish as she is, tempted Lennie into doing yet another bad thing. This lead to Lennie having to escape and being chased down in the end. Lennie thought George was his friend and trusted him so much, but George kills him at the end of the novel and walks off with Slim. Lennie is so nice. He shouldn't have been killed. In this novel, the weak are seen as a nuisance to society who must be exterminated. Of Mice and Men hints that the only was to survive is to be mean and ruthless. The weak should not be looked upon this way. We should try to help them, not get rid of them. Everyone already has enough troubles in his or her life. Why read such a depressing book?"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This masterpeice was written in 1937 by a man named John Steinbeck. He was born in salinas, California 1902 he grew up in a fertile Agricultural valley about twenty five miles from the pacific coast, now to the story this was a rather good book in my opinion it is based on two main characters named lenny and George the story takes place a few miles south of soledad, Where the Salinas river drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green.well you see lennie is a monster of a man who is shapeless of the face and heavy set and is slightly mently undeveloped because when he was a child he was kicked in the head by a horse but he can work, George is a little different he is small and very defined in terms of muscle tone.This story is basicly about two guys one is mentally challenged and the other is not however they stick together and go through a lot of things together and then they also move to different job sites to get more money when thet leave a town called weed they go to another one and there is baiscly the main set of the story where most of there time is spent during there time at this place they are working and lennie is helplessly trying to make friends. then at the end of the story lennie kills george and is very dissapointed at his choices later then the other guys he works with went and bought him a drink for doing it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"What confuses me more than why I was forced to read this book in school was how anyone could call it a masterpiece or a classic for that matter. I'll admit the relationship between Lennie( mentally retarded) and George was sweet. Although as the book so uneventfully progressed, things turned terrible between Lennie accidentally killing Curley's wife and George shooting Lennie. As in both The Pearl and Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck seems to love writing about innocent people getting shot.

First Lennie cause tiny problems, then bigger and finally the biggest trouble. Now what and how should the weak one(George) help or save his best friend?I give the rate of 4 stars to this book. It's a great book for love, friendship and at a loss as what to do. The theme of this book is sometimes friends have to force themselves do something that he/she doesn't want to. I recommend this book to those young children and adults who have been lost as to what to do."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"this book is an excellent between two friends in the heart of the Great Depression in the 30's. George, is a witty guy who takes care of his friend george, a mildly mentally challenged guy who can gets paid extremly well when he gets jobs becayse of his strength and determination. But a downward spiral of events tests the friendship of these two men."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"OF Mice and Men was a very good book, i could read it over and over. I have read the book a few time and it gets better every time. John Steinbeck was very creative to think of the character Lennie, and the troubles he was in. I also watch the movie and it did give the book some justice. It was almost the same way I pictured it while reading. In this book you do see the side of someone who is not very smart at all. I enjoyed this book very much and Will more in likely Pick it up again."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men was about the best book I have ever read. It's a story of George and Lenny, two men that have not much more than each other. It's a captivating book, but not one to read if you like exciting, happily ever after endings. John Steinbeck is not that kind of writer. Everything that happens in the book is foreshadowed, and by the end it has you saying, &quot;Oh, that's why he wrote whate he wrote in the beginning.&quot; It's a great book and a must read for high school students."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book is a really great book. It teaches respect. One of the men in this book his name is Lennie. Lennie is mentally challenged. He isn't all that challenged because he and do a lot of things and remember a lot of things as well. Now he has a friend named George. George helps Lennie throughout the whole book. George is like a bigger brother to Lennie, but he really isn't.George and Lennie go around trying to get jobs hoping one day they can make enough money to own their own farm. They land a job at this one farm. They become friends with the other men who live and work there. Lennie even though he is challenged he is a very big, strong man. He gets in a fight with another man there and he crushes his hand. The way that George helps Lennie in this book I thought was respectful and a good thing.Its not like George treats Lennie bad and is disrespectful to him, he treats him with respect and when I read this book it taught me a lot about other people like Lennie. Now I could tell you what happened at the end f this book, but i'm not going to. If you really liked this review and you're really interested you will just have to read \\" Of Mice and men' by John Stienbeck."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"An excellent piece of classic American literature, painting a very detailed picture of early America and the foot and thumb tradition.Steinbeck's writing are in what I assume his finest form. The incorporation of slang and half-witted conversations adds to the atmosphere of this novel . It essentially is a story of Lenny (a slow giant-like person), and George ( the quick and sharp brains of the two). The bond they share is quite unforgettable as the losses they both take paint a strong image of brotherhood between males."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a great prototype for gritty realism. At the end there are no sunsets or glorious lifting of burdens that leave the protagonists free from worry for all time. However, it isn't an exercise in sorrow either. It is a portrait of a life and of two men trying to make one together. Yet, the one with the brains can only do so much, as the childlike giant is a danger to everyone around him, without meaning to be. This is one of Steinbeck's classics and for good reason. It is short yet it says everything it needs to say, which I think is one of the marks of a great writer: stop writing when the story is finished. This novel is deservedly a classic."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinbeck does an incredible job of using what was happening during the time period to influence his characters. His two characters George and Lennie were complete opposites but they fit together perfectly. This book shows how even the hardest thing to do could be the best choice in life. George is a more serious minded man who just wants to stay on the good side of his boss on whatever job he is doing. Lennie always wants to hear about their future dream life and play with mice. Lennie is big and he doesn't always realize that he can hurt or even kill things. George promised Aunt Clara (the lady who looked over Lennie) that when she died that she could count on him to look out for Lennie. If you need a good book, that is not too long and has a great story and also a lot of good but not complicated symbolism, this is a great pick!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I'm a big fan of Steinbeck to begin with. This book does a superb job of characterization. In my mind the two main characters, George and Lennie have such great personalities and they are complete opposites but for the story line they compliment each other beautifully. This is a piece of literature that really allows the reader to envision the characters and also shows the development of what it was like to live during this time period in America."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is certainly a tragedy, and I would certainly not recommend you read the book if you aren't a place where you can cry openly. Steinberg has written a powerful book that will touch on very sensitive emotions as you follow the character George and Lenny through a short section of their lives together. The relationship between Lenny and George is related to the reader almost entirely through dilouge, allowing the reader to provide much of their own interpretations. Their relationship is the basis of the novel, and is only further developed through the use of other, very animated characters.This is not an action packed adventure, or a steamy romance, or even a suspense filled mystery, but instead a story of a very simply kind of love between very simple characters looking only for a simple existance."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Steinbeck's powerful novel is the saddest story this side of Wharton's &quot;Ethan Frome&quot;. I enjoyed it, however, because sometimes tragedies make for more interesting reading. Plus the Old Man and his dog who is shot, if that scene doesn't stir emotion in you then check your pulse. God bless Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I think this book is excellent because it shows the hardships people had to go through in the great depression.

My ninth grade english class read this book together and I loved it. Steinbeck takes everything into account, even how they spoke and the language they used in the day the book is based in.

They got no gamily. They don't belong to no place they come to a ranch an' work up a stake and then they go inta town and blow their stake, and the first thing you know they're poundin' their tail on some other ranch. They ain't got nothing to look ahead to. With us it ain't like that we got a future. We got somebody to talk to and gives a damn about us. We don't have to sit in no bar room blowin' in our jack jus' because we got no place else to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody gives a damn. But not us.George the guy that is sort of the brains of the stuff that goes on and is a good guy...Lennie isen't the smartest person ever but he is a good worker and a good guy just dosen't know whats going on sometimes.

It applied to society then, now and into the future. Excellent read, excellently written, and the kind of novel I like fiction but thought provoking."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is the story of two men - George and Lennie. George is small and smart, and George is big and mentally challenged. George and Lennie are about to start working on a new farm; they had to leave a previous farm because Lennie got in \\"some trouble\\". Lennie has a preoccupation with things soft and pretty, which lands him in pretty big trouble.This book didn't immediately draw me in from the beginning. I thought the beginning was rather monotonous, but the pace quickly picks up when George and Lennie arrive on the farm. I found that this book is a beautiful portrayal of human compassion. George says that his life would be much better without Lennie, and perhaps it would be, but still you can tell that he cares very much for the gentle giant.George isn't the only example of \\"human compassion\\". You have Carlson who's probably on the extreme uncaring end. He's one of those people who feels that a life isn't valuable anymore once you're of no use. There's also Slim who's very kindhearted. He believes that you can tell if a person is good or not just from their manner of acting. Then, there's Crooks-the cynical stable hand-who likes to believe in the worse of men rather than the best.Also, Steinbeck did a very good job getting his point across using mostly dialogue. There is precious little description in this book, but that's okay because most of the emotion of the story is conveyed through dialogue."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book by john steinbeck was really well written.

I'll tell you this, though, buy this book in the store, they're overcharging for it here. And aside from that, this book *is* wonderful. I had to read the first chapter for school and read the rest on my own. The imagery is vivid and all of the characters, from the least important to the main two, Lennie and George, breathe a life of their own. Another good one by John Steinbeck is 'The Pearl.'"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I have just recently read the book &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; by John Steinbeck and it is one of my all time favorites. John Steinbeck depiction of the farmland of the early 1900's was incrediable. The book is about two guys George and Lennie. George is the brains and Lennie some how screws everything up. Lennie has a good heart and good intentions but he is definatly clumsy. Even though the book is only about 120 pages long, it is so good, it ranks up there with the long books i've read.

He helps Lennie to solve his problems and everything else. In the end everything is just not what i expected.

They are out of luck and out of work migrant workers roaming the highways of California during the 1920s. The depression is the backdrop for the story but that does not prevent Lennie and George from dreaming big. Steinbeck paints a masterful and brilliant portrait of a bygone era that still resonates today. Every time I read this book it reads differently. This is required reading for most high schools. Fifteen years after I originally read I still love it. However, the difference between reading it at 14 and 28 is amazing. Lennie and George are some of the best characters of 20th Century Literature. I highly reccommend picking this one up."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is one of JohnSteinbecks most famous novels and one of his best.The relationship between George and Lennie the two main characters is powerful and thy are memorable . There is foreshadowing that is effectivein several areas.Lennie has trouble with women becausehe has no understanding of them or any subtlenessi n relationships or anything else and a tramp wife who hates her husband means trouble.

As far as Steinbeck, I know that I still despise The Grapes of Wrath, but this is an incredible book. Especially short and easy to read, the writing is simply superb. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is simple and to the point, and the descriptions are detailed. This book deserves it's frequent consideration as a classic. And while I still can't imagine ever liking GOW, I can no longer dismiss Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men has by now attained the status of one of those books that we are \\"supposed to read.\\" I finally got around to reading it this summer (2009). OM&M; is consistently interesting reading. But it did not move me as much as the best books that I have read.The best thing that I can say about OM&M; is that it is a book that you want to read. John Steinbeck's protagonists, George and Lennie, are so vividly drawn that they \\"come to life\\" for the reader. As a result, I found that I cared about both men's fates and I cheered for them to succeed.Steinbeck also does a good job of crafting vivid descriptions of the grubby conditions in which George and Lennie live their lives; readers will find it easy to picture the scenes that Steinbeck describes. OM&M; contains several strong scenes. The scene in which the men debate whether to shoot Candy's dog is powerful and important to Steinbeck's overall message. The opening scene in which George and Lennie walk down the dusty road toward the ranch also contains many memorable images and some good dialogue.In other ways, I thought that OM&M; was lacking. OM&M; is depressingly unsubtle. Steinbeck incessantly hammers away at his themes. For instance, Steinbeck makes the point that Lennie does NOT like to fight so many times that I lost count. Another overworn point is that the men dream of living on land that they own. Steinbeck seems to have worried that his readers were not sufficiently intelligent to draw the conclusions that he wanted them to draw. He attempted to compensate through redundancy.More damagingly, Steinbeck sets up a simplistic universe in which good, strong workers struggle against heartless bosses. Unlike George and Lennie, the people that they work for are sloppily-drawn caricatures. The fact that Steinbeck describes one character only as \\"Curley's wife\\" provides an idea of the slapdash manner in which Steinbeck draws the \\"villains.\\" I don't want to include a spoiler in my review, but I believe that OM&M; would have been more powerful if \\"Curley's wife\\" had been less of a caricature. Had she been even moderately sympathetic, OM&M; would challenge its readers to answer more-difficult questions. Steinbeck's immunity to nuance drains the power and realism from OM&M.;Finally, OM&M;'s last chapter includes a scene in which Lennie has surreal visions. This is a daring tactic. Steinbeck uses it to try to illustrate Lennie's internal struggle. It is only partially successful as it introduces a jarring shift in the perspective Steinbeck uses in the rest of the book. Lennie's visions are interesting, but the manner in which Steinbeck presents the visions makes the reader aware of Steinbeck's overly-heavy hand.OM&M; is a good, quick (118-page) read. But, in my humble opinion, it is no better than good."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"These are the two words I have to describe this book. It's a short work of genius, and it fully immerses you in its world for the all-too-short time that it lasts. With its masterfully crafted characterization and storyline woven so perfectly, it has you tightly wrapped around its proverbial fingers until its heartbreaking conclusion."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This was a very brief but very engaging story wonderfully read by Gary Sinise. It is very touching and I didn't want it to end the way it did but I knew it had to. Great Story."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Classic story of two nomadic laborers who's goal is to own their own farm. The book is set in Depression Era California where Steinbeck grew up. George is the brains while Lennie is the brawn. Each makes up for the other's weaknesses. Steinbeck shows the unselfishness of George as he takes it upon himself to care for Lennie, mainly to keep him out of trouble. Unfortunately, Lennie finds trouble which leads to the death of a young girl. It is at this point George must decide whether to protect Lennie as he always does or cut his losses. Excellent story, a well written classic."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is a wonderful, beautifully written story of two loyal, polar opposite friends. Lennie a tall, strong, slow, gentle giant, is looked after by his friend George, a short, clever little man. They make their way together all over the country searching for jobs and trying to achieve their dream of owning their own piece of land. Lennie does some \\"bad things\\" and keeps losing both of them their jobs. George sticks by Lennie and looks after him nonetheless. They finally end up at a ranch where they meet some interesting characters. There is the taunting, head-strong Curley, his harlequin wife, the tall authoritative Slim, the lonely Crooks, and the tired out Candy, all excellently portrayed by Steinbeck. The power of friendship, the woes and dreams of all men, and the outside forces that combat with all of us are present in this epic novel. Beautifully written with a surprising yet appropriate ending, a must read for all."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In the land of opportunity, everyone strives to achieve the ultimate goal: to live the American dream. Of Mice and Men's protagonists George Milton and Lennie Small are no different. John Steinbeck gives his readers the reality of the road to the American dream.George and Lennie dream of owning their own farm and being their own bosses, but they need to work for the money to buy land first. While working on a ranch, they encounter troubles with the boss' son, Curley, a hot-headed and aggressive man. These troubles climax with Lennie's accident and merciful end.One of the greatest elements of Steinbeck's novel is his character Lennie Small. Slightly mentally disabled, Lennie is a large but kind-hearted man with the mannerisms of a child. His unshakable, child-like faith in one day owning a farm is the drive of his and George's hard-work. Personally, he is one of the only characters who can provoke emotion from the reader, whether it is pity from Lennie being scolded by George and bullied by Curley, or utter sorrow from the final events of the novel.Steinbeck accomplishes to tell the \\"other story\\" of pursuing the American dream. Unlike many stories where there are happy endings, Of Mice and Men incorporates some harsh realities of making it big in the land of opportunity. The obstacles that George and Lennie face on the ranch and the heartbreaking ending definitely illustrate such realities.Despite the novel's ending, Of Mice and Men is a great book to read. I would personally recommend readers of high school age or above to read this great tale of two men and their struggles to success."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Everything from Lonnie's mental disability to the punishing of Candy for his age made me feel anger, pain, and resentment towards people with such prejudice. If you have ever wanted to know what a true friend was like you have to read this book. The friendship between these two men are unbelievable. Steinbeck is one of my favorite author's because of this particular book. This book shows how Steinbeck has a steadfast refusal to allow &quot;celebrity&quot; become a roadblock to his only real ambition, to be a writer. With the emotions and realism in this book i would say Steinbeck has really accomplished his dream of being a successful writer."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"i like the book alot. John steinback is a good author. the best part of the book was when percy got his hand broke by lennie. George did the right thing at the end by doing what he did. I liked lennie the best of all. How he always had a knack for doing accidents. I never liked percy's wife. The way she always acted like a tramp around the workers on the ranch. Percy wasnt my favorite either. he was always trying to get into fights with people bigger than him. i look forward to reading more of his books. He is a really good author and has very interesting books."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book Of mice and men was a really geat book, i read it befor in eighth grade but it meant more and i could understadn it better.

Steinbeck to me had to hve a creative imagination to write such a great creative book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I loved the book! I had to read it for english and it was an in class assignment so we read thru it together. The 2 main characters, George and Lennie, go from town to town looking for work. most people think that it's weird that 2 men would travel together(not that way). Everyone thinks that George is taking Lennie's pay check and using to go to town and use it for the whorehouse. It had vivid descriptions and pictures that I had acutally thought I had lived and worked with them. It does have some foul language, but if you focus on the language then you will not be able to read thru it and feel the emotion. Also if a 12 year old could read it then most likely anyone could. The book covers the following topics: life in the early century (30's), racial prejudice, prostitution, and the all american dream. There's also a tear-jerking ending so be forewarned. Overall, (obviously) I loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Set in agricultural California during the Depression, this book describes the harsh reality of the life of migrant workers and the brutality of human nature in general. Two wandering ranch hands keep the gleam of hope alive, as they privately dream of someday owning a small ranch, where they can be their own boss and live off the fat of the land. Freedom and roots--is that too much to ask of life? But Steinbeck readers will not be surprised at his pessimistic view of the human condition.George and Lennie travel everywhere together, working and sharing the visicitudes of 1930's migrant life--lucky to have a meager supper of canned beans without ketchup. But these two men, who are not even related, are bound as deeply as brothers. George, the short guy with the brains, feels responsible for his big, simple-minded companion, who depends on him for work, food and dreams of a better future. Lennie is a gentle retarded man, who panics easily--not realizing his own tremendous physical strength.This story is more than a mere '30s novella, for it pits the private vulnerability of human nature against pitiless fate. The story, 75% dialogue with only 25% narrative, reads easily, flowing along like the indifferent Salinas River, which inexorably carries its characters to a tragic denoument. Man Aspires but Flawed Society Destroys. A dark Classic."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I think this book was very short and sweet.

I only gave it 3 stars because I didn't finish the book with a strong feeling about it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" was written bye John Steinbeck and is a fictional book. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a book about two life long friends named George and Lennie. They go to a farm to do some farm work after having to run away from their old town Weed. Lennie is a big guy who is retarded and likes to pet soft things like mice. George is a short guy who is very smart and has stuck with Lennie for a while. In their new farm, they meet many people including Curley, a little boxer guy who hates big guys like Lennie, and Curley's wife, who is attractive to the other guys. Lennie and George have many grand adventures on the farm. I would rate this book a 4 because it was pretty fun to read, it was well written and it had a good plot but sometimes it got a little bit boring to read and hard to understand but for the most part it was good."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. It was almost as though I could relate to the events of the story even though I had never experienced anything like it in my life. John Steinbeck did an excellent job in grasping the elements that went along with this time as well as telling the story. Once I arrived at the middle of the book I just could not put it down. Yet at one point I really wanted to due to content but still I couldn't. This book is definitely in the top five best books I have ever read. In my opinion the way Lennie was described and acted in the book was how someone like him actually would in real life. This book was compelling and showed how in some relationships you have to do things for the better even though you know in a way it is not the best thing. It is a great book for young adults because although it is fairly deep and deals with some hard times you really learn something about life and when you are done it really gets you thinking. This was an awesome book and when I look at what it has achieved it is no surprise to me why! I really like how Steinbeck focused on one portion of these men's lives instead of their whole lives. In a way the book almost skips to the &quot;good part&quot;. I enjoy reading when it is interesting and in a way to the point which was what this book was and my own personal preference. This book also shows how much times have changed since when it was written and it shows younger people of what used to be and mabye even what some of their grandparents might have lived through. This was an overall spetacular book with excellent clarity. I would reccommend it to anyone especially young adults. It provides insight most people would otherwise not have!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was super duper, the thing I liked the most was that Lenny was the big tall strong man, but he wasn't all the way there in his brain. George the short and not strong man was controlling Lenny. Lenny isn't gentle, he seems to like to pet soft things.When Lenny killed Curley\`s wife he didn't know what to do so he ran away. Then the group of men was following him until George found him and he said \\"imagines up there on that hill and imagine how our house will look like, then George puts the gun next to Lenny\`s head and killed him. George did that because he didn't want him to go through the misery of being killed by Curley.

One of the few books that I would like to read again. Simply put, this is the story of a TRUE friendship between two men, one of whom is mentally challenged. Read it!!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This piece is ultimate Steinbeck. The author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones. The book is short, however, the tale is told thoroughly. The reader feels so very sorry for George. George is a study of loyalty, decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human being-in this case his childhood friend, Lennie, who is somewhat mentally challenged. This book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the end-even if he needs to commit murder to show it. The character, Candy, is so very pathetic too and his comments about \\" a stranger killing my old dog\\" are so very sad! One tends to think that it was because of Candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that George does what he does. This is a beautiful book!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I never thought of Salinas California being so interesting but the author John Steinbeck made it seem like a place I would to go visit.In the book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" they describe the setting as a ranch in Salinas Valley that George and Lennie worked on.The time period that the story takes place is during \\"The Great Depression\\" which impacts the story and makes it very different such as in the way they talk and things they do.There were two main characters in the book.One was George,he was a normal size man,strong and smart.The other was Lennie,he was big,tall and muscular but he was retarded. So George was like the caretaker of Lennie because he did'nt know any better.Mainly this book is about two hobo,s who are trying to fufill their dream fo live of the \\"fatta the land\\" (Steinbeck pg.14).I would recommend this story to eighth grade and above because it is kind of a challenge to understand but it's a very good book.I like this book because it is very different from many books that i have read.But one thing about this book that i like is that it's very unique."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In the book Of Mice and Men written by John Steinbeck was an amazing story about two men over coming they're struggles to try to live they're dream. John Steinbeck does such a wonderful job of describing the setting that you feel like you're on that same ranch in Salinas California during The Great Depression. The two men Lennie and Gorge are very different. George is small but very smart and quick while Lennie is huge very slow and dose not even know his own strength.The reason there are struggles is because every time they work Lennie always gets them in trouble in fact the reason they come to the ranch because they where run out of Weed. When Lennie and George get to the ranch they met the boss, Slim, Candy, Curly, and Crooks. Now Curly hates big people and has a wife that always is looking for him and the other half the time he's looking for her. Slim is like a hero of the ranch he is like the leader of the group. Crooks and Candy are two people you would have to feel sorry for. Crooks is the black stable buck that every time the boss is mad he takes it out on Crooks. Candy has an old dog that smells horrible and ends up killing him.This book is very good and I would only recommend this book to mature teenagers and up. The reason is because of the use of cussing and the N word. A great book no matter the slurs."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck takes place in Salinas, California. On a large ranch. T his story takes place during the Great Depression. When many men and women became hoboes.The two main characters are George Milton and Lennie Small, who are hoboes because bums beg and hoboes work. Lennie is mentally retarded and does not know his own strength, he loves rabbits. He forgets quickly and is big and tall. He is a very good worker, also a nice person, and will do anything George say's. George is in charge, he protects and looks out for Lennie he is short with sharp features, and is very serious.I think this book is mostly about the companionship between George and Lennie, because even though George doesn't act like he cares about Lennie he actually does. George does not want anyone to hurt Lennie, mainly because most people don't understand him. Lennie's best friend is George because they travel together and always look out for each other. Lennie doesn't like to start trouble, but unlike the incident with Curley he doesn't know how strong he is. Most people won't mess wont George because him and Lennie are so close.George and Lennie always wanted to \\"Live offa the fatta the lan\\" Steinbeck pg.57. Which I think means to be able to do what they want without anyone telling them what do. They could be free and not worry about what anyone else says because it's their land and they can do what they want to. George and Lennie have dreams to one day get a farm and be away from everyone. All they want to do is live there because the feel they belong there.I recommend this book to anyone who loves books about love and companionship between two entirely different men. This book would be more for young adults because there is some racial comments and profanity used in this book. George and Lennie make you be able to image two guys' opposites of each being so close they are like blood. This book is full of imagery that anyone could picture; the author loves to explain with great detail. At the end of the book you are so hooked on it you just don't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"When two hobos Lennie and George set off to a new town in Salinas, California with hopes of fulfilling their dream of owning their own farm, things don't go as easy as planned. The two get a job on a farm and go though many obstacles; the main one Curly's wife. That's how all the action begins. Author John Steinbeck pulls you deep inside this story taking place during The Great Depression, and keeps you laughing by the realistic dialogue of all the characters, in the novel \\"Of Mice and Men.\\"Lennie and George get into trouble often by Lennie's uncontrollable strength. He doesn't seem to realize when he's hurting something or someone because of his slow mentality. George is his care taker and watches over him like a father. Even though he would like to be alone he feels like he has no choice but to be with Lennie. Sometimes George gets annoyed by how Lennie says \\"An' rabbits, George.\\" (Steinbeck, page 57) whenever he talks about the farm that they're going to have.This book is so exciting and enjoyable that it makes you want to jump ahead to the end. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel like they're on a adventure and who doesn't mind strong language."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and MenBy: John SteinbeckReview by: Hunter T, student at MLMSI may not have been living in the Great Depression, but novelist John Steinbeck made me feel like I had been there from the beginning to the end. George and Lennie (the main characters) was the oddest bunch of friends. George a thin, stalky man took care of Lennie. Lennie a giant, strong man was mentally retarded and didn't even know his own strength.When we find our characters, Lennie and George, they are sitting on the banks of the Salinas River. There are trees, willows fresh and green, and limbs arching over the river. Leaves scattered underneath the trees. A couple of rabbits come out of the brush to sit on the sand. It was a cool autumn day in 1930. The Great Depression knocked George and Lennie off track. They must travel now from town to town. Finding new jobs, because Lennie keeps getting in trouble.The main idea the author is trying to convey is love. Even though these two friends are the oddest couple, they are the best friends ever. George gets mad at Lennie all the time, we know George needs Lennie and Lennie needs George. The ending was sad but we know that it was out of love.My all time favorite quote from Lennie would be, \\"I didn't mean no harm George, honest.\\" Lennie is always getting in trouble, so just hearing him say that makes the story all the better. I will never forget,\\" Rabbits, George, Rabbits.\\" Lennie was my all time favorite character, for his loveable and gentle ways.My recommendation would be, to only read this book if you are a mature eighth grader and above. This book is strong with profanity, so if you are okay with that go ahead and read the book. I guarantee you will love George and Lennie; if you don't then don't read another John Steinbeck book again. I recommend listening to it on tape and hearing Gary Sinise's voices. You will laugh at them all. PLEASE READ THE BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In the book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck two older men, Lennie and George, living as a hobo during the Great Depression in the 1930's struggling in life and trying to find a job. Lennie and George are running away from their old town of Weed because a woman charged Lennie with rape. Lennie is a little bit retarded and likes to touch soft things. George is Lennie's Aunt Clara died so now he's the responsible guardian.There are two main settings in this great novel. First, in the brush where they stay one night. There were many trees and bushes. There was also a pond where the two of them drank from. This was important because if Lennie ever got in trouble George told him to come to this place. The other setting was the ranch where they got their money. The people on the ranch were the boss, Curly, Carlson, Curly's wife, Candy, Slim and Crooks. The two of them bucked barley and there was Crooks house, the bunk house, the main house.George and Lennie are hobo's so they travel together. George always tells Lennie that they're going"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Even though I was never in the Great Depression, the book Of Mice and Men made me feel like I was in that time setting. John Steinbeck describes the details of main characters, Lennie and George, so well. The two characters are on the run in Salinas, California because of Lennie's uncontrollable strength. They are on their way to a ranch where they will work. They are saving money to fullfil their dream of someday owning their own land.Lennie is the big, retarded hobo. He is always forgetting information. He tries not to but he does. \\"I tried not to forget George, honest to God I did, George,\\" (Steinbeck, page 4). He is very strong and likes soft things. This combination will land him in trouble throughout the book.George is a hobo that takes care of Lennie. He is a short and mean sometimes. He really cares about Lennie. He will go out of his way for him but his love for Lennie will not change the fact that Lennie is retarded. This places him in an unwanted situation.They run to the ranch of the boss, in which his son, Curly, suffers from little man syndrome. He tries to make up for it by acting big and strong. Curley is married to the only woman on the ranch. She gives almost every man 'the eye'. She craves attention.I really recommend this book to teenagers or young adults. It uses strong dialect that a child won't understand unless read to by an adult or audio tape (The audio tape is mostly recommended). If you decide to read this book, make sure you have a spare hour or so because when you first open it up, you will not put it down until you are done. And even then you won't want it to finish! I really hope you enjoy this book like I did."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book has long been known as a classic, a masterpiece. The same can be said of Gary Sinese's reading. It makes the book and the characters come alive, as if they are with you, in the room or in the car. An absolute masterpiece, both in writing and in the reading."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\", written by John Steinbeck is an intriguing book which leads readers through a vast variety of emotions. The story includes two main characters, George and Lennie. George is a very small man with defined features whereas Lenny is the exact opposite. He is huge, almost colossal in fact and is mentally retarded. Because of this, George has to care for Lennie and put forth a lot of extra effort. However, he does not mind doing so because Lennie provides the kind of friendly companionship he desires. The differences between the two characters only serve to bond them closer together. Despite this, they also have one prominent commonality: they both share the dream of eventually acquiring a piece of land to farm and raising rabbits on it, the rabbits being mainly Lennie's idea. Lennie has an obsession with petting soft things which ends up just causing trouble for the two. For example, they were kicked out of their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman's dress and was accused of rape.The book is based at a ranch in California were the two managed to get a job while lying that they were cousins. While there, they slowly plot to achieve their goal of starting their own farm and join a fellow worker who they plan to achieve this with. What happens at the end WILL shock you but is a very satisfying conclusion to the story.Overall, it was an awesome book. Although these kind of stories are not usually my style, I found myself deeply caught up in every page. I strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a good book and an easy read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This tightly crafted story's surface level of life for Depression-era farm hands in Caifornia kept my interest even though that's not the sort of thing I'm usually drawn to.This book showed me a dimension to humanity I had never before been able to articulate: The paradoxal, divine, yet fungamenta nature of friendship.Steinbeck's gritty characters and setting are the perfect vehicle for a message that only sounds intellectual until you feel it. There is no fanfare, no flourish of trumpets, no pomp and circumstance, no canned philosophy -- just raw emotional truth.Some stories hold the mind's attention; this one touched my soul and made me simultaneously both proud and ashamed to be human. We are capable of ugliness but also such loving sacrifice. For a little book, it packs quite a punch.I am breathless. Give this book an afternoon and you will be too."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is an absolutely stirring, poignant, and tragic portrait of human nature, a book of harsh reality. As a book of only 107 pages, many find it hard to believe that such a short book can have such impact on the reader, in dealing with such a complex subject. This is great testament to the author, John Steinbeck, and his short, sweet, and to-the-point writing style, letting the characters provide the complexity (there is a LOT of dialogue) through their interaction. Ranch laborers Lennie and George both seek a real, yet delusional dream, that they want to believe is tangible, but the reality is very different, as others have dreamt it before them, while they at the same time have done absolutely nothing towards the dream's realization. It is all just an illusion, by those who seek to transcend their current situation in life, just keeping the dream with them, for whenever they need it, for their personal reassurance that one day, things will change. It is worth reading for the last 8 pages alone, for its stirring, disturbing, and tragically humanistic climax. Definitely one of the best fictions I've ever read. Highly recommended, unless you're one of those who got the book banned from several school libraries in 1993 and 1994 for \\"promoting euthanasia\\"................................."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Matea G.Of Mice and Men is a great story to read. Having two different people like Lennie and George come together and do all the things they do is something everyone should learn about. Lennie is mentally retarded and looks to George for everything he does. He forgets everything, but if George tells him anything or does anything then he will remember it. George was the only person who he talked with, and was Lennie's hero.This book is about these two different men who travel together and look for laboring jobs. Lennie has a hard time though and always seems to get in trouble, so they always have to leave and find another place to work at. Once they find a place in Soledad working on a ranch things began to change. As they meet many knew people there their relationship begins to change. Both are welcomed but George seems to get along well with all of them as the others begin to wonder about Lennie and his intentions. Soon Lennie gets in more trouble then he has before and with a surprising twist at the end you come to realize how true their friendship was.I thought the book was very good. I couldn't really relate to any of the characters but just seeing how there lives were was very interesting and how they did things. I thought it was amazing how George stuck with Lennie for so long even with all the trouble he makes. In all i thought it was good book to read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The plot of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is two men, one having a mind of a child, trying to make a life. Things turn out for the worst and troubles start. Their lives change forever. I liked the two main characters, George and Lennie, who are very different in many ways, but are like brothers. My favorite character is Candy because he's nice and cares about all the others. I wasn't very fond of Curly because he has a bad attitude and doesn't care about the world. The main idea of the book is that the story tells us that what comes around goes around. It lets us know not to judge others because they're different. The main conflict is trying to keep Lennie from hurting anybody and trying to teach him the difference between right and wrong. I really liked this book because it dealt with drama and it had suspense in it. It was very interesting and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"At only 107 pages \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a short but to the point book. The story goes though the feelings about the ups and downs of relationships and how far they will go until someone breaks. Lennie and George are the main characters. Lennie is mentally Challenged, and really big and strong. George really wants to pursue \\"The American Dream\\" also he is kind of tells Lennie what to do, to keep out of trouble. I like George a lot; he is the smarter of the bunch. But I do not like Lennie at all; he does things that I don't really agree with. The story has much detail but yet is short enough to be a novel. The characters are not the smartest of all people. The book is okay in my opinion, not one of my favorites because I didn't feel it had a good pull on you, but the ending is what saved it, it has a totally unexpected twist of an ending.brandon_m"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"All together the plot of this...interseting tale of two men(one slower than most) was alright. But there was a reocuring item,Lenny always getting into trouble with women but i guess this was an interesting and dependent part of the plot. The main focus of the book was how this very exploratory man with below average intelligence,Lenny, is being basically cared for and looked out for by his friend,George,who is just tryin to make money so someday he can have his farm with his dumb but sometimes helpfull friend. I myself thought the book as alright but not the best. The whole book is actually not very long and does not tell a whole lot about their past."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"as with most of steinbeck's work, 'of mice and men' poses a series of moral dilemmas and takes a serious look at both the positive and negatives nuances of relationships; but more than anything, the novella (steinbeck's first major work) explores man's inability to escape his situation and surroundings. escape, maybe more than any other theme, runs through the book.lennie and george are well-documented characters, so there's no need to delve into their respective personalities. what struck about 'of mice and men' is steinbeck's assertion that human beings in precarious situations, whether of their own making or as the result of others, are trapped. whether or not the reader buys into this theory is, of course, up to the reader. however, throughout the novel steinbeck introduces the reader to characters stuck in their situations. lennie desires freedom but is stuck with george (notice how many times lennie offers to leave george), george wants to be rich, but it stuck with lennie (granted, george chooses to remain stuck with lennie); curley's wife wants to be a movie star, but is stuck at the ranch with a miserably, miserly husband. the majority of the major characters, at one point or another, all express sincere desires to escape their current situation--all of which lead the novel's shocking ending.without giving too much away, there are really on two possible interpretations to george's actions in the final pages. either we view george as a savior or a muderer (i guess i just gave it away). either george is justified in his actions, or he is not. again, this depends on each reader's own individual interpretation of the text. steinbeck makes no effort to villify or diefy george--he simply tells what happened. was george justified? did he do lenny a favor or was he acting out of his own selfish motivations? it's a great topic for debate and thought.'of mice and men' was steinbeck's first major work and in a way established him as a master of the moral dilemma. this novel, just as his others, leaves you thinking days, weeks, months and years after you finish reading.

George is a man of low tolerance, and is traveling with the slow, but warm-hearted, Lenny. I think the book was a well written story of how you can't take advantage of anyone, especially if they don't know that you are doing it. Also, that you can't be too hard on a person who doesn't understand, because then they never will. I think it was a good book because it provided many lessons that included those ones. John Steinbeck introduced, and protrayed the characters in a manner that was very intriguing and realistic. The way he showed Lenny to not be prejudice against Crooks because he didn't see the difference in them privded a good connection with how real people should act. All around Of Mice and Men was a very good book and I would recommend it because it can change the way you think about certain people."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"My name is Priscilla Limon and i was assigned to read John Steinbecks novel OF MICE AND MEN.

Curleys wife goes into the barn with Lennie, and then he starts to feel Curleys hair, she starts to scream and then he breaks her neck. George finds out that he did it and tells him to run away.

For example, if you are an Indian immigrant, coming from a fairy tale land of Buddha and Gandhi and you find it hard to understand predatory nature of American corporate culture, this is a novel that will give you a glimpse of \\"American way of life.\\". I think one should read these books before one starts to dream about migrating to America. Otherwise the reality shock that one gets after living and working in a private corporation in the USA will be not only surprising but also painful.Steinback has tried to condense as much possible in as few pages as possible and it has kind of dramatized the story too much. But I agree with Steinback in his depiction of the American way of life. The strong trying to prey on the weak. This is what has always happened in America from day one. From Native Americans that were the first victim of white lust to the today's common man in America who is nothing but a unit of production in the capitalistic system, it is always the weak that have been used by the strong. The masks have changed, but exploiter and exploited always continue to exist and the American dream is for the exploited to think that one day he will be the exploiter."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Book came on time and was in great condition.
