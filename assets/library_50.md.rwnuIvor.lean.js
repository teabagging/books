So relevant across all times, to all sorts of people. Francie is an amazing character that anyone can relate to"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's a pleasure to review this book on the centennary of its story-time (the book begins in 1912). Yes, this is a coming-of-age story, but it is also a portrait of urban poverty that speaks directly to the present. Tales of kids collecting the lead from liquor bottlenecks and cigarette-pack foil to redeem along with the family rags at the junk man's--an extra penny for a pinch, for girls who can stand it--sheds light on the way we live now, and on what might yet lie ahead for us, as people once again start salvaging fat from restaurants (now to run their cars, rather than to make soap, as back then).The characters are surprisingly bold. The emotions of sexual desire, exploitation, pleasure, pain, and trust are explicitly portrayed, without prurience, and it is refreshing, compared to the present, that the urges are shown to stem from the desire to procreate and also to be thwarted by their own success! There is no prettying up of either women or men, children or aged, and the 'deadbeat' father referred to in other reviews is a man of talent and longing as well as weakness.If it weren't for his complexity, and the main character's loyal brother, the male sex might seem the weaker in this book, but Betty Smith was bigger than that. And if, as she herself said, sometimes what happens in this book is what should have happened, not what did happen, her realism and grit are more than sufficient to carry the day.I can only imagine how much fun it must be for New Yorkers, let alone Brooklynites, to read this; but for all of us this is a book that zooms on the most fundamental plot: how people manage to live."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I only first heard of this story years and years ago because of the movie and I've seen it several times.

She lives in a poor neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY at the turn of the last century. Her mother has to work as a janitor to make up for the money her kindly but alcoholic father drinks away. Francie herself collects junk to sell to the junk man just to help buy food. Despite the obstacles Francie faces, she is fiercely determined to break her family's cycle of poverty and ignorance. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn chronicles her life as she grows from a child into a young woman, learning about family, dreams, love--and herself.Betty Smith's largely autobiographical novel doesn't sugar-coat the hardships of urban poverty in early-twentieth-century New York. The reader sees how want and ignorance can dehumanize anyone. Smith's narrative follows first Mrs. Nolan and then Francie as they make mistakes--and leaves the reader with room to learn from the characters' mistakes with them. As Francie and the Nolans slowly lift themselves out of poverty, they never forget to be grateful for what they have and most especially for each other."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In all these years of reading, no one ever mentioned this book, no one suggested it and I had never seen it on a list until last month.

Her brother Neeley is two years younger and together they weathered the storms of poverty. The story is told with kindness and simplicity. I loved it. the triumph of the American family.

Check it out...you might be surprised!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book! I suggest it for anyone who knows how Brooklyn was at that time.Because both my parents and also two of my grandparents were New York city kids. I am only a 13 year old girl but I have an adult reading level. I think this book had an incredible plot and some of the most wonderfull charecters ever written about. Learning of Francie's life, her thoughts and her pain was incredibly interesting."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was a very touching, and thrilling book. It made you feel everything that Francie felt, made you think like her. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm not one to gush, but I consider this one of the finest books ever written. I've read a decent percentage of the &quot;great books&quot; and &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; deserves to be on the list.It can be read and enjoyed by young people, but so can &quot;Huckleberry Finn.&quot; Like &quot;Huck Finn,&quot; this book is even more rewarding to the adult reader.I read it for the first time at age 47 and was blown away. The characters, even the minor ones, truly leap out from the page, they're so real. The writing is seemingly effortless (which we all know is the hardest thing to do!); nearly every word is perfect. The insights into human relations and human pscyhology are startling and profound.The book is also incredibly modern. Published in 1943, describing life in the 1910's, yet, like any true classic, the dilemmas are timeless and the author's viewpoint, especially about women, speaks to us powerfully even today.Among its many strengths, &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is a completely truthful portrait of the effect of alcoholism on a family. It also tells us about how poverty really affects people and about the immigrant experience.I can't speak to how men will respond to this book, but I believe that any woman of any age will be thrilled by it.Don't miss it. And if you read it as a teenager, read it again and rediscover one of the greatest books of 20th century American literature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the best book I've ever read!!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is superbly realistic and worth reading over and over again!

Its portrayal of coming of age is both easy to relate to and very interesting. It was beautifully written, and was never boring. It gives you first hand, seemingly accurate knowledge of life in poverty at that time. The time during which the story takes place is made real through the effect of the different events and ideas (such as advertisement, the union, the urban machine, and WWI) on the characters. The book explores and analyzes each character's life, so that everyone seems like an old friend by the end of the book. Through these characters you experience joy, pain, hunger and sorrow as if it were your own. While it was lengthy (430 pages), it was not very complicated, so it remained enjoyable throughout."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As someone who likes literature I must say this book is one of the most enjoyable book I've evr read.

After a huge tragedey strikes the Nolan family, Frances understands a little more about the special signifagance of the tree that grew in Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is about a girl, named Francie Nolan growing up in the Brooklyn slums in the early 1900's. Her family, which consists of her younger brother Neeley, her father Johnny, and her mother Katie, struggles to make ends meat.

The Nolan's are faced with many problems and hardships, but they are strong and always manage to get through them. Life starts to look up for the Nolan's just as they thought all of their dreams would never come true. This is an easy book to get into because it is very discriptive.

Buy it!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I tell people who have already read this book (especially women) that it is my absolute favorite, I typically get a look an/or a comment somewhere along the lines of, \\"How can a book about a 13 year-old girl's coming of age in Brooklyn be your favorite?\\" Maybe I can't relate period-wise, geographically, or sexually (male/female), but there was a strong emotional connection that formed between myself and Francie the first time I read the book that I will never forget. I've always loved libraries and reading and now that I am a librarian, I rarely walk into any library without thinking of Francie's interactions with the librarian and her goal of reading all of the books from A-Z. This is a wonderful book for all--women, children, AND men."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I could NOT put this book down!I have read it three times in total and plan to read it again. Betty Smith writes of the coming of age of one young girl in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. Smith does well in characterizing Brooklyn and its inhabitants, from the &quot;fast&quot; but warmhearted woman to the lonely army boy.Smith accurately portrays the hopes and fears as well as the crushed dreams and ambitions of one young girl looking for happiness in a world full of nostaligia.A time that is past comes alive with glitter and grit in Smith's words."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am a student of Betty Smith's and have read all the reviews on this site. Many of you loved this book and described it as a classic. Unfortunately, as great as it is, it is not considered a classic academically. It is not canonized, it is not often read in high school and college classes. Do a web search on Betty Smith and her name will rarely link with any websites. That is where you come in. If you truly love her works, spread the news. This author, who wrote 4 novels and over 70 plays, is quickly becoming forgotten. It is time for a revival."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I got this book off a reading list and put it on my own for the summer. This book is amazing. You feel as if you are a child in New York. Smith describes so well the life of a poor family scraping by in turn of the century Brooklyn. How much things were changing and things needed to get by in the world, not as much as we would like to think.I so enjoyed reading about Frnacie's life, I didn't want the book to end, and that generally means a good story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is so wonderful. THe author describes the life of the Nolans so well, you feel as if you are actually there, experiencing the things she describes. You are happy for Francie during the good times, sad during the bad. This book will make you laugh, cry, and really help you to get your priorities straight. It is a classic, and should be in every home in the country. By not reading it, you are depriving yourself of an amazing experience. It is great reading for teenagers as well as adults, although the readers should be mature enough to truly grasp the story's meaning. I know some 13-year-olds who get more out of this story than some 30-year-olds. Like I said, it all depends on maturity. To wrap this up, I believe that this is an amazing book, and everyone should read it at least once at some point in their lives."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"even though i'm 12, i've found this book to be amazing. it first appealed to me at a family friends's house at the age of nine. i find it hard to believe that a book can be read at least 10 times. now, my class is reading it and we all love it. we analyze every single chapter to the point, and i absolutely love this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Having just moved to Brooklyn my mother thought that I should read this book. The book arrived two days after my arrival, so after a long day of dish boxes I sat down and began to read. Several days later with few boxes unpacked I finsihed the book and loved every word. The adventure is amazing. This book is well written and has reason for being such a classic. The forward is terrific. This is a book for every shelf and should be cherished and shared.Read it soon."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There's a lot to be said about B.Smith's &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, but I will simply say this. There's nothing else like it anywhere. Without knowing it and - almost as instantaneous, you're thrown into this world (some can relate if they're from brooklyn and recognize the areas spoken of in the book) and you just can help falling in love ..utter love, with every character!! Mark my words: you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be humbled by the story and inspired by Francie's and Katie's passion, your heart will go out to Johnny Nolan it's just so intense so deep so AMAZING!! Please, read this book - soak it in and love it forever, because this book will treat you well...this book is a dear friend to anyone who needs a little friendship. GET THIS BOOK AND READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I think I finally understand my younger sister who is in her forties today. She read this book when she was the age of eight or nine and living in New York City. I recall her talking about how wonderful the book was and how much she enjoyed Francie and aunt Sizzy. Like Francie (including myself), she grew up in similar circumstances except there were six siblings and mother. Dad was too irresponsible to fit any of the characters, except perhaps the disgruntled Willie Flittman, who runs off with his new found vocation; a single man orchestra (substitute women). Anyhow, she grew into Sizzy more than Francie although there was a lot of Francie in her as a young girl. I certainly went off in search of the American dream. My sister did not, although Francie still lives in her particularly in her search for beauty, love, and insatiable love for books. She too wanted to read all of the books in the local library.The book speaks mounds of truth about poverty and the struggle faced by urban poor. Ms. B. Smith treats the subject and the characters with great tenderness and honesty. Although the pathos and ethos of the urban poor may not have been of great interest or even palatable to readers at the time of the book's publication, the great human paradigm and its redeeming values is timeless and relevant. Reading A Grows in Brooklyn and having lived in Brooklyn Heights as well as experienced a similar childhhod is especially welcoming. To reflect on those difficult childhood times is important as it helps keep me grounded. I would not deny or exchange that experience for anything in the world.The book is a must read for all lovers of literature regarless of age, gender, or socioeconomic circumstances."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Iv read this book soo many times and recomended it to alot of people! so poerful. would love to read her next book that is apparntly the sequal.

Would recommend it to other people."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a coming of age story and I know that is such a cliche - especially for a debut novel. But this coming of age story is one set in a world that I had never read about before. How is that possible, you ask? It's set in Brooklyn, right? Every story about Brooklyn or NYC has already been told, millions of times. But I'm telling you, this one is different. The main reason it's different is because this Brooklyn story is told through the eyes of young Francie Nolan, one of the most glorious characters ever created in literature. Truly, she's almost indescribable. She's smart without being precocious, at times sad but never maudlin, and traversing the world of Brooklyn at the turn of the 20th Century with her is one of the greatest reading experiences I've ever had. I will love her forever.This book is about family and community and love and education and poverty and strength and mistakes and triumphs and growing up. It is filled with the most amazing characters and paints a picture of America that is utterly new to me and leaves me believing there IS magic in America, magic in the neighborhoods we call home, magic in our childhood memories . It will make you laugh and cry (I cried three times, a record for me, while reading a book) and as soon as it is over you will vow to return as soon as you can.So if you've been putting it off, or if you've never heard of this book before, or if you haven't read it in years, do yourself a favor and read it now. And then reread it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book first at 11 years old. It has been one of my favorite books ever since. The writing and the story are so clear it takes my breath away. You should definitely read this if you haven't already."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was an unexpected discovery: I had seen something about this American teenage classic, but had no idea what it was about. It sounded rosy and childish, but turned out to be an excellent novel on the life -from age 11 to 16- of Francie Nolan, a girl who lives in Brooklyn. The Nolans are very poor. The father, Johny, is a handsome guy, but he suffers from a horrible alcoholism that only leaves him time to find sporadic work as waiter and singer. Katie, the mother, is a young, admirable hard-working woman, who has had a tough life and who finds work as housekeeper in order to sustain her children. Francie has a younger brother, Neely, with whom she generally is in good terms. The portrait includes uncles, aunts, and grandparents, depicting their lives and misadventures. It is a grand realistic fresco of life in Brooklyn during the first decades of the XXth Century, a poor Brooklyn populated by Irish, German, Italian and Jewish people.But the main, and most interesting, focus is on Francie's inner world. She's an absolutely lovable character, an admirable, brave girl, self-assured and reflective. Francie enjoys going to the library to borrow books which she later reads in the peace of the fire ladder outside their tiny apartment. Although she is kind of a loner, this is compensated by the mental travels and the enrichment of her mind provided by books. The novel recounts the difficult passage from childhood into adolescence, her troubled and hurting love for her father, a pathetic failure who can't find the will to overcome his problems, and who stumbles from fall to fall until his destruction. It also recounts Francie's relationship with her mother: she suffers from believing Neely is her favorite, but she's never reproachful and is always helpful.The tone is intimate, and even sordid aspects are treated with great beauty of language, depth in psychological description, and empathy with the characters. Feelings, values and situations are universal and allow the reader to really feel the story. Readers of any age beyond early childhood may enjoy it. It is about dignity, courage, effort, and authenticity without ever being corny or preachy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith isn't a novel about a dysfunctional family. It is a lullaby of a quiet corner in the city that never sleeps. It is a lullaby that whispers the joys, hardships, and love of a family that will forever be in my heart.The story revolves around Francie Nolan, a young girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. She is one of the only true Americans on her blocks and is proud of it. Living on little food, Francie quenches her thirst for life through books and school. Her mother is a traditional housewife with a twist of rebellion. Her father is a man as magical and loving as he is drunk, living through a kaleidascope of wonder that he teaches his children to adore.Everything about A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was utterly enchanting. I truly connected with each character. It doesn't matter whether you're an eager young author, someone who has experienced a tragic loss, or simply someone who loves life, I believe there is a little bit of everyone in Francie Nolan. Everyone has that childlike need to live their dreams in an attempt to escape an imperfect reality. In fact, all of the Smith's characters are so terrific that it is hard to believe that they are 'ction. Their attitude, togetherness, and love are something that every family should strive to imitate. By the end of the novel, I began to miss the family that I had grown up with as if they were my own.Betty Smith's writing is full of wonderful portraits of the place she grew up. She displays the glory of New York City at a time when immigrants poured into America. Her prose make us feel the pride of Francie's neighbors when they leave their homeland, and the freedom they felt as their boats docked. Yet, along with these beautiful images, she portrays the struggles of so many people living in the small crowded islands of New York City. Betty Smith shows us the loves and losses of a new nation by painting a picture to rival Picasso.The chronicle of the Nolans' life was a truly wonderful and enlightening experience. It is so enchanting to travel alongside the family through their trials and celebrations alike. I will admit to several tear streaked pages and advise anyone who reads this book to have a box of tissues handy. I will end with my favorite part of the book. The tree is growing outside the window as Francie looks out at it for the last time. About the tree, Smith writes: \\"It lived! And nothing could destroy it.\\" Those sentences remind me that nothing ever truly dies. Everything and everyone will live on forever in the memory of all who come to love it.- Victoria Testa"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I lived in the pages of this book, was totally carried away to Brooklyn.

I cannot wait for my teen daughter to read this book and to find out what she thinks of it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The term \\"classic\\" is thrown around these days and lands on lots of inappropriate choices, whether it's books, movies,music, etc. But this book is- and always has been - a gem. I read it myself fifty years ago; bought it for my daughter, my daughter-in-law, and, most recently, my niece. We have all loved the story.Buy it and share it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is an incredible coming of age story that everyone should read regardless of social class, race, etc. It is the story of Francie Nolan and her often impoverished family and their daily struggles to put food on their plates and to become educated. Francie's voice is so innocent and perceptive as she narrates her family's history, the Brooklyn neighborhood she was raised in and the adjustments she must make as she grows older. She is able to find pleasure in the simplest of things, yet her life is a constant struggle filled with small joys and immense tragedies. Smith's beautiful writing immerses the reader in the Nolan's lives, effectively conveying the atmosphere of their existence and defining the era. I was so absorbed in this novel and am thrilled that I was prompted to read it for my book club. It will be a favorite that I will recommend and revisit over the years."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith deftly depicts a young literate woman's perspective of Irish life in Brooklyn during the turn of the last century - impressively in a manner similar to great American authors Theodore Dreiser or Saul Bellow. She shows us the great American story where simple roots can bring rise to good and sometimes great triumphs.Protagonist Francie Nolan is the main party throughout the book whose literary verve and gift make her the seemingly natural person to author this or a similar book. She writes about the happy and sad times of poverty in Brooklyn when impoverished lives delivered grueling challenges. But, to deliver such stories to the teacher in grade school can be straining.All great writers probably stretch the truth - that is what makes their stories surpass what we read or hear about on a daily basis. When Francie writes true stories about her poverty, her teacher says, \\"You know, Francie, a lot of people would think that these stories that you're making up all the time were terrible lies because they are not the truth as people see the truth. In the future, when something comes up, you tell exactly how it happened but write down for yourself the way you think it should have happened. Tell the truth and write the story.\\" She learns \\". . . poverty, starvation and drunkenness are ugly subjects to choose. We all admit these things exist. But one doesn't write about them.\\"But, Betty Smith did write about such difficult topics, and succeeded. So have numerous others since. Recently,Angela's Ashes: A Memoirrevolved exclusively about such Irish poverty forty years later. And how many post-war novels (WW I or WW II) have caught the public's attention with doom and despair as the almost exclusive focus of the fictional or nonfictional account?Reading books like this also allows modern readers to learn about the times and events. People walked outside late at night with little wonder about physical assault. Meals were \\"stretched out\\" from crumbs, day old bread, soups and parts of animals most of us would ignore. Education was very expensive, and horses ruled the roads in New York. As the subway and car were still not fine-tooled enterprises, trips from Brooklyn to Manhattan were journeys. And, \\"When you get a Democrat president, you got a war president.\\" Times have changed.This book proudly has been selling for decades, and could continue its selling feats beyond a century, because of the simplistic delivery and acute perception tied with great story and dialogue. Books like this are fun."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Everyone should read this book. It will make people realize what a great country we have, and of the courage of these people who made it a great country by working hard and bettering themselvews."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is timeless in it's appeal to the generations since it was written. I loved it as a teenager, and loved it even more as a grandmother. It shows how enduring the power of love is even though we have serious flaws. When we as children are loved unconditionally, we can grow to do great things,in spite of poverty and other adversities. We in turn learn to love unconditionally too."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Nothing like the good old classics for late night reading. Very interesting and well worth the money. I could read this over several times."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My Mom gave me this book to read when I was very young. Actually I have one of the first publications of it. I have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story. Reminds us that recycling actually did begin a long time ago when during the depression kids would take wagons full of things to recycle to get pennies for bread. A beautiful story I will read again and again. So happy to have it on my Kindle now."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I found this book to be very heart warming and interesting. Whether or not it is true to life and an accruate account of life at that time, doesn't matter because I enjoyed it. A slow page-turner of a book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I keep my favorite 100 books on a shelf next to my computer. After reading this touching, bold, honest biography, I had to bump another book to find a place on my shelf for Smith's gem. It is one of my all-time favorites. R.K. Tipton"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The imagery in this book is haunting and evocative. The struggle for dignity amid poverty is still poignant and relevant today. This book is a timeless classic. Read it for the first time, or read it again. You will be glad that you did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am enjoying the book very much and would recomend it. It is an interesting book. I loved the movie but the book is a lot more explicit."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this years ago and was so happy that I decided to read it again. Classic book that stands the test of time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was a surprising selection for my book club. I had seen the movie years ago and thought it okay. The book describes a period of growing up in difficult times with wonderful use of words and descriptive phrases not dated at all. This is, yet again, a case of the original book being much better than the movie! It is well worth a visit."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn the summer I turned 16. At the time, it was just a book I saw on a clearance rack at Barnes and Noble. I knew it was a classic and I just wanted to read it quick and cross it off on the book list I was building. I didn't know that when I began reading it that I would finish it in less than a week, and then go back and re-read passages.The book tells the story of Francie Nolan, a girl growing up in early 1900's Brooklyn. Francie's story weaves through themes of poverty, pride, family, and just the wonders, heartbreak, and humor of childhood and teen years. There's great dialogue and colorful characters to love and hate. It's amazing to be able to relate to a character, when the time gap between is about 100 years.This book is awesome, wondrous, beautiful... I just finished re-reading it again after years of not touching it, and I was reminded why it is one of my favorite books, it still resonates with me today. This should be required reading for kids in school, and their parents :) Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Although this appears under my husband's account because he gifted me the Kindle and set up the account, I am the one who read this book as a young girl of approximately ten years old. I fell in love with the story and still hold fond memories of reading it. I was delighted to see it available for Kindle and can not wait to re-read this beloved story. I encourage others to experience the story of a young girl coming of age in NYC. Peggy"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This will always be a favorite book of mine, from the time I first read it as a young girl.I actually bought it as a gift for my daughter-in-law. She had once told me that it was a book she had always meant to read, and since mine is time worn and literally falling apart, I was anxious to get it for her.The seller of this book was wonderful. I received it well ahead of the expected date, in perfect condition, so I was able to give it as a little extra gift for Veronica's birthday!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was the 2nd time I've read this classic book. I was always held within the pages of intimacy of interest."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I used this for a book club and it was an excellent choice. I wasn't sure it was going to be a success but the members enjoyed it. There are so many controversial topics and differences in lifestyle from that era to today that it really facilitates great discussions. The questions in the back of the book that are provided for use in book clubs were great."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am so sad to say good bye to the characters in this book. It was a great read. I loved seeing the little girl in Brooklyn grow up to be a strong young woman. I loved the message of the tree. . . that beauty can grow and overcome the harshest of circumstances."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had been meaning to read this classic coming-of-age story for years, and I'm so glad I finally did. Completely fell in love with young Francie Nolan and her family, immigrants who strived to make a better life for their children in poverty-stricken Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time, this book had me both smiling and fighting back tears many times. As I reached the final pages, I slowed down my reading, because I just didn't want to say good-bye to the characters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As is stated in this book's forward, this story isn't about one thing. There isn't one topic, one climax, one point. It meanders quietly, yet poignantly through the growing up years of a young girl living in the poverty stricken tenements of 1912 Brooklyn, NY. To describe the plot is impossible if one wants to do it justice. There's just too much that would have to be left out and that that would be a shame. Suffice it to say it keeps one's attention to the elimination of everything else.Upon research, I found it is actually an autobiography of the author (which makes it even more moving and unforgettable) who, upon request turned it into a story. I also learned while it became a huge best-seller when originally published in 1942, it was also hugely controversial. People didn't want to see poverty and injustice, reality in their stories. Looking in that mirror could be just too uncomfortable. Honesty is fine - up to a point - but truth is sometimes awfully hard to stomach. Taking from the book:\\" Honesty is casting bright light on your own experience; truth is casting it on the experiences of all\\"And, that's what Ms. Smith did so well. In her story we see bits of ourselves, for good or bad. We relate to the too-skinny girl who doesn't fit in. We remember the cruel children, the harsh teachers, the humiliating situations that coat the human experience. We also remember the joys that make childhood magical, the dreams that make growing up an adventure, no matter one's social class. Francie's life is filled with life - humanities. It's a story of living among the desperately poor through the eyes of one who knows nothing else. But, lest one think it is depressing and dark, it's also a story of love, of family, of the infallible will to do better in a country where better is always promised but sometimes disappoints. It's innocence shines through even while its hideousness is obvious. It is a quiet, heart-wrenching, soul-felt, yet ultimately hopeful story. It accepts weakness but inspires greatness. It admits ugliness while searching for beauty. It acknowledges great despair while encouraging great hope. All with a clear, simple voice of an 11 year old girl"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I love this story and I plan to make my girls read it as soon as they are old enough. I have never read a book that does a better job of stressing the importance of education and reading."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Knowing only that this book was written a long time ago and has been in print for many decades was all the information that I had. I knew it featured an urban family in 1900 NYC, and my understanding stopped there. One day Audible.com had a \\"classics\\" sale and I picked this up and stashed it away on my MP3 player. Eventually I listened. In short orded I double-bought this magnificent novel for my Kindle and read along as I listen. Then I shared my Kindle edition with all my friends and family, who were equally impressed. There is no stopping this book. I delivers history like no textbook ever will, and human insight, depth and drama, that no film ever could."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is a great coming of age story, but I felt that some of the topics were inappropriate for my 12 year old daughter for whom I was pre-reading the book. Though some topics were difficult, they were presented well and within a context that would give an opportunity for learning new perspectives without a loss of innocence. It is a book that I will recommend to my daughter, but I will wait another year or two. I read the Kindle version and had instant delivery with no problems whatsoever!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"movie MANY years ago. Loved it then and loved the story as I read it. Times were tough by our standards but attitudes were good and mostly positive. Good read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a hard to put down. The author really brings out the liveliness of the characters. I don't usually read books twice but I would pick this one up and read it again"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. The tree symbolizes Francie,as the tree grows in the worst conditions yet there's beauty within. Just like Francie."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book appeared on an optional eighth grade reading list for me -- 45 years ago. And, I'm very sorry I waited so long to become acquainted with Betty Smith's masterpiece. If nothing else, Francie Nolan is a contemporary of my grandparents, and it would have been a great way to start conversations that might have let me learn more about what it was like to grow up in poor immigrant families in small-town Wisconsin.Beyond that, though, this is a truly compelling story of a girl's coming of age under less-than-ideal circumstances, buoyed mainly by her own strength of character. Smith's sparse writing style took a bit for me to get used to, and it helped reading her biography and learning that she was primarily a dramatist; she prefers to show her readers what's going on and leave them to their own interpretations, rather than simply telling them.The latter chapters weren't quite as rewarding, even though it's comforting to see that Francie's hard work is finally going to pay off. The real meat of the story occurs in her formative years ending with her own eighth grade graduation. Even so, these were not characters I was prepared to leave when the book ends. And, while I believe I understood the adults better for having waited 45 years to tackle this book. I'd heartily recommend it to anyone 12 and up who wants to read a wonderful story of a girl's growing up."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"the author painted a clear picture of New York City and described the way of in the 1930s and growing up in the area"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Very good book, but is a slow read. It brought up a lot of memories that were good and bad."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a classic, every lady wether she be a girl or a woman should have read at least once in her life time, preferably at a young age because it is a classic coming of age story about love, dreams and that awkward moment between birth and death called life. I absolutely loved it! I read it in Middle School and it still remains in my top list of favorite novels of all time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I enjoyed re-reading this book with my book group and discussing the life of that time in a place we all know well."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"arrived fast and in great shape.

I am so interested in the lives of all the characters and wish I could know more about all of them. I cried several times, and felt so connected with Francie Nolan. I now understand why this book is held in such high regard among many people I know."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this is an old book that I wanted to read for a long time. I really enjoyed it even tho the heroine was so dicriminated against."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Although this book was intriguing and interesting, there were a few things I didn't like about it. For me, it didn't get that interesting until half way through the book. Also, there seemed to be many irrelevant details and characters. I still enjoyed reading it as it had a unique plot and kept me interested."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I remember when I first began to read this book for class, didn't understand how a book could be about nothing and still be a classic. But after it all, I've come to classify it as a book about life, simply put. It's a grotesque, truthful, yet beautiful description about life that can be loved by all."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a beautifully written story.

Incredible to think of life exactly 100 years ago. Things were so different. 100 years from now? Makes me wonder!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I enjoyed this book, it opened my eyes on how hard the Times were back then. Francis was a strong person."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith enchanted me with her beautiful description of early 19th century America through the eyes of Francie Nolan. Despite the significant differences between Francie Nolans lifestyle and my own, I feel connected with her. I love this book because I loved Francie's character. Francie's innocence, imagination, human desires, and passion make her very lovable. I cherish the descriptions of Francie's relations with her family. I also enjoyed Francie's endless observations of the world around her. I anticipated reading from chapter to chapter to see what trials, experiences, joys, and triumphs she'd come across next. I recommend this book to anyone who loves detail and good anecdotes. Francie makes me appreciate the wonderful life around me, one of the greatest gifts a book has ever given me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and certainly is Betty Smith's best book. It follows, for the most part, the life of the Nolan family from the oldest daughter's point of view. But it also gives you backround to give you idea of John and his wife's lives and their families before Frances was born. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was the best book I have ever read. I was assigned it for an English class I took. I moved away from my old school and finished it for no reason at all. I feel in love with Francie, and continued to read &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;, also by Betty Smith. That was wonderful too. I am currently reading &quot;Maggie-Now&quot;, by Betty Smith. She has a way of writing that I can't even describe how good it is. I would reccomend for anyone that hasn't read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; to do it fast. I learned a lot from it, and I think you will too. I have been encouraged by this book to be strong when times are tough, and to NEVER give up. Here's the surprise, I'm only 15 years old. I think I have matured a lot from reading this book. I can't seem to stop reading. This book has gotten me addicted to reading. I go from one book to the next, but &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; will always be my favorite. Jamie"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was fourteen I read this book for a class in junior high. Now, at age twenty, I am reading it again for a book review and have found that I have a deeper understanding of its meaning. Francie is like the inner child in all of us, wanting to be greater than anyone thinks she can. She rose up out of poverty by her own thinking and has shown us that we can do whatever we set our mind to. Her mother Katie was a very strong character who gave us an insite into a mother's love for her children. At the end, I loved the symbolizm where Francie says good-bye to her old self, the next little girl to take her place. And always, there is the tree, the one that will never die. To me, that tree stood for the continuation of life itself - it will always go on."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book. It touched me. The Nolans struggled throughout the years and as they grew I grew too. I wholeheartedly recommend this book. It's good reading."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In the fifth grade, my teacher gave this book to me as an end-of-the-year present. I was dismayed because it was long and looked excruciatingly boring. Inside the cover, he wrote that I would someday enjoy it. He couldn't have been more correct. I have read and reread this brilliant book, about the passage of Francie into adulthood through the struggles of poverty. I have never experienced anything like what she did, but I felt as if I could be her. Everyone must read this book. It is a timeless classic."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story is so true and one of my favorites. Meet Francie, the daughter of Katie and Johnny Nolan, who don't have much future in store for their intelligent and bookworm daughter. You learn about Francie, the so honestly true story. It's amazing that it isn't your story. The slums of Brooklyn come to life in this touching story. If you did not enjoy this book you have no passion for life, or no feelings for those who do exsist but you push them out of your mind."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"So much will be left unsaid about my love for &quot;Tree&quot;. I'm only 16 years old and I was introduced to the Noland family 2 years ago. This is a book that will bring tears to my eyes, a smile on my face, and countless hours of being locked up in my room imagining that I am living in a flat in Brooklyn- 1917. Thank you Betty Smith for bringing this book into my life. -Sarah Homan"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Turning 16 I went to California to stay there for a year as an exchange student. My English wasn't very good and the first thing I had to do in my junior-English-class was to read the &quot;Tree&quot;. I had a hard time surviving the introduction and getting on was even harder. But even though I failed the first five or six quizzes on the book (we did one quizz a day) I somehow started to understand the language and to sympathize with the Nolans. Francie Noland became my dear friend during my first two months in California and my English got better and better turning the pages of Betty Smith's wonderful novel. The essencial thing that made Francie special to me was the way my English teacher pronounced MY name, Franzi, that sounds differend in German and in English. When I came back to Berlin I couldn't get a German copie of the &quot;Tree&quot; which I thought was terrible for me. I searched the libraries and found an old English copie which I read instantly. I missed the Nolans and the 1900 New York. END"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I must say, I was taken aback by the superbness (don't know if that's a word) of the hard, depressive reality in this masterpiece. Being 13 years of age, I am going into the eight grade, and therefore, must read four books over the summer for school. Well, a friend of mine suggested I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and, my being a skepticist, I said &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; &quot;Yeah&quot; is right! This is one of the best books I've read since I was five years old when I started to read. It is, as I've said, negatively veritable, and I am a great fan and avid reader of real, in-your-face publications. Usually I read macabre, gory mystery, and basically ghoulish stuff, but when I read this book, my point of view did a total 180*. Macabre may be physically gory, but wonderful, realistic books like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn are emotionally and mentally &quot;gory&quot;. Emotional depression is, at least I think, the backbone of marvelous, expressive writing; I believe that this book is one of the only of its kind to provide that backbone in a way that separates it from unreal story-telling. Bravo, Ms. Smith, bravo.H.S."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My mother recommended A Tree Grows In Brooklyn and I was actually reluctant to read it . I didn't want to read the book until I finished reading the first page ! Then , my mom would have to tell me to stop reading and come down for dinner .A Tree Grows in Brooklyn isn't any normal novel . This book actually makes you grow , not physically but - how can I explain - It made me feel reborn , in Francie's shoes . I 've read the book 6 times and am planning to read it again . I recommend this book to all people .I also don't understand how anyone could rate this masterpiece anywhere under 5 stars ! These are the ones who flip through the book and say &quot; too long , too many pages , I don't feel like reading. &quot; Please listen to me - I'm 13 , and truthfully say this:A Tree Grows in Brooklyn will always be the best written novel you shall ever read ."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"While reading this book one truly understands Francie Nolan's struggle to grow up and live her dreams. Growing up isn't easy,but when your father is an alcoholic and your mother clearly favores your brother, most people would turn inward and reject the outside world. However, Francie Nolan is too strong for that. She knows she will accomplish her dreams, and she won't let anybody else tell her differently. Even when her father becomes ill, even when Francie must leave school to work, even when her heart is broken, Francie never gives up. I think Betty Smith gives courage and spirit to the Francie Nolan of today's world, a young girl growing up amidst anything else. Francie's struggles are the same struggles of girls of today, only in a different time. Parents, sibling, school, dreams, and simply understanding why the world works are all part of growing up. Just as Francie must learn these things on her own as part of growing up, young girls must learn these things on their own, as a part of growing up.The book shows that young girls are never alone in their struggles, and never will be, ever. Because this book gives hope and inspiration to girls of today, this book is among my favorites."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I originally picked &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; off of a reading list my junior year in high school. I wasn't looking forward to the reading, and frankly I put it off until the very last day. I picked the book up the day before the report was due, and did not close it until the next morning when I was finished: not because I had to, but because I was enchanted. In a world that is so fast paced, I was overjoyed to read about a time when all a little girl wanted was to read every book in the library. When penny candy really cost a penny, and when ice was delivered. This book is magical and educational. It shows the aches and pains that all young women feel, regardless of what decade you were born. It is passionate, and full of love. Each sentance is crafted, caring for the finest detail. It is truly the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; two years ago; I was 14. Since then, I have fallen in love with the book. I simply like Betty Smith's profound and elegant style of writing; it was particularly effective since I couldn't put the book down. But often, after reading a few pages, I had to put it down to think about life: where I was going, what was my purpose on this earth, etc. These questions have been clear in my mind since then. I recommand this book grandly and I hope you'll love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book showed me what it was like to grow up in a low-income family in Brooklyn.

Seeking to lose ourselves in an old, familiar book, savoring the warmth of a hot mug of coffee, relishing the flavor of everyday life...Smith does not merely describe life. She defines it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Wonderful!Wonderful!Wonderful!I felt sorrow,I cried for the characters,I'll always remember Francie Nolan and her family!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is the most amazingly touching piece of literature I have ever read. I am fifteen years old and have read this book twice. As a girl growing up, I can completely relate to Francie, despite how incredibly different our lives are. This book made me cry in places and sometimes filled me with such feeling that I was content to simply sit and think about it. I have recorded a few of the many delicious quotes and anecdotes and refer to them for anything I may be feeling. It is an amazing book that made me grow as a person. I suggest that every girl read this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was very moving. i read it everywhere I went. I just couldn't set it down! A GREAT book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am 13 years old, and i've already read this book 3 times!! The length and depressing periods could NOT in the slightest hold this story back!! I was amazed by the way that a full grown author like Betty Smith could show so perfectly what adolescent girls feel and think, and the anecdotes in the story stay with you forever and ever, The simple events like going shopping and searching for scrap metal makes being poor seem much more interesting than middle-class life, by FAR. I think every teenager should read this book for PLEASURE because it made me think in a totally different way than I ever had before."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A tree grows in Brooklyn was a pleasant read for a classic. By saying that I mean that some of the classics we have read in the past have just been hard reads - hard to understand and hard to get into. This books writing was smooth and I could follow the story easily. The book is centered around Francie and her family in the back drop of World War One. Told from the perspective of Francie, I quickly was engrossed in the absolute and utter level of poverty they were.Food is a big theme in this book and while they had very little, Francie's mom Katie could work wonders with it. There is always stale bread and crushed pies, and bone marrow to spread on bread as a treat after the bone has been used in soups. Meat was a rare treat. This book reminded me a bit of The Book Thief as far as the poverty and making the best of what they have.I enjoyed the theme of the book, yet found it for the most part non eventful. The book goes page by page through Francie's life, what she sees in her parents (her dad drinks too much and her mom works hard cleaning homes to make ends meet). You see Francie is school and you learn her love for books and for learning. The book carries you through Francie's life and through this I see comparable to the tree that grows outside their home... the tree seems to represent Francie - strong and yet with struggles, continuing to grow.A Tree Grows In Brooklyn was published in 1943. The book sold 300,000 copies in the first six weeks after it was published. How amazing is that! I find it astonishing that I have never read this book before. This as well as most of the other greats were never required reading in our local schools."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have been collecting old classics, and found this on Amazon. It is a Harper Perennial Classic, in paperback. This novel was written in 1943, but is enjoying a \\"re-run\\"."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I will never forget Francie Nolan and her family. Reading this book has given me more appreciation for all that I have. It has given me hope that magnificent can come out of poor and uneducated. The characters were deep, the details colorful."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I learned a lot about the way life was when my great grandmother was living, which was very interesting to me. I didn't want the book to end, I wanted to keep learning about Francie's life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Is this a seminal, Americana classic? I sure think so after finally reading it, 30-years after my fingers first laid touch to its bindings. I'm sorry that I did not discover this insightful, understated work years earlier. This is easily on par with \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and \\"The Good Earth;\\" perhaps even superior because it infuses humor into the salt-of-the-earth characters and storylines.A tree does grow in Brooklyn; and it soars with redwood-stature. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Why did I wait all these years to read this book.

Everytime I picked up the book, it put a smile on my face. Couldn't wait to continue reading the book. Characters in this book are very real, geniune and heart warming.

Well deserved 5 starts."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book when I was 12, 13 years old, back when I was still in junior high. Even then, I love it. The prose is clear, simple, and truthful, but there are phrases in it that give off beauty--like the passages that describe Francie's imaginings, or her simple awe at the simplest things. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is truly like life.I grew so attached to the characters that when Francie worked to gain a measure of her mother's love for Neeley, I felt my heart hurt the way hers would have. When Johnny died, I cried (and still do, even after all these years). I love that everyone in the novel, from Francie and her family to the simplest store owner, has depth, and weaknesses and strengths like anyone else.I highly recommend it to anyone, adult or child!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is such a great story and so eloquently written.

The hopefullness underpining all the struggles of the mther and daughter explains alot about the immigrant experience at the turn of the last century."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of those literary classics I'd always known about, but never got around to reading till I was an adult. This book was well worth the wait. Perhaps I loved and enjoyed it even more as an adult instead of a teenager. It has all the hallmarks of the classic fiction I love--well-developed, rich, complex characters you feel like you're friends with by the end, a rich backstory for each character, wonderful historical details, a well-described historical backdrop that yet doesn't overwhelm the reader by constantly calling attention to the past era, an episodic structure instead of being plot-centric, the now-underused third-person omniscient POV, a slower pace that develops the story bit by delicious bit instead of racing from Point A to Point B within 288 pages, and a story focused more on characters than stakes, action, and some kind of formulaic three-part act.While in many respects, the world Francie grows up in has advantages over the modern world (a slower pace of life, valuing family more, kids who love reading from an early age, understanding the value of money), in many ways, I'm glad to know this is history. It was so emotionally difficult to read about things like the treatment of Francie's neighbor Joanna, a 17-year-old single mom who dared to go out in public with her baby and show her love; Francie being shamed out of the special gift of left-handedness by her own mother, and never questioning why her natural inclination was wrong; a doctor and nurse who think poor children are sub-human; teachers who mistreat students simply for being poor; and hard-working people having a hard time catching a financial break.Initially I was kind of disappointed that the pace picked up so much later in the book, going through important historical events and long stretches of time so relatively quickly, but I guess that it makes sense, since Francie was a teenager by then. Time seems to pass more slowly when we're kids, and then passes more quickly as we get older. I do wish there'd been more coverage of things like the influenza epidemic and World War I, but the purpose of the story wasn't to be a historical epic. It's a Bildungsroman about a poor girl and her family as they experience life during some historic times. The only really negative moment I had in the book was the part where Francie had an instalove of sorts with a young soldier. It just didn't seem to fit with her well-established character. I was glad when that storyline was over.It really strikes me how a book like this would have a hard time getting published these days, because it's so slow-paced and quiet, focused on character over action, doesn't really have a plot structure, Part II is the backstory of Francie's parents and grandparents, tells more than shows, and doesn't really have any stakes other than the Nolans wanting to get out of poverty. And yet those are the things that make it such a classic and wonderful book. This is the type of book that wasn't written for people with a ten-minute attention span. It was written for people who enjoy a slow, well-crafted story that takes us through the ups and downs of life with beautifully-written characters. It's not meant for people who want to be hooked in the first line or who won't read anything that doesn't have a lot of action or high stakes. I think this is going to be one of those books I remember in detail years later, as though I just read it for the first time yesterday."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I would love to teach a literature class on historical fiction that was actually written a long time ago. It's so interesting to see how writers from a particular period saw an era that came before them.For example, The Last of the Mohicans was written in 1826, but takes place in the 1750s. To Kill A Mockingbird was written during the Civil Rights Movement, but takes place in the Depression. And now, I just finished A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It's a great book that holds up incredibly well, but one of my favorite things is how the novel is a view of life in 1912 that's written from the perspective of someone in 1947. You can see both eras--the one being written about as well as the beliefs of the writer who came later.This novel is an absolute work of genius. It's completely addictive, beautifully written, funny and sad. The characters are so real that I felt as if I knew them, and while they don't always do what's right, they are heartbreakingly human and vulnerable. A truly fantastic read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Have wanted to read this since high school. Now I'm 41! Almost forgot that I was reading a classic! Please do yourself a favor and read this one!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"To say I was pleasantly surprised by this book is an understatement. I was looking to get out of my reading comfort zone as a 48-year-old man. It more than lives up to its billing as a classic. I draw a parallel between it and \\"The Good Earth\\" by Pearl S. Buck. It just says so much about so many things over the course of the story (roughly set in the years 1900-1918).The commonality shared by this book and \\"The Good Earth\\" -- besides being a story that is told over a period of years -- is family and enduring times of hardship and poverty through hard work. Whereas Wang Lung (in \\"The Good Earth\\") was connected to the land (in China), young, lonely and intelligent Francie Nolan is ambivalently connected to her neighborhood in Manhattan.Both books show the cruelty of fate and other people (especially the young in this book) to the poor and downtrodden and both serve to educate the reader to different times. There is also a lot a dynamic perception of family in both.I'm used to more immediate, dialogue- and action-driven stories and wanting to change that is what drove me to this book.At times the story appears as if there is no plot or trajectory, but that is where Betty Smith's craft took over. All of the seemingly disparate events depicted over time fit together like a jigsaw, building and enhancing characterization of its literary denizens along the way. It leaves the reader filled with hope and the feeling of love -- again, something I'm not normally gushing about. Which says a lot about the quality of the book. It's filled with truth.If you are into superficial action books, stay away from it. If you want to look at a unique time and place and enlarge your literary boundaries, then by all means buy it. I don't think one needs to be a young student to get the most out of it, though it serves well in that capacity. I think one just should want to look into humanity and a different time and place (and the more things change, the more they stay the same). To be clear, I never thought I'd find a book of this kind nearly as good as \\"The Good Earth.\\" This is right up there. Truly inspiring and poignant. I highly recommend it. It will stick with you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Written in the third person, this certainly is Francie's story. The reader gets drawn into the poverty culture of the immigrants of Brooklyn during the years prior to WWI.

In the past fifteen years, I have read the novel at least eight times and it has shaped the way I approach my chosen career fields of Psychology and Sociology. Each time I flip through, I draw new connections from the story about the development of America's white immigrant population, women's roles in society, and the advantages and challenges that sprout from public education. However, my gut emotional reaction to the book never changes; it will always make me laugh and cry!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"One of the best stories I have ever read. The book is amazing throughout, as Francie and the Nolans struggle through life in the Willamsburg tenaments. Francie is an amazing character, one of the most complex I have ever read about. She offers a completely different perspective on the world, one of innocence.The story itself is complete. Very well written, with great descriptions and complete thoughts."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,&quot; by Betty Smith, is a wonderful example of teenage hardships and a girl's struggle in her coming of age. Francie Nolan serves as an illustration of these hardships. In the novel, Francie is seen growing up. We are privileged to be given a window into Francies heart and the Nolan home. The novel shows Francies struggles with her family and school life, her fight to overcome the poverty that she was born into and to become a success.Francie was not born into the ideal family. The Nolans were poor, but they survived. They had love and enough money to have food, clothing and shelter. Francie's father, Johnny Nolan, was a fun-loving gentleman. Francie loved how he referred to her as his \\"prima donna,\\" and she cherished the relationship that they had. Katie Nolan, Francie's mother, was not as fun-loving as Johnny, but she loved her children and provided for them. Francie thought that she was not loved by her mother, but Katie instilled responsibility and independance in Francie, even though she did not think of this as love at the time. Katie was a very hardworking mother. Her job as a janitor kept her very busy and it gave her a very rough appearance. Neeley, Francies younger brother kept himself very busy by collecting recycling products to make a little extra money for himself and for his family.To Francie, reading and writing were the basis of life. She lived for weekend mornings when she could read, and she got so much joy out of going to the library and finding a new book. When Francie came home with a new book, she would read it on the fire-escape and indulge her active imagination. Francie applied her imagination to everyday experiences. She loved watching her neighbor get dressed up for her dates and she fantasized that the girls' dates were not coming for her, but for Francie. Francie got pleasure out of very simple and ordinary things, like her friend Frank's horse. Francie did not have an ideal school life, even though she imagined that she did. She battled solitude and loneliness throughout her school career. Her education, however did lead to better things for her.Francie's struggles in her life and her ability to endure show a strength that people long for today. Francie was able to overcome poverty, death, sexual abuse, and stress of adolescence. \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is a wonderful book that I advise every woman, regardless of age, to read.

This book is about a girl, Francie, and her growing up in a town called Brooklyn. It talks about her as a little baby and the troubles she went through (such as being a sickly little baby and having a younger brother that was liked more than she was) and it talks about her and her growing into a woman and the things she wants and the things that she has to do, the jobs that she has and her troubles with college ( i.e. getting in since she did not graduate from high school) and, to me the most important, how her family pulls together in hard times (like when there is hardly any food, how they pay bills and how they keep money) This book is truley a great book to read on a &quot;fire escape and looking out onto a tree&quot;.

I read it looking for a simple story, but when I was asked what it was about, I couldn't find simple words for it, though the hours spent reading it flew by. I wish this beautiful story hadn't ended.

Perhaps you will learn something different, something more meaningful to you.

The detail with which Smith recreates life in a poor section of Brooklyn is memorable and meticulous: the small details such as dinner after dinner of fried eggs with onions (eggs and onions being what the family could afford) are reminscent of &quot;Angela's Ashes.&quot; Francie is spirited, bright and unquenchable and it's this spirit that has inspired young readers for decades.Smith was able to write autobiographically while fictionalizing the events sufficiently to create a novel. This is a marvelous writing. I enjoyed reading it again to study the skill with which Smith blended the ability to recreate her past in detail, yet keep the writing spare and fresh. This is great fiction."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I don't know how I got through junior high without reading this. I listened to it on tape and loved it.

Any novel that can captivate me for 500 pages has got to be something extra special, and this one did. It has everything you want in a novel, great writing, superb characters, humor, sadness, joy and pain. I loved every word. There is really nothing more to be said, if you have not read this book you are truly missing out on something magical."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is an America classic, so you probably already know the plot outline. The book is the story of Francie, a poor young girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early years of the 20th century. Francie is an intelligent girl who aspires to be a writer, but she has to overcome the predictable obstacles associated with poverty and absence of connections.But the author doesn't over-romanticize the story by inventing a too-good-to-be-true character who is single-mindedly ambitious. Francie has the same concerns as any young girl in the poor section of Brooklyn would have had during those years. She is no more honest, no more selfless, no more generally virtuous, than any other girl. That typical-ness, I believe, is the key to the book's popularity.The book has been more popular with women than men, I believe, because the book evokes powerful memories of what a girl's childhood is like. And the female readers whom I have talked to all say, \\"Yes. That's just what it was like.\\" And it's probably not a bad idea for men - especially men with daughters - to have that vicarious experience by reading the book, either.Heartwarming, genuine, and well worth your time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book when I was 12years old. I'm now 33 and I still find myself returning to this book for its beautiful story. I love how Betty Smith drew a picture of early 1900 Brooklyn and it's temement district. The story she reveals page by page of Francie Nolan and her family is filled with triumphs and sadness and the joy of learning and growing."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"For the life I don't know how Betty Smith managed to write my life decades before I was born. I too, am a Brooklyn native and I truly believe Smith has a amazing style of writing. Like Francie, I'm the older daughter, and I have a younger brother close in age. If I were to describe all the similarities between Francie's life and mine, I would never finished. I recommend this novel whole-heartedly. Every Brooklynite should read this. Though the story takes place in an entirely different era, Smith evokes a wave of nostalgia to all who understand the appeal of Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am a Brooklyn native, with my father being brought up in the same neighborhood (Williamsburg) described so vividly in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. My father (deceased) never spoke much of his childhood, probably wanting to avoid telling me of the squalor. But as Betty Smith proves, one person's &quot;slum&quot; is another person's &quot;home&quot;.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the (hard-to-believe-it's-fiction) story of a teenage girl, Francie, being raised in rather rough conditions during the 1910s. Her life, as viewed from 30,000 feet, is not terribly exciting. Yet it is her mind, her curiousity, her compassion, and her soul which is so well projected by Betty Smith. I feel that Francie and her family are, well, people *I KNOW*. A brilliant novel.My only 'objection' to the novel is that it is targetted to young adults, which might limit its overall popularity (..the book has only been recently reprinted here in the UK). I believe the strong emotive element of this novel to be a bit too ... intense for folks under, say, eighteen. Young adults might actually find A Tree Grows in Brooklyn to be too sentimental."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I remember i first read this book when i was in Grade 8. My mom had told me about it, and i couldn't find it in any bookstore. I finally found it in our library at school and was spellbound the minute i picked it up.

While they were all moving and wonderful, this one is by far her best.I think everyone should try this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am seventy three. I remember reading this book in my early teens. I gave a copy to my daughter, then to my granddaughters, who enjoyed it as much as I did. Fashions and lifestyles may change, but the human condition does not. 'A Tree grows in Brooklyn'is a perennial delight and as fresh as the day it was written. The bitter-sweet tale of Francie, a young girl of Irish immigrant stock, approaching womanhood in downtown Brooklyn, speaks to the heart. On the face of it, this is a somewhat bleak tale of poverty, disappointment and sorrow, but above all, it tells of great love and youthful hope springing up among the weeds. My only fear is that in today's society, where instant satisfaction has become the norm, this book, with its' 500 pages, might seem too long - I hope not, for it is one of literature's truly great stories and a very good read!Rita Southgate - Cyprus"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Of all Brooklyn literature, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", has probably the most charm and magnetism for everyone, who reached for it at least once.The story of the Nolan family from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, comes to life in the book - and the novel is really heartfelt, very much because of simple, but poetic, suggestive and emotionally engaging language. Betty Smith managed to write a timeless piece, not only because of what she wrote about, but largely due to the lack of mannerisms and phrases fashionable in the 1940's, when she wrote \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\".Francie Nolan, a gifted girl who loves books and decides to be a writer (an alter ego of the author), who is 11 years old at the beginning of the book, is a daughter of Katie, a strong, pragmatic, honest, down-to-earth woman of Austrian descent, who supports her family being a cleaning lady, and Johnny, an Irish, heavy drinking romantic, earning some money now and then as a singing waiter. Francie has a year younger brother, Neely, and although the children are often hungry and cold, and try to earn money, selling scrap metal, they have the love of their parents, their own good nature, and a happy childhood as a result.The plot follows Francie from 11 to 16, when she goes to college, but also goes back in retrospective as far as the childhood and family lives of Katie and Johnny. Francie is at the center of the story, growing from a dreamy, shy child into a bright, imaginative woman. The lives of the Nolan nuclear family and numerous relatives and neighbors are described in a series of anecdotic pieces, which could make very good short stories, like snapshots of everyday life of the poor neighborhood, where people are resourceful and full of character. These stories, however, are masterfully tied together into this brilliant novel, which made me laugh and cry, moving me to the core, and teaching important lessons of the essence of humanity and American spirit.Betty Smith wrote a wonderful novel which will inspire generations to come, and immortalized the atmosphere of Brooklyn at the beginning of twentieth century. Thinking of this book simply as of \\"coming of age\\" novel does not do it justice - it is much more than that."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My grandmother, who I adore/admire in words I am not able to convey, passed this book onto me years ago. It still remains in my top 10.It is intensely emotional and affirmative for a woman of any age... and, for those who want to be around them.I can't imagine anyone being disappointed."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"To all the one star reviewers out there complaining about the tedious details in the book. Betty Smiths gift for detail is what makes the book so wonderful. I was fascinated with this book as a kid. I even tried to recreate the stale bread cutlets with ketchup sauce that Mama Nolan made!To this day, if I find a book about turn of the century NY tenements I will stop everything to read it. I've had a copy of ATGIB for 30 years now and I don't think I've ever gone a year without rereading it. Now I need to buy a new copy as my treasured copy (with illustrations!) has become lost. I hope whoever finds it enjoys it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just bought this for a young lady I know who is graduating High School. I read it at that age as well, and it is the perfect tale for a young woman on the verge of adulthood as it moves from the children to the young, and eventually middle-aged adults as it tells the multi-generational tale of the Nolan family. Heartbreaking and heartwarming without ever delving into sentimentality and highly, highly reccomended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Not many books come close to Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird on my bookshelf, but A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith has been placed right next to it.The story may seem bland: a girl grows up in a poverty-stricken section of Brooklyn in the early 1900's, as her mother and father struggle to provide a better life for their family.Yet, the story does not totally transcend the standard book: the characters are not overly eccentric and the plot is simple. After finishing the book, I could not put my finger on what it was that left such an impression, until I realized it was very demonstration of human nature which left me breathless.Smith's work offers much insight into the gorgeous complexity that is the human spirit, and the innate ability to acclimate to the life one is thrown into the moment they are born. When boiled down, the essence of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a beautifully written tale of strength in the midst of the eternal turmoil in poverty, heritage and relationships, both deep and superficial.The book, being semi-autobiographical, is easy to identify with; the themes of poverty, innocence and strength flowing strong throughout the story. But what may seem as urbane and indistinctive actually reveals the matchless feats and adventures conquered in an ordinary life.The characters of Johnny Nolan and Aunt Sissy bear a kind of comedic tragedy: a loving, alcoholic father who leaves flowers for his daughter a year after he dies, and an \\"over-sexed\\" woman who calls all her lovers \\"John\\". The characters are odd, but also very recognizable in any lifetime or family.Conclusively, Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the humbling story of ordinary people, doing ordinary things to stay alive, while astonishing readers by how parallel the fictional characters' lives are to their own."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"With joy and regret I finished A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, the tale of the Nolan family (and the Romelly women too). Started by eleven-year-old bookworm Francie Nolan and told by her younger and older selves, this book is rich with all the truth and tragedy of life at the turn of the century. Francie, born sickly and never quite getting enough food, thirsts for knowledge and in ways that she doesn't understand, love. Katie, her mother is a hardened and hard-working scrub woman who takes care of the family when her drunk but handsome husband is between jobs, which is most of the time. Though Francie and her father are very different, he understands her in a way that her mother can't and her brother Neely won't.On each page, there is something rich about the Brooklyn in all of us, the stingy place where we nail down our best dreams in tin cup banks and pray that something amazing grows out of the often sour soil of our lives. Francis and her family remind us that are many things in the world more important than money. This one goes on my \\"Books for Life\\" list. It's a keeper to be read over and over."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I've read this book twice in my life, and am thinking of picking it up again. I can still \\"see\\" the scenes from the book, and remember how I felt at each part. One of the best books I've ever read, definitely in my top 10. A book that stays with you and becomes a point of reference in how you see the world.Yes, that good."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the kind of book where there is no interwoven complex plot - just life, death, marriage, sacrifice and lessons learned. It's these simple writings that sometimes touch us the most and are the most thought-provoking. A girls life from childhood into womanhood, and all the dreams and devastations in between... Excellent."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the type of novel that comes along once in a lifetime. The reader is swept into the life of Frances Nolan, aka \\"Francie,\\" and is an unseen observer in the life young Francie leads. Francie and her family are poor. Poor to the point where it is a simple wonder that they have enough money to exist. There is a knowledge of this poverty in the characters, and a wish to be better, however they have no means by which to overcome it. Instead they embrace their lives and hope for better times. Francie values small things which may be overlooked in our world today, such as a pickle, jello, and even shiny pennies. She is grateful for what she has in life, though she is deeply poor and is well aware that others look down upon her.The title, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is symbolic in its meaning, and has many layers by which to discover. The characters come to life in the beautifully written prose of author Betty Smith.Time passes through the life and eyes of Francie, and as she grows, so does her perception of the world and those around her. She grows up fast, and at 14 is older and wiser in years than her Mother. Her relationships are heartfelt, as are her desires to overcome her life of poverty. Though poor, she is not ashamed and her pride is felt in waves throughout the novel. Throughout her journey, she remains true to herself and to her family.Personally, I was moved by this novel. It is an excellent read. My perception is that it started out somewhat slowly, but soon gathered speed as characters were developed and the story unfolded. I recommend this to all who want to experience a rich, beautifully written and deeply moving novel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith penned a true classic in her novel A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. It is a richly detailed and nuanced portrait of a time and place as seen through the eyes of young Francie. This is a classic coming-of-age story that follows Francie's growth and changes and is vividly told in her own words. It is a true pity that so many people seem to loath this wonderful book when it is assigned for school, but that is not the fault of the book. Thank goodness I came to read this one on my own so that I could appreciate the literary treasure that is A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I absolutely adore this book and recommend it to everyone every chance I get! I identified so much with Francie in her relationship with her family. I also admired her strength through all that happened. My favorite part is when they are getting the christmas tree chucked at them and they have to stay standing to win it. Francie was always thought of to be frail and weak b/c that's how she looked while her younger bro. looked strong and healthy but when the tree hit them, the bro. went to his knees and Francie jerked him back up even tho it hit her in the head. The book has great insight and narrative. It is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel can look imposing for the casual reader. However, the story is so wonderful and the writing is so enjoyable, that most people will rediscover this great book and realize why it is such a classic of American literature.The characters are \\"alive\\" for the reader. The Nolans are a family that could be any of us. Betty Smith must have felt these characters in her soul, because, they are that real! I tend to believe that Smith based these characters on her own personal experiences.Some moments of this novel will have you tearing up, some moments will have you cheering ( the christmas tree scene), and other moments will make you angry at the injustice that seemed so prevelant at the time.In this time of cultural excess and flomboyant bounty, it is a good reminder of how this country was at one time, not nearly so bountiful. When the \\"working class\\" lived in poverty. Much could be argued about the politics of the working class today, but we all have to admit that the \\"working class\\" of America is not living in the poverty and hard times of the early 1900's.This novel was a joy to read. I will recommend it to many others. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Set in the early 1900's, a tree grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is an old classic we should all revist. The reader continually finds him/herself cheering for the sterdy little girl who forms the main character of the book, Mary Frances Nolan.The book tells of the struggle of a typical family living in that time. It shows the poverty, the happiness, the utter love for the opportunity that America provides and the pride that first and second generation immigrants felt at being in America. Though Johnny Nolan, the witty, talented, drunk father of Francie, Smith shows how, even in poverty, a typical &quot;johnny&quot; enjoyed his freedom and opportunity in America. Johnny's conversation with Francie about the opportunity to drive a car if you could afford it (chapters 25-6), not based on who you were, shows the real love of the American dream of getting ahead on your own merit. Each such conversation is equally compelling and satisfying on the topic presented by Smith.Smith's portrayal of the relationships that Francie had with her mother, Katie, her aunts, Sissy and Eve, and, in particular, her brother Mealy, are so well defined and understood. Like Dickens, Smith, through these relationships and personalities, has the reader identifying smilar characters in their own life.A reader will really enjoy this classic and I would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"You can see, hear, and taste Brooklyn in the early 1900's while reading this book. I connected with Francie, the heroine, on the first page and loved her by the time I reached the end. I finished the book last night and must find a new book to fill the feeling of vacancy in my heart today. While it's pretty hard to impress me these days, this book made it onto my 'absolute favorite, must read list' of books...please don't miss this one."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It was with relish that I opened the book for the second reading of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It is one of those novels that you can read over and over and find some lovely detail that was missed before with each reading. This is the coming of age story of Francie Nolan and her family living in Brooklyn in the early 1900's. What is fascinating to me in addition to the story is the accruarate portrayal of life for the working class citizen at that time. Life was hard and could be physically and spiritually back breaking for the uneducated working class man or woman of that time. Betty Smith so beautifully captures this in her prose and observations about life. This may be so, because the author grew up in those very neighborhoods at about that time period.Francie is the daughter of John and Katie Nolan who grows up knowing that her father is an alcoholic and that her mother loves her brother Neely more. Although this is conveyed to the reader what you really see is the love Francie has for her parents despite their shortcomings. As a child she only sees the way her father sings and his poetic, dreamy view of the world. Francie admires the hard working ethic and coarse love and protectiveness of her mother. We meet her aunts and other neighborhood characters who add to the richness of the story and feel of authenticity of that time period. She views all of the secondary characters for what they are, flawed but worth loving. She is a dreamer who goes from being a little lonely girl with the ability to see lifes ugliness with a sense of wonder and joy to an accomplished woman who still maintains this ability. As the reader we are treated to life through Francie's eyes and that is truly a journey worth taking more than once."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is my favorite book now, and will be for a long time to come....it reminded me of Angela's Ashes (Frank McCourt), the story of a young woman against the world. I loved reading all the descriptions (glad I haven't lived them) and watching Francie's experiences to the end. She is a character that wasn't, and-shouldn't, be perfect but one to cheer for. READ THIS!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn starts slowly, but gradually pulls you into the mind of the wonderful Francie Nolan. And the other characters are great: Neeley, Katie, Johnny, Aunt Sissy, Evie, and the rest. What a heartwarming story! My favorite part is when Francie and Neeley talk about how their sister Laurie will be missing all the fun.This is a great book which you shouldn't miss!!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is a wonderful treat, with a very poignant message to anyone who reads it. I think it's the perfect book for any pre-teen girl, and the lessons it teaches will stay with you forever.Every young girl should have this in her collection, to reflect on, and to grow with."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is a real treasure. I don't think anyone who reads it and is a good reader will disagree. I'm sixteen and a real book freak- I read more than 20 books in a year- and I assure you, this is the best book I ever read in my whole life. Apart from being a light reading, it is a very strong and thought-provoking, inspiring novel- the kind that makes you happy and hopeful in a somber kind of way. When I finished it, I looked up and smiled and even my room seemed to brighten up. Step into the world of this young girl from Brooklyn, and you will find yourself there!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Betty Smith does a wonderful job of not only portraying people to the reader but also portraying thoughts and feelings. The characters were very well-developed through both the dialog and the narratives. Each action and word said by the characters seemed to fit them and make the reader understand the person a bit better, but at the same time it makes the individuals seem more confusing and complex. There was not a page in this book that didn't create a mental picture of the scene in my mind. Betty Smith depicted scenes and settings just enough for me to have a picture of it, but not so much that I got bored with the tedious descriptions. The fact that this story took place in the early 1900s made it much more appealing. It was interesting to learn about the Nolans' lives not only in poverty but in that specific time period. It is amazing how Francie, the main character, can overcome all the many obstacles working against her. It shows that the parents of a child really do make all the difference in how the child turns out. Francie's mother worked hard from the beginning to make her children's lives better than her own, and she succeeded. This book made me glad I lived in America where one can change his or her social status after birth. This novel proves that no one should ever give up. It illustrates that no matter where a person comes from, if they get an education and work hard enough, there is always a chance of success. This book is probably more interesting to women, but the occasional sensitive man would enjoy it too. Both teen-agers and adults can read this book and enjoy it to its full extent. No matter who you are, this book can open your eyes to something new."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved every page of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I finished all 483 pages in it in less then a week (which it really good for me.)! It's diffentetly a classic, and you don't know what your missing it you pass up to chance to read it. Through reading this book, it really made me thankful for all that I have and all that I take for granted it. It made me feel really blessed. I recommend this book to eveybody!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book as an assignment for my english class, but when i began to get further into it i was unable to drop the book. There were a variaty of themes, one was that you need both dreams and a practicalness to live a sucessful life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The story is naive, so naive that you long for it. It has no complex plot at all, its just as life actually is. And the characters are those that we are familiar with through our lives. In short it's a good and simple read. But then, you fall in love with it! Yu admire every little thing these beautiful people do to build up a life and a future. Francis is every child on earth, her mother is what is hidden in every women, the poor father is one of the most loveable characters in the history of fiction... read, laugh, cry, feel that you live.

Becasue they had so little small things brought them great joy. Francie Nolan is my hero."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is an incredibly amazing novel...which i believe is actually an autobiography of the author. In &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,&quot; the reader is taken through an incredible path of the main character, Francie Nolan's life. From the death of her father, to her assult in a dark hallway, to this amazing girl supporting herself into college, this book finely illustrates the transition from girl to woman. This story takes the reader back to a childs perspective, and also helps one to remember to take time to appreciate the smaller things in life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There have been many memoirs of sad and deprived childhoods on the market lately (most notably &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; by Frank McCourt, which is very good), but this magnificent novel is far superior to any of them. It is fiction, but it reads like a memoir and is told with an innocence that tugs at your heart.We come to identify very closely with the characters and their deprivations, and rejoice when they do, and sorrow when they do. It paints a picture of poverty in a city that had a booming economy that makes you feel guilty for having a comfortable home with plenty to eat. And yet it does not intend to be a confronting novel - it is easy to read and is truly entertaining and heart warming.It is one of the best books of its type, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the most realistic, well-written book that I have ever read.

Fantastic, superior, genuine, wonderful... it really is a masterpiece! I had to read this book for 7th Grade English Class (3 Chapters a night). Even though this was a lot to read a night, I truly enjoyed it. This really is a classic book and almost every adult you talk to will say they read it as a kid. Buy it today, it is worth the money, you will want to read it again and again. But, we also are in the process of watching the black &amp; white movie which is horrible and stops on chapter 36 when the BOOK ends on 56."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"i read this book when i was 11 years old.i am now,24, and although i keep reading excellent books ,before i fall asleep, i always read the one book that shaped and marked my childhood years for ever.and this book is called:&quot;a tree grows in brooklyn&quot;thank you,mrs betty smith.."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really enjoyed this book. i think that it is an emotionally heartwrenching story of a little girl named Francie Nolan. . It was a very moving and poignant novel, with every detail intact, it gives you a full description of events and it does not let you imagine a setting of your own. Betty Smith, the author, gives such a detailed introduction that there is not an absolution in how you want to imagine the setting. I think a reason why many people do not like this book from the beginning, are because of its length, and use of verbal effusion. She does use a lot of unnecessary descriptions followed by mindless bits and pieces of little information at odd times. Nevertheless, this is a great novel, of which there are very few, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. I do believe that the way this book composed, it cannot be a novel that is forced to be read in schools, for this reason, it is such a great novel that once you get an introduction of all the characters (a.k.a. the first hundred pages) it will want to make you read onward to see what happens to these beloved characters. One of the best things about this book is that it can be interpreted differently by each person who reads it. I love the way Betty Smith, the author, has used a tree that grows outside the Nolan house, to in a roundabout way portray the dramatic life that Francie had lived. It also shows the unconquerable vivacity that Francie Nolan possess. The usage of a tree to describe Francie's life is so intelligent and well thought up it makes you realize at the end of the story the significance of the tree that grows in Brooklyn. That tree is named Francis Nolan . DISCLAIMER: It was a long and arduous read, but in the end it is all worth it!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just finished reading this book for a class assignment. I loved it. I thought it was going to take me forever to read, but i was one of the first to finish. I can't see how anyone could hate a book like this.When I read this I felt like I was Francie. When se was happy, I was, when she was sad, I was. I felt so sad for her when I read that her mother did not love her as much as she did Neeley. Francie only had her dad to rely on for strength. Then he died. This book was so real. I can't say how much I loved it.

I figure, if they're classics, they must be good. Well, I was so right. I can read this book over and over and everytime I read it I love it. I like to picture life as it was in the early century, and this book showed me that it wasn't all fun and games and that everyone struggles. I cried when the father died becasue he seemed like such a hard worker and the entire family depended on him. The book is better then the movie and nothing ever made with the name attached will be better.

They suffered and worked so much with little reward. The ending is extremely heart warming! Anybody that doesn't read this book will be greatly deprived!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book when I was 13 and at that age, I related to Francie. As I grew older, I find myself relating to more that of Aunt Sissy and fianally Katie's. Aunt Sissy's &quot;love for men&quot; was a strength and a weakness. It was a strength with her relationship to Johnnie's that out of her love and compassion she gave him alcohol when he was drying out cold turkey as could not stand to see such sadness and suffering. It was also her compassion for others that allowed her to adopt an unwanted child which invaribly saved it's life as well as the mother's. There was no judgement nor moralization on Sissy's part. When I was younger, I didn't like the mother, Katie much, but now I understand the hardship she went through to provide for her family through it's setbacks. She lost some of the joie de vive, but in the end got what she truly deserved, a good reliable man to provide security and love. She married Johnny out of young immurity, but sadly paid the price. This book also gives great background of the New York Tamammy Hall political corruption of the time as a general feel of the firt 20 years of this century from the view of an every day working class family. I read this book every 12-18 months or so and always find something new. To this day, reading about how Francie received the graduation roses from he father posthoumously, I cry. It is touching to know of an example of how love reaches through even death to reach another through Aunt Sissy's compassion."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a book that deserves to be read by all.

Betty Smith's style of writing is very detailed and her book shows us what literature was made to be. Young Francie deals with deaths, losses, and school. A poor girl, she is captivated by anything. I highly recommend this book for preteens, as not all of the material is appropriate and understandable for young children. Francie, as a young girl deals with much.

The story follows her through her life, with all the ups and downs included, until she is at the age of twenty and off to college. A wonderful long read, I think that a girl would like it more than a boy would. Some material may be inappropriate, so I recommend an age minimum of 9 or 10. If you like this book, which is almost a sure bet, look for Betty Smith's other book, Joy in the Morning."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this book is a must read for anyone working with children. both heartwarming and heartbreaking, this compelling novel will encourage empathy in the most indifferent reader."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for a school summer assignment and loved it!

I listened to it in the car and it held my interest all the way through. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A friend recommended this novel since I enjoy historical fiction. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn follows the path of a turn of the 20th century family in Brooklyn. Although Ms. Smith wrote the book in the 1940s, its message is timeless. The reader watches as the central character, Francie, grows up determined to have a better life for herself. Francie is 2nd generation American who comes from a working class neighborhood of Brooklyn.Francie adores her Irish father who does not have steady work and often comes home drunk. Her father loves Francie dearly and encourages her to dream and to become a writer. He even supports her efforts to go to a better school despite the distance the school is from their home.Francie's mother, Katie, works hard and long as a housekeeper and keeps the family together. Katie recognizes the value of education and reads to her children from the Bible and Shakespere nightly. She also encourages their imagination. When the family moved into a house with a piano, Katie had the children sit with her during lessons so that they all could learn to play since the family could hardly afford lessons for one.Francie is very close to her brother, one year her junior, who is also pushed to achieve more than what the parents have been able to do.While money is always tight, the family always has a roof over their heads and usually they have food. Francie's maternal grandmother and aunts add to the moral fabric and are there to support the family when needed.There is conflict between having the children work so that the family can survive vs. allowing them to focus on education. Francie and her brother are able to do both, but the logic that Katie uses when forced to choose was not intuitive, but the right choice.What I loved about the book is that it showed how the children grew up with very little material things. Another message is to look at everything around you with the attitude as if it was the first or last time that you have seen such things. Recognize beauty of which it beholds and you will live a much for fulfilled and hopeful life. Sure, the children had conflicts with their parents, but in the end, they recognized how important their relationship was with each other and that having money didn't equate to having happiness. It is a wonderful, timeless, coming of age story that should be required reading for today's youth."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Brilliant book! I'm so glad I finally got around to reading it, as it has been on my \\"to-read list\\" for years. Definitely worth it. Anyone who enjoyed Scout Finch's character in To Kill a Mockingbird would especially appreciate Francie Nolan's character. I found some original and new reviews of this books and wanted to share them:[...]. I was drawn into the original reviews, especially after reading Betty Smith's quote: \\"I, Betty Smith, wrote a novel. I had no axe to grind. I just wanted to write, but it seems I didn't know my own strength.\\""},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"What a great book. I enjoyed the character development, and the author definitely kept me interested. Read this and become a fan also."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" by Betty Smith is a story about the average American Dream. Critics have called in a \\"coming-of-age novel\\" but when it is looked into further, this novel is really a story about pride. It is about family pride and personal pride. It is also about instilling pride in the younger generations. Too often children are spoiled and told the beautiful parts of life, but Katie Nolan knew better. As the mother of two children Francie and Neeley, she made a point to show them the hardships in life while still giving them happiness in the little things. For instance, coffee was given to the entire household as a supper drink. When Francie decided she didn't want her coffee during supper she was allowed to pour the remains into the sink. For the Nolan family, this seemed to be the exact worst thing to do. The Nolans were extremely poor and barely had enough to keep everyone in warm clothes during the winter. Johnny Nolan, the head of the household and Francie's father often drank his tips as a singing-waiter away leaving only his meager pay to bring home. However, allowing Francie to throw away her coffee gave her the feeling of being rich and proud and Katie knew well enough that if Francie wasn't proud of herself, then no one else would be proud of her.Katie wasn't the only person who wanted to instill pride in her family. Katie's mother, Mary Rommely, gave Katie the secret to raising children. She said first Katie must own land. Katie was to make a tin can bank and every day add a little bit of money to the bank until she had enough to buy a plot of land. Then she must read to her children, one page of the Bible and one page of Shakespeare and as her children grew and learned to read on their own, they would take the role of reading one page each every night. Lastly, Katie was told to instill a sense of imagination in her children by reading them stories of fairies and elves etc. At first, Katie was skeptical of her mother's advice but soon realized that Mary's advice was only to help the children remain proud of where they are from and where they are going.While the fairy tales did not last long for the Nolan family, the mystery surrounding Santa Claus and elves gave Francie the love of stories and books. She went to the library every day and checked out every book she could. Her goal was to read every book in the library. The land ownership gave pride to the entire family. Unfortunately, the land that the Nolan family would finally own was the burial plot of Johnny Nolan who died of alcoholism. Johnny's death affected young Francie the greatest because of their close relationship. Francie was \\"daddy's little girl\\". The reading of Shakespeare and the Bible was the beginning of Francie's love affair for books and her yearning for an education. Education was what would give her pride in herself. Especially after Johnny's death, it was difficult for both Francie and Neeley to stay in school past the eighth grade but because Francie pushed herself and wanted to get a good education, she made it to college ending the novel with the new young woman proud of where she was from but even more excited about where she was going.Betty Smith used the hardships of early 1900's Brooklyn to tell a story of pride and youth. It is probably one of the most influential novels in America today and will continue to influence future generations."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story stays with you, it is inspiring and grounding, so beautifully written, a must read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Many of us read about Francie Nolan and her life 100 years ago growing up poor in Brooklyn when we were young ourselves. Try it now as an adult. Although the writing is at times a little stilted and too often we are told things instead of shown them, the spirit of Francie and her practical and hardworking mother and her dreamer of a never-do-well father comes through. Some scenes are absolutely delightful: Papa taking Francie and her brother on a fishing trip or Aunt Sissy finally finding a way to get herself a baby. Other parts are poignant beyond words: Six-year-old Francie having to take her younger brother for their vaccinations before starting school or Francie finding that she must work instead of going to high school."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was in very good condition and I received it in a very timely manner."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am more than satisfied with my purchase.

History of turn of the century Brooklyn unfolds before our eyes. But this is more than that, it is the story of a family, a very real, flawed family. This in not a sit-com family, where everyone is happy all the time and the biggest choice is what to wear to the prom. This is a gritty reality, sometimes good, sometimes terrible. I was unhappy when the story ended, loving the characters too much, but I was also glad that the author ended it when she did, not dragging out the tale too long. She left me wanting more, which is the best I can ask of any character. Actually, it seems hard to think of these as characters, they seem like real people."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Though this book was a little long in places, I loved it. I'm not even half-way through and I have to be yelled at to STOP reading. What thirteen year old can say THAT? I loved the book, felt as though I was Francie.

It may be a little too much for younger readers, although I would accept the challenge. I love this book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I love this book with all my heart. It is right next to my bed every night along with my Bible. I can never get enough of young Francie Nolan. It shows how much we really need to survive. Most of us are living in luxury, but I would rather be Francie any day. She had the love of her father and the soul of her mother to survive on and nothing else. She didn't need the money to be happy, she was content and taken by the world around her. I think if more people in this world took time to look at their surroundings, and acknowledge their worth it would be a much happier place. Francie really knew the secret of life. She knew that &quot;This too shall pass.&quot; In the end, we are all survivers of the biggest game. Life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I could not put this book down!

Not only does it make you stop and think about your life differently, but it makes you appreciate what objects you have.

The next page was missing and was clearly printed that way, not torn out. I flipped through the next few pages and realized that pages were put together all mixed up, so I've had to flip around to keep reading. It's very annoying and confusing. The publisher is Harper Collins. They should be ashamed of themselves. This book is a classic. Get the book, just not this printing."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Engrossing and timeless, if you want to time travel for a few days into Brooklyn a hundred years ago, read this book. My only caveat is that, like most coming-of-age novels, the character goes through a period where she is struggling to decide what she believes about God. She decides that she doesn't believe, and the scene where she decides is compelling... In fact, it's as if the entire book, her entire life, leads up to the point where she decides that there really is no God, but \\"life\\" and \\"beauty\\" and \\"education\\" and \\"love\\" are all good enough for her. It's anti-climactic when you know that those things really AREN'T worth it. Those things disappoint. Those things fail. Those things vanish away... Too sad, really to know that there are plenty of people who also have come to that same conclusion in life, and the beautiful stories that could have been told end in darkness and as much hopelessness as they began.Sorry for completely ruining the novel for you.

I would recommend it to any one"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My school English group had to read this book for a project. This book is a classic literature book about a girl named Francie growing up in the Brooklyn slums in the early 20th century. The novel provides a really shocking view of hardships that grip the lower class, even today. From a suburban middle-class teenager point of view, it was a really in depth and profound story. But, everybody including myself in the group, had a difficult time reading this. Though we were allowed to choose from a wide variety of novels, we were drawn to this particular one. But, we found the story too long, not interesting enough for our age group, and it had too many dry spells without really appealing action. Until you get to the 22nd chapter, events don't seem to move along quickly enough. Though there are quite a bit of attention-grabbing scenes that some parents might call inappropriate (mention of condoms, vulgar language, etc.), those were the most interesting to my group. For parents or adults that are considering giving this book to a young adult, make sure that they like history, long novels, and are interested in social problems effecting the world. More forward-thinking teens that are interested in more &quot;sociable&quot; subjects may not like this particular book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am writing a review on the book, Maggie-Now, by Betty Smith. I have yet to read A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, but I am excited to do so. I could not stop thinking of the Moore family characters and how real they seemed. The values and the traditions of the day were so important then, I feel sad that there is a lack of tradition and heritage in America today. It grieves me so that I really do not know much about my family history and wonder if others feel as I do. This book made me laugh, cry and wonder. It truly deserves the time and effort to read. I looked at my own children differently and dreamed their dreams through their eyes. Wondering if that spunk of my middle child was the Irish in her, or thinking of my maiden name and wondering what my English ancestors were like and how they came to America, what did they do for work, were they poor like the Moores, having to take in laundry or sweep a street? So many questions I have now, because I picked this old book out of a closet, dusted off the cover and opened my mind to the past of all of us. The characters are believable, the vivid detail of the late 1800,s and early 1900,s was depicted effortlessly, and humor and pain will engulf you. The flavor of heritage and tradition flows throughout the book and takes you back to a time you may have never lived in, but one in which you are strangely familiar. The characters felt like family. Already I was lonely and missing them when I read the last page and had to close the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. As a young girl, I could relate to Francie and loved every word of the book. It is filled with adventure and joy, sadness and excitement. This is definetly the best book I have ever read. READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I agree, is an excellent book. However, it does not have much action. It seems like the author keeps telling the same thing over and over: Francie Nolan and her family are poor and have to do whatever they can to survive.Throughout about 3/4 of the story, Francie experiences being poor and growing up in Brooklyn, doing whatever she can to live a successful life. Near the end, she finally starts to become more independent and learn more about the real world.This story took me a long time to read, probably because the first 3/4 of the book are so slow. I would reccommend this book, but have patience, because it doesn't get very good until the end."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The book arrived in a timely fashion. It is in very good condition with only minor stains on the edges of the pages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I thought that &quot;A Tree grows in Brooklyn&quot; was a very well written book. Yet, I am a boy, and the sort of topics hand-picked by Smith didn't appeal to me. This was issued to me through the summer reading program at my high school. Being dissapointed with the previously picked &quot;Anne Frank&quot;, I figured this would be the typical, mushy, girl book. Yet it was very moving and kept me reading. If you like this, I would recommend anything about the Great Depression. See ya!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A fine book. An interesting book. But hardly one that I would single out for highest praise. Why not try &quot;Anne of Green Gables,&quot; &quot;Harriet the Spy,&quot; &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot; or &quot;From the Mixed Up Files...&quot; instead?"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel tells a story: a can't put it down, page turning story. However, evaluations of this novel as a five star work, or &quot;masterpiece&quot;, may lead prospective readers to believe that superlative literary technique is involved. Certainly it is a stunning work, something of a period piece (and enlightening in that respect), and it is an emotionally moving story. But it is a story that is told from a variety of viewpoints that are not clearly developed nor developed through inventive or identifiable technique. This limited criticism gains in perspective through contrast: whereas Toni Morrison may shift perspectives in many of her works, engage magical realism, and countless other techniques, Smith shifts without the clearly conscious development (requisite?) that an author such as Morrison employs. Smith, as authoress, speaks and speaks again interupting the voice of character and relating stories that develop the story -- punctuating the novel as story -- a very good story. The story that the novel tells is well structured and believable, replete with conditions and experiences of a protagonist that unviersally invite readers to recognize character-building truths within realistic parameters that resonate throughout the pending turn of the century. The foundations for empathy are believably developed and it is a page turning read. For these reasons, the work maintains the status of a &quot;beloved&quot; work, but in all fairness it reads as an incomplete work of &quot;literature (of the highest rank)&quot;."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"While Betty Smith's A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN will never rival Henry Roth's CALL IT SLEEP for so-called high-brow literature, the two books have something in common: pluck. In the eminently readable A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, Smith shows it to us in the Nolans--a half Irish-, half Austrian-American family at home(s) in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In CALL IT SLEEP, Roth uses stream-of-consciousness alongside narrative descriptions of squalor and depravity on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to show us--if you'll allow a clunky metaphor--an alternative definition of pluck: namely, \\"the heart, liver, windpipe and lungs of a slaughtered animal\\" (American Heritage Dictionary).Is it fair to say that one novel is better than the other, that one writer is more accomplished than the other? I think it is. Henry Roth wins hands down.If Roth's novel deals with depravity, Smith's deals with deprivation. The difference between Roth's David Schearl (the beaten young \\"hero\\" of CALL IT SLEEP) and Smith's Francie Nolan (the coming-of-age heroine of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN) is no less than that between resignation and hope. On Manhattan's Lower East Side in the first two decades of the last century, 'hope' would've been a cynical sluice to the East River and its pollutants. In the Williamsburg ghetto of the same period, 'hope' would've been the only dyke keeping that same river and its pollutants at bay. Hope, for the heroes of both stories, is just a well-appreciated resting place along the way to resignation.If there's any similarity between the two novels, it's to be found in Chapter 43 of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN. This--at least to *my* way of thinking--is where Betty Smith's prose shines with a brilliance equal to Roth's.Why, then, would I here suggest that Roth is the better writer? In deciding upon the virtues of the harp or the lyre versus the trombone or the tuba, first consider the player--as much the reviewer as the author. I find that Roth takes me deeper into his characters and into their immediate circumstances while Smith tweaks me as a reader. For my money, she's a bit too heavy-handed in jerking the obvious tear.Would I read either or both once again? Unequivocally, yes. I've already read CALL IT SLEEP twice. I may one day invest in a second reading of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN.If, in a word or two, I had to characterize the two novels, I'd say that CALL IT SLEEP stretches the brain cells while A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN tugs at the heart strings. Either way, you can't lose. But what do *I* know? CALL IT SLEEP had to wait thirty years to find an appreciable (and appreciative) audience; meanwhile, A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN was an instant success. Is there a more fitting--and telling--tribute to the American myth? Ms. Smith, meet Mr. Horatio Alger."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"If you want to read about a hard working family who gets through tough times, read &quot;A tree grows in Brooklyn &quot;, by Betty Smith. Imagine you have a father who you love more than anyone in the world, but who drinks to much and uses all of his money for liquor. How would you feel if you had a father who was addicted to liquor? This book gives the reader an idea of how hard life would be growing up with a dad who drinks and a mother who works so hard to get money and help the family have a better life.Other characters in &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; have hard lives. The main character is Francie. The book tells the story of her life growing up in Brooklyn. Francie is a smart girl who likes to read and write. She lives with her mother and father and brother. Her parents married when they were very young. Her dad,Johnny ,drinks all the time. He loves his family but isn't happy. He is not happy because he didn't have enough education. He dreams all the time but it doesn't come true. Francie's mom works very hard because she wants Francie and Neely to have a better life than she did. Francie's Aunt Sissy loves her very much and hangs out with her when Francie's mom is busy.I really thought this was an interesting book. I thought it was interesting to learn about how different their lives were compared to mine. I learned so much about what life was like in the early 1900's.They wore different clothes and played different games. When I read this book I really wanted to know what happened to the characters. I would recommend it to readers who like books about hard lives. I would recommend &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; to girls over twelve years old."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I only started reading this book because it was required for my English class. The first 70 or so pages were very hard to get into but once I hit 100 I couldn't put it down! There are amazing characters in this book and when it ends you wish there was a sequel. I've read it twice in 3 years and will read it again in years to come."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Every so often I find a story that is so authentic in the revealing of its characters, that I find myself wondering about them when I'm finished. &quot;How is Francie?&quot; I think to myself...&quot;Is Katie happy?&quot; I wonder...&quot;Does Neely sing just like his father?&quot;...as if they are real, and their lives continued somewhere in the cosmos after I finished the last page. This is one such book. Although I found the everyday drudgery of the Nolans just trying to survive a bit tiring, I would often chastise myself with the thought that &quot;This is very real for many people, even today...&quot; The crisis of poverty and hunger remains with us, and I was struck by my own frivolity as I watched the Nolans struggle to save every single penny. I wonder if I had read this book at a younger age, would my lifestyle have been any different? It is well worth the occasional struggle to complete this novel...for I believe it will impact you internally."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith takes us back to the early 1900's (1912) where Francie Nolan grows up in Brooklyn in abject poverty. Her mother, who loves Francie's brother, Neely, better, works to support the family, while their endearing yet alcoholic father staggers though Francie's early life, giving her more support through out his weak life, than her mother's strength, because he truly loves her. To me, this is an amazing story of true life in the early 1900's among emigrants and others, like Francie's family, who consider themselves true &quot;American's&quot;, because her parents were born in America, making Francie the only one in her class in school &quot;a true American&quot;. Hard to find a great deal of humor, but easy to find an amazing family story as good today as when it was published. I recommend this to everyone and plan to make sure my grandchildren read it - hopefully with me- to explain a generation they cannot imagine, but certainly did exist (and probably still does)."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I would probably pick A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as one of the greatest books of this century. Yeah, I know Ulysses was chosen as number 1 but those guys who picked the best books of the 20th century don't know what their missing. This book has everything, you will fall in love with Franci Nolan and her family. Its realistic about poverty but not quite as depressingly repetitive as Angela's Ashes(I liked AA but A Tree Grows in brooklyn is much better) This is one of those books where you escape into the world of the characters and become best friends with the main character. I could read this book over and over again and not get bored, its a remarkable book and I recommend it to everyone who would like to be introduced to a wonderful book that they can treasure forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book along with my class and my language teacher in the seventh grade. This is one of the best-written books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. This isn't a book for short-story readers and it's definitely not one for fairytale readers. This book gives a vivid, firsthand account of a young girl growing up in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn, and it deals with all aspects of society, no matter how shocking or taboo they may normally seem. This book describes literally ever aspect of this young girl's life, and I think that the author should be praised for examining the issues that she did and presenting them without the silver lining that isn't there in real life. This is a wonderful book for fans of history and especially for fans of good literature. Books like this one don't come along very often, and if you haven't read it then you're missing a great work of literature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been on my \\"to read\\" list since girlhood, but I never got around to it, until this week, at age 29. Now I almost cannot believe I lived so long without reading it. Smith's novel is a written masterpiece of storytelling, characterization, and narration. Never have I so longed to be back in college with a professor and fellow English majors, to be sure I hadn't overlooked a single morsel of a book. Though Smith writes in the third person, it IS \\"Francie's book\\" and the narrator describes the world beautifully through her eyes. Over and over, a single, simple sentence expressing a fleeting, naive thought by young Francie manages to make more of a poignant and sometimes humorous social commentary than what other authors might take entire chapters to describe. As Francie grows, so does the narration-- becoming more direct, less naive, and more self-aware. Francie is one of the most lovingly drawn and memorable characters I've ever encountered-- she is a timeless picture of every curious young girl who has ever grown up in a poor family, dreaming of more, working hard in school and writing her way to a better life. A century later, I know that I was that girl, and thousands of other women over time have been \\"that girl,\\" yet Francie manages at the same time to be both every-girl and a unique little jewel all her own. Smith's book not only provides an intriguing description of life of the American urban poor at the turn of the century, but also grapples with social issues still existing in modern America. This is a book to be read over and over; even while reading it, I was aware of how much I was missing by not pausing to relish and deconstruct particular passages. However, it is also a novel so well-written and so packed with life that it deserves to be savored between readings. So, as I finished the book, I had to stop myself from turning back to page 1 and starting again-- at least for a while."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I first read this book over twenty years ago and to this day, I think about the characters often, comparing their struggles to those I have experienced in my own life. I recommend this book to anyone who will listen. If this book touches you the way it has touched me, it will stay with you forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"They call it \\"a green umbrella\\", they call it \\"the tree that lived,\\", they call it \\"Annie,\\" this tree is no ordinary tree, it's a pet, it lived, through all the chopping down, and through all the fires, this tree lived. When Francie was 11 years old this tree was only 2 stories high, but it seemed that as Francie grew, it grew too. Betty Smith explains poverty of the 1910's in Brooklyn, in her book \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". She describes the protagonist (Francie Nolan) as caring, loving, and creative. Betty explains Francie's life from her childhood days to her 15th birthday. Ever scince she was a child, Francie has loved to read. From her first glance at \\"If I Were King,\\" to her job at the Press Clipping office, Francie has demonstrated her creativity and love for reading and writing. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is split into 5 books. Book One, explains the childhood life of Francie and Neely Nolan. It explains how Francie loves the library. Book Two explains how Katie Rommely and Johnny Nolan (parents of Francie and Neeley) first met. Book Three is the longest and explains Francie school life. She changes schools in the middle. In this book her mother saves her from a murderer. Book Four and Book Five go on to explain Francie's life from ages 13-15 and how she gets a job. It's a very good book. Outstandingly written, and explains 1910's poverty life very well."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I only recently got around to reading Betty Smith's 1943 memoir-cum-novel A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, mainly because it had a reputation as an Oprah Winfrey sort of book, meaning I thought it must be one of those tomes filled with good intentions but short on literary merit. After all, the first mention of it I can recall was a snide comment in an old Bugs Bunny cartoon from the 1940s. Boy, do I love to be wrong about things like this. The novel is a total masterpiece. At almost 500 hundred pages there is not a thing I'd cut- not a chapter, paragraph, sentence, nor word. It is a work of fiction the equal of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, and some other great works like John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath, Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, Charles Johnson's Oxherding Tale, and the best of Kurt Vonnegut and William Kennedy. In fact, it might be the best of the bunch.In fact, it's more than great literature. It personally resonates with me because its depth and narrative immersion in a bygone world rivals that of the best of memoirs, including my own True Life series. I include it, now, along with Walt Whitman's Leaves Of Grass, Alex Haley's The Autobiography Of Malcolm X, Leonard Shlain's Art And Physics, Loren Eiseley's autobiography All The Strange Hours, and Terry Matheson's Alien Abductions, as the most personally influential and resonant books I have read. Aside from that it is a perfect example of what the publishing industry used to do right versus what it does wrong now.In many ways ATGIB is a very similar story to 1996's Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt. The later book follows a poor Irish American boy who will grow up to be a writer for his first nineteen or so years, while this book chronicles a poor Irish-German American girl who will grow up to be a writer for her first sixteen or so years. AA is set three decades later and the family goes from America to Ireland, and then Frankie goes back to America, while Francie Nolan remains in Brooklyn, until heading off for college at novel's end. Both books feature strong mothers who endure alcoholic husbands, and both books have colorful families to sketch, as well as great poverty, but ATGIB is a far superior book to AA. Primarily this has to do with editing. AA is a 450 page book that could have been 300 pages, and included far more. But, in it, McCourt tends to ramble on far too much, and recount far too similar stories, with the effect of boring you. His book revels in suffering for suffering's sake. ATGIB, was submitted as a memoir, but the editor urged Smith to make it a novel, which helped her flesh out the characters and smooth over rough spots. It worked, for ATGIB is a compelling, poetic, and multifarious work, where AA is a spotty work of unrealized potential. I submit these two books as Exhibits A and B in the case of poor editing for most current books' being so poorly written, rather than just bad writers.The book ends with Katie Nolan accepting a marriage proposal from a retired police sergeant and widower who has long been enamored with her. He offers to adopt Francie's youngest sister Annie Laurie and to send Neeley and Francie to college. Francie readies to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan to attend the University of Michigan. As she stops past her old apartment building she sees the cut down but still growing Tree Of Heaven resprouting in the tenement yard. She sees a small girl named Florrie Wendy, for whom the tree will also come to represent something, just as it must have represented something to her older neighbor girl Flossie Gaddis before her. That all three girls have names that start with F is not coincidental. That the tree that is chosen as the titular tree is a nondescript tree is all the more apt. It is, along with Melville's white whale, one of the greatest metaphors in fiction. Yet, even as the book ends the reader wants to know more of what will happen in Francie's life, even though none doubts she will perdure.I am eager to read other of Smith's novels, to see if this was merely part of a continuum, or some great work that rose far beyond any other in her oeuvre. The scenes she so deftly set in A Tree Grows In Brooklyn are indelible, and even if her other works are not on par, this book alone is one of those near-miraculous things that justifies the 99.9% of bad arts being out there. Now, back to the crap!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree grows in Brooklyn is a rare jewel. I fell in love with this book at age twelve, and have read it maybe one hundred times since (and i am not all that old) I am an avid reader, and usally finish five books a week. But the first time I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, something changed. It broke my heart while filling me with pure joy. I never cry at the end of books, but the last page of my copy is stained from all the years of reading and loving. I love it so much that sometimes when I get to the end, I flip to the first page, because I never wanted to hear the end of Francie Nolan.A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a book about life. Nothing more. It fills you with a love and a saddness that almost no other books can. This is my favorite book, and as a huge reader and an editor of a literary magazine that is not said lightly. The ideas posed in this book will stick with you until your death, and maybe longer. You will never forget Francie Nolan.This book deserves much more than I can say. This book is amazing feeling, and maybe not more than that. Nothing really happens in this book, and that is perhaps the beauty of this book. If you read nothing else, read this book. I know you'll love it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was required reading by a Jewish teacher in my 8th grade English class, in Brooklyn. Being a know-it-all Black girl from Brooklyn, I never wanted to read it because I thought I knew it all. Fast forward 10+ years and I finally read the book as a semi-adult. Fast forward 10+ more years and I read it AT LEAST twice a year. This is, in my opinion, the best book for any young woman to read, EVER. It made me read everything else that Betty Smith wrote. It makes me check my local library's supply to make sure they have adequate copies for other young (or older, wiser) girls to read. I have searched and found a 1st printing of the book and I hold it more dearly that my most profound treasure. I would suggest this book to anyone that can read. It will surely teach you something about love, sacrifice and the complexity of the human heart. It is full of romantic love, child-parent love, hopes, dreams, fears, innocence, everything! I recently purchased the movie and I've watched it at least 15 times already. This is a really good book. Oprah thinks so too; she lists it as one of the few books that changed her life. I wholeheartedly agree."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Bad News in BrooklynFrancie Nolan is the kind of person that lives life to the fullest, no matter what the circumstances are. Francie is a poor Brooklyn girl, living in the early 1900's. She has many struggles to overcome, and few opportunities. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a fiction novel by Betty Smith, is about the battles Francie and her family have to win in order to rise above poverty.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is essentially a biography about Francie Nolan, the fictional heroine in this novel. Francie is an intelligent and determined girl. She is a wonderful writer, and has planned to read every single book in her local library. Unfortunately, though, Francie's life is anything but perfect. Her dad is a singing waiter, and he is addicted to alcohol. Therefore, he doesn't bring home a lot of money, so Francie, her mom, younger brother, and dad, all have to live off of only a couple dollars a week. In order to survive, Francie will have to work hard, and get a job to support her family.In this novel, Betty Smith describes in detail all of the characters' personalities, which helps the reader better understand their actions. She also describes the time period very well, so it feels as if you're actually living back then.I really enjoyed this book because it opened my eyes to how different this country was, just less than a century ago. Few people back then were well educated, and some were even illiterate. It also made me see how difficult life is as an immigrant. Francie has to grow up living through all of these hardships.I would recommend this book mostly to girls, ages 12 to 15. Anyone who enjoys reading fiction or historical fiction , or who liked Number the Stars by Lois Lowry, is sure to love A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a book I read over and over as a child. I so identified with Francie, the dreamer and eager reader, observing her surroundings as an outsider having trouble fitting in. I loved and savored the detailed descriptions of Francie's routines and rituals of junk selling, little treats, and books devoured on the fire escape. The world of turn of the century tenements seemed like a wonderful place, and the family's ability to make something from nothing was marvelous.Returning to the book as an adult I found new pleasures in the parts I'd skimmed or barely understood as a kid--the drama of the adult relationships of Katie Nolan and her husband, and Katie's sisters Evie and Sissy. Instead of Francie's impatience with her mother, I sympathized with Katie's point of view and saw the grinding poverty without the innocence of Francie's viewpoint. I was amazed anew at the vitality and resourcefulness of the characters.Recently I listened to the audio version of the book, read by Kate Burton. I rediscovered the story yet again, finding parts I'd forgotten in the ten or so years since last re-reading it and anticipating the parts I remembered. In having it read to me I enjoyed it all over, with the addition of Ms. Burton's talent for accents and the dialogue.If you have never read this book, read it. If you read it long ago as a kid, check it out again--I guarantee you'll find fascinating new dimensions to the story. If you've read it a dozen times, you will still find it worthwhile to spend a little more time with this old friend. I know I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which is similar to Angela's Ashes, is a great book. Not only is it very personal and emotional, but it also is a reflection on a society. At times it can be so horribley honest; the descriptions are very blunt. Through the experiences of Francie and many other characters, we get a picture of what life was at that time and place. Francie is surrounded by ignorance and poverty. Some of the scenes she witnesses are not very pleasent (for example, the women who gang up on the girl who has a baby and throw rocks at her). But through it all, Francie manages to have a good time. On the last page of the book, i wanted to cry, which says a lot because i NEVER cry in books."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very, very great book. I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to read it. I mean it has everything: romance, fun, adventure, sad stuff, down-to-earth characters, or whatever else you might be looking for. But really, this story one you read and then forget about. It really stays with you and makes you look at life in a different way. I know that I am a different person after reading this book.Anyway, now that I told you how truly wonderful this book was, here's a summary: This book is mainly about Francie Nolan, an eleven year old girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn, New York. The book goes all the way up until like she's seventeen and the author does a good job of showing in an indirect way just how hard her life is. Sometimes her family doesn't even have enough to eat, and instead of going to high-school, Francie has to go get a job. Plus she has to deal with many problems in her family.I loved this book because of Francie's courage and strength and because the author knocked down the typical stereotypes about people living in slums. But what I really should have just said along time ago is you should just read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn instead of this corny review that lasted way too long."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I don't know how many times I've read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. My parents had a copy in the house where I grew up in Queens, and it was among the books I read again and again as a young teen. Perhaps that was because it was about a young girl growing up in New York, perhaps it was because it was among the few books (in the ramshackle, eclectic collection of my parents' house, which a friend once described as \\"decorated in Late Brooklyn Depression\\") that was clearly about the joys of being a kid. But I think it was really a lot more than that.The movies they made from this book are TERRIBLE, or at least they don't reflect any of the magic I found here, so please don't let them set your expectations.What Smith did so well -- and why this book has remained a classic -- is show the shabbiness and the innocence, simultaneously. The story, which you probably know is about Francie Nolan and her family in Brooklyn's tenement neighborhoods from the early 1900s, treats the poor with respect but without romanticism. It's nostalgic for the joys that children find -- in the flowers at a library checkout counter, in the opportunity to choose the best candy from the penny store -- without painting such a rosy glow that you ever want to go back there.Another reason that this book works so incredibly well is the author's marvelous ability to show each main character's viewpoint. Francie and her mother argue; instead of showing just Francie's side, you also know exactly what is going through Katie's mother's mind, and you know that BOTH of them are right. That's an important message, especially for teenagers, and I distinctly remember deciding to adopt some of the attitudes I saw in this book. How many books did you read as a child that had that kind of influence on you?Smith never shied away from issues of sex and drink, either, so if you're considering this book as a present for a child of, say, under ten, you might want to read through it first yourself. (Not that this will be a hardship; I just re-read it last night, at the grand old age of 48, and I obviously still love this book.)On the other hand, this might be a good book for a pre-teen, as the sex and substance abuse are treated with clear eyes and a kind heart. If you want to talk to kids about the choices that people make (\\"Could Francie's father have stopped drinking?\\" you might ask the kid), this would be a great vehicle for doing so.But heck -- you don't have to get that serious about it. This is a great story, wonderfully written, and the time-and-place comes alive."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Hello! ...I've read most of the reviews on here.

The economy is also discussed, with details on the depressions and deflations, plus several graphs and statistical tables.It is very well written, easy to read and has complete references.I have 7 pages of typed notes from this book, which is much more than the average for this type book. From my notes:\\"A coal mine may exist in the United States not 10 miles from valuable ores of iron and other materials and both be useless until a canal is established between them, as the price of land carriage is too great to be borne by either.\\" \\"A ton of goods could be brought 3000 miles from Europe for about $9, but for that same sum it could be moved only 30 miles in this country\\". U.S. Senate Committee (1816) American State Papers: Misc II (1834)p 287A ton mile cost 30-70 cents between 1800 and 1819. Robert Fulton (1814) stated the usual cost of wagonage as 32 cents/ton mile. Transportation cost of wheat to Philadelphia equaled it's value at 218 miles. Or corn at 135 miles. 1819-22 wagon rates fell. Were as low as 12 cents /ton mile in 1822. The deflation of 1819-21 was one of the most drastic in history and caused partly by transportation costs. p-133Only 100 miles of canals were built by 1816. Only 3 in operation were longer than 2 miles. By 1840 there were 3326 miles of canals. Most canals were built from 1824-40, with spending of $125 million. p-32Excellent turnpikes cost $5,000-10,000 per mile. Canals typically cost $20,000-30,000 per mile. p-53Plank roads cost $1,500-1,800 /mi.

It was incredible how much information was packed into the book. I totally disagree with the editorial regarding this book. It is not over cluttered and the title is not offensive when you consider the book is telling a child how he or she would have lived as an American Indian from the climate, to what you'd eat, to what was inside the teepee and exactly how it was made. Also included how and when the American Indians migrated to North America from Asia, why and how they moved to survive, what a buffalo hunt was like and even their arts and crafts. It should be noted that the book concentrates on the Plains Indians. I spent about an hour researching childrens books at the bookstores and this was by far the most informative and best presented. My son was not at all interested in the American Indians, but after studying this book wanted to go back in time and live as they were when they roamed freely. Our family is proud of its American Indian ancestry, and this book did it justice. EXCELLENT!

You'll learn all about inmates like Al &quot;Scarface&quot; Capone, George &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly, and &quot;The Birdman&quot; Robert Stroud. While the essay is quite informative, this book's real strength is in all the pictures that it contains. Ever page has black and white pictures depicting prison life on Alcatraz. By looking at these pictures you'll get a very good idea about the prison cells, watch towers, officers' living quarters, and the kinds of activities the prisoners engaged in to pass the time.This is an excellent reference book for information about Alcatraz.

This mystery is set in and around the coastal town of Larchmont, Georgia. The boys start out trying to help a man accused of libel, and end up getting involved in a hidden treasure, secret passages, mysterious characters, and a monster. Of course, there is also the central mystery of the hidden harbor.Bart Worth is the publisher of the Larchmont Record, a newspaper. Bart wrote a story about Samuel Blackstone. The story was carefully written and completely factual. However, after the story was set in type, remembering that this story was updated in 1961 and computer publishing was many years in future, someone added a rumor that the Blackstone fortune was obtained from smuggling. Samuel Blackstone was in the process of suing Bart for libel, and Bart was requesting help from the Hardys to either find the person responsible for changing the article, or find information about the Blackstone family to prove that they had started their fortune based on smuggling.The boys once again have jumped into the thick of a complicated mystery. Samuel Blackstone's brother, Ruel Rand, lives on property adjacent to Samuel's. It appears to the boys that either Samuel or Ruel is out to hurt the other brother as each is attacked. Added to the mystery is the disappearance of a seamstress and a butler. The boys also learn that the pond between the Blackstone and the Rand estates is rumored to have a treasure associated with it, a treasure that can be found at the hidden harbor.As the boys continue their investigation, they learn that others are involved in the apparent plot between Blackstone and Rand. It seems these other characters may be working for Blackstone, trying to keep the boys away from any information related to the impending lawsuit, the disappearing people, the pond, the treasure, and the brother's estates. However, these other characters are vicious, attempting to harm the boys more than once, including leaving them stranded on a deserted island, and knocking them out.As the boys unravel the clues to the various mysteries, they encounter a long-unused secret entrance and rooms related to the entrance. The entrance and the secret rooms may be related to at least some parts of the mysteries. Most unusual of all, the boys encounter a monster in the pond.Join the boys in a classically styled mystery that reminded me of 30s-styled mysteries. Spooky mansions, secret passages and rooms, mysterious characters and a monster provide an enjoyable atmosphere to this Hardy Boys mystery.I have one minor complaint about this book. The cover of the book features a reptile. The reptile should be an alligator to match the novel. However, the reptile on the cover appears to be a crocodile, not an alligator. Also, the boys refer to the cold water, and alligators and crocodiles are very sluggish in cold water. Minor complaints about an otherwise enjoyable mystery.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The Hidden Harbor Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 14)","review":"This review concerns the original 1935 edition.

It is one of my favorite books in the Hardy Boys series. The story takes place in Georgia with a man named Bart Worth asking Joe and Frank Hardy for help. Mr. Worth is going to court with a man named Samuel Blackstone. Mr. Blackstone is suing Mr. Worth for a story included in the newspaper owned by Mr. Worth. The story accused Mr. Blackstone's ancestors of getting rich by smuggling and piracy. Mr. Worth needs Joe and Frank to find proof that Mr. Blackstone's descendents did get their money this way.The Hardy boys decide to camp outside the Blackstone property and spy. Mr. Blackstone's house is on a very large piece of land belonging to the Blackstone family. Half of the land belongs to Mr. Blackstone and half belongs to Mr. Ruel Rand. There is a pond on the land, but no one knows who owns it. When the original owner died, the will was not clear about the boundary line. One night, Joe and Frank hear Mr. Blackstone and Mr. Rand arguing loudly about who owns the pond. They saw, through the window, Mr. Blackstone hit Mr. Rand over the head with a vase. They quickly go to the door of the house and ask to talk to Mr. Blackstone. His servant lets the boys inside.Mr. Blackstone is sitting in his room reading a book. When asked what happened, he says Mr. Rand is not there and there have been no other visitors. The Hardy boys call the police anyway to report what they saw. When the police arrive, Mr. Blackstone says Mr. Rand is on a trip to Storm Island.The Hardy boys decide to explore the pond because they want to know why the pond is so special. While they are swimming in the pond, they see a weird creature similar to an alligator, but bigger. They escape and decide to figure out what it is, later.Frank wonders if Mr. Rand is really on Storm Island, so they rent a boat and go to Storm Island to find Mr. Rand. While they are exploring the island, someone cuts the rope which tied their ship to the rocks. When they discover what had happened, the ship was out of swimming reach so now they are marooned on the island. In the distance they see a speed boat speeding off.Will the Hardy boys be able to get off the island? Who cut the rope? Who was on that speed boat? What was that creature in the pond?

They are quite obvious.In Washington State, for example, the northwesternmost point in the lower 48 states was called Flattery Point, because its discoverer flattered himself into thinking that there would be a great harbor beyond it. Of course, there was: Puget Sound.Now, a friend had told me that the reason it was called \\"Flattery Point\\" was because, since it is a \\"land's end,\\" that flattery would get you nowhere. That is not the reason this point is called Flatery Point.But I digress. The harbor hides here in the original story because it was being used by Prohibition-era rumrunners. Of course, they were trying to land their illicit booze in some hidden location.This was happening all up and down the east coast, not just in Bayport. However, it was libelous to associate a newspaper publisher with that activity, and therein hangs the tale.Tales do hang in the most unusual locations.It's not F.W.

The poems in this anthology deal with everyday things that children do and see such as whistling and bathing.This anthology of poems is set at the level of younger children. The authors use simple words and also a lot of alliteration and repetition to help young readers to learn these poems. The poems also appeal to the reader's emotions. The main emotion of focus in these particular poems is humor. The authors took everyday things that children do and turned them into a very fun and joyous experience. The poem After A Bath by Aileen Fisher is an example of this. She makes the chore of taking a bath a little less painful by comparing how the child dries off with that of his dog.The rhythm of the poems throughout this book is very smooth. The book begins with the child waking up for the long day ahead of them. It then takes them through the experiences that they may encounter throughout any particular day. The book then ends with poems about bedtime stories and getting tucked into bed. The illustrations for the poems also make the book flow rather well. Every poem has an illustration about what is going on in that particular poem. The illustrations are very suitable for the younger age levels because they are very simple and do not clutter up the pages. The illustrations also help portray the humor in the poems as well.Children of the younger age levels will find reading this book to be a very good experience. This anthology will help introduce poetry to children in a fun and exciting way."},{"Title":"Wraps Around the World: Fusion Fast Food","review":"This is very colourfull cookbook .

Foot meticulously goes through the evidence, finding all the flaws and holes in the prosecution case, and positing a plausible alternate theory as to who could have committed the murder. The Bridgewater Three were released in 1998 (one died in prison), due in large part to the dedicated work of themselves, their families and this fantastic book about them. For anybody interested in the workings or otherwise of Bristish justice, this and Foot's other books about Helen Smith, Colin Wallace and Paul Hanratty are a must read."},{"Title":"Murder at the Farm: Who Killed Carl Bridgewater?","review":"This book is written by a seasoned investigative journalist. It concerns a local murder committed at Wordsley in the West Midlands. The case provoked national outrage because the victim, a 13 year-old newspaper delivery boy called Carl Bridgewater, seemed to have stumbled upon a burglary and been gratuitously killed to silence him. Four men were convicted of his murder in 1978. Twenty years later, three walked free from the Court of Appeal - the fourth had died whilst in prison. The author, Paul Foot, had long been one of their leading champions.Foot tells the story well combining a wealth of evidence of their innocence with a journalist's readability. The story as it unfolds is a depressingly familiar one of the police constructing the case for the prosecution by prematurely concluding investigations into alternative lines of enquiry. The defendants were all small-time local criminals and it was all too easy for the police to believe the worst of them. That is commonplace enough but what followed is what makes this case a particularly instructive one. Foot shows how the police and prosecutors, convinced of the righteousness of their cause, forged confessions and concealed exculpatory evidence to ensure that the defendants were convicted.As evidence of their innocence mounted over the years, so public concern grew until by the time of their release there had been six separate police inquiries, two hearings before the Court of Appeal and the case had been referred back to the court twice by the Home Secretary. What was almost as bad as the prosecutorial misconduct was the dogged determination of the courts to uphold the convictions in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. We may well ask ourselves - why do courts behave like this?"},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"This book does only one small thing, but it does it extremely well: It will teach you how to play melodically over quick-change bebop ii-V-I progressions. For players who are frustrated by the \\"play this mode over this chord\\" approach, this book is a refreshing antidote that focuses instead on functional harmony and good voice leading to help you find the target notes that will smoothly connect the chords while outlining the harmony. For players who understand the theory but are lost as to how to get this stuff under their fingers, the brilliance of this book is that it boils everything down to just three very simple patterns, so you can immediately focus your practicing on internalizing these patterns, and later work on embellishing them into a constellation of jazz ideas.Although the outlines appear very restrictive at first glance, Ligon makes a good case that these basic patterns can be varied and embellished without end, limited only by the creativity of the player. At his disposal are hundreds of examples of the outlines, transcribed from recorded solos.However, this book has some troubling theoretical inconsistencies, and one very big flaw: The numerous examples cited in the book are completely removed from their musical context, which often complicates their analysis. Bafflingly, for each example, Ligon cites the name of the soloist but not the recording from which he transcribed the solo or even the name of the tune! This is a problem because nearly all the examples are only 2 - 4 measures long and end immediately on the beat after the I chord is reached, as if Ligon is not concerned in the slightest with what jazz musicians play over I chords. And because he often fails to include a key signature, it is sometimes impossible to analyze the example in the context of the key of the song.All these problems come to light almost immediately, when on page 18 he runs into murky waters. A one-bar musical example is given showing two beats of Am7b5 and two beats of D7. Because the name of the tune is not given, nor a key signature, we have no way of knowing what the context of these chords are in the structure of the tune.Describing this short example, Ligon writes, \\"Tom Harrell uses this pattern on a iii - V7/ii progression in the key of F.\\" Ah, ok - so now we understand that the full progression is most likely Am7b5, D7, Gm7, C7, F. Ligon continues, \\"The Am7 chord is not the ii chord of the key of G major, rather the iii of the key of F major.\\" First of all, *what* Am7 chord? The example shows an Am7b5, not Am7. They may be functionally similar but they imply different modalities, as Ligon has explained previously. Nothing in the melody indicates Eb, and again, we don't know the tune, so we can't investigate further. Second, I'm confused why he felt the need to clarify that the A chord is not the ii of G major, except for the fact that it is presented completely out of context, requiring explanation in the text that it is actually iii of F. Except of course that Am7b5, the actual chord in the example, is *not* the iii of F!Moving on: \\"Because of the key signature of one flat, the second note is B-flat.\\" Where to begin? There is no key signature at all in the example! And the second note is not flatted, it is shown as a B-natural! Is this a copy error, and Ligon meant to write Am7 and Bb? Or did Tom Harrell actually play a B natural over an Am7b5 chord, a very plausible possibility? We don't know anything about the tune or the recording, so we can't check for ourselves.Next: \\"The D7 chord is the secondary dominant to G minor, the ii chord of F major.\\" Ok, that explains why Ligon calls it a V7/ii instead of a VI7, but what about the preceding Am7b5 chord? That chord also borrows an Eb from G minor, so wouldn't it make more sense to call it ii/ii ? Isn't it also participating in the tonicization of G minor?Finally: \\"To get to G minor [Tom Harrell] needed to add one flat (Eb) and add the leading tone to G minor (F#). In doing so he spelled out a D7 with a flat nine. Both chromatic tones pointing to the new key are included in the line.\\" This is actually a great explanation of how modal borrowing and temporary tonicization work, and it explains why 7b9 chords often occur before minor chords, especially on V7/ii, not just because someone wrote 7b9 on a lead sheet (as Mark Levine would have you believe) but because it describes the voice leading that is happening in the melody. But the explanation is incomplete. What is not mentioned is that the note Eb (b9 of D7) sounds good in this case because it voice leads down a half step to D, the fifth of G minor. Ligon explains very well in Chapter 1 how the seventh of one chord voice leads down a half step to the third of the next, and the third of a dominant chord leads up to the root of the tonic, but his discussion of voice leading ends there. He mentions only in passing that ninths may also resolve to fifths, which is why the borrowing of a b9 on a dominant chord leads to more effective resolution on the following minor chord.This incomplete discussion of voice leading is reflected in his outlines. The vast majority of his examples show the seventh leading down to the third, leaving unexplored the other possibilities for connecting chords with good voice leading using other chords tones. This restriction might be useful for a beginning player, so as not to get overwhelmed by the possibilities inherent in soloing, but using only this device in a real solo will sound boring. Now, it might seem that I'm picking an awful lot on just one tiny example, but this example is emblematic of other examples throughout the book.Another issue is that Ligon's outlines are directly applicable only in a rather limited context: ii-V7-I and secondary dominant progressions with a fast harmonic rhythm. When the harmonic rhythm is fast - two beats per chord, as in almost all the examples given, the outlines can be used with little or no embellishment. But players will struggle to use these concepts over many tunes where the harmonic rhythm is slower, and much embellishment is required to expand the patterns to fill more time. There is some discussion of embellishment techniques, but Ligon never demonstrates how a player might expand the outlines using (for example) sequences. And although he makes some attempts to show how the outlines can be used over other types of chord progressions, I find his examples unconvincing - he's trying a little too hard to force these examples into his outline theory, rather than letting the theory follow from the examples.Finally, as I've mentioned before, there is no discussion of what to play over a I chord or how to connect it to whatever follows - indeed, so many examples simply stop at the end of a dominant 7 chord, leaving the reader wondering what the I chord is supposed to be - is it major? is it minor? is it even a I chord at all or something else? are we looking at a ii - V7 or a iii - V7/ii progression? How are we supposed to analyze the solo, completely devoid of its context in the tune?This problem presents itself in the Am7b5 - D7 example above, and this illustrates a problem with the whole 'temporary tonicization' explanation. After Ligon has explained that the melody on the D7 chord is borrowing from G harmonic minor, we never actually get to see what Tom Harrell plays on the Gm7 chord itself! The melody is left hanging on an Eb note in the D7 bar, leaving us to wonder if it will resolve down to D, the fifth of G minor, or perhaps up to F, the seventh. But a player might wonder, if the Gm is being tonicized as a minor i chord by D7, and Harrell is borrowing F# and Eb from G harmonic minor, what should she play over the Gm7 itself? Should we in fact treat it as if it were a minor i? Ligon has stated earlier that we should play notes from the harmonic minor scale over a minor i. Well, that might be a good choice to spice things up, but the more conventional choice is to treat the Gm7 as what it really is, a ii chord that implies dorian harmony, with an F natural seventh. Playing F# in this context will sound exotic but will not give the smooth voice leading to E that Ligon desires when the C7 finally comes around.On the other hand, if we're looking at an Am7b5 - D7 preceding a bridge that modulates into the key of G minor, we might very well want to play notes chosen from the G harmonic or even melodic minor scale over the following Gm chord, and we're going to choose different notes to play over the A and D chords as well. If it were an Am7 - D7 as part of vi - V/V - V - I progression in the key of C, we would make still different choices and alterations. Context matters, and that it what gets lost in this book. It is an especially serious flaw in a book that emphasizes functional harmony and voice leading instead of viewing chords as isolated verticalizations of modes.All this said, despite the serious problem of lack of context in the examples, Ligon's book is still an excellent gateway into ii-V-I playing, and a player who sits down with this book and Aebersold's ii-V-I tracks will be playing satisfying solos almost immediately, with plenty of room to grow and inject one's own creativity over time."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"I truly wish this was the first book on jazz I had read.

After getting through the song list fluidly, I set about supplying missing ingredients in my playing. Neil Olmstead's Solo Piano book supplies some.

This book goes where those books do not: it shows how to create ii-v-i runs that do not sound like scales and arpeggios stitched together like a crude Frankenstein's monster. It describes three very simple outlines, spends a short chapter discussing embellishments, and then takes the reader through more and more complex examples of where these outlines appear in the work of giants. My ii-v-i runs are improving as I integrate these outlines into my playing.

A typical jazz improv contains three outstanding forms, that can be altered and decorated according to will and taste of the performer.This work of abstraction is very, very powerful!!! It's ways too easier to improvise this way, just controlling and varying 3 basic forms!!!As to the second part (Outline analysis and examples from Great Masters) what I would have liked additionally is:1. an accompanying CD2. some more detailed explanations (mainly on more complex phrases)3. some examples tying it all together, mixing outlines4. suggestions about any proper voicings to be used while playing some phrases.Maybe these requests could sound too naive to the expert performer, but I still think that, as the main purpose of this great book is to flatten the learning difficulty (and time) to learn how to improvise, all of the items I've pointed out would contribute to this goal, futherly reducing the duration of this complex, intriguing and amazing mental process."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"Bert Ligon's Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony is my favorite improvisation technique book of all times.

I started taking guitar and piano lessons, and had a natural talent for the technique side of playing, and it didn't take me long to learn a lot of theory, but when I tried to improvise, nothing sounded good at all.So the point is, It took me a few years to get to a decent level of playing, but then I just plateaued, and over the next seven or eight years of lessons, books, and DVDs I felt like I didn't improve much from there.Just about a month ago I bought this book and I'm finally getting it! Things finally MAKE SENSE! If you've struggled with improvising, I can't recommend this book enough. I guess I can understand why other teachers don't explain it in such detail the way Ligon does because in just the few weeks I've been working with his book, the things I've picked up from him seem so obvious and self-explanatory, but I just COULD NOT get it without his explanations. I wish I had learned from him (or someone like him) from the very start.Most teachers show you the chords, and then show you all the notes to play over the chords and then say \\"Ok go for it! Have fun and LISTEN!\\" and you can either try to make something up with those notes that probably won't sound very cool or jazzy, or you can copy cool licks from others that will sound cool, but won't really feel like YOU are improvising and you won't really understand it anyway.Ligon shows you the notes that \\"work,\\" and then also gives you RULES to follow, which is restricting and boring at first, but as you go further in the book, the more and more you start adding variations to the rules, and breaking the rules, and then great music just starts to flow! And it is so much fun and feels really good. I used to watch/listen to artists improvising and it seemed like so much fun, but when I would try, it felt like a language that I just wasn't quite fluent or articulate enough to express myself. But I am getting there faster every day now than in years of practice.(This is probably one of my top 5 best purchases of all time. That's how great it is).[Sidenote: In full disclosure, there is one other thing besides this book I have started doing over the past year that has also helped a lot, so my rapid progress recently is not SOLELY because of this book. My teacher always told me to SING the scales and arpeggios, and sing the notes before/while playing, but I ignored him until now. I finally started SINGING notes from songs I liked or from my own head and hearing/figuring out how they fit into the major scale before/while playing them and this has helped exponentially my ability to HEAR what is going on in pop/rock music and improvise pop/rock sounding solos, but still JAZZ seemed beyond me until about a month ago when I bought Ligon's book, which was like the final step].-----------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: I wrote the review about a year ago and I'd just like to update and say this book really unlocked something for me, I highly recommend it, and I also just wanted to add that after studying with this one for a while, the Charlie Parker Omnibook made a lot more sense and was a lot more fun to practice with."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"The concepts in this book are very simple but very effective.

The the shelves in my bookcase are stacked with abandoned books on the topic. Some of them have become monuments to years of frustration and lack of development. So it would be fair to say that I received Bert Ligon's Connencting Chords with Linear Harmony with somewhat low expectations on what I would gain from working with it.Surely, I was in for a surprise. With it's simple devices and vast amount of examples from the great legends of jazz, I soon found myself playing over chord progressions, and actually connecting the dots. It was a rewarding experience. No more pages on pages with arpeggios exercises, scales, modes and such. Like the ones that would take months to actually play. I'm not trying to advocate that these things don't matter. Of course they do. In fact I'm also working my way throughMickey Baker's Complete Course in Jazz Guitar: Book 2 (Ashley Publications)too andCreative Guitar 1: Cutting Edge Tech (v. 1), both excellent book, which are full of the above. But still, my point being -though there is a great amount of books that will improve your technique and/or give you great theoretic insight. But when it comes the mysterious craft of sculpting great solo lines, how to understand them and the sacred art of internalizing of them, while having lots of fun, there are only a few \\"hidden gems\\" (books) out there.Connecting Chords With Linear Harmony\\" is certainly one of them.So now I'm looking forward to the day I clear out that particular shelf in my bookcase, to make room for this book, a monument to progression and achievement. On the other hand, that day may never come. I'm afraid this book is too exciting, practical and too awarding to just stand up there collecting dust. Bert Ligon's book should really have been glued to every music stand ever produced."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"Have you wondered what do you have to do to improvise? I have. I have spent a lot of money on books that promised to teach improvisation. The books teach licks, fragmented ideas, etc. They do not go into detail or depth on the subject of improvisation. The book Connecting Chords With Linear Harmony was like the opening of the heavens for me. I began to understand how to improvise. Mr. Ligon starts with three basic outlines and builds from there. He then goes into embellishing the outlines by using passing notes, sawtooth harmony, etc. The book gives many examples of recorded music from people like Sonny Stitt, Cannonball Adderly, Clifford Brown, etc. to illustrate the ideas being discussed. Now as I listen to jazz I can hear what I am learning in the book.There are a few drawbacks. First, the book is written in standard music notation. There is no tab. If you can't read music it would be hard to understand the book. Second, I would be very helpful to understand some music theory as you go through the book. Lastly, there is no accompanying recording to listen to the recorded examples. I am sure a recording would be helpful to many people.Despite these drawbacks I have found this book to be the greatest aid in helping me become proficient in improvising. I give the book my highest rating."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"This book, as are all of the Bert Ligon Jazz Books, is extremely well written. It provides great insight and detail into the components that make up Jazz theory, with practical examples taken from many of the greatest Jazz musicians of the past 60+ years. There are more than 250 examples with which to enhance your playing skills, and it has provided many more sounds and textures for me to choose from in my Jazz improvizational pallet. Study from this book, along with the Jazz Theory Resources vols 1 & 2 books, and you will be well on your way to being a much more versatile Jazz player."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"I'm only slightly past the halfway point in this book, but already it's helped my soloing so much that it's already worth five stars. He's transcribed thousands of solos and presented the best parts of them in this book, carefully explained. I've been working through the examples one by one, playing them (on guitar) until they feel like second nature, and now when I solo I have a wealth of new ideas and patterns to work with. I do have one minor nit - the examples are all written without key signatures. So, regardless of the key center in the example, it looks like it's in C with lots of accidentals, when in fact many of the accidentals are natural to the key. Does that make sense? I don't read that well, so this slows me down a little. Again, it's a minor nit, it doesn't take much away from the overall value of the book. If you're learning jazz, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"I like this book. This book helps the aspiring jazz musician to be well on their way to creating good music on their instrument. Mr. Ligon uses three types of linear harmonic outlines that creates and can develop a jazz solo. I think this book is good for a beginner just starting out in learning how to improvise. It is very sound in its knowledge and presentation of it. Mr. Ligon cites many excerpts from improvised solos of very great jazz musicians to support his outlines. And there are exercises to go with it. This is important stuff for all jazz musicians to know and, I believe, it is a book that should be in any college or university teaching jazz music.Books like this and many others prove that jazz music is NOT a mystery. Jazz is music that anyone can enjoy!"},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"When I was taking Jazz Guitar lessons with a professional teacher, he showed me all of Burt Ligon's materials. This book is prehaps one of the best books written on Jazz Improv PERIOD. The author is a college professor with years of experience playing and analyzing Jazz Improv; in this book, he basically shows that most improvisers use certin methods(and sometimes don't realize it!) over and over again. He shows the most common methods of viewing a Improv solo which you can use to go from there.I don't see why anyone who studies this book and asborbs what Ligon has to teach won't have a solid foundation for Improv they can use to go to new levels of playing.BTW-Rock guys, you will need to able to read music(even if just slowly) because serious books about Jazz and Classical playing don't have tabs and NEVER will. You will also need to know some theory about chord structure/progressions(Diatonic Chords in a key, what defines the types of 7th chords,etc) ,intervals, and how to derive/play the Modes from Major. I came from a Metal/Rock backround and learned all this stuff..it's not hard really and it will open new doors to take your music to higher levels."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"Don't loose time looking for other jazz book !

I wish I had read this book before the others. It is clearly written, and is progressive for those new to learning jazz soloing and for those more advanced. Bert Ligon shows how basic outlines can be used and embellished in numerous ways, providing and breaking down hundreds of example lines and phrases from several well-known jazz artists. It only includes notation (no tab for guitarists), but any guitarist serious about learning jazz should already know how to read notation. From beginning student to advanced player, you won't regret adding this delightful book to your library."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"Bert Ligon's Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony is an essential resource for learning jazz improvisation. While the book is introductory and self-contained, those without some background in elementary jazz theory (major and minor scales, seventh chords, ii-V-I progressions in major and minor) will probably struggle a bit with the material.Ligon's book ties together three main elements: 1) three elementary melodic \\"outlines\\" for navigating the ii-V-I progression, 2) common melodic \\"embellishing devices\\" (passing tones, approach tones, encircling tones, and so on) that can be applied to the outlines to transform them into \\"real music,\\" and 3) about 250 transcribed phrases from the recordings of Clifford Brown, Charlie Parker, Tom Harrell and others that illustrate this process in the hands of master improvisers.For many jazz neophytes who have struggled with the more common chord/scale pedagogical approach (\\"dorian for two beats, mixolydian for two beats, major for four beats\\"), a little effort with the material here will prove revelatory. The reason may seem a bit counter-intuitive - the \\"constraint\\" of embellishing a simple melodic outline provides a starting structure for creating solid jazz lines that is sorely lacking in the chord-scale approach. If this seems a bit mysterious, go to Ligon's USC main faculty web page, click on the jazz improvisation hyperlink, and spend some time digging around in the online materials. The material is poorly organized, but if you can find the \\"outlines\\" discussion it will give you a good sense of the contents of this book.While the material here will keep most busy for a long while, this approach is intended as an entryway to the world of jazz improvisation. There is of course much more in that universe, and Ligon's three other volumes - see my comment to this review for direct links - are excellent resources for expanding one's exploration.I would like to address a couple of criticisms of this book in other reviews.Some reviewers criticize the use of short phrases from transcribed solos rather than longer examples. I disagree. The short phrases are entirely appropriate to illustrate the concepts in an introductory manual such as this. As one begins to master Ligon's material, it is very instructive to search complete transcriptions for the presence of embellished outlines. I agree that it would be wonderful to have references to the sources of the transcribed phrases.One reviewer goes on at great length about example 3 on page 18. Ligon misjudged the placement of this example as it introduces a more advanced concept while the reader is still becoming familiar with the basic ideas. Worse, it has at least two typos, which render it a muddled mess. Example 5 on the next page is essentially the same example. I suggest skipping them on a first reading. To correct the typos: assuming the iii - V7/ii progression and key of F major are correct, the Am7(b5) in both examples should be Am7 and the B in example 3 should be Bb.Finally, some reviewers have criticized the limited applicability of the basic ideas presented here. Short ii-V7-I examples dominate the book, but far from exclusively so. The application of Outline 1 to other progressions is discussed briefly on pages 28-30, modal applications are discussed briefly in Chapter 8, and pages 94-128 discuss lengthier progressions in detail."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony has been a huge help for me in taking the first steps towards understanding improvisation and outlining chord changes.The book is based on three \\"outlines\\" used to outline ii-V-I progressions with proper voice leading (7ths leading to 3rds, 9ths leading to 5ths, etc). The outlines concept and embellishments are very clearly explained in the first few pages. From there, the first half of the book gives example after example of famous players' licks, categorizing them by outline and explaining what devices they are using to embellish the outline. Jazz is a language, and I feel like the first half of the book shows you the written form and a bit about grammar and how statements are made.From chapter 9 on, clear exercises are given to actually get the concept and licks into your improvisation. If this book were a language course, this would be the spoken part. Ligon shows how the outlines work over key changes, turnarounds, blues, Rhythm changes, and tunes like \\"Stella By Starlight\\", \\"All the Things You Are\\", and even \\"Giant Steps\\". At the end of the book, there are etudes and example solos (a Lou Donaldson solo and a Tom Harrell solo) to show the outlines in action. There are also two pages on exercises for teaching the concepts in a jazz improvisation class.I feel that all of the concepts in the book are clearly explained. This is not a book of basic chord/scale knowledge with a bunch of licks to learn. Ligon does offer hundreds of great licks to learn and use, but the book teaches you to identify and understand the different ways you can outline chord changes. The book is also not a rigid guide of rules and regulations; you begin with the simple outlines, but end with the general understanding of how one chord connects to the next. A thorough understanding of the material presented here would surely give a player a good starting point- a wealth of licks and the understanding of how licks are built and embellished."},{"Title":"Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)","review":"OVER THE YEARS I HAVE BOUGHT OVER A HUNDRED BOOKS ON IMPROVISING,AND HAVE GOT NOWHERE.

In all revealed world religions the coming of the Kingdom is identified with the appearance of the Supreme World Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts, the returned Christ, the Qa'im, the new Buddha and about 1850 Baha'u'llah announced that he was this redeemer and the bearer of God's message to modern man. Ignored by the kings and rulers whom he addressed, he died in the Holy Land in 1892, an exile and captive of the Turks. Today there are followers of the Bahai Faith in every nation on earth. Townshend was particularly interested in that part of the Lord's prayer &quot;Thy Kingdom come&quot; and investigated whether Baha'u'llah was in fact the returned Christ. He found that a large number of people gathered in the Middle East in the 1840s waiting for Christ's return, but in vain as they overlooked an important clue in the Bible. 'Christ and Baha'u'llah' is the story of his investigation and in 1957 he decided to put his findings in book form to make it easier for others to conduct their own investigation.Townshend starts the chapter on &quot;The False Prophets&quot; with these words: &quot;As Jesus had prophesied, the false prophets contrived to change the essential meaning of the Gospel so that it became quite different from that which the Bible recorded or Jesus taught. It has long been generally believed that Jesus Christ was a unique incarnation of God such as had never before appeared in religious history and would never appear again. This tenet made the acceptance of any later Prophet impossible to a Christian. Yet there is nothing in Christ's statements, as recorded in the Gospels, to support this view, and it was not generally held during his lifetime.&quot;Three chapters discuss Muhammad, but I found these excerpts helpful in understanding the relationship between religions. &quot;Muhammad was already about 40 years old when he began to teach ethical principles similar to those in the Old Testament and to proclaim the succession of the prophets, including His own succession to Jesus Christ, whose Divinity and whose Gospel he called His believers to accept. But after a few years he found Himself forced by severe and continuous persecution to leave his native town for Medina where he at once began the execution of the real mission of His life, the building of a spiritual nation.&quot; And &quot;To the Christian Muhammad showed the greatest kindness, insisting that all Muslims should fully accept both Jesus Christ and His Gospel, and assuring them in the Qur'am (Sura 5 verse 85) that they would find the Christians nearest of all men to them in affection, He took them under his protection.&quot;If you are uncomfortable about the religious truths that have been handed to you; if you are uncomfortable that religious friendship has turned into religious rivalry; if you are open to learn about the evidence that convinced Townshend that Baha'u'llah is the returned Christ, this is a good book to study."},{"Title":"Christ and Bahaullah","review":"There is revolutionary thinking in every part of taday's life. People are told to step outside the box and look at previously proven ideas from a different angles. This has led to many discoveries.But, when it comes to religion, all minds seem to be closed.

Still, even if I were a devout secularist I would not be able to resist the vision of world unity described in the final chapter.The notion that Baha'u'llah was Christ returned will make many Christians uncomfortable, but then, if you await Christ's return, exactly how will you discern when it happens? With all its imagery, Revelations does leave room for interpretation.If you are secure in your belief that the religion you were born into, or have since converted to, represents the whole truth and has no peer, then a book like this should pose no danger.

Snacking - I need to eat 6 times a day to keep my blood sugar stable. I need snacks. Sharon Long gives two lists of snacks. One is those under 5 carbs and the other is under 10. What I liked was that the lists were not just of acceptable low carb foods ( low carb veggies, cooked meat, etc) but were actual recipes of things like (5 carb) orange essence almonds, smoked salmon dip and (10 carb) pumpkin granola and nutty caramel roll ups.2. Advice - The author discusses the truth about food bars, discusses ketosis and her experiences with both, talks about different types of restaurants and options you have, and gets real about handling cravings. Sure, most of this advice is common sense. However, the author tells it all from her own experiences as she has followed the low carb lifestyle for many years.3. Set Up - The book is split into sections for breakfast, lunch, main courses and desserts. There are shopping list, smaple menus, sugar conversion tables, susstitution lists and other indexes at the end. I found the book to be very user friendly.4. Nutritional Info - This is so very important to me in a cookbook. At the end of each recipe there was detailed nutrition info and the substitution to make the recipe low fat with that nutritional breakdown as well.I think this book is simple and excellent for people who plan meals and do prep work for the week. Recipes are easy to prepare and many can be made in batches for the week. Any specialty items are listed in the back and can be found in most health food stores.

We would go skinny dipping, catch pollywogs and lizards, make willow whistles, and trudge through the oily sludge that lined the river bottom. We did not know that once the river flowed year-around crystal clear, teeming with fish and supporting a heavily wooded flood plain rich with swamps, lakes, and wildlife. My first surprise on reading the biography of this once-ample river was the fact that it supported one of the largest concentrations of natives in the country. The first Europeans who settled on its banks named their village after it. This book really tells three stories. The first is how the river contributed to the growth of agriculture during the first 100 years of European settlement, creating a lasting image of fertile vinyards and orchards in the sunshine. After the railroad came, the needs for water grew so rapidly they pumped the river dry and built an aqueduct to the Owens River in the north to supply their needs. The second story is about the river's revenge and the periodic devastation it caused by flooding. Time after time, the river, swollen by storms in the San Gabriel Mountains, would smash through its levies, carry off whole houses, factories, herds of cattle, orchards and vinyards, destroy roads, bridges, cemeteries, and towns, putting the whole county under water. It was not until the late 1930s that an earnest attempt was made to tame the river with a system of dams, catchment basins, and pavement. The third story is about the recent attempts to restore the river to its natural state, an exercise about which the author is skeptical. Blake Gumprecht has given us a splendid book that again shows us how much geology, climate, and topography affect how we live and think of ourselves as a people."},{"Title":"The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"This fascinating book is packed with information about the history of Los Angeles. Not many present-day Angelenos would know that the location for the city was chosen because of the once-abundant flow of the Rio de Porciuncula, or Los Angeles River. Blake Gumprecht pulls an amazing feat in researching the River's many incarnations alongside the history of the growth of Los Angeles. In addition to providing detailed reports of the River's former courses, and devastating accounts of some of the River's infamous catastrophic floods, Mr. Gumprecht explains the River's role in shaping the course of Los Angeles city politics in greater detail than any previous study.Once an ample stream that sustained all of the city's water needs for over 100 years, the Los Angeles River was then pumped dry, smothered in concrete, and almost pushed out of the city's consciousness. Incredible photographs appear throughout the book; many of these photos will make nature-loving Angelenos yearn for the Los Angeles River of yesteryear, with its bubbling, meandering stream, and its banks lined with willows and sycamores.Long before you approach the end of this book, you realize that, in an over-zealous attempt to control flooding, the Los Angeles River was essentially raped, depleted, and buried. The fact that, at present, most of its 51 miles are cement is a shame -- especially in a city with so little park space. Amazingly, the River still provides up to 15% of L.A.'s drinking water, albeit from subterannean pumps that tap the River's flow before it ever reaches the surface. And millions of gallons of River water were diverted to the Silver Lake reservoir.People who never knew that there was a Los Angeles River should go see the few surviving River greenbelts in the Glendale Narrows and the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area to appreciate our city's River as it used to be.P.S. - I encourage other Los Angeles River buffs to look at Kevin Roderick's book \\"San Fernando Valley: America's Suburb\\" to see other beautiful pictures of the River in its natural state, before the concrete obscured it."},{"Title":"The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"Reading this book was an assignement for a geography course I was taking in college. My first thoughts were \\"A book on the L.A. River? How can they write an entire book on a river that flows a couple of days per year?\\" My indifference to the subject was quickly dismissed after the first few pages. This book is very insightful! It gives a detailed history on L.A., from it's foundation as a tiny pueblo to the sprawling metropolis it is today, with the river & water in Southern California being the central themes. I always wondered why L.A. was built in the area it's in & Mr. Gumprecht answers that in fine detail along with many other interesting facts regarding the annexation of neighboring cities, water rights, deadly floods and ultimately the concrete channel built to contain this unpredictable river.Whoever is interested in the histroy of this region will no doubt greatly enjoy this superb book!"},{"Title":"The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"If you've ever wondered why Los Angeles is in the middle of a desert (hint: it wasn't always), what the river looked like before there was a city, and why the river was buried in concrete, this is the book. An excellent description of the origins of the river and the city, with insights into the modern revitalization movement.Among the things I learned:--The river starts in the San Fernando Valley, but the city of Los Angeles has claimed the water as its own since at least 1810, a claim eventually known as the Pueblo Water Right.--Not all of those concrete beds in L.A. are technically the L.A. river, which starts along the south edge of the San Fernando Valley, dodges a number of movie studios, and makes a right turn through downtown before heading for the Pacific. The others are creeks and washes that feed (fed) the river.--The area's light rainfall was sufficient to keep the river flowing year-round until suburbia took over. Concrete and asphalt reduced the water that soaked into the ground to be released slowly into the river. Now, the primary source of flowing river water is the what's been reclaimed from sewage treatment plants.Worth the read for all Angelenos or anyone who is interested in Los Angeles."},{"Title":"The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"Another one that I needed for my project. Again arrived in great condition and in plenty of time. thanks."},{"Title":"The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"Gumprecht's _Los Angeles River_ is a well-written history of the Los Angeles River, from Native American and Spanish/Mexican pueblo days to the present.Looking at the concrete-lined flood control channel that the LA River has become, it is hard to believe that the LA River once was the main water supply for the City of Los Angeles. As the city grew, though, its water needs outpaced what the river could supply. An alternate source (which turned out to be the infamous Aqueduct), was eventually developed. With all the Owens Valley water coming into the city, the river became simply a dumping ground for wastewater and other undesirable things.The LA River, more or less also determined the expansion of the city. Since farmers in the San Fernando Valley had no rights to the LA River water (it all belonged to the city), eventually, the San Fernando Valley had to join the City of Los Angeles to access any water.The river was also known for flooding and changing its course unpredictably. These floods became more and more of a concern as areas near the river developed, first with agriculture, later with residences. After a particularly devastating flood in 1934, officials called on the Army Corps of Engineers to help with flood control. This led to the concrete channelization of the river.After that, no one thought much of the river. Occasionally, the concrete channel inspired uses such as movie shoots and vehicular uses. It looked so much like a road, that several people proposed making the riverbed into a freeway.Meanwhile, the river was starting to get some attention. Lewis McAdams founded the Friends of the La River, which is trying to get the river restored to its natural state. They have run into opposition by the Army Corps of Engineers, and other parties concerned about flood control issues. The future of the river becoming more than it is now (a paved channel with a trickle of water in it most of the time) remains in question.The book started its life as a masters' thesis, but the prose is accessible, not overly academic. Recommended for anyone interested in the history of Los Angeles."},{"Title":"The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"I first saw the Los Angeles River in TV shows and movies like Terminator 2 and have ever since been interested in learning more about this strange, concrete encased urban waterway. Blake Gumprecht's book does a great job of providing the history of the Los Angeles River from its pristine condition two centuries ago into the modern era as a \\"Freeway for Water\\" in the book \\"The Los Angeles River.\\"The author balances his coverage of the river and fairly represents both sides of the struggle to restore it back to a more natural appearance versus the need to provide flood control protection with concrete fortifications.The book is extremely well researched and documented. Extensive maps and photos shed light on the topic and make the historical changes easier to follow.My only wish is that a future edition will include color photos."},{"Title":"Reaching for Rainbows: Resources for Creative Worship","review":"Ann Weems talks about the church in interesting and contemporory ways.

Even if you are a bemused observer of American Catholicism and its Catholics, this nuanced approach to a complex history identifies specific events or influences that caused a revolution in the 2,000 year old institution, and more specifically in the American Catholic Church and culture.It doesn't have all the answers, but it helps gives the reader something to hang his or her hat on--tools to comprehend the church's identity and maybe even help Catholics to see where they could go from here.Very readable, but challenging and highly informative"},{"Title":"Catholics and American Culture: Fulton Sheen, Dorothy Day, and the Notre Dame Football Team","review":"Mark Massa's study of twentieth century American Catholicism is a first rate analysis of the more recent life of the nation's largest Christian Church. I consider it an essential book for students and scholars of American culture. -David J. Hackett n.S.J."},{"Title":"Catholics and American Culture: Fulton Sheen, Dorothy Day, and the Notre Dame Football Team","review":"Massa's catchy title made this book appealing to me at first, and he takes a pretty thorough look at the overwhelming changes in the American Church during the Cold War years and how those changes paralleled the transformation of American Catholics from a closed society with its own schools, social institutions, etc., to a mainstream American religion and more importantly, a mainstream American social group (Massa refers to the assimilated Catholic as part of an &quot;ethnic group&quot; in America).I found the first half of each chapter quite fascinating, as Massa describes the days of Thomas Merton, Notre Dame's rise to academic excellence under Rev. Ted Hesburgh, the first Sunday of Advent, 1964 (the first week when the Vatican II Mass was conducted in churches across the US), and more.Unfortunately, Massa would fill up the second half of each chapter with analysis from (what he called) &quot;famous&quot; sociologists. I haven't taken sociology since my undergrad days, so other than Andrew Greeley and Max Weber, I heard of none of these &quot;famous&quot; people. Massa's lapse into dry academic language each chapter slowed down the book considerably, and I found myself skimming over those sections after reading a few chapters. At times, his book read like a sociology textbook.Charles Morris' _ American Catholic : The Saints and Sinners Who Built America's Most Powerful Church_ makes similar assertions as Massa's book, but it is far more readable and deals heavily with 19th century America more than the Cold War. However, it eventually is Massa who makes a more forceful argument and deals more in detail with the transformation of the American Church after World War II (_American Catholic_ goes into very little detail about these changes, oddly enough).All in all, an uneven but promising work better suited for a sociology class than for a general reader. If you read it, I recommend Morris' book as a worthy complement."},{"Title":"Catholics and American Culture: Fulton Sheen, Dorothy Day, and the Notre Dame Football Team","review":"This lucid, learned, enlightening study shows that what old-time Catholics miss did in fact have a real value, and yet losing it is an invitation from a God who, throughout sacred and profane history, has been noticeably discontent with stasis and status quos. Using the metaphor of the changes at Notre Dame University, &quot;the epicenter of American Catholicism&quot; is brilliant. We've won a few, lost a few, and ironically neither our losses nor our gains were entirely one or the other. A masterful piece of work."},{"Title":"Catholics and American Culture: Fulton Sheen, Dorothy Day, and the Notre Dame Football Team","review":"A highly informative and comprehensive work. I highly recommend it for those seeking insight into the experience of Catholics during the 20th Century."},{"Title":"Catholics and American Culture: Fulton Sheen, Dorothy Day, and the Notre Dame Football Team","review":"Utilizing irony, humor, and a breadth of knowledge, Dr. Massa's latest opus is excellent from cover to cover. And though his academic credentials may seem daunting, Massa writes with an easy lucidity that makes his subject matter interesting and enjoyable. As a non-Catholic who had no prior knowledge of what &quot;BVMs in a bathtub&quot; were, I nonetheless was able to relate to the uncomfortable assimilation process experienced by his second and third generation American Catholics.Massa's interdisciplinary approach expands this work beyond mere religious or cultural history. The chapter on JFK ranks with some of the best political writing I've seen, and the section on the results of Vatican II contains superb theological analysis. The truths revealed in this chapter alone have serious implications for Christians of all traditions.A must-read for all those interested in American culture during the latter half of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Catholics and American Culture: Fulton Sheen, Dorothy Day, and the Notre Dame Football Team","review":"Mark Massa is a former teacher and a marvelous writer. The book is fascinating and well worth it!"},{"Title":"Catholics and American Culture: Fulton Sheen, Dorothy Day, and the Notre Dame Football Team","review":"Great book from a terrific teacher (seriously), although my sense is that all the reviewers here have taken Fr.

Still, worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"The contests at Cowlick","review":"The Contests at cowlick is a very cleverly written book, even adults still enjoy it. The whole book is written so artfully that it is easily characterized by the most un-dramatic readers. It is a great book for both children and adults, it makes for great drama too. Ever want a skit for kids, thats not a cheesy one, but simple enough that they can perform it in a little under a month? The contests at cowlick is a multi-purpose book. I reccomend this book to anyone looking for great wholesome entertainment."},{"Title":"The contests at Cowlick","review":"I was digging around my parent's basement bookshelf last year and was delighted to find this gem of a book that I only remembered in the most basic sense: kid is brave and outsmarts the bad guys. I was the only one of five kids to apparently read the book, so my parents had no problem with me claiming it as my own. This book has instantly become a favorite of our house and is a special shared experience that \\"...No, only daddy reads this!\\" The other reviewer wrote of voices and roles coming easily and this is very true. The kids love to recite along having memorized it long ago, even the little one who is not actually reading yet.The true power in the book, however is what it has to say about heroism. At the outset, the first step requires the physical bravery to step forward and say, \\"I am here.\\" That risk, that accountability is mandatory, but the fact that the young hero uses intelligence, strategy, tactics, delayed gratification, and (apparent) humility to win the day is the lesson I subconsciously took to heart as a boy. I find that throughout my life, whenever I sat down to think of how I would ideally handle a challenging confrontation, it matched very closely to what Wally would do. Thanks, Mr Kennedy, I am sharing your book with my kids in the hopes that it will help form the basis of heroism for two more young minds. Plus, it makes them laugh."},{"Title":"The contests at Cowlick","review":"This book is a wonderful action story with a very young boy as the unlikely hero. The town is threatened by bandits while the sheriff is away on a fishing trip.The townspeople are helpless until our young hero challenges the bandits to some contests, outsmarts them and ultimately brings home the sheriff to complete their defeat. A fun book to read out loud, especially if you enjoy faking a cowboy drawl in the process!"},{"Title":"The contests at Cowlick","review":"Good illustrations. Obviously a young child requires the explanation the story is fun but not something to try. Too often entertainment is seen as more than entertainment. Nothing in the story indicated adults being inspired or lead by the little boy.

Mr. Cressy has done a huge amount of research, and the text is peppered with primary source quotations. I now have a real feel for what these experiences were like in Tudor &amp; Stuart England. I plan to buy whatever other material Mr. Cressy has written--I found him an easy, extremely informative read."},{"Title":"Birth, Marriage, and Death: Ritual, Religion, and the Life Cycle in Tudor and Stuart England","review":"I actually had to read this for an MA class in history and it's definitely a textbook of the Tudor and Stuart time period but it wasn't as dry as I had expected it to be, thanks to Mr. Cressy's amazing writing ability. But it is thoroughly researched and offers up very important conclusions about the social life of the Tudor/Stuart period and anyone who wants the recent and best literature on the subject should read this book."},{"Title":"Birth, Marriage, and Death: Ritual, Religion, and the Life Cycle in Tudor and Stuart England","review":"I've just finished writing a series of books about life in Elizabethan England, and this book was invaluable to me in my research. It is full of interesting details about how people in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century England approached and experienced the major transition points of the life cycle.

There is a huge supply of love-themed &quot;Peanuts&quot; comics out there, and I'd love to see Henry Holt put out a new edition with more of them. Still, even at this size, this book is a great buy for $7. Kind of like a &quot;Peanuts Classics&quot; book, it features comics from the '60s/'70s through the early '90s. I would recommend this to any &quot;Peanuts&quot; fan wanting a Valentine's Day, or just love, collection."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" is one of the all-time classics of English literature. The epic poem begins with Satan just having been expelled from Heaven. Adam and Eve are tempted in the Garden of Eden, and fall. Before the two are expelled from Eden, Adam has revealed to him some of the major events of the Old and New Testaments, culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. The epic has enthralled readers for well over three centuries.One thing that must be borne in mind when reading this work is that Milton's theology was not orthodox Christian theology, but Arianism, as he denied the Trinity and believed that Christ was not eternal, but created by God the Father. Also, the seventeenth century English is difficult to plow through. However, by forcing the reader to reflect on the origin of evil and to consider what they believe about the concept of original sin, \\"Paradise Lost\\" proves to be worth the effort one must make in reading it."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I suppose I could be thankful that this edition did not try to update Milton's English. The software that comes with it is just a .doc file; a hypertext document linking outdated words to definitions or mythic references to explanations would have been far more useful. The book itself is in a pleasing font, but the binding is weak and pages easily fall out."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"This magnificent book was recommended to me by a dear friend through another review here on Amazon.com. For that recommendation I am grateful due to the pleasure that I have received from it. I enjoyed the audio book rather than the printed version, and as one who listens to hundreds of audio books, I can say that this production through the talent of Anton Lesser, produces dramatic results.The book, this epic poem, is so beautifully written that it would be a pleasure to read, or listen to, even if the actual content was in some way lacking. But, the content is anything but lacking. For me, Milton points out that God is vengeful, jealous, and ego-driven, almost as though he were human. What father would pronounce the death sentence on his child for eating fruit from a tree (albeit \\"forbidden fruit\\")? What father would banish their child from Eden for that same offense? None that I know. Milton shows the God of the Genesis to be harsh and cruel while staying true to scripture.If you are looking for a book that is beautiful to read, and thought-provoking to ponder, then look no further.Best wishes, Kevin"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Very hard to read if you are non English speaking man.

So if you really interested in such things, don't think simply get it."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Even if you can't appreciate Classical epics and copious amounts of poetic language, this book is still written good enough for one to appreciate. Milton not only instills new life into this ancient story, but makes it just as compelling and intriguing as any modern story. The epic scope the story encompasses, including both the domains of Heaven and Hell, is enough to humble any reader. Also the unique look at the Powers' characters, especially the in depth look at the character of Satan himself, impresses the reader with a sense of something great.

She's a bit flakey, while Adam has his head together."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"How a blind man could produce such a stunning work is beyond me. Paradise Lost chronicles the fall of Adam and Eve from Eden and the fall of Lucifer from Heaven. It is told in flashback and in current time, by angels and by the narrator.

Immensely valuable to understanding this difficult poem is the editor's explanatory summery going into each of the twelve books (chapters) and the numerous footnotes.The second half of the book contains a biography, an historical evolution, other writings, and a critical analysis of Milton by multiple revered authors with a wide degree of beliefs.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I'm still reading this and will follow up with Paradise Regained.

One of my favorite quotes from the work:&quot;The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven. What matter where, if I be still the same?&quot; (Satan, Book 1)"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"It is a laborious read, but John Milton's Paradise Lost is worth it. First published in 1667, Paradise Lost remains, many contend, the greatest poem ever published in English, and Milton is deemed second only to Shakespeare among the pantheon of English writers. When reading Milton, be prepared for hundreds of references to Greek and Roman mythology that few of us (myself included) are familiar with as well as works saturated in biblical references and allusions and much obscure vocabulary. Happily, this Norton Critical Edition includes hundreds of notes--footnotes, so there is no disruptive flipping back and forth! This edition also offers dozens of critical essays on Paradise Lost, some dating back to its publication, a couple of Milton's prose works and an extensive glossary. Whether reading for pleasure or for (school) credit, this NCE of Paradise Lost is a godsend."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Rating Paradise Lost on a 5-star chart is not even fair.Some books are not to be rated at all, \`cos they do deserve more.Paradise Lost deserves your time and your mind."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"So important in modern literature that a lot of people credit the Bible with things that were actually the imagination of Milton in &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot; A long twisty tumbling poem that never loses its meaning from the first word to the last. The characterization of Lucifer is unlike any I've ever read, and the most powerful passage in the story is Lucifer addressing the legions of hell, ordering them to do whatever they can to thwart God, while tears of sadness at the loss of heaven stream down his face. Milton played with both typical and atypical views of sin and damnation and created something so timeless that lots of us don't know he imagined it.In any discussion of religion, I wouldn't leave home without it."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Justly placed at the head of the canon of Western literature behind Shakespeare and Dante by Harold Bloom, Milton stands as a towering creative genius in English literature and epic poetry.Milton conceived of his vast epic as a way to justify the 'ways of God to man.' Strangely, the character of Satan is absolutely central to this epic more so even than Adam and the rest of humanity, and often one can't help comparing Satan and his journeys and battles against misfortune as akin to those of other great literary heroes, such as Prometheus, Odysseus or Aeneas. I feel in a way the message of Milton is more than just good Protestant Christian apologetics; if you read his passionate and brilliant defense of freedom of the press and of thought in works like Aeropagitica, I am sure Milton in a way showed the power of free choice and what heights it allows any being to soar to, even those who are damned. I always get a sense from reading Milton a great trust in the human spirit and an expectation to rise against tyranny.While ultimately I feel Milton does not really justify the 'ways of God to man' in an intellectually satisfying way, and his vision lacks the brilliant unity of that of Dante, Milton is certainly a poet and genius of first order and probably the greatest writer in English after Shakespeare. His poetry contains great depth and beauty, not just the Paradise Epics but many other poems as well, and his learning and erudition are immense.In Milton there is a great confidence in human reason and in the individual to prevail in the face of disaster and hardship. One can't help but admire Satan's stubborness and determination in the face of so much which goes against him, and his incredible efforts to achieve his goals. If you ever wanted an example of 'self-help' look no further than the devil in Milton; despite the most hopeless situations he never gives up. Perhaps conciously or unconciously Milton embodies in Satan and also in Samson our own present confidence in our creative abilities and our determination and intelligence to overcome any obstacles in our way, and perhaps in a world as turbulent as ours, that isn't such a bad hope to have after all."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"My Kindle version lacks an introduction and any footnotes or endnotes. When it comes to the clasics I guess it is better not to use Kindle until they work out all the issues. This is the second book I've had a problem with. I tried a sample of Boswell's Life of Johnson and it was unreadable. Milton is worth reading just not in this format."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I used the Norton critical edition edited by Scott ElledgeWe will discover in these pages a profound rendering of the cosmic battle between good and evil, man's fall through disobedience to God, and Satan's perversion on mankind.Each line serves a purpose, so in order to inhale this sublime poem to its fullest it will be necessary to slow down. Immensely valuable to understanding this difficult poem is the editor's explanatory summery going into each of the twelve books (chapters) and the numerous footnotes.The second half of the book contains a biography, an historical evolution, other writings, and a critical analysis of Milton by multiple revered authors with a wide degree of beliefs.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"This is a very nice edition of Paradise Lost. It is a good deal for the $20.00 price. As far as the poem itself, Milton does an excellent job at creating a believable dialog between biblical figures. Although his many references to other literary works can become difficult to understand (unless you have read them) Paradise Lost is a must read for any person."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I ordered this text to help write a paper, and it has ended up serving as my primary text for my research. The text is at least as good as any of the other editions I have looked at, the footnotes are top-notch, and the critical articles are some of the siminal works. My only gripe is that there are no visual markers in the text for the footnotes, they are simply at the bottom of the page, signified by line number. Because of this, I sometimes don't realize that there are footnotes on a particular line, but this is a minor problem."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Be not mistaken: this is the finest piece of literature ever written. Ever. About anything. Few books even draw close. This is Milton's tribute to the English language - the English epic poem that draws near then surpasses Homer's Oddyssey (greek) and Dante's Divine Comedy (italian) The story of Satan's fall, creation, Adam and Eve, and the Fall of Man. I have read it three times in the last eight weeks and there are still new twists and tangles in it I am uncovering. It is simply, truly amazing. It is an experience. It is a revelation. I am not exaggerating. Ask C.S. Lewis. PS - I am not an intellectual. I am a 21 year old student who has found gold."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"The audio version of Paradise Lost is good. I was expecting more of a dramatisation rather than just a reading of the text, but that's just my misunderstanding."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Penguin Classic Editions of any book are truly great. One should also note that Signet Classics is also Penguin but this version should only be brought if Penguin Classics is not available. Of course, one has to evaluate one's purpose for the book but Penguin always has notes and good Intros for their books.I purchased this book for a paper in which I had to choose a chapter and write about it. This version is really clear but is written as Milton would have written it so some of the old English is difficult but there are notes and major parts. The only problem I have with this edition is that there are no chapter titles so you really do not know what each chapter is about unless you read it."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"This stunning epic poem of the fall of both Lucifer &amp; man from God's good grace is full of all the self-indulgent goth agony to fuel a lifetime of bitter recrimination and despair.

I love to read, but I never would have finished this without an instructor to guide me through it and classmates to discuss it with. But....I LOVED IT! It was great! If I'd tried to read it on my own, I wouldn't have made it through one sentence, but since I had assistance (someone to help me understand the references and the time period it was written in) I found reading it an absolute pleasure. I am SO glad I read this book/immense poem. Just don't try to do it alone!!! (Ditto with Divine Comedy which is also supremely excellent but impossible to grasp by one's self). You gotta read this, but do it in a group. Guess I've said enough!!!"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"The Kindle edition is improperly typeset, right justified with an overly wide left margin.

I can&#8216;t write a review of a book that i simply can not get interested in. sorry"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I did get the general idea of the book (or poem) but it was very confusing the way it was written. I read about 25 percent of the book then I gave up. There were words in the book that were not even words according to the dictionary so I didn't know what their meaning was in relationship to the story(poem). I talked to my daughter-in-law who is a English Literature teacher at a college in Colorado; she said she had to read Paradise Lost while she was working on her college degree and if there was any way she would have been able to get out of reading it she would have but since it was part of her class she had to read it.If anyone has the patience to sit through this sort of writing this is for you."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"First off, let me say that we're not talking here about the famous Qi gong instructor named John Milton. We're talking about the famous 17th-century English poet who wrote _Paradise Lost_ and _Paradise Regained_, two of the most wonderfully overlong Christian poems in the history of Western literature.Your English teacher will tell you that _Paradise Lost_ \\"narrates the story of Adam and Eve's disobedience, explains how and why it happened, and places the story within the larger context of Satan's rebellion and Jesus' resurrection.\\" And you know that can't be far wrong, because SparkNotes says the exact same thing.But the main reason everyone should read Milton's grand epic is that it contains certain secrets about prayer.In PL, Milton reminds us how important it is, when we pray, to be absolutely specific. The Lord has a strange, often disturbing, sense of humour (PL, books I-XII). If you leave Him wiggle room, He will answer your prayer in a way you never intended, and then say it was your own damned fault, because your prayer contained seven types of ambiguity.John Milton writes from experience. Example: Almost every time a good-looking woman passed within view of John Milton, he suffered an involuntary erection. Daniel of the Old Testament might well have suffered such a condition without complaining, but John Milton found it onerous. John was both a Puritan and a student of Saint Augustine. He was not happy when he suffered an erection, he hated it, and he especially resented the women who made that thing happen to him.In a Latin letter to his friend, George Wither, John Milton reports that, in his youth, he would sometimes see a pretty woman even in his dreams at night, and suffer, not just an erection, but the whole nine yards, up to and including a nocturnal emission; which he trained himself to handle according to Scripture, thereby to purify himself (Deut. 23:10); but sometimes he was unable to wait that long before he handled it, which filled his soul full of Puritan remorse and self-reproach.At age 33, the poet took to wife a 16-year-old lolita named Mary Powell; and you may already have guessed the reason why, which is that she gave him an erection -- more accurately, she gave him \\"one damned erection after another,\\" without remission. (Giving John Milton an erection was not the girl's conscious intent, but it just happened to him, every time they met.) And since Christian marriage is Saint Paul's only approved method whereby to deal with that kind of torment, John Milton (being an honourable man) thought it best to marry the girl (1 Cor. 7:9).Frailty, thy name is woman! After two years of marriage - after just two years of witnessing those insufferable erections that could not be beaten down, or at least, not for long - the poet's young Puritan bride ran away and skipped back home to live with her mother, Mrs. Anne Powell, who likewise gave John an erection; which is why John Milton resented his mother-in-law as well as his estranged wife.Those were the hardest years of the poet's life - nothing but a daily struggle against involuntary erections, yet here he was, trapped in a loveless marriage to a barely pubescent teenager who lived with her entirely-too-attractive mother. Which is partly why John Milton wrote those four revolutionary Christian pamphlets, correcting Moses' and Jesus' hardline policy on divorce (Mark 10:11-12).In his Latin correspondence, some of which is preserved in the Bodleian Library, John Milton reports that he was fine when alone in his study, or when hobnobbing with Parliamentarians, or even when having a hasty pudding, or a figgy one, over at the Inns of Court; but let just one good-looker cross his path, showing good ankle between the hem of her dress and the top of her shoe, and it was boing! - instant erection, just like a spring-loaded mechanical device; causing John to exclaim bitterly, \\"Oh, God, please, not again! Save me from this penal fire!\\"It even happened to him once when Oliver Cromwell's wife, Elizabeth Bourchier Cromwell, bent over to pick up a handkerchief that had fallen to the floor. On that occasion there was a lamentable accident (\\"an hard mishap\\" [verbatim quote]) with John's ordinarily modest codpiece - an incident so humiliating that John never even wrote a poem about it, although he did apologise, profusely, to Oliver Cromwell, and to Mrs. Cromwell, who saw the whole thing, and then fainted. (John at the time was employed as Cromwell's Latin secretary.)By the way: It was modesty, not arrogance, that moved John Milton, after that embarrassing incident, to wear a baggy codpiece, with plenty of wiggle room.Which brings me back to the beginning, when I was explaining why you should give the Lord no wiggle room when you pray: John Milton took his problem to the Lord in prayer, stating in his journal, \\"Father, I pray Thee, let me not suffer a stiffe joynt when I see a beautifull woman.\\"And here's how the Lord answered that prayer, in 1651: He struck John Milton blind.At first, John thought that his blindness was a punishment for his own bad behaviour - which is how that whole thing got going, in Anglo-American Christianity, about how, if you are a boy who does what John Milton used to do, it could make you go blind. But God revealed to John, by means of a dream, that his blindness was actually an answer to his own prayers - because the poet had said, \\"Father, let me not suffer a stiff joint when I see a beautiful woman.\\"John Milton then said, \\"Lord, that is not what I meant, at all\\" - but it was too late to change the outcome, because the prayer was already answered.The erections that John Milton suffered in the years 1651-1674, and there were many, even after the Lord answered his prayer, were not from seeing a beautiful woman, it was actually because John had a condition that modern physicians call PSAS (\\"Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome\\"). So the chronic \\"stiffe joynt\\" problem was not really the women's fault, and it never was; but John Milton never knew that. Even when he wrote Paradise Lost (by dictation, from 1652-1667), John was still under the impression that women, seen or unseen, were to blame for his condition; which is why he makes all of those snide remarks in blank verse about your mother, Eve, in Books IV-V and IX-X of Paradise Lost. Because whenever he pictured Eve in his mind's eye, it was boing! - the same old problem. And there would come no more blank verse to his head for the next twenty minutes or so, until things settled down. John Milton hated that.But it all turned out for the best: if God had not answered John Milton's prayer in that unusual way, by blinding him, Paradise Lost might never have been completed, and sold to the publisher, Sam Simmons, in 1667, for 5 - which was a tidy sum for a religious poem during the decadent Restoration era.It was while writing the early books of Paradise Lost that John was introduced to Katherine, a ship captain's daughter, a fat woman whom he had never seen (because he was blind); whom he nonetheless married in 1656, but not for the same old reason as before: John asked fat Kate to marry him (a.) because he needed secretarial assistance with Paradise Lost, and (b.) because Katherine did not have the same pernicious effect on him as Mary Powell and her mother Anne had done. John could dictate blank verse to Kate all night long without feeling so much as a tingle down there.Kate's surname was Woodcock. Beelzebub made a little joke about that: he said, \\"The Lord finally gave John Milton just what he always wanted.\\"- L."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I took a course on /Paradise Lost/ this past semester.

I suggest this to Milton scholars as well.)*feminist/gender studies*any literature or popular culture that addresses the fall from grace after Milton does*anything else you can think of to be geeky aboutYou could read /Paradise Lost/ through the lens of pretty much any interest, it's that dense.

The language and Milton's own belief of Christanity is one of the main reasons this unique epic was so popular during his time, and why it has remained one of the worlds greatest epics still today. Unlike other epics written at the time, Milton tries to stay away from war as being his central subject. Instead, he writes of more nobler topics. The whole idea that the entire universe is guided by God's providenc, is captured in this epic unlike any other."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I just finished the Penguin paperback version of this book with the foreward by John Leonard. Of course the Poem itself is wonderful, magnificent, and all that.But I really wanted to say that the introduction by John Leonard is marvelous, as are all of the footnotes.

The audacity of Milton opening the poem with declareing that he's going to pursue things unattempted in prose or rhyme and to justify the ways of God to men is enough to get people reading to ifinity. The succsesfull attempt to tell the orgin of Hell and the story of Adam and Eve outside of the bible is a daring mission Milton puts himself through but comes out joyusly triumphant.

I discovered it when I was barely thirteen and have reread it almost a hundred times. It inspired me to read more, write my own stories, and major in English. What I do not like is this edition.

Maybe it's my edition and if that's the case, then some one needs to give this inferior edition a new ISBN to separate it from the edition with Dor&eacute; and Blake engravings, if that does exist.Don't get me wrong the artwork is good, the amount detail on the angels and humans is stunning; but of course Satan looks like he was hit in the face with a shovel. Where in the poem did it say Satan's hair is made out of snakes? or that he has horns that look like elbow macaroni? I was expecting illustrations of grandeur and rebellion and instead got these stiff and sorry excuses. Be forewarned, you are in for a let down if you are expecting well known illustrations.

All of his works have been amazing !"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"This epic poem, contained in a series of 12 books is a must-read for any who wish to expand their knowledge of literature, religion, and human nature. Each book in the poem is preceded by Milton's argument, which provides a plot summary of that particular book. To really understand Milton, the dedicated scholar must go above, underneath, around, through and most importantly, beyond the plot. Through this poem, Milton poses alarming questions regarding the nature of God and Satan, Heaven and Hell, Good and Evil. Satan is the hero of the work. By this I do not mean to say that Satan is a hero, but simply that he was the antagonist of this tale, in the same way that Oedipus was the antogonist of his. This is a profound work that will question every belief that the Christian and Jewish faithful hold to be true. It is only through this constant questioning that we are able to find our true faith. If you find that this poem causes you to lose faith in God, you didn't have true faith in the first place. Those who are believers of God will find that questioning their faith will only serve to strengthen it."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"This is easily some of the best prose ever recorded. The stories related are Milton's interpretation of the war of the heavens, and man's expulsion from paradise, on earth. The words dance and sing above the pages, forming phrases that when spoken aloud are akin to your tongue parting your lover's lips for the first time after a lengthy courtship. This demands to be read, re-read-----studied, digested, and especially to be read aloud, for phonetically the lyricism expands dramatically, collapsing to a honed edge, then cuts to the very marrow of your being. It is not necessary to believe in the Judeo-Christian faith to be floored by this book, it kicks English up to the realm of the Romance Languages, pick it up today."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"This is a highly recommended book by practically everyone who has read it.

I was of course aware that scholars considered it a great work, a classic. But it seemed a bit daunting - long, difficult, dated, and possibly no longer relevant.A few years ago I made two fortunate decisions. I elected to read Milton's Paradise Lost and I bought the Norton Critical Edition (edited by Scott Elledge). I read and reread Paradise Lost over a period of three months as well as the 300 pages of the Norton critical commentary. I was stunned by the beauty and power of Milton. Why had I waited so long to even approach such a literary masterpiece?Make no mistake. I had been right in several ways. Paradise Lost is difficult, it is long, and full appreciation requires an understanding of the historical and religious context. But Paradise Lost is a remarkable achievement. It explores questions regarding man and God that are as relevant today as in the 17th century. And the genius of Milton has never been surpassed.I found the Norton footnotes extremely helpful - definitions for rare or archaic words and expressions, explanations of the historical context, and links to the critical commentary section. The footnotes are at the page bottom, making them readily accessible.The Norton biographical, historical, and literary commentaries were fascinating in their own right. I may well as spent as many hours reading commentary as with Paradise Lost itself.John Milton led a remarkable life. His enthusiastic euology on Shakespeare was included in the second folio edition of Shakespeare in 1632. This was Milton's first public appearance as an author! While traveling as a young man he &quot;found and visited&quot; the great Galileo, old and blind, a house prisoner of the Inquisition for his astronomical heresy. Years later Milton, a close supporter of Cromwell, barely escaped the scaffold at the Restoration and was at risk for some period afterwards. Many considered Milton no more than an outcast, now old and blind himself, a republican and regicide who had escaped death by too much clemency. Within a few years this aging blind outcast created one of the masterpieces of the English language.Milton broke all English tradition by writing Paradise Lost in blank verse. Homer in Greek and Vergil in Latin had used blank verse, but English demanded rhyme. Although others failed to imitate Milton's blank verse (I suspect that none wanted to be compared directly with genius), the praise was without exception. Dryden, a master of rhyme, is attributed with saying, &quot;This man cuts us all out, and the ancients too&quot;.Milton's characterization of Satan, Adam, Eve, the archangels Raphael, Michael, and Gabriel, and even God himself are masterful. The debates and arguments that evolve around free will, obedience, forbidden knowledge, love, evil, and guilt are timeless. And fascinating. And thought provoking.Paradise Lost will require commitment and patience and thought. The commitment in time is substantial. (I enjoy Samuel Johnson's subtle comment: &quot;None ever wished it longer than it is.&quot;) But the return is a personal experience with great literature, one of the masterpieces of the English language. I consider myself fortunate to have made such an investment."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I have read \\"Paradise Lost\\" four times, and took no less than three semesters on it at university. This was the edition we used to work. Modernised spelling, coherent punctuation (plus variations of it in the notes), good introduction, and enormous work in the notes; this edition has all you need for a good reading of the epic poem.As to the poem itself, some people are hard on it for all the wrong reasons. Remember that it is a 17th century poem, that English was not exactly similar as it is today, and that there are many, many words which were first used in English in \\"Paradise Lost\\". Milton was innovative with words, and he gave English new words, and expressions, such as the most famous \\"all Hell broke loose\\", which was first uttered in \\"Paradise Lost\\".A poem like this cannot be read without good notes, and this is what this edition has to offer. Notes aren't enough, though, they have to be good, and in this edition, they are. The poem itself is not burdened by the numbers of the notes, because there are so many, the editor decided not to show them in the text per se, but at the end of the book, you will always have the reference, the lines, which the notes are about.As to the poem itself, if you don't know it, you certainly know of the story of the Fall of Man, Adam and Eve, and the rebellion of Satan in Heaven. I'll only say that Milton's God is one seriously problematic figure in the poem, and that it caused centuries of academic discussion as to whether Milton's God is a good God or a devilish one, whether \\"Paradise Lost\\" was truly a \\"myth\\", in the old sense of a story which explains why we're here and how it got to be, or whether it was an attack on Christianity. Scholars still discuss this today, so make your own mind if you can!"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I love Norton Critical Editions. Or I try to. Gordon Teskey's new edition of Paradise Lost is for the most part worthy of the praise it has received in other reviews on this site. However, it has one unpardonable flaw, which is the editor's tampering with Milton's poetic line. Teskey and the Norton editors have for some reason decided to make it \\"easy to read\\" by adding parentheses to complex syntactical passages that Milton wrote on purpose to be. . . I dunno. . . hard? This move to simplify the syntax alters not only the experience of the poem but, worse, its meaning. Take for example these famous lines of Satan's from Book I, the first words spoken in Hell:If thou beest he but O how fall'n! how changedFrom him who in the happy realms of lightClothed with transcendent brightness didst outshineMyriads, thought bright! if he whom mutual league,United thoughts and counsels, equal hope. . .The meaning of the lines is confusing because Satan himself is confused, and now speaking for the first time a fallen language. The \\"he\\" from line one gets dropped until line four, when Satan remembers what he's talking about after wandering through a few memories of his life before the fall. The reader is supposed to feel the confusion and torment of this run-on sentence. But Teskey uses parentheses to clean up the very mess Milton wanted Satan to make of the sentence:If thou beest he (but O how fallen! how changedFrom him who in the happy realms of lightClothed with transcendent brightness didst outshineMyriads, though bright) if he whom. . .This effectively dumbs down the poem and drastically changes it. And there is way too much of it in this edition. It is common enough to modernize spelling and syntax in editions of early modern poetry, but this is a bit too much. Readers don't buy this book because they want an easy read; most readers, even students, don't mind if it is a little hard and confusing in parts. Mostly, I bet they want to see what Milton and not his editors wrote."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"When John Milton set out to write Paradise Lost, he had every intention of writing a masterpiece of the English language. He felt he was destined for greatness, and his creation does not disappoint. With over 9000 lines of some of the greatest poetry every written, Milton does an incredible job of using classical and biblical allusions within a classical format to create a surprisingly modern and incredibly poignant look at the nature of God and man. Add on to this the fact that he was blind when he composed it, and you cannot call PL anything less than a work of genius.What separates this version from all the others available? The incredibly detailed work of the editors. The annotations of this edition are absolutely fantastic. They are plentiful (sometimes taking up as much as half a page), extremely informative, and surprisingly fun to read. Most annotated works such as this merely clarify antiquated vocabulary, but in this case the editors point out classical allusions, references to current events, and references to Milton's prose works. In addition to the prose and poetry associated with the text, the editors routinely mention the critical discourse (of which there is an unholy amount) associated with Milton. There are even moments where I laughed out loud at their comments. There is also a subtle touch to the annotations, in that there is no indication of annotations within the line. What I mean by this is that there are no bubbles or footnote marks in the body of the poem. The annotations at the bottom of the page simply point to a line number. This allows the reader to ignore the annotations if they choose to do so.Another nice characteristic of this edition is the artwork and illustrations included. There's some really fantastic stuff in there.All in all, this is an excellent edition of an excellent poem."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I have other editions of Paradise Lost, many with lengthy and preachy introductions, but this one has become my favourite. The design is beautiful, with a great cover, blood red inside covers and red ribbon marker. The original engravings that illustrate the story are a unique feature and look great.The introduction and notes on all chapters written by Philip Pullman are short, refreshing and suprisingly funny. Even if you studied Paradise in depth, his comments may shed new light on this classic work. As he reminds the readers, these are his views as a fan rather than a scholar, and he tries to clear some cobwebs that gathered on Milton's opus and bring it closer into focus for the modern readers. Among his references are Alfred Hitchcock's movies and novels of Frederick Forsyth. And he tackles that age old dilema- if he is so evil, why do we find Lucifer so damn likeable...?If you want to read Paradise Lost for the first time, possibly after/before devouring Pullman's own Dark Materials trilogy, look no further than this beautiful edition. And even if you have other copies, this is a great addition to your home library. Nothing wrong with a good looking book, when the content matches the design in quality, as it is the case here."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Paradise Lost is my favorite work in the English language, and this is my favorite edition of it (I have quite a few). The editor, Roy Flannagan, does a superb job with the footnotes. They address just about every question a modern reader might have, provide plenty of historical context and explain in detail the zillions of references and names that someone who is not intimately familiar with all of Milton's sources (among them the Bible and ancient Greek and Roman mythology) will have a hard time understanding. Flannagan's infectious enthusiasm for this poem comes across loud and clear, and he never condescends to readers that lack a PhD, like Merritt Hughes does in his scholarly edition of Paradise Lost. Finally, the page layout of the Flannagan edition makes reading and note taking real easy. In sum, this is hands down the best edition of Paradise Lost."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Interesting but skimpy comments from Philip Pullman, but the real attractions are a very clean and historically sensitive page design and the Michael Burghers engravings from the first illustrated edition of 1688. I own other PL's, but from now on this is the one I will take down to read."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I was assigned to read Paradise Lost on my own over the summer and I am so glad that I chose the Norton Critical edition. Obviously, reading Paradise Lost is a daunting task for anyone who isn't a religious historian and without the Norton Critical edition, I might not have finished the epic at all (which would be much of a loss, not only in my grades.)This edition has a vast array of extremely helpful footnotes (have a Bible at hand for all those cross-references) and it has large margins for taking plenty of notes of your own. More than half of the book is a collection of various literature, excerpts and explanations that are also quite helpful.Certainly, there is no doubt that Paradise Lost is an excellent work, but the Norton Critical edition is invaluable for any average person (like me) who wants to truly appreciate it. I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"There are so many editions of Milton's epic, so how does someone interested in owning a copy choose from the crowd? Unfortunately there are not many &quot;bad&quot; editions of Milton's poetry, so the decision requires effort, and every editor has their own interpretation (which is more or less valid than others') of their author. (Indeed, editors are always like secondary authors.) First a few quick words about NCEs. All have bigraphical, historical, literary backgrounds, and criticism that are outside the text (in this case _PL_) and are useful, or at the least interesting. But I do not advocate the NCE edition of _PL_ for these reasons though they are rewarding. Rather I encourage those who are interested in Milton, _PL_, and poetry to get a copy of the NCE because of its editor's philosophy on footnotes. The footnotes are what separate one edition of poetry from another, and Scott Elledge's footnotes to _PL_ were made with the following prescription: &quot;No one, I think, should interrupt his or her first reading of a poem, or a substantial part of it, by looking to the bottom of the page for help. The best way to read is to listen to the poet , the way one listens to someone speaking; then if one is attracted to what one hears, or is curious about it, one can go back over the poem, or a passage in it, consulting the notes. In my opinion one should read a poem before one begins to study it&quot; (2). Finally, Elledges, footnotes to _PL_ are so rewarding to read because of their etymological emphasis."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I am always glad for an occasion to tread \\"with wand'ring steps and slow\\" through the lines of \\"Paradise Lost\\" yet once more. When I found out that Gordon Teskey, to my mind the great poet's strongest reader in many years, had edited a new Norton Critical Edition, I knew it was time to travel the path again. As his predecessor Scott Elledge did for a previous generation, Professor Teskey has created an edition and charted a reading experience of enormous richness for contemporary students and general readers alike, and forged a tool of unique value for teachers at all levels. The text is well edited, as it must be, with helpful but judicious modernization of some spelling. The footnotes are measured, thorough but never gratuitously scholastic, to serve the process of active reading. This is not an easy poem and no editor can change that, but one travels through it faster, though steady at speed, with Professor Teskey at one's side. The critical apparatus is also strikingly well done, with modern essays usefully divided by topics, such as 'On Satan' and 'On Feminism', in a manner that will serve all audiences well. Along with retaining essays by past titans of Milton criticism, from Marvell to T.S. Eliot, as well as much of the canonical modern criticism present in earlier Norton editions, this volume includes some of the best critical voices of the last twenty years, among them William Flesch, Regina Schwartz, Archie Burnett, Julia Walker and Mary Ann Radzinowicz. But these new contributions have been chosen, it seems to me, with a very judicious focus on their own lasting canonical value, rather than merely on their more recent dates of publication. Whether out of deference or editorial privilege, Professor Teskey saves the last word for himself in a short selection from an essay that has since become a chapter in his new book, \\"Delirious Milton\\" (Harvard, 2006), in which he charts a history of philosophical modernity through an inspired analysis of Milton's view of creation, divine and human. Whether you are coming to \\"Paradise Lost\\" for the first or the twentieth time, make this edition your primary text and make Professor Teskey's new study the next book you read. If you do, you'll experience a very fortunate fall followed by a delirium of the happiest sort."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I'm 16, and I had to read this book for school.

His writing style reflected his deep personal convictions, a passion for freedom and self-determination during a time of religious and political disturbance. He is named among history as one of the most influential protectors of free speech and freedom of the press.Paradise Lost describes the fall of a Heavenly being, named Lucifer, who wanted take over the throne of Heaven and become equal with God. Lucifer's journey began when he believed himself to be in bondage. Legions of Heavenly beings band together with Lucifer and attempted to DE-throne God (46). Lucifer's name was changed to \\"Satan\\" (46). Satan then comes in the form of a \\"serpent to the Garden of Eden\\" (119-120).While in Paradise, he met Adam and Eve in their \\"happy state\\"; however, they were forbidden from eating from the \\"tree of knowledge\\" under the penalty of death (120). Satan devised a plan to tempt them to rebel against God and eat of the \\"tree of knowledge\\"; therefore, causing Adam and Eve to fall from God's grace and there began the fall of man (235). Satan continues to roam common day earth to tempt man to rebel against God. Satan's goal is to bring as many of mankind into his army as he possibly can.In the beginning, God created Paradise for man and woman to live and have all their needs and wants met by Him. Lucifer's fall from the Kingdom of God resulted in man's fall from God's grace and loss of Paradise. This book is recommended for adults who are seeking understanding of the consequences brought about by one's desire for power and control.A fictional elaboration of nonfictional events is a wonderful representation of the religious horror genera recommended to fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S LuisReviewed by Joshua a high school student for which this book was recommend by a friend. Joshua found this book to be thought provoking and increased his desire to regain Paradise in Heaven."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"First of all, this book is not easy to read but it IS worth the time and effort. Because it is actually a poem written as a book, there is difficulty reading it. Also, the language of Milton's time is quite different from our modern-day language. But if you can overcome these problems, you will find a brilliantly written poem/story that will keep you mesmerized especially if you know the general background of the story."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I was hoping for an edition of the poem that would help wade through the arcane verbiage and perspective of a 350-year-old mind. I was hoping for an introduction, glossary, and notes to help with the task. This book has none of that, only the bare text of the poem. Other reviews said that it had good notes. There must be some confusion of editions because this one has nothing. The only reason I did not return it was because it was not expensive and therefore not worth my time to send it back."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"This is one of my favorite texts for diving into and reveling in Milton. The editor, Barbara K. Lewalski, has chosen the Spelling and Capitaliztion that i prefer, wherein the nouns are capitalized and italized.

Just look out for a Bantam or Signet mass market paperback to satisfy one's curiosity or school requirement. But for those would consider the investing in the Riverside or the Modern Library editions, etc. then also consider this labor of Lewalski to bring Milton to the us."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Many people I know, (including myself), have a dismal view of poetry, especially epic poems. Those who have had to plod our way through the excruciating Middle English of the Canterbury Tales, the old English of Beowulf, or the now obscure references of the Roman propagandist's Aeneid are rightfully wary of yet another long tale set to verse.However, I implore the fence sitter to put aside their prejudices and read this book. Unlike all the other famous epic poems, John Milton writes in modern English. Not only that, his writing is absolutely beautiful and enthralling, even for a modern reader. In addition, unlike other epic poems that may have turned off the reader to this art form, John Milton's subject material is approachable and understandable to the modern reader without having to read other books or notes to inform as to the plot of the story. Why is this so? The Aeneid, the Odyssey, and Dante's inferno were written for different times and audiences. The normal reader cannot approach the first two without substantial background reading in Greek and Roman history (and religion). The inferno spends have its time describing the tortures of Dante's enemies (who you don't know of or care about). John Milton, on the other hand, is writing about the Book of Genesis, a story that most in our culture are well versed in. You'll know the main characters (if not all the minor ones), which will give a grounding for Milton's expansion of the story. Aside for the story itself, Milton's philosophical themes are also more modern than any other famous epic poem. Individuality, disobedience, love, redemption, all of these are common themes that Milton expounds upon. You won't spend many pages concerned with the social structure of a vanished civilization.To conclude, Paradise Lost is a work of Genius. This book is important for overall literacy (just think of all the books that have taken titles and inspiration from its lines). That usually means that the book will be a pill, but not in this case. Milton's verse makes the lines fly by."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"The book stands out not only for its beautiful illustrations by Gustave Dore (unarguably one of the most cherished illustrators of all times), but also for the marvelous quality of this edition.The book is quite big (at first I thought it was huge) - but it is not so heavy, the jacket bares a label in golden relief, the hardcover repeats the design without the relief quality, the print is fine and so is the paper, the font is well chosen so that it makes the text easy to read, each song has a short synopsis at the beginning so that one can quickly overlook the plot.AND last but not the least - the insanely high ratio quality/price!!!!!

And I started again, put it down, and it stood, neglected, at book three. So anyway, I decided to take a course on Milton, as I had (poorly) read his major work. And it is one of the most amazing works to have gotten through. Book Nine: Satan makes yet another soliloquy (avengers are, in the end, alone). He reflects on his fall, and sees that Eden is better than Heaven, for what omnipotent creator would make a lesser creation? (Milton loved the pastoral ideal: i.e. farmers/ nature, as per Greek Elysium) And Satan laments that he will not (not cannot) stay in Eden or go back to Heaven unless as a conquerer; he laments that he is to destroy Man, whom he admires, and Earth, which he loves, in order to strike at the God who slighted him (he created/appointed his Son as King in Heavan, and Lucifer had previously been #2) and damned him. He reflects on the fact that his former, huge, mighty state must enter the beastial snake, but accepts it as necissary. It's a soloquy that rivals, if not surpasses, the &quot;better to reign...&quot; one. Definitely read this, but it is best read when accompanied by critique/observations from another: it'll really draw out the story, the author, and the subtlties: such as the ideas of IDEAL gender roles."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"It helps clarify the fall of man and the devil's role.

Because Milton was essentially a self contained encyclopedia, the footnotes (which are detailed but not verbose) are very helpful in explaining some of the more obscure references included in the text. My only gripes are that in certain areas (as the editor wholly admits) the syntax has been changed, slightly altering the mood and at times the message I believe Milton had in mind. Also, the in-depth information regarding the names of characters and places that was included as footnotes in the second edition has been moved to a glossary in the third edition, making reference a little more difficult.

Christians and non-Christians alike should marvel at the vision presented by Milton. He is not a Satanist, as the Romantics would have you believe. Indeed, he is a devout Christian. This is what makes the work so extraordinary. Milton's vision of the astral world invokes various responses from the reader, all of them genuine and some contradictory. No matter who you are or what you believe, you will thoroughly enjoy this imaginary look into the events surrounding the fall of Lucifer and the beginnings of man in the Garden of Eden."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"OK so an epic poem based on the Christian doctrine of original sin wouldn't be the first thing that popped into my mind when I was looking for a good summer read. But since I heard that William Blake and Edgar Allen Poe thought that Paradise Lost was the greatest poem ever by the greatest writer in the English language, I figured I'd take their word and give it a shot. I trust their opinions in such matters.After finishing the thing, my main thought is that you'd have to be a great writer to pull this story off. This is a long, loud cheer for the Renaissance status quo of stodgy European social hierarchy and ancient Christian beliefs, and to us non-European non-Christians, all this stuff is at best annoying and at worst infuriating. The Almighty Father is smug and self-satisfied, his Beloved Son is a simpering goody-two-shoes, and the angels are the swaggering authority figures we all roll our eyes at. No wonder the romantics thought Satan was the hero of the story.Despite all this, and the fact that you already know the ending, and the fact that none of your friends ever bother to read epic poems, Paradise Lost snaps along pretty well. That alone is a testament to just how great a writer John Milton was. And whether you think the story line is gospel truth or an eye roller, you'd have to be tin-eared to miss the beauty of Milton's language. Take this passage, where everybody's favorite fallen angel is about to leave his brimstoney digs in his quest across Chaos to Earth:Into this wild Abyss the wary FiendStood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,Pondering his voyage (1)This is high art with blank verse. The way the consonants sound together: \\"wild,\\" \\"wary,\\" and \\"while;\\" the cadence of the words perfectly setting off \\"the brink\\" to make it a brink in the sentence; the pause to ponder at the end; all form a powerful image of the devil standing between Hell and primordial Chaos, and put you right there with him- pondering along. Paradise Lost is full of such gorgeous passages, and deserves the praise heaped upon it. Can't say enough good things about the language.But \\"greatest poem ever\\" is a pretty bold claim, and although the language is easily in the realm of masterpiece, the story line has too many flaws to put Paradise Lost up against other great works of English literature. Here's why I think it ranks lower.The original Eden story in Genesis is a revolutionary and powerful myth from the dawn of man's consciousness, and it concerns itself with topics quite different than those which Christian doctrine later associated with it. You have to go back and read Genesis without baggage to see it, but the Eden story is about how people, God, and nature relate to each other, and how mankind transitioned from gatherers to farmers on their way to the Hebrew's preferred profession of shepherding. There's no sex, no Satan, there are several interesting mysteries now mostly ignored, and although God is undeniably angry at being disobeyed, nothing is labeled as evil and there's no mention of sin. (2)As different philosophies developed through the ages, the story of Eden was re-interpreted. Several hundred years after Genesis (3), the pseudipigraphical \\"Life of Adam and Eve\\" (4) added Satan to the story. The idea of the fall of man and the need for him to be redeemed came in with the early Christians maybe two hundred years after that. And the idea of concupiscence and original sin was cooked up by Irenaeus and Augustine after another century or two more. (5) Fast forward a thousand years from there to Milton's time, and people's main theological concerns had progressed to twisted psychological conundrums like theodicy (6) and free will vs. predestination, which were a huge leap from the simple concerns about sustenance and obedience that were most important to the authors of Genesis.Milton attempts to reconcile this modern load of concepts back into the original Bible verses. He adds a few flourishes of his own, including sinless sex in Eden, demonic Gothic architecture, and perhaps the high point of the poem where Adam chooses to eat the fruit out of love and \\"fall\\" with Eve to share her doom. But for the most part, Milton sticks with the standard Christian doctrine of his time. Wherever this doesn't fit into the original story, he bangs on equivocating, apologizing, or just repeating the idea often enough that he thinks you won't call him on it. The result is that Paradise Lost commits the literary sin of too much telling rather than showing. At times this gets downright tiresome.One of the most easily demonstrated examples of this problem is Milton's treatment of God's curse on the serpent. At the time Genesis was written, the serpent was a powerful mythic being in his own right: spirit of primordial nature and guardian of immortality. For the crime of convincing the woman to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge, God curses the serpent to crawl around, eat dirt, and scare women. Genesis leaves it to the reader to interpret the serpent's motivation. One thing is clear: God's curse of the serpent shows that God is in control and has absolute dominion over nature. This was revolutionary at the time when nature was the most powerful thing around, would easily kill you if you didn't watch out, and everybody else worshiped nature gods.Fast forward a few hundred years and mankind had subdued nature to the point that other people posed the bigger threat. So the people of that time invented a humanoid devil and associated him with the earlier biblical \\"accuser\\" (\\"satani\\") from Numbers and Job. In the \\"Life of Adam and Eve\\" from that period, Satan is introduced as the enemy of mankind and (in most versions) the same being as the serpent. In Milton's age, the serpent symbol had so little power left that Milton has Satan as a wholly autonomous being who possesses a heretofore inconsequential snake to disguise himself. Paradise Lost has to spend a verse to justify why Satan chooses this particular animal rather than say, a monkey or a squirrel, and Milton ends up with a weak circular reference back to King James' Genesis:...for, in the wily snakeWhatever sleights, none would suspicious mark,As from his wit and native subtletyProceeding; (7)In recognition of Milton's genius, I must say that once Satan possesses said snake, he proceeds to deliver to Eve 50 lines of as tempting an argument as you could imagine any devil could make, and this is a masterful work of art that powerfully presents the Christian interpretation of the story. (8) Unfortunately though, since Milton laboriously and repeatedly expounds upon Satan's sin and evil nature, when the time comes for God to deliver his curse on Satan, Genesis' original curse of the snake doesn't fit at all, and Milton has to tap-dance awkwardly around the discrepancy:...yet God at lastTo Satan first in sin his doom applied,Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best:And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. (9)Sorry, but you just can't put stuff like this in your poem and still be in the running for the greatest ever. The competition's too stiff. Shakespeare and the Beowulf writer advance to round two.I'm going to complain about one more thing before wrapping this up. There is a passage in book five which dropped my jaw, and not in a good way, where Milton mentions Galileo's telescope in a kind of Renaissance pop-culture reference. To set the scene: the Almighty has just sent the angel Raphael down to warn Adam that Satan is going to try to mess things up in Eden. Raphael looks down on earth from heaven with his super-powered angelic vision and sees Earth's details clearly, even though he is a celestial distance away...As when by night the glassOf Galileo, less assured, observesImagined lands and regions in the moon (10)(Jaw drops here.) So Milton didn't like Galileo? Milton thought Galileo was wrong? This sent me off to research Milton and Galileo. Apparently, Milton visited Galileo once on a European tour. Most of the references I could find emphasize the parallels between Milton and Galileo: both blinded, both political prisoners, etc. (11) Wait a minute. If Milton had such an affinity for Galileo, how come he goes out of his way here to diss Galileo and cast doubt on Galileo's real observations in contrast to his fictional angel's? By calling Galileo's observations \\"imagined\\", Milton is siding with the Inquisition, and putting himself on the wrong side of history.Now I know you can't look back almost four hundred years and fault a person for not seeing things in a modern way, but this is no small mistake for the \\"greatest poem ever.\\" The Renaissance church's rejection of science was among the worst ideas in dozens of millennia of human history, and Galileo got it dead right and Milton and the Church (and arguably, most everybody else) got it dead wrong. Religion had been the dominant institution of culture and knowledge from the dawn of man's consciousness up to Milton's time, when the church, in its power-madness, turned away from striving for competence and understanding truth to a childish because-I-said-so view of the world. Galileo was one of the major innovators of his time who was able to bring revolutionary new truths to western civilization, and those truths were threatening to the stale, orthodox power structure of the Renaissance church.Instead of embracing the new thinking and opening institutions of research and learning, the church made a horrible mistake by rejecting science, and opened the rift we still see today between the faiths that modern people claim to believe and the facts that they know to be true. To earn the title of the greatest poem ever, Milton could have reconciled Christian mythology with the new ideas of empiricism, and turned Paradise Lost into the new Bible. Instead he chose to spend his energies reinforcing the power structures of his time and missed his opportunity.One of the most compelling themes in the original Eden story is the juxtaposition of progress with defiance of authority and negative consequences. You can't gain something valuable without giving something else up. You can't bring in a new idea without disrupting the current order. Adam and Eve lose their life of leisure in Eden by gaining knowledge of good and evil. The Christians lose the meaning of the Eden story when they re-define it as the wholly sinful \\"fall of man\\" to give Jesus something to redeem. If you ask me, I like my Genesis straight up and undiluted; read raw from the original with all its power and balance of conflicting ideas intact.The Genesis authors understood very well the tension between honoring tried-and-true traditions and defying conventional wisdom to innovate and improve their lives. They struck out on their own and rewrote the mythology of their time. In my opinion, John Milton's failure to do the same and his parroting of the mythology of his time is Paradise Lost's primary sin. Genesis is challenging and revolutionary. Paradise Lost is pedantic, overstated orthodoxy. Its relentless emphasis on obedience to authority makes it seem more like political propaganda than spiritual inspiration, and it ignores many of the richest and most illuminating aspects of Genesis.Five stars for the language, deduct a star and a half for degrading the original story and sucking up to authority. Selah.(1) John Milton, Paradise Lost. Book 2:917-919(2) The idea of the Garden of Eden without sex or sin may seem shocking to many readers, and each of the topics mentioned above deserves its own essay. But that would take us far away from a critique of Paradise Lost. Here are two quick, simple points. First none of these elements are mentioned in a literal reading of the story and must be interpreted in. Second, in the case of sex and sin, both are mentioned explicitly quite close to the Eden story in Genesis, but not in it. I assume this was deliberate.(3) There are widely varying estimates on the year Genesis was written. A summary is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_the_Bible. Interestingly, the more conservative you are, the earlier you believe Genesis was written, so the bigger the gap in time between the original and the introduction of Satan. I figured \\"several hundred years\\" was safe.(4) (...)(5) (...)(6) Theodicy means trying to figure out how there can be evil in the world if the world is ruled by an all-good and all--powerful God.(7) Paradise Lost. Book 9:90-93(8) Paradise Lost. Book 9:678-731(9) Paradise Lost. Book 10:171-174(10) Paradise Lost. Book 5:261-263(11) Jonathan Rosen, \\"Return to Paradise,\\" The New Yorker, June 2008, (...). Also see Milton's defense of Galileo's right to free speech in his \\"Areopagitica,\\" (...). To me this doesn't offset the bad judgment of the comment in Paradise Lost, but makes it worse because it demonstrates that Milton should have known better."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"First of all I want to say that reading Milton is very difficult at best and impossible at worst. So if you really want to read this don't be turned down if you have problems.

Not only because of the (my point of view) wonderful and amazing language. But only because this is better than the story told in the Bible !!!Really because the Bible has left us hundreds of unanswered questions and a story that doesn't make any sense at all. While Milton present us a story wish shows us all motives and gives us all the answers. Non of the philosophical are left unanswered. Therefore I can give him only praise for he succeeds there where thousands and thousands of religious people have failed.In the end Milton gives us that what he promised.\\"To explain the ways of God to men.\\" (I don't remember the exact quote.)So be aware of that what you are going to read and remember that before you lays not only one of the greatest epics ever told (I can compare this even to Iliad and the Devine Comedy) but also one of the best religious books (I can compare it even to the Bible and the Dhammapada).This book stands on a lonely height."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"A Christian classiic which I had difficulty following.

I find the way it obscures meaning and ebroiders every last thought in metaphor and simile to be frustrating and distracting. I'm so busy trying to figure out what each line means that I forget where I am in the overall scheme of things.After making my way through The Oddysey, Beowulf and the Divine Comedy, I thought I could handle Milton's Paradise Lost. I was wrong.I make it a personal mission that try to I finish every book I start. In the last 10 years, I can remember having failed in this only 4 times:- On The Origin of Species (Charles Darwin);- The Republic (Plato);- The Four-Gated City (Doris Lessing); and- Paradise Lost by John Milton.My major criticisms include the following:- Sentences are drawn out to intolerable length, stacked with metaphor upon metaphor, until I get halfway down the page and I've forgotten how the sentence started!- Although stated at the start of the book that rhyme was deliberately avoided, I found the absence of any rhyme reduced the poetic impact for me.- It was hard to fall into the metre of the verse, which made it more difficult for me to get into the flow of the tale (possibly related to the lack of rhyme stated above).- The decriptions were so flowery and interwoven that I often found that what I thought was a decription of one entity was in fact two or more!In the end, I just couldn't do it.To be fair though, of the small section I read (I got to the end of Book III I think) there were a few passages which were clear enough that I was able to appreciate the beauty of the language. Also, I appreciated the way Milton attempted to characterise the War in Heaven and its aftermath. Such a critical foundation of Judeo-Christian theology is given short shrift in the Bible and other works; giving it some depth was a valiant effort. But there weren't enough of the good parts to keep me engaged, more's the pity.This may be a cornerstone of English literature, but it wasn't for me. If you enjoy thick, dense poetry, and apocryphal theology, then enjoy with my blessing. It was too much for me."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"First off, let me say that we're not talking here about the famous Qi gong instructor named John Milton. We're talking about the famous 17th-century English poet who wrote _Paradise Lost_ and _Paradise Regained_, two of the most wonderfully overlong Christian poems in the history of Western literature.Your English teacher will tell you that _Paradise Lost_ \\"narrates the story of Adam and Eve's disobedience, explains how and why it happened, and places the story within the larger context of Satan's rebellion and Jesus' resurrection.\\" And you know that can't be far wrong, because SparkNotes says the exact same thing.But the main reason everyone should read Milton's grand epic is that it contains certain secrets about prayer.In PL, Milton reminds us how important it is, when we pray, to be absolutely specific. The Lord has a strange, often disturbing, sense of humour (PL, books I-XII). If you leave Him wiggle room, He will answer your prayer in a way you never intended, and then say it was your own damned fault, because your prayer contained seven types of ambiguity.John Milton writes from experience. Example: Almost every time a good-looking woman passed within view of John Milton, he suffered an involuntary erection. Daniel of the Old Testament might well have suffered such a condition without complaining, but John Milton found it onerous. John was both a Puritan and a student of Saint Augustine. He was not happy when he suffered an erection, he hated it, and he especially resented the women who made that thing happen to him.In a Latin letter to his friend, George Wither, John Milton reports that, in his youth, he would sometimes see a pretty woman even in his dreams at night, and suffer, not just an erection, but the whole nine yards, up to and including a nocturnal emission; which he trained himself to handle according to Scripture, thereby to purify himself (Deut. 23:10); but sometimes he was unable to wait that long before he handled it, which filled his soul full of Puritan remorse and self-reproach.At age 33, the poet took to wife a 16-year-old lolita named Mary Powell; and you may already have guessed the reason why, which is that she gave him an erection -- more accurately, she gave him \\"one damned erection after another,\\" without remission. (Giving John Milton an erection was not the girl's conscious intent, but it just happened to him, every time they met.) And since Christian marriage is Saint Paul's only approved method whereby to deal with that kind of torment, John Milton (being an honourable man) thought it best to marry the girl (1 Cor. 7:9).Frailty, thy name is woman! After two years of marriage - after just two years of witnessing those insufferable erections that could not be beaten down, or at least, not for long - the poet's young Puritan bride ran away and skipped back home to live with her mother, Mrs. Anne Powell, who likewise gave John an erection; which is why John Milton resented his mother-in-law as well as his estranged wife.Those were the hardest years of the poet's life - nothing but a daily struggle against involuntary erections, yet here he was, trapped in a loveless marriage to a barely pubescent teenager who lived with her entirely-too-attractive mother. Which is partly why John Milton wrote those four revolutionary Christian pamphlets, correcting Moses' and Jesus' hardline policy on divorce (Mark 10:11-12).In his Latin correspondence, some of which is preserved in the Bodleian Library, John Milton reports that he was fine when alone in his study, or when hobnobbing with Parliamentarians, or even when having a hasty pudding, or a figgy one, over at the Inns of Court; but let just one good-looker cross his path, showing good ankle between the hem of her dress and the top of her shoe, and it was boing! - instant erection, just like a spring-loaded mechanical device; causing John to exclaim bitterly, \\"Oh, God, please, not again! Save me from this penal fire!\\"It even happened to him once when Oliver Cromwell's wife, Elizabeth Bourchier Cromwell, bent over to pick up a handkerchief that had fallen to the floor. On that occasion there was a lamentable accident (\\"an hard mishap\\" [verbatim quote]) with John's ordinarily modest codpiece - an incident so humiliating that John never even wrote a poem about it, although he did apologise, profusely, to Oliver Cromwell, and to Mrs. Cromwell, who saw the whole thing, and then fainted. (John at the time was employed as Cromwell's Latin secretary.)By the way: It was modesty, not arrogance, that moved John Milton, after that embarrassing incident, to wear a baggy codpiece, with plenty of wiggle room.Which brings me back to the beginning, when I was explaining why you should give the Lord no wiggle room when you pray: John Milton took his problem to the Lord in prayer, stating in his journal, \\"Father, I pray Thee, let me not suffer a stiffe joynt when I see a beautifull woman.\\"And here's how the Lord answered that prayer, in 1651: He struck John Milton blind.At first, John thought that his blindness was a punishment for his own bad behaviour - which is how that whole thing got going, in Anglo-American Christianity, about how, if you are a boy who does what John Milton used to do, it could make you go blind. But God revealed to John, by means of a dream, that his blindness was actually an answer to his own prayers - because the poet had said, \\"Father, let me not suffer a stiff joint when I see a beautiful woman.\\"John Milton then said, \\"Lord, that is not what I meant, at all\\" - but it was too late to change the outcome, because the prayer was already answered.The erections that John Milton suffered in the years 1651-1674, and there were many, even after the Lord answered his prayer, were not from seeing a beautiful woman, it was actually because John had a condition that modern physicians call PSAS (\\"Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome\\"). So the chronic \\"stiffe joynt\\" problem was not really the women's fault, and it never was; but John Milton never knew that. Even when he wrote Paradise Lost (by dictation, from 1652-1667), John was still under the impression that women, seen or unseen, were to blame for his condition; which is why he makes all of those snide remarks in blank verse about your mother, Eve, in Books IV-V and IX-X of Paradise Lost. Because whenever he pictured Eve in his mind's eye, it was boing! - the same old problem. And there would come no more blank verse to his head for the next twenty minutes or so, until things settled down. John Milton hated that.But it all turned out for the best: if God had not answered John Milton's prayer in that unusual way, by blinding him, Paradise Lost might never have been completed, and sold to the publisher, Sam Simmons, in 1667, for 5 - which was a tidy sum for a religious poem during the decadent Restoration era.It was while writing the early books of Paradise Lost that John was introduced to Katherine, a ship captain's daughter, a fat woman whom he had never seen (because he was blind); whom he nonetheless married in 1656, but not for the same old reason as before: John asked fat Kate to marry him (a.) because he needed secretarial assistance with Paradise Lost, and (b.) because Katherine did not have the same pernicious effect on him as Mary Powell and her mother Anne had done. John could dictate blank verse to Kate all night long without feeling so much as a tingle down there.Kate's surname was Woodcock. Beelzebub made a little joke about that: he said, \\"The Lord finally gave John Milton just what he always wanted.\\"- L."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"a riveting book for the philosophy of good and evil"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Sufficiency is fluid. There is nothing that in Paradise Lost that can be described as simple. But sufficiency in the eyes of God, Adam and the various obedient angels consists of doing God's will and using the gift of free will given to all his sentient creatures to extol his greatness. Before the falls, both of the rebel angels and of Adam and Eve, the relation between God and his creations is almost always one to one and direct. God makes his creatures sufficient to withstand any and all evil, but by investing all with free will gives them the choice of whether or not to embrace the evil. Suffiency lies within all sentient creatures to do God's will, but one can only be proved sufficient by doing God's will. In short, to be sufficient in God's eyes is to do his will--no matter what!That suffiency is fluid is vaguely clear through out the poem. There is never one definition of perfectly righteous or good behavior. Satan and the rebel angels needed only to accept Messiah as God and King; Adam and Eve needed only not eat of the tree of knowledge; Michael, Gabriel, and company had to take part in that farce of fight for heaven; Enoch, Noah, Moses and Jesus showed their suffiency by standing up for God against humanly impossible odds. The lists of lesser examples in the poem are too numerous to recite and keep this essay readable, but it is more than reasonable to conclude that depending on the situation anything from indifferent obedience to militant martyrdom will be sufficient. But, constant obedience is always the rule.The same rule of suffiency should be applied to Paradise in a slightly modified form. God is the greatest of planners because he knows all. Knowing all, he makes plans for every consequence of every action. Had Adam and Eve resisted Satan in the garden, then it would have proved sufficient for two beings who did not know good or evil. That would have proved enough of a mockery to the aims of Satan, but after the fall God ordains it necessary to show that everything Satan ever does to mankind is utterly futile and leads only to more punishment and increase of pain. The fact that he will make the supreme greatness of mankind come from evil means shows his power to be without end, and Satan's unwillingness to accept this is what will ultimately destroy him and his host of rebels at history's conclusion.The entire question of suffiency of all virtues is the meditation of Milton from the poem's beginning to the close. What is constantly necessary to remember in this poem is the distinction between virtue, or power, and true virtue, power used to celebrate and defend good. Milton uses this distinction to turn epic virtues on their head by investing Satan with so many of them. Satan is fearless, uncompromisingly defiant, willing to fight by whatever means are provided to him and he is inspiring. We can see shades of Aeneas, Odysseus, Scaevola, the Earl of Kent from King Lear, and numerous other literary and historical figures that seethed with defiance and did everything in their power to defy and defy and defy. What all characters put forth have in common though is that they used their powers in defense of people, home, freedom, and friendship. Satan uses the power still invested in him, his \\"courage never to submit or yield\\" to try to destroy, not create. Comically, he even seems to realize that he can, at best, be a mild irritant to God this way:...If then his ProvidenceOut of our evil seek to bring forth good,Our labour must be to pervert that end,And out of good still find means of evil,Which oft-times may succeed, so as perhapsShall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturbHis inmost counsels from their destined aim. (I, 162-68)This is power so completely abused that it barely requires further explication. Suffice it to say though, this is the same valor that we find in Adam when we are introduced to him for the first time in book IV, and that he disdains using in book IX when he chooses to follow Eve's lead by eating the forbidden fruit. Where the true virtue of the obedient angels and the classical epic heroes lies in their motivation for undertaking feats of violence, Satan's hatefulness, which grows as he further resists God, lies in the fact that he uses all his powers and intellect in the service of conquest, destruction, and wickedness. As becomes clear by the poem's end, when Michael shows Adam the tyranny of Nimrod, valor when in the service of wickedness is not a true virtue. True virtue and greatness can only come through God's favor.Here it seems appropriate to move from suffiency in beings and their actions to the suffiency of Paradise. As Raphael points out in book VII, creation of the world and mankind took place in order show Satan and the rebel angels their superflousness by filling what they could have defined as a void when they were banished from Heaven. God loves all his creatures for the obedience and love they show him. But part of the nature of being omnipotent is that nothing is inexpendible and no thing is outside of his purview. Existence itself is by God's sufferance and for any permanence of good to come of a beings existence this must be accepted as indisputable. Milton's Satan would not be Milton's Satan if he accepted this necessity. He even had a chance to accept it in book II had he advised the Stygian council to accept the advice of Mammon--one who hates God as much as Satan:...Let us not then pursueBy force impossible, by leave obtainedUnacceptable, though in Heav'n, our stateOf splendid vassalage, but rather seekOur own good from ourselves, and from our ownLive to ourselves, though in this vast recess,Free, and to none accountable, preferringHard liberty before the easy yokeOf servile pomp. Our greatness will appearThen most conspicuous, when great things of small,Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse,We can create, and in what place soe'erThrive under evil, and work ease out of painThrough labour and endurance. (II, 249-262)God's wrath is infinite when provoked, and expulsion from Heaven is the punishment for attempting to conquer Heaven. There is no reason to believe that his ire would have been raised had the rebel angels simply accepted their punishment, because the punishment and the concomitant agony that the disobedient angels suffer would have been sufficient. The further disobedience of Satan is what makes more punishment necessary, hence the periodic metamorphosis into serpents the rebels undergo after Satan's return from Earth. Again, suffiency of actions by God becomes defined solely by decisions made by his creations. By seducing Adam and Eve, Satan showed God that banishment was not sufficient to quell his pride. Also, Adam and Eve showed themselves insufficiently obedient to deserve Paradise. It became necessary for God to alter all of their conditions in order to punish Satan accordingly, further dash his pride. For Adam and Eve the punishment was death and the misery of history. They proved insufficient of Paradise, nothing in Paradise itself was imperfect, insufficient, let alone deficient, accept for them after the fall.God is the creator of infinite possibility in all his sentient creatures. He should not be viewed as the writer of a book with a singular vision who preordains events to make a specific conclusion. That would be fate or destiny and God did not impose these upon human existence. God has total foreknowledge of all events, but he explains to Messiah that this is irrelevant because free will gives all his creations choice. They would be worthless otherwise because,Not free, what proof could they have giv'n sincereOf true allegiance, constant faith or love,Where only what they needs must do, appeared,Not what they would? What praise could they receive?What pleasures I from such obedience paid,When will and reason (reason also is choice)Useless and vain, of freedom both despoiled,Made passive both, had served necessity,Not me. (III, 103-111)There needs to be the constant possibility of evil arising for good to mean anything. Good is totally impotent without the contrast of evil, in fact it arguably can not exist without it. Automaton praise would not be real praise of God.When discussion of the suffiency of Paradise comes up in any definition of suffiency we enter into very dangerous territory. Adam and Eve voice no complaints about Paradise; they do not imagine the possibility of being happier than they are prior to their fall. Disobedience to God remains a constant possibility because of the absolute existence of free will. The universe that Milton has created is one where the actions of individuals is never foreordained and one in which absolute obedience to God is the only path through which any good can ever u come to the individual. There is also never an instance where what God asks is even in modest proportion compared to what he gives. At the same time though, Milton makes absolutely clear that obedience to God does not protect either his dutiful from horrors. One need only remember the nightmare of Eve at the beginning of Book V, or the awful description by Raphael of the hollowing that he hears coming from Hell when he is dispatched there during creation. But God never exposes his creations to truly painful tests of their loyalty, not by any standard that fallen humankind. Paradise is perfectly sufficient for Adam and Eve in the state they are in just prior to their fall. Neither one truly aspires towards bettering themselves in a way that would increase their happiness and still maintain their total obedience to God. They proved insufficient to remain in Paradise, but Paradise may have proved insufficient for the beings they were to become had they not fallen.Raphael conjectures when he meets Adam and Eve in Book V, that mankind may one day transubstantiate into a more spiritual being that will be able to cross the boundary between Paradise and Heaven.(493-503) He is not given any information by God save the fact that Satan is hanging around Paradise, so it is purely conjecture to assume that this is possibility. The same is also true of the conjectures that Michael makes about the once possible future of unfallen mankind in Book XI; the progeny of mankind would spread out of Paradise and into the world at large. Eden would have proved not large enough to hold all of mankind. I do not believe though that this is a reflection upon quality of Eden, but one upon its physical size. There is also no reason to believe that the progeny of Adam and Eve would have been just like them. They may very well have been designed to exist in a state closer to our own. Milton's God is the definition of infinite variety and it is impossible to quantify what he would have done if...Ultimately in Paradise Lost questions of suffiency are nearly moot. Milton's initial purpose in the poem \\"to justify the ways of God to man,\\" shows this better than anything else. God asks so little, but the stakes are so high for the fate of mankind that it becomes horrible to see just what happens. Since God is infinitely complicated just as he is infinitely powerful. It seems to me that Milton came to the conclusion that God could not be justified, let alone by human standards. God gives all and asks nearly nothing. When he is disobeyed, no one of his creations has the right to question the actions he takes. Through his ability to show just how simple the arrangement with God initially was, he shows how futile it is to try to justify anything he does prior to the fall."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Some parts of this book are good, some are boring.

And as an editor, Tesky seems to disregard this fact. First of all, he omits critical punctuation from the poem, which can seriously alter your understanding of what is going on:\\"[God} made the stars/ And set them in the firmament of heav'n/ T'illuminate the earth and rule the day/ In their vicissitude and rule the night/ And light from darkness to divide.\\" (VII. 348-52)This is clumsy editing, and cross referencing other editions will show that the comma between \\"the night\\" and \\"and light\\" is retained; without it, the sentence makes little sense.This is only one example of the gross injustices done to Milton's poem: parentheses where parentheses do not belong, misspellings, unnecessary footnotes (literally half of the footnotes you will find merely tell you that two words are elided), and omissions of information that could be helpful. It seems as if Tesky delights in telling you things you either already know or can infer from the context. Tesky's modernization of Paradise Lost is awkward and ill-managed, insulting to the unfamiliar student, and to the memory of Milton.Tesky does, however, include a glossary of biblical and mythological terms which may be unfamiliar to many (but which were much more recognizable to Milton's contemporaries), and this is hardly found in many editions of Paradise Lost. Tesky also gives critical articles on subjects as diverse as the character of Satan, gender distinctions, and even the agency of the angel Abdiel. While there is alot to learn from this edition, scarcely any of it comes from Tesky himself; he ends up doing more damage than good. In my opinion, stay away from this edition."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Not only does this book contain the revised Paradise Lost, but excerpts from other Milton works, like the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, Christian Doctrine, Areopagetica, and others.

They are really incredible. While waiting for the third book to be released, I decided to read Paradise Lost, one of Philip Pullman's main inspirations and the source of a lot of the allusions. Paradise Lost is surprisingly readable for a book that was published in 1667. I understood it, even with the older edition I read which didn't have much of a readers' guide, and I'm only 15. Even though you don't always understand every word and every mythological allusion, you can always get the basic idea, especially with some help from the footnotes. If you read it alone, you might find it boring, but I would strongly recommend reading the His Dark Materials books first. They discuss a lot of the ideas in Paradise Lost. (Was Satan right to rebel against God?) Then when you read P.L., you will enjoy seeing where Philip Pullman got some of his ideas. You can't help but like the His Dark Materials books, then when you read Paradise Lost you understand them so much more. Everyone over the age of 14 should read them both."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"This review focuses on the Kindle reading experience of this e-book, rather than on the literary merits of Milton's epic poem.The Kindle experience is fairly mediocre.The book is out of copyright and has been roughly scanned. The poor (non-existent?) post-scan editing of the e-book means it has plenty of typographical and formatting errors.There is little point in offering very cheap classics if the quality is poor - as it is with every one of the cheap classics I have bought from Amazon (see all my reviews).The poem is full of classical and biblical allusions. Some can be looked up in the kindle dictionary with one click, but most cannot. It would be a great help if the kindle came with an encyclopedia as well as a dictionary. Wikipedia is no substitute."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Not owning an actual Kindle, but reading instead on my PC via the Kindle Cloud Reader (and secondarily on my iPod Touch), the Kindle version of the Penguin edition of Milton's Paradise Lost (edited by John Leonard) offers one very substantial improvement over the print version: an indication that there's an endnote for a given line of poetry given by endnote numbers embedded in the poetic text. Clicking on the number sends you directly to that note. This is important because the endnotes by John Leonard are among the best of any lower-cost modern annotated edition of Paradise Lost (his introduction is also very good). Stripped of such annotations, as in the \\"naked\\" texts you can get for free from Amazon or Google, there's little chance the modern reader would be able to fully appreciate Milton's achievement. (Putting the notes at the end is the usual Penguin Classics practice with its printed books and is the principal flaw of its otherwise fine paperback series of Shakespeare plays.)There are also drawbacks with the Kindle edition, however. There is no running header or footer indicating which \\"Book\\" of the poem you are in while skimming through -- it's all one congealed mass of text. Even worse, the original line numbers placed every five lines here also receive a line of their own. This upsets the margins in such a way that it looks like the poem is constructed in 5-line stanzas, which it is not and, equally detrimental, also upsets the visual rhythms of the poetry. These two factors make the poem harder to read out loud (Milton's poetry should be heard, even if only in your mind's ear) or to call up a specific passage that might be referred to in a classroom or in an essay in some other book. For example, getting to Line 263 of Book I (\\"Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav'n.\\") is FAR quicker in the print edition than the Kindle one where you have to go to the table of contents to cue the first page of Book I and then turn pages one by one to get to Line 263. Navigation of a digital book should not be as cumbersome as this. Let this be a warning to publishers and buyers of electronic editions of Paradise Lost and other epic poems (Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer etc.), not to mention other major works with multiple layers of standardized labelled and/or numbered subdivisions, like Shakespeare or the Bible."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"\\"Paradise Lost\\" by John Milton is the definitive English epic poem (even if it does not always read like one). Much more a dramatic tragedy, Milton's extension of the biblical story of the Fall of both Satan and mankind is timeless. For while Milton may have woven the politics of his own time in regards to tyrannical kings and their heroic counterparts into the battle between heaven and hell, it is a situation that lends itself to any century.Many critics have often thought the 'problem' with \\"Paradise Lost\\" was the fact that Satan seems like the epic hero - the reader immediately begins identifying himself with Satan and rooting for him in his fight against God, an uneasy feeling to be sure. However, as the course of the poem unfolds, Satan's true tragic nature reveals itself and the reader can marvel in Milton's keen ability to bring to life Heaven, Hell, and Paradise (the Garden of Eden). The epic begins in Hell with the fallen angel now known as Satan rousing his troops into further rebellion against God, but the only action they can take is to pollute his newfound paradise and its brand new inhabitants, Adam and Eve. Satan undertakes the journey to spy out the land and learn how to tempt these two to sin. And while he is successful in his attempt to do so, it is a victory that gains Satan no glory, since he does not understand that he can never truly win against God.Milton set out to answer the question of what (or who) caused Adam and Eve to sin, tracing some of the blame away from Satan and examining the relationship between Adam and Eve in the garden. Milton perhaps raises more questions than he does offer any answers, but that is partly what makes \\"Paradise Lost\\" a mirror that still reflects today. Milton includes numerous classical allusions that readers of his day would be familiar with, as well as biblical accounts (including apocryphal works) to flesh out the barebones structure of the biblical account in Genesis. While parts of the poem can be tedious (especially the seemingly somewhat unnecessary books 11 and 12), \\"Paradise Lost\\" is a true masterpiece of literature that should be required reading for everyone, regardless of any religious preferences, for at its heart it is an examination of what it means to be."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"This is John Milton's masterpiece, though not the great epic he had intented to create. He actually wanted to write one about his beloved England, something along the lines of Arthurian legend. But what came out in 1667 was the story &quot;Of Man's first disobedience,&quot; an expansion on Genesis 2 and 3. After creating a vast, vivid cosmos and setting up the battle between the two prevailing forces of God and Satan in the reader's mind, Milton puts Adam and Eve at the very center of it all. But its up to them (like all of us) which side they want to be on. This epic is a true classic among the classics."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I don't know what happened to this edition, but I selected it based on 5 star reviews which lauded the introduction and footnotes within it. THERE ARE NONE!!! Only the text of the poem. Trying to get through a literary masterpiece as complicated and obtuse as this, without some form of explanation, is like trying to make your own computer from scratch without any guidance whatsoever. Additionally, this printing is a a shoddy, oversized paperback. Totally useless."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I ordered this book for a seminar on John Milton. While I expected it to be dense and hard to understand, I was pleasantly surprised with how the notes are alongside the text, as opposed to in the back, and how the format of the text lends some more understanding to the reader, such as when dialogue vs. monologue is taking place, or when the narrator is speaking. It's a great buy for anyone wanting a deeper look at John Milton's Paradise Lost."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Milton's view is now the dominant one, or at least an integral part of it. People seem to know this version(Ruler of Hell than servant in Heaven, snakes, etc.) more than that in Genesis and that is a serious accomplishment."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I was very pleased with this edition. It was somewhat large, with glossy dust jacket and preservation of the original poetic form (in terms of margins and such). Unlike previous editions, the text is not hampered by dredging annotations (which in some editions may take up half of a page of the poem), and Pullman does a good job in giving his analysis. If you've ever read His Dark Materials, you can definitely see the connection between Pullman and Paradise Lost. Original woodcuts are included in this edition, however, I feel that their inclusion is not complete. But I can't complain.This is the sort of edition worthy of any scholar (and it's the right edition for showing off in your bookcase too)."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Regardless of edition, Paradise Lost is one of the finest books ever written, and possibly my favorite. While the subject matter is Christian, the book's greatness transcends religious categories, and I would recommend it equally to secular readers. It is uniformly spectacular in describing heaven, earth, and hell, angels and mortals. However the portrayal of Satan is particularly remarkable. At the start, though at his lowest point, he appears an idealistic hero - championing freedom and the power of the human/angelic mind against a more powerful oppressor. However, as it says in the beginning, his \\"high words [bear] semblance of worth not substance.\\" As his situation improves, he's revealed as a hypocrite enslaved by his own pride, who increasingly disgusts even himself.As others have pointed out, this is a beautiful edition of the book, well bound with big type. The Dore illustrations are a huge plus, and for me it's hard to imagine buying an edition without them. Blake's are the only real competition, and done in a very different style.For the text, there are two issues that may be a challenge for first-time readers. One, as noted by others, there are no annotations. Honestly, vast sections of the book go by with nothing you'd want to look up anyway. A couple parts have tricky allusions (part of Book I comes to mind), but they're few enough to look up elsewhere, and Milton usually spends a couple lines giving you the gist of what he's referring to.The second issue is spellings, which are modernized. While unneeded, this generally makes reading slightly easier without altering pronunciation. For \\"ed\\" endings, modern pronunciations (winged) are spelled normally, while the extra-syllable form (wing-ed) is indicated by a grave symbol. When \\"the\\" appears before a vowel, this edition doesn't specify whether to elide (as in, th'Aeonian mount). Hence you either have to infer based on the number of syllables (usually 10 per line) or simply ignore the issue. I was concerned at first, but upon reading it's barely an inconvenience at all. All or most of the other elisions remain explicit.Overall, this is a superb edition, and perfect if you want a nice hardback containing the Dore illustrations."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I reluctantly studied this at university but once I started reading I could see how wonderfully rich the text was. There was so much to it. Milton took a section from Genesis where there was little description and he gave great thought to it. Perfection was not a simple issue, and paradise was not a simple place. Milton, in some ways, \\"filled in\\" what wasn't mentioned in Genesis. Perfection and paradise are complex ideas that we probably can't completely comprehend (since we're all imperfect).And then the all time issue of Satan vs God... I thought Milton did a great job of representing this.All in all, I highly recommend this great epic."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I am thrilled with this book. The artwork is wonderful.

Published by MobileReference (mobi)This is an outstanding edition of Milton's classic work. Paradise Lost is Milton's paean to a vast pattern in the universe, the disruption of that pattern by rebels, and the weaving of those rebellion threads back into an ever more beautiful tapestry."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"First off, let me say that we're not talking here about the famous Qi gong instructor named John Milton. We're talking about the famous 17th-century English poet who wrote _Paradise Lost_ and _Paradise Regained_, two of the most wonderfully overlong Christian poems in the history of Western literature.Your English teacher will tell you that _Paradise Lost_ \\"narrates the story of Adam and Eve's disobedience, explains how and why it happened, and places the story within the larger context of Satan's rebellion and Jesus' resurrection.\\" And you know that can't be far wrong, because SparkNotes says the exact same thing.But the main reason everyone should read Milton's grand epic is that it contains certain secrets about prayer.In PL, Milton reminds us how important it is, when we pray, to be absolutely specific. The Lord has a strange, often disturbing, sense of humour (PL, books I-XII). If you leave Him wiggle room, He will answer your prayer in a way you never intended, and then say it was your own damned fault, because your prayer contained seven types of ambiguity.John Milton writes from experience. Example: Almost every time a good-looking woman passed within view of John Milton, he suffered an involuntary erection. Daniel of the Old Testament might well have suffered such a condition without complaining, but John Milton found it onerous. John was both a Puritan and a student of Saint Augustine. He was not happy when he suffered an erection, he hated it, and he especially resented the women who made that thing happen to him.In a Latin letter to his friend, George Wither, John Milton reports that, in his youth, he would sometimes see a pretty woman even in his dreams at night, and suffer, not just an erection, but the whole nine yards, up to and including a nocturnal emission; which he trained himself to handle according to Scripture, thereby to purify himself (Deut. 23:10); but sometimes he was unable to wait that long before he handled it, which filled his soul full of Puritan remorse and self-reproach.At age 33, the poet took to wife a 16-year-old lolita named Mary Powell; and you may already have guessed the reason why, which is that she gave him an erection -- more accurately, she gave him \\"one damned erection after another,\\" without remission. (Giving John Milton an erection was not the girl's conscious intent, but it just happened to him, every time they met.) And since Christian marriage is Saint Paul's only approved method whereby to deal with that kind of torment, John Milton (being an honourable man) thought it best to marry the girl (1 Cor. 7:9).Frailty, thy name is woman! After two years of marriage - after just two years of witnessing those insufferable erections that could not be beaten down, or at least, not for long - the poet's young Puritan bride ran away and skipped back home to live with her mother, Mrs. Anne Powell, who likewise gave John an erection; which is why John Milton resented his mother-in-law as well as his estranged wife.Those were the hardest years of the poet's life - nothing but a daily struggle against involuntary erections, yet here he was, trapped in a loveless marriage to a barely pubescent teenager who lived with her entirely-too-attractive mother. Which is partly why John Milton wrote those four revolutionary Christian pamphlets, correcting Moses' and Jesus' hardline policy on divorce (Mark 10:11-12).In his Latin correspondence, some of which is preserved in the Bodleian Library, John Milton reports that he was fine when alone in his study, or when hobnobbing with Parliamentarians, or even when having a hasty pudding, or a figgy one, over at the Inns of Court; but let just one good-looker cross his path, showing good ankle between the hem of her dress and the top of her shoe, and it was boing! - instant erection, just like a spring-loaded mechanical device; causing John to exclaim bitterly, \\"Oh, God, please, not again! Save me from this penal fire!\\"It even happened to him once when Oliver Cromwell's wife, Elizabeth Bourchier Cromwell, bent over to pick up a handkerchief that had fallen to the floor. On that occasion there was a lamentable accident (\\"an hard mishap\\" [verbatim quote]) with John's ordinarily modest codpiece - an incident so humiliating that John never even wrote a poem about it, although he did apologise, profusely, to Oliver Cromwell, and to Mrs. Cromwell, who saw the whole thing, and then fainted. (John at the time was employed as Cromwell's Latin secretary.)By the way: It was modesty, not arrogance, that moved John Milton, after that embarrassing incident, to wear a baggy codpiece, with plenty of wiggle room.Which brings me back to the beginning, when I was explaining why you should give the Lord no wiggle room when you pray: John Milton took his problem to the Lord in prayer, stating in his journal, \\"Father, I pray Thee, let me not suffer a stiffe joynt when I see a beautifull woman.\\"And here's how the Lord answered that prayer, in 1651: He struck John Milton blind.At first, John thought that his blindness was a punishment for his own bad behaviour - which is how that whole thing got going, in Anglo-American Christianity, about how, if you are a boy who does what John Milton used to do, it could make you go blind. But God revealed to John, by means of a dream, that his blindness was actually an answer to his own prayers - because the poet had said, \\"Father, let me not suffer a stiff joint when I see a beautiful woman.\\"John Milton then said, \\"Lord, that is not what I meant, at all\\" - but it was too late to change the outcome, because the prayer was already answered.The erections that John Milton suffered in the years 1651-1674, and there were many, even after the Lord answered his prayer, were not from seeing a beautiful woman, it was actually because John had a condition that modern physicians call PSAS (\\"Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome\\"). So the chronic \\"stiffe joynt\\" problem was not really the women's fault, and it never was; but John Milton never knew that. Even when he wrote Paradise Lost (by dictation, from 1652-1667), John was still under the impression that women, seen or unseen, were to blame for his condition; which is why he makes all of those snide remarks in blank verse about your mother, Eve, in Books IV-V and IX-X of Paradise Lost. Because whenever he pictured Eve in his mind's eye, it was boing! - the same old problem. And there would come no more blank verse to his head for the next twenty minutes or so, until things settled down. John Milton hated that.But it all turned out for the best: if God had not answered John Milton's prayer in that unusual way, by blinding him, Paradise Lost might never have been completed, and sold to the publisher, Sam Simmons, in 1667, for 5 - which was a tidy sum for a religious poem during the decadent Restoration era.It was while writing the early books of Paradise Lost that John was introduced to Katherine, a ship captain's daughter, a fat woman whom he had never seen (because he was blind); whom he nonetheless married in 1656, but not for the same old reason as before: John asked fat Kate to marry him (a.) because he needed secretarial assistance with Paradise Lost, and (b.) because Katherine did not have the same pernicious effect on him as Mary Powell and her mother Anne had done. John could dictate blank verse to Kate all night long without feeling so much as a tingle down there.Kate's surname was Woodcock. Beelzebub made a little joke about that: he said, \\"The Lord finally gave John Milton just what he always wanted.\\"- L."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Of course Milton's poem greatness one of greatest ten classics of English Literature. This edition is wonderfully easy to read with good paper, margins, typeface. This is not collectors quality but it will serve to be my libraries copy of Paradise Lost.Loved the essay by Pullman."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" is a timeless classic. It's imagery, based itself upon 1500 years of previous Christian-cultural imagery, has shaped how the Western world views Christianity, sin, the fall, life, death, heaven, and hell.The open-minded non-Christian reader would do well to read \\"Paradise Lost\\" to become a literate student of Christian imagery. The Christian, willing to work through the descriptive poetry, will gain new insight into Creation, Fall, and Redemption. In many ways, Milton bridges eras (the Middle Ages and the Reformation), cultures (Southern Europe and Northern), and religious groups (Catholic and Protestant).It's interesting how much \\"folk theology\\" owes itself to Milton's \\"Paradise Lost.\\" Modern views of the Devil, in particular, are often unknowingly based upon the poetic images from Milton. Fortunately, Milton is at his best in describing Satan, first as the unfallen Lucifer with all his glorious, God-created brilliance, and then as the fallen False Seducer in all his distorted and tormenting deceit.For example, Milton speaks of how revenge, dark requital, propelled Satan's monstrous motives:To waste his whole Creation, or possess all as our own, and drive as we were driven, the puny habitants, or if not drive, seduce them to our Party, that their God may prove their foe, and with repenting hand abolish his own works. This would surpass common revenge, and interrupt his joy in our confusion and our joy upraise in his disturbance; when his darling Sons hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse their frail Original, and faded bliss, faded so soon (Milton, Paradise Lost, p. 40).Surpassing common revenge, Satan lives to spite the Author of life.By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence, but from the Author of all ill could spring so deep a malice, to confound the race of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell to mingle and involve, done all to spite the great Creator? (Milton, Paradise Lost, p. 41).Milton's depiction of the temptation in the Garden displays psychological brilliance and biblical insight into the nature of the human personality as designed by God and depraved by sin. Perhaps only C. S. Lewis' \\"Screwtape Letters\\" matches Milton's understanding of Satanic seduction.For instance, so whose fault their fall? Milton, imagining God's words to Christ, declares:For man will hearken to his glozing lies, and easily transgress the sole Command, sole pledge of his obedience. So will fall he and his faithless Progeny. Whose fault? Whose but his own? Ingrate, he had of me all he could have; I made him just and right, sufficient to have stood, though free to fall (Milton, Paradise Lost, p. 63).Well put. Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. Made just and right and able to choose. Adam and Eve had all they could have from the generous hand of God, yet they transgressed the sole command, the sole pledge of loving, trustful obedience. Loving allegiance they chose to grant to non-god rather than to Father God.Whatever could possess them to trade their birthright for one bite of the one forbidden fruit? When we last spied earth's Villain, he was tumbling toward hell. Having lost the battle for heaven, his hostility and hate triggers a new plan. Why a second siege on heaven's gates, when earth's shores suggest easier prey? As Milton envisioned it:Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need with dangerous expedition to invade Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, or ambush from the Deep. What if we find some easier enterprise? There is a place (if ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven err not), another World, the happy seat of some new Race called Man, about this time to be created like to us, though less in power and excellence, but favored more of him who rules above. So was his will pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath, that shook Heaven's whole circumference, confirmed (Milton, Paradise Lost, pp. 39-40).Readers also could benefit from his less known work, \\"Paradise Regained.\\" Many have mentioned how difficult it is to write a riveting book about Heaven since the drama of evil is defeated and thus the tension is deflated. Yet Milton captures one possible vision of a future Paradise/Heaven as well as most. (Randy Alcorn's book \\"Heaven\\" is, in my opinion, the best modern book on the topic)."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Not my cup of tea at all.

I worked diligently and ploddingly to move through the abyss of confusion. With the help of Cliff Notes and of making careful notations in my book, it began to come together after the first fifty pages or so. (It was rather like learning to read middle English or Shakespeare.) Then, Milton's Paradise opened and I fell in. I stood in the Garden as the Snake tempted Adam and Eve. Never was there a more tantalizing personification of Evil. Yes, he was appealing.

If you've only read this great work in college, it's time to read it again."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Milton is hard to read. There's no way around it. He was incredibly well versed in Latin and Greek and the famous epics, and intentionally set out to imitate that style with this Christian poem. Thus, some of the sentences are close to thirty lines or more, and are almost unintelligible at first. I am a Latin scholar, so I am used to seeing this kind of writing, but Paradise Lost could be challenging to the uninitiated. That being said, it is definitely worth the effort. Milton set out not just to tell the story of the Fall of Man but also to \\"justify the ways of God to men.\\" It is frequently remarked that God is a secondary character and Satan is the most well-developed. I think this may be the same technique used by Dante to draw in the reader and have them commit the same sin as the characters. And this is what is most enjoyable about Milton: trying to unravel the many layers.If you are a Christian, this book may ask some interesting questions. Milton was definitely pious, but he did have some interesting personal beliefs that may or may not have agreed with doctrine at the time.If you are just a fan of the classics and great literature, I'm sure you will find Paradise Lost to be among the best poems in history, and certainly the best in English.Finally, the Norton Critical Edition is superior in that it contains about 300 pages of criticisms and background information, all of which aid to one's understanding and enjoyment of the poem."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"With its fine binding, large type, and beautiful paper, this large addition of Milton's Paradise Lost will make a handsome addition to any shelf. Some will say that it is not well suited for the first time reader, lacking the line notes of other annotated additions. I would beg to differ, as such commentary, while deepening ones understanding, can also detract from the majesty of Milton's words. Yes, it is true that the laymen will miss many or even most of the references woven into this, perhaps after Shakespeare's work the greatest piece of literature ever produced in English. However, once captivated by the poetry, readers can always go back and peruse thicker, commentary laced edition. First and foremost, one must dive into the language of Milton, before attempting to wring every drop of meaning from that pool's heady wine.A note, of course, must also be given to the extraordinary illustrations of Gustave Dore included in this volume. Dore's vision, especially the inexorable dissent of Satan from angelic beauty to demonic ugliness can only add to the readers' joy. At less than $20, one cannot go wrong in acquiring this very fine edition."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruitOf that forbidden tree whose mortal tasteBrought death into the world and all our woe,With loss of Eden, till on greater ManRestore us and regain the blissful seatSing, Heavenly Muse...Not a lot people know that 'Paradise Lost' has as a much lesser known companion piece 'Paradise Regained'; of course, it was true during Milton's time as it is today that the more harrowing and juicy the story, the better it will likely be remembered and received.This is not to cast any aspersion on this great poem, however. It has been called, with some justification, the greatest English epic poem. The line above, the first lines of the first book of the poem, is typical of the style throughout the epic, in vocabulary and syntax, in allusiveness. The word order tends toward the Latinate, with the object coming first and the verb coming after.Milton follows many classical examples by personifying characters such as Death, Chaos, Mammon, and Sin. These characters interact with the more traditional Christian characters of Adam, Eve, Satan, various angels, and God. He takes as his basis the basic biblical text of the creation and fall of humanity (thus, 'Paradise Lost'), which has taken such hold in the English-speaking world that many images have attained in the popular mind an almost biblical truth to them (in much the same way that popular images of Hell owe much to Dante's Inferno). The text of Genesis was very much in vogue in the mid-1600s (much as it is today) and Paradise Lost attained an almost instant acclaim.John Milton was an English cleric, a protestant who nonetheless had a great affinity for catholic Italy, and this duality of interests shows in much of his creative writing as well as his religious tracts. Milton was nicknamed 'the divorcer' in his early career for writing a pamphlet that supported various civil liberties, including the right to obtain a civil divorce on the grounds of incompatibility, a very unpopular view for the day. Milton held a diplomatic post under the Commonwealth, and wrote defenses of the governments action, including the right of people to depose and dispose of a bad king.Paradise Lost has a certain oral-epic quality to it, and for good reason. Milton lost his eyesight in 1652, and thus had to dictate the poem to several different assistants. Though influenced heavily by the likes of Virgil, Homer, and Dante, he differentiated himself in style and substance by concentrating on more humanist elements.Say first -- for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,Nor the deep tract of Hell -- say first what causeMoved our grand Parents, in that happy state,Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall offFrom their Creator and transgress his will,For one restraint, lords of the world besides?Milton drops us from the beginning into the midst of the action, for the story is well known already, and proceeds during the course of the books (Milton's original had 10, but the traditional epic had 12 books, so some editions broke books VII and X into two books each) to both push the action forward and to give developing background -- how Satan came to be in Hell, after the war in heaven a description that includes perhaps the currently-most-famous line:Here we may reign secure, and in my choiceTo reign is worth ambition though in hell:Better to reign in hell, that serve in heav'n.(Impress your friends by knowing that this comes from Book I, lines 261-263 of Paradise Lost, rather than a Star Trek episode!)The imagery of warfare and ambition in the angels, God's wisdom and power and wrath, the very human characterisations of Adam and Eve, and the development beyond Eden make a very compelling story, done with such grace of language that makes this a true classic for the ages. The magnificence of creation, the darkness and empty despair of hell, the manipulativeness of evil and the corruptible innocence of humanity all come through as classic themes. The final books of the epic recount a history of humanity, now sinful, as Paradise has been lost, a history in tune with typical Renaissance renderings, which also, in Milton's religious convictions, will lead to the eventual destruction of this world and a new creation.A great work that takes some effort to comprehend, but yields great rewards for those who stay the course."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I made it to the middle of book two before I decided I would go to the library Monday and check this book out.

A Must Buy"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"People I admire have told me they consider Teskey a brilliant scholar, but what he has done with this Norton Critical Edition is a real disappointment. In short, the annotations, the ancillary texts, and the critical readings are all less helpful thanthe old Norton edition (edited by Scott Elledge). Elledge sometimes could be a bit pedantic, giving too many Latin etymologies and such. But Teskey has simply abandoned the original audience (first-time readers of Paradise Lost). He doesn't gloss such difficulties as \\"ravin,\\" \\"all I,\\" and the odd etymological use of \\"pontifical.\\" He omits such indispensable ancillae as Elledge's 33-page selection from Milton's \\"On Christian Doctrine\\" (and also Doctrine & Discipline of Divorce, and much else). He takes the best critical readings (Lewalski, Fish) and cuts them down to excerpts too tiny to matter much.That really concludes my argument against choosing Teskey. He also commits howlers in Latin, Greek (\\"Greek leukos also means joyful\\"), and English (\\"tradition\\" in X.578 construed as a verb; faulty modernizations like \\"condemn\\" for \\"contemn\\" in IX.306 and \\"shown\\" for \\"shone\\" in X.1096).For a Norton Critical Edition (i.e., the extra primary and secondary texts), choose Elledge; its advantages in learning and help far outweigh any of its defects. Perhaps, though, the most helpful Paradise Lost edition for the target audience (first-time reader, well-annotated) is nowDavid Scott Kastan's generous reworking of Merritt Hughes' edition."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"I am not a Milton scholar and my comments need to be understood in that light.Having read the previous Norton Critical Edition (edited by Scott Elledge, (C) 1993;Paradise Lost (Norton Critical Editions)) several years ago, I was looking forward to reading this new one (edited by Gordon Teskey). The new edition is printed on heavier paper, which is nicer to read and less prone to bleed through when I write on it. But to maintain the same size and heft, the newer edition is about 100 pages shorter (587 vs 685). Almost all the critical essays are carried over from one edition to the next. But omitted material includes:A number of Milton's other writings, including 7 sonnets and excerpts from a number of his essays.An essay about the religious and political issues at the time of MiltonA brief biography of MiltonExplanations of Milton's conceptions about the universe, Physiology and Psychology, Reason, the Scale of Nature, Angels, God, Freedom, etc.A more complete set of relevant readings from the Bible (the new one omits the readings from Matthew, Luke, John, Timothy, and James).I found these materials enormously helpful in understanding Milton and Norton's decision to delete them makes the new edition much less useful. I would have preferred, personally, that they delete some of the critical essays about PL, rather than the explanatory materials to help readers get through the book in the first place.Finally, Teskey's notes are not nearly as helpful. About half of them discuss how the syllables of Milton's words should be counted. Here's a comparison of the notes to book one, lines 43-46, in each edition. From Teskey, page 5:44: Pow'r: power, pronounced with one syllable: 'paar.'45: ethereal: has three syllables: 'eth-ear-yal.'46: hideous has two syllables: 'hid-jus.'and so forth. Some of his notes explain odd words, ideas, or allusions to biblical or classical texts. I am certain that his emphasis on explaining Milton's syllabification is important to some readers, but it matters little to me.By comparison, Elledge's notes almost never discuss syllabification. They are full of information explaining the text. From the same set of lines (p. 9):43: Impious. The L word means disrespectful of one's parents or one's country as well as of one's god.44: ethereal: (Gk aithein to ignite, blaze) of the ether, the element supposed to fill the outer regions of the universe; not earth, fire or water, it was not earthly but heavenly, and eternal.46: This image of a meteorite is more distinct in the description of Satan's fall at 745 (\\"like a falling star\\"). hideous: causing dread or horror. ruin (L ruere to fall violently) ruins, rubble; fall destruction. combustion. Cf Combustible. line 233.Elledge's notes are fuller, richer, and far more helpful to me. Knowing what \\"etheral\\" means and how it fits into Milton's cosmology is far more interesting and helpful than knowing that he pronounced it with three syllables.In short, I would encourage folks to look for a copy of Elledge's version of this Norton's Critical edition. I found it far more helpful than Teskey.Perhaps when Norton issues a second edition of Tewsky's work, they will restore some of the missing material; until they do, I will continue to use Elledge."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"It's not too often that one gets to hold a really nice edition of anything.

It also has really quality illustrations from Dore And at this price, how can you lose? I have books costing 10 times as much that are no better made than this one. A really nice piece of work.

The advantage of this publication is that not only do you get the poem itself, but you also receive critical essays written on the work by such personages as Scott Elledge (who also edited the book), Voltaire, Viginia Woolfe, John Keats, William Blake, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, Christopher Ricks and Harold Bloom (just to name a few). For the serious student of Milton, the literary criticism that has been written is nearly as important as the poem itself.&quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is the Protestant counterpart to Dante's &quot;Divne Comedy.&quot; That is to say, it is the epic poem of the Protestant tradition just as Dante's work is the great epic poem of the Catholic heritage. Unlike Dante, however, English speaking people do not have to worry about anything getting lost in translation, for Milton wrote in English. Great works written in English were fairly sparse before the time of Shakespeare, and this is one of the few great epic works to be written in English since .What &quot;PL&quot; deals with is the fall of Satan &amp; the subsequent fall of man. Milton attempts to &quot;justify the ways of God to man&quot; as he says in his famous line. Whether he does this or not is a matter of opinion, but what is not in debate is that he wrote an extraordinary piece of literature.Milton uses the famous &quot;free will&quot; defense for evil in the world and gives us a panoramic vision of heaven, hell, the garden of Eden and the entire cosmos. Regardless of whether people accept this position, Milton offers the best example of the free will argument that I have ever read.We also get to meet Satan (Lucifer) and in many ways we get to know him even better than God. It has even been said that Satan is actually the &quot;hero&quot; of the tale even though Satan ultimately loses (sort of like Ahab in Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot;). While this point has come under much scrutiny,what I can say is that Satan is a magnificent fellow. His speeches are generally the most dramatic &amp; powerful and he has the most memorable lines (such as the infamous &quot;It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven&quot;).So, for anyone remotely interested in literature, religion or philosophy, I would HIGHLY recommend this poem. You may just find there some ideas which you have never thought of before. An outstanding epic poem which ranks up there with the works of Dante, Virgil, Homer, Shelley and Goethe."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"There's enough already said about why and how Milton wrote this book, so I don't have anything to say about that. It's a story most people will be familiar with, and any surprises will involve the beauty of the language or a random, surprising insight into a character's motivation. In the end, Milton deserves to be called the greatest writer in English because of the pure strength and beauty of each individual sentence.This is undoubtedly a difficult book to read. I teach a small bit in a sophomore high school English class, and I tell them, \\"This will be the most complex text you will encounter this year.\\" We have to practice unpacking sentences one at a time and stating them in our own words in order to get their meaning. It's a slow process, and one that most adults will also need to go through.But it's all worth it! Reading Milton might or might not change your view of God and man, but absorbing him will change your love of language. The words are vivid and powerful and beg to be read aloud. If you like your poetry Great in the sense of sounding larger than life and tackling humanity's major questions, Milton is it.

In Paradise Lost, Milton poses some of the most fascinating questions about human nature and the nature of free will manifest in any work of literature.

In any case, Teskey's treatment of the punctuation does not correspond at all to the programme he announces here. Far from punctuating lightly, he mutiplies full stops, clogging the progress of the poem, and often cutting Milton's sentences into bleeding ungrammatical segments.He very frequently adds other punctuation marks where there are none in the original, and sometimes the effect of these is to obscure or distort the sense. He puts a comma in the middle of I, 9: \`In the beginning, how the heav'ns and earth', creating the confusing impression that \`in the beginning' goes with \`That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed' (I, 8), whereas the absence of the comma makes clear that it does with the following words as in Genesis 1:1. He puts full stops where the 1674 texts has semi-colons, sometimes bringing the poetry to an abrupt half and breaking its rhythm, as in I, 34: \`Th'infernal serpent. He it was whose guile'; the abrupt three-word sentence is not Miltonic style. The full stop introduced in I, 78 leaves the following three lines isolated even though they do not form a sentence:He soon discerns. And welt'ring by his sideOne next himself in pow'r and next in crime,Long after known in Palestine and namedBeelzebub. (I, 78-81)Milton is a grammatical writer, who does not leave incomplete sentences lying about. Beelzebub is the object of the verb \`discerns', from which it is here brutally cut off.There are some rare exclamation marks in the 1674 text, as in I, 75: \`O how unlike the place from which they fell!' Teskey applies exclamation marks lavishly, giving a cartoon-like emphasis to Milton's lines. Examples: \`Sad task!' (IX, 13)He even introduces italics for emphasis, something liable to alter radically the rhythm and sense of a passage.So much the rather thou, celestial Light,Shine inward and the mind through all her powersIrradiate. _There_ plant eyes. All mist from thencePurge and disperse, that I may see and tellOf things invisible to mortal sight. (III, 52-4)The 1674 text has:So much the rather thou Celestial lightShine inward, and the mind through all her powersIrradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thencePurge and disperse, that I may see and tellOf things invisible to mortal sight. (III, 52-4)Notice that by dividing the passage into three sentences, Teskey connects the closing \`that I may see' only with the purging of mist, not with the more crucial \`shine inward' and \`there plant eyes'. The italicized \`there' is meaningless, since it suggests that the Celestial light might be planting eyes elsewhere instead.I could go on and on about Teskey's rushed revamping of Milton. I urge teachers NOT to used this flawed edition; Lewalski's edition with the original punctuation (Blackwell, 2007) or the richly annotated edition of Alistair Fowler are vastly preferable."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruitOf that forbidden tree whose mortal tasteBrought death into the world and all our woe,With loss of Eden, till on greater ManRestore us and regain the blissful seatSing, Heavenly Muse...Not a lot people know that 'Paradise Lost' has as a much lesser known companion piece 'Paradise Regained'; of course, it was true during Milton's time as it is today that the more harrowing and juicy the story, the better it will likely be remembered and received.This is not to cast any aspersion on this great poem, however. It has been called, with some justification, the greatest English epic poem. The line above, the first lines of the first book of the poem, is typical of the style throughout the epic, in vocabulary and syntax, in allusiveness. The word order tends toward the Latinate, with the object coming first and the verb coming after.Milton follows many classical examples by personifying characters such as Death, Chaos, Mammon, and Sin. These characters interact with the more traditional Christian characters of Adam, Eve, Satan, various angels, and God. He takes as his basis the basic biblical text of the creation and fall of humanity (thus, 'Paradise Lost'), which has taken such hold in the English-speaking world that many images have attained in the popular mind an almost biblical truth to them (in much the same way that popular images of Hell owe much to Dante's Inferno). The text of Genesis was very much in vogue in the mid-1600s (much as it is today) and Paradise Lost attained an almost instant acclaim.John Milton was an English cleric, a protestant who nonetheless had a great affinity for catholic Italy, and this duality of interests shows in much of his creative writing as well as his religious tracts. Milton was nicknamed 'the divorcer' in his early career for writing a pamphlet that supported various civil liberties, including the right to obtain a civil divorce on the grounds of incompatibility, a very unpopular view for the day. Milton held a diplomatic post under the Commonwealth, and wrote defenses of the governments action, including the right of people to depose and dispose of a bad king.Paradise Lost has a certain oral-epic quality to it, and for good reason.

If you are new to Milton, Pullman's comments will guide you along.What a beautiful edition. Classic illustrations; perfect fonts; Satan himself could never produce such a great volume."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"At least in Paradise Lost. Here, when among his own kind, we find the much-maligned Fallen One to be noble, honorable, brave, loyal, beautiful, eloquent, intellectual, defiant and determined--mostly exact opposites of all we humans have been told of him. Satan, in fact, is all-but perfect, and yet it is his own arrogance that undermines him and makes possible his terrible exile from the paradise that will ever after be denied him. Satan, defeated in his Heavenly rebellion in which one-third of all the Host of paradise sided with him, will throughout eternity be God's foe, and because of this, he hates man, God's greatest creation, with all his being, hence his efforts throughout history to oppress and ruin man's relationship with its creator.It took me three face-first dashes into this heavier than lead poem, but I'm glad I finished it. Satan is the best heroic villain in English literature, and God is crafty beyond expectations (although He is God, so how can that be possible?) to use Satan's vast pride against him in His plan for man's future. Some say the ebb and flow of Milton's lines here is akin to the notes of a perfectly-tuned pipe organ blasting out music, and I like that description. This is a great tale full of lines so utterly quotable (or at least paraphrased, as in: \\"better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven\\") that it amply rewards the exertion it takes to your force protesting mind through it.Even if you have to take some time off from this HEAVY poem, come back to it.

This poem does Jehovah and his drones more injustice than it justifies. Actually, by my perception, Milton displays the naivet&eacute; and gullibility of man's mind. As I read this book I could not help but to lament, with a hint of comedic relief, for society knowing that in 2010 people still ardently believe all of this actually occurred, or at least as the Bible foretells it. Which to be honest with you, Milton's version has no more factual quality than the Bible itself, as pertaining to mythological and paranormal activity, not in relation to the historically relevant parts. Nonetheless, Milton decided to venture into an abyss with naivet&eacute; himself if he thought he would be able to eloquently portray a sound omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient deity while simultaneously retaining a perceptual benevolence, magnanimity and shrewdness in the same character. Here, in this regard, neither Milton nor the author's of the Bible afford success. One of the myriad of problems is that personifying one deity as having all of the above qualities is just oxymoronic. Milton himself knew this, which is why he had to utilize the Son as a metaphoric supplement of the last three qualities to keep the other elevated on its stilts. It is difficult to fuse together the perspectives of two distinct cultural and temporal perspectives of God-in references to the Old Testament and the New Testament- these cannot be interwoven as one; there is just not continuity of character there. Personally, a more accurate representation of a sound omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient deity is manifested in the character Dr. Manhattan from the modern Alan Moore epic \\"Watchmen.\\" I wonder if this character is the epitome of what man will become as a result of our consumption the forbidden fruit?!Just as his counterparts of past and present, Milton attempts to demonize Paganism and has an overt chauvinistic sexism. The interesting quality that I have always found about Christianity, the organized religion not the Christ himself, is that it adopted Pagan customs to convert Pagans, obviously for a larger control over the European population, and ironically demonized it afterwards. Not to mention, Paganism has a very strong emphasis of goddess worship in most of its constituent cultures, but in Judeo-Christian literature the woman is subordinate and inferior, along with these qualities women are further subjected to ridicule and subjugation for committing the \\"original sin.\\"Milton makes it obvious that man can only continue to worship God in ignorance. Once man has bitten of the fruit of Knowledge his perspective changes and an indefinite INDIVIDUAL pursuit of that Essence begins. Actually, this whole \\"interdicted knowledge\\" was more than likely contrived by the powers-that-be rather than the power-that-is. Ignorance was a sure tool for suppressing a population into obedience, submission and guilt, and who were the mediators of those illiterate times? Priests, subordinate to the kings, and in later culture, kings and lords. The whole system was oriented to serfdom, vassalage, submission and control. Why do you think the Protestants presented so much of a stir in the seventeenth century? Milton says it best, \\"[Interdicted] with design / To keep them low, whom knowledge [will] exalt / Equal with [priests and kings]\\" (IV 525-527), slightly out of context but it fits the accusation.As a work of literature Milton did an excellent job conveying vivid imagery in a poetic style, but he corroded it by bloating the book at times with Botoxic irrelevant allusions and descriptions.Before anyone reads this particular print, which is the only one I recommend, particularly due to Gustave Dore's prolific drawings, they should make sure they have an extensive vocabulary as well as some historic reference for the time periods relating to Milton and the Bible. To me this availed my understanding and enjoyment of the book without the inhibitions of footnotes and translations, these only detract from the quality of the story.The Subjective:I have to commend Milton for his efforts, especially considering his condition at the time he wrote this. This work is very admirable regardless of your particular intellectual or spiritual bias. It is a work of art and I feel that we are indeed better off in the arts for having such fictional literature influenced by our most prominent mythology. While I would not compare this to Dante's \\"Inferno,\\" Milton gave us his best effort and for anyone who renders art and literature from their consciousness for all of us to share should be honored and revered, as opposed to solely giving the world physical labor and dying with no other contribution.Lastly, I cannot help but to wonder if the mythological Tree of Knowledge was a psychoactive plant of some sort which we have a symbiotic relationship with. Could this be the catalyst that removed us from the animal kingdom into eventual progression into advanced civilization? Is this story an allegory of that? Milton's rendition seems to point to this from his affinity with the collective unconscious:\\"O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving plant, / Mother of [thought]! Now I feel thy power / Within me clear; not only to discern / Things in their causes, but to trace the ways / Of highest agents, deemed however wise /...[You give us] life / To knowledge [, chaos, creativity and Novelty] (IX 279-287). Not death, but life / Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys, / Taste so divine, that what of sweet before / Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh (IX 984-987). [A]nd shook sore / [Our] inward state of mind, calm region once, / And full of peace, now tossed and turbulent [, but oh how divine] (IX 1125-1126).\\"With a few insertions to sway the context, which has minimal influence to its overall meaning, anyone who has ever had a psychedelic experience sees how ostensible this concoction of words describes the nature of that psychological event. - D.R.Thomas"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Historical significance and beautifully descriptive prose aside, I couldn't get into this book at all.

I can see why Milton's attempt to enlighten his audience as to the events leading up to the fall of man were important and relevant at the time that it was written and can see the significance of his writing on the literature of today, I just did not find Paradise Lost to be personally satisfying or enjoyable.That being said, there are some passages throughout the text that are extremely rich, beautiful and powerful examples of what the English language can be in the hands of a master author.

He doesn't synthesize as much as he subsumes entire civilizations worth of symbols, motifs and allegories into his own extended riff on the first four books of genesis. He throws together images from greco-roman antiquity, paganism, medieval European mysticism, etc, and churns out this impossibly rich, chthonic view of the divine world that only Dante could keep up with. And unlike Dante, this just hammers you into the ground on each page with sensory and historical overload. Whether you like it or not, it's hard not to acknowledge just how exhaustively ambitious Milton was. And hey, the man can write a really good villain, or anti-hero, or whatever Satan is supposed to be"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"This is a dense, imaginative book, an only-book-to-take-with-me-on-a-deserted-island kind of book. Although the story is mainly based on Christian mythology, it is just as appealing for atheists because Milton mixes Christian and classical mythology and thereby shows the roots of Western culture. It is no wonder that William Blake was so inspired to draw his fantastic art fitting this text. The book's extreme patriarchal views, bearing on repugnant misogyny in some places, will disturb some readers. This issue has nothing to do with the aesthetics of the book, but modern readers would have difficulty ignoring it.Readers are advised to find an edition with detailed and directly adjacent annotations in order to appreciate what Milton is up to in each word, line and book (chapter). There is much below the surface. And yet at times one should just read on and let the art wash over in waves. This is a good way to take on Milton's torturously contorted sentences or to deal with some of the ancient-sounding names that Milton made up for effect. Knowing Milton's biography also helps: the story is also about his frustration with the English who gave up much of their hard-earned liberty after the English Civil War. The circumstances under which Milton created his classic epic were dramatic: after having led a colourful life and helping to lead the English Republic, he was a poor, blind pariah who dictated his prose. Homer is also thought to have transmitted his epic orally.The following paragraph is a citation from Northrop Frye in the edition that he introduces (Rinehart Editions, 1951): Most Renaissance critics regarded the epic as a greater form than tragedy: this fact is to be connected with the humanist sense ... of the encyclopaedic range of knowledge to be derived from the study of the classics. For the difference between an epic and an ordinary narrative poem lies chiefly in the encyclopaedic quality of the epic. The epics of Homer, Virgil, Dante and Milton are vast syntheses of the religious, philosophical, political and even scientific ideas: they integrate not only the poet's own thinking but the whole culture of their times. An epic of this sort can only be written in an age which possesses some kind of encyclopaedic vision. For Milton, the humanist synthesis of knowledge was in its turn contained within Christianity. The Bible, as Milton saw it, transcends all secular knowledge, but comprehends it too, and it is also encyclopaedic, though on a far bigger scale. ... Traditionally, too, the theme of the epic is heroic action, and all the conventional features that Milton takes over from the Classical epic--the similes, the battles, the set speeches, the invocation to Muses, the councils of gods and leaders--are concerned essentially with this theme.For Milton, Christ is the hero of this epic, despite Milton's wooden portrayal of him. Satan is only a mock-hero, but is more interesting. Harold Bloom perceives Milton's Satan as comparable to and inspired by Shakespeare's great baddies. Frye writes: \\"Satan is the haughty Achilles, the crafty Ulysses, the knight-errant who achieves the perilous quest of chaos, and all through the first four books he is surrounded with the rumors and the panoply of war.\\" Because his heroism is based on pride, Satan is doomed \\"and merely by the compulsion of obeying his own nature, is forced to become more and more debased. By the time he has got himself disguised as a talking snake and is congratulating himself on catching Eve alone with the man of the house away, the sombre Promethean rebel of the opening books seems remote.\\" But for Milton, Christianity is deadly serious, so Satan is never comical but a constant threat to man.Paradise Lost resonates, deep and wide. As literature it could conceivably have been effective even if it had been based on a mythology other than that of Christianity, but for readers sharing Milton's Western culture, another mythology is unlikely to have achieved such deep resonance. There is no doubt that the Bible's short creation story was extended with much fantasy and mythologized in popular perception by the medieval Church, but on reading this book one wonders to what degree the popular story was further extended and mythologized by just one individual, John Milton. Furthermore, Milton was perhaps the top creator of English neologisms (over 600, much more than Shakespeare). For a thoughtful analysis of how deeply the \\"Edenic narrative\\" has effected us, see William Cronon's anthology \\"Uncommon Ground\\"."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","review":"When presented with a choice between a free and a cheap ($2) Kindle edition, I usually go with the cheap edition. But here, there was also a \\"moderate\\" priced Kindle edition, with a critical introduction. I chose the third, not for the benefit of the introductory essay or even for the pictures, although both were welcome. I picked this one because it had both hard copy page number and the line counter. There is nothing worse than having someone give you a reference by line number, and you can't find it, because your edition left off the lines. Of course, you can usually find the reference by searching, but for really common words, like \\"Satan\\", for example, that can be tedious. The only improvement I can imagine would be if this were an annotated edition, which it is not. But since it is in English, the main questions are to what events of the day may Milton be referring.

In \\"Deep Cuba,\\" we set sail with him aboard an expedition vessel for a journey that plies the waters of both politics and discovery.Through his poetic telling, the island's previously unexplored waters come to life, populated by everything from mysterious bioluminescent creatures and toothy sharks to the simple souls whose livelihoods come with the tides. We meet a variety of Cubans, among them a harbor master who boards the ship and skillfully guides it to port, two scientists who join the expedition in a rare show of cooperation between Cuba and the U.S., and a group of boys who frolic among the watery mangroves of a distant island during a break from their studies of becoming boat captains. And late in the book, there is Castro himself, who boards the ship with his inquisitive intellect.We witness, too, the dynamics of an expedition driven by filmmaking -- in this case, a documentary for the Discovery Channel, which funded the voyage. Belleville lets his keen observations of the personalities of the expedition ebb and flow through the narrative, and it soon becomes apparent that relations between the filmmakers and scientists are at times as chilly as those between the U.S. and Cuba. We learn first-hand how science can take a back seat to the wants of filmmakers, even on such a rare expedition as this.Throughout the book, there is much high adventure. Belleville descends 2,000 feet under the surface in a mini-sub, and he dives reefs and plunging ledges that teem with fish. In one harrowing chapter, he even loses his way during a night dive in open water.The book is a page-turner, to be sure. But along the way there is much to be learned as Belleville weaves scientific findings and cultural observations seamlessly into the telling.At the very least, this scientific expedition has found a happy marriage in word, if not on film."},{"Title":"Deep Cuba: The Inside Story of an American Oceanographic Expedition","review":"Bill Belleville, environmental journalist, diver and storyteller pulls us out of our easy chairs and transports us to the forbidden waters of Cuba on board the marine discovery ship Seward Johnson.Leading American marine biologists were invited by The Discovery Channel to accompany their documentary film-makers for a rare look at the undisturbed bio-diversity of the Cuban coast and adjoining waters. Belleville, who had participated in a similar voyage to the Galapagos was invited along to transmit the adventure to The Discovery Channel's web site.Tension between the scientists and film-makers was pervasive throughout the month-long voyage. Good film-making (i.e. sunken treasure and toothy barracudas)and good scientific study (i.e. the discovery of new life forms)are not necessarily consistent.Competition for use of the deep-diving minisub, Johnson Sea-Link was intense. Sadly, more often than not the film-makers favored by The Discovery Channel won out over the scientists.Belleville rides the sub twice, and takes us along in that chilly, cramped, dangerous machine into the mezmerizing depths of tropical reefs and underwater mountain ranges.We also visit the benighted island, the haunts of Hemingway and San Juan Hill. We steam past the Bay of Pigs. We meet the people: the woman who escapes poverty by offering herself to the visitors; the proud fishermen whose love of Cuba is palpable; and El Jefe, himself who boards the boat and shares his profound knowledge of his beloved Cuba with the scientists. A good tale--well written."},{"Title":"Deep Cuba: The Inside Story of an American Oceanographic Expedition","review":"Bill Belleville's Deep Cuba book is part Cousteau adventure tale, part natural history, part cultural history, with a smattering of Hollywood documentary drama. It is enjoyable and engrossing to read- a must for those interested in protecting our fragile environments. Belleville's sensitivities and attention to detail give us greater understanding of the pristine waters and lands of Cuba, a place that seems so far away, yet is in reality right next door. Like many readers, I have grown up during a time when Cuba has been \\"off-limits.\\" Ironically, this embargo has in many ways protected the environment by keeping masses of American tourists away. How lucky we are to be able to visit this magical place through Belleville's enlightening account."},{"Title":"Deep Cuba: The Inside Story of an American Oceanographic Expedition","review":"When the author climbed aboard the research boat hired by a Discovery Channel film crew bound for Cuba, he gained entry to two engrossing stories. One covers the exploration of Cuba's coral reefs, sunken ships, and sharks, whose mysteries are elucidated live-on-location by Discovery's consultant scientists and cultural experts. This story is by turns exotic science, pure travelog, and just plain spooky - expedition members in a submersible find two complete sets of diving gear hundreds of feet below the safe diving range, in an area where divers were known to have disappeared. Belleville's deep dive in the little sub hangs in mid-book like a luminous bubble of science, poetry, and spookiness.The second story is a weird tale of the making of a documentary film. It's unnerving to see the innards of the \\"documentary\\" process exposed. For instance, Belleville watches as the camera bypasses scientists who lack sex appeal or sound-bite savvy. Or, although Fidel Castro's visit to the expedition's ship makes great reading, it evidently makes bad vibes in Filmland, and is cut. And Belleville's account of the debate over whether the word \\"forbidden\\" should be used in the film title is hilarious.These two narrative lines intertwine to weave a fascinating path around, and even into the throbbing and troubled heart of - gasp! - the forbidden island of Cuba."},{"Title":"Deep Cuba: The Inside Story of an American Oceanographic Expedition","review":"The title of this book seems straightforward and explanatory enough. Yet, the content is far more complex, and thankfully, the author is more than up to the task of explaining broad concepts of oceanography, of documentary film making, and the oddball politics that have embargoed Cuba over the last 40 or so years. But more than anything, this is just a really well-told story that takes the reader along on an expedition to a place that few Americans have ever seen. Belleville seems to have a lot of experience as a scuba diver before this trip, and his acumen as an 'underwater naturalist' is much appreciated by this reader. So too is his exacting descriptions of daily expeditionary life---which at time is hilarious, enlightening, dangerous, and at times downright ironic.The chapter describing Castro's visit when the expedition is in Havana is refreshingly candid---and quite a hoot, as well. Belleville knows how to craft a good story, and has the stylistic tools to do it.Thematically, the author tries very hard to make a solid case for the need for more funding for ocean research---as well as for diplomatic relations that will finally let the leaders of the U.S. and Cuba manage their regional waters under one umbrella. As an educator specializing in marine sciences, I think the ecological connection between our country and Cuba is one of the great under-reported stories of our time. My deepest gratitude to Belleville for having the fortitude to tell it---and to tell it with great style."},{"Title":"Deep Cuba: The Inside Story of an American Oceanographic Expedition","review":"Bill Belleville amazed me with his incredibly detailed account of the daily activities going on board the RV Seward Johnson, on land, and aboard the Johnson Sea Link submersible.

Hence, this book comes just in time to review the state of the art and help \\"new comers\\" enter this field. The method is presented in a clear, easy-to-follow manner and the best part of the book, in my opinion, is the focus on several areas of application where tough problems were already solved with CE. I have recently used this book to support a novel CE application to project management and found it extremely useful. I think it should become a standard piece in the \\"tool-box\\" of both scholars and practicionairs interested in optimization."},{"Title":"The Cross-Entropy Method: A Unified Approach to Combinatorial Optimization, Monte-Carlo Simulation and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)","review":"The cross entropy method (CE) is a modern technique attacking optimization and estimation problems by simulation. It has been introduced by the first author and it is elaborated thoroughly in this book. The reader will find a lucid introductory chapter into the subject followed by the core of the book consisting of a chapter where CE returns an iterative algorithm for adaptive importance sampling simulation, and a chapter where CE is transformed into a randomized algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The book concludes with several chapters with applications including detailed numerical results and some Matlab codes.I read the book with great pleasure because it is a well written exposition of a fascinating method containing many illustrative examples and realistic applications. I think that it is appropriate for both practitioners and theorists in simulation and optimization. While reading the book I got encouraged to apply CE to several other problems because the CE basics seems so simple while the results are marvellous. I am interested specifically in rare event simulation so I focused on reading the simulation part where I found many inspiring new ideas. In fact, I applied CE to a reliability problem and obtained results far better than existing methods. The simulation chapter is the most mathematically oriented, for instance it gives a proof of convergence and it contains recent developments in simulation of rare events with heavy tails.I can recommend this book to everyone who likes to learn new ways for solving estimation and optimization problems."},{"Title":"A Mersey Duet (Ulverscroft Romance)","review":"I enjoyed this book of 2 sisters brought up so differently. They were separated by the death of their mother, Patsy is brought up by her father and his mother above the pub where her grandmother is the publican and her sister is brought up across the road above the antiques business that is owned by their maternal grandparents.Patsy was my favourite sister as she was so down to earth. I enjoyed the story of their lives."},{"Title":"The Battle of Glorieta Pass: A Gettysburg in the West, March 26-28, 1862","review":"This was a pleasant suprise about a battle that I knew little about. I don't know if I would call it the &quot;Gettysburg&quot; in the West. The Battle of Shiloh is the only battle that comes close to Gettysburg when it comes to mass of troops and casualties. However, this little known battle was strategically important for the Confederacy as they tried to spread their power west and their ultimate goal of obtaining the gold of California and Nevada and also obtaining official recognition by Mexico. The author does a good job explain the background of the Confederate troops (Texans) and the expidition they were on, as well as the Union troops (mostly Colorado volunteers) meant to stop them in their tracks. The Battle of Glorietta Pass did have significant casualties on both sides, however the ultimate key factor for Union victory was the destruction of the Confederate's supply train. I recommend this book to any Civil War enthusiast who wants to read about a different, little known but significant battle of the Civil War."},{"Title":"The Battle of Glorieta Pass: A Gettysburg in the West, March 26-28, 1862","review":"The Southwest theater of the Civil War is often overlooked--many people do not even know that there was such a theater. The Confederacy hoped to seize the Southwest, with an eye toward gaining an outlet on the Pacific coast.The action in this theater began at Valverde, well south of Albuquerque, where the Confederates won in February 1862. This drove the Union forces northward, but the Confederates did not capture the critical Fort Craig, which came back to haunt them.The Union troops, mostly from Colorado, met the Confederate troops, mostly Texans, in present-day northern New Mexico at the Battle of Glorieta Pass in late March. The authors do a masterful job of covering the battle in great detail. The Confederates won this battle as well, but were forced to retreat southward when Union troops captured their supply train. The Confederates retreated to Albuquerque, and eventually were forced to retreat back to Texas.The Southwest was saved for the Union.The book also has detailed appendices and is a great read for anyone unfamiliar with this far-flung engagement of the Civil War."},{"Title":"The Battle of Glorieta Pass: A Gettysburg in the West, March 26-28, 1862","review":"This book was a \\"gotta-have-it\\" buy at the Pecos National Historic Landmark bookstore. Pecos NHL is the site of the Gloriata Pass Battlefield (at least the Pigeon Ranch section); one of the newer Civil War battlefields added to the national park system.This is a good and detailed account of the battle. Probably best suited for Civil War buffs, the book gives a good background to the joining of a small band of Union and Confederate soldiers twenty-five miles east of Santa Fe, NM in 1862. The book lists troop movements down to the company and section level, gives brief sketches of commanders and illustrates the movements through a series of maps that clearly show the relative positions of soldiers as the battle progressed.For those uninitiated with the details of the battle, this book will give you a good understanding of why it was fought at Glorieta Pass and how positions and tactical moves developed during this largest of Civil War battles in New Mexico."},{"Title":"The Battle of Glorieta Pass: A Gettysburg in the West, March 26-28, 1862","review":"This was the third book I bought on the subject matter of the American Civil War in the Southwest. I choose it over the Don Albert's version since I already had the Bloody Valverde title from John Taylor. Generally speaking that was a good choice, as the format of the book remained the same and I knew what I was getting into.While more significant a fight than Valverde, the Glorietta fight is more difficult to follow and not as exciting. They did the usual good job of sketches and photos to help the readers follow along. I recommend it as the most straight forward work to get a person more knowledge on the suject. Perhaps even after a visit to the Pecos National Historic Park's new Battlefield Trail.I do feel that overall the Don Albert's book is the best on the subject matter. But for Wargamers and people with a cursory interest, this book will get you the direct results you want the fastest."},{"Title":"The Battle of Glorieta Pass: A Gettysburg in the West, March 26-28, 1862","review":"If you are doing a research project on this topic, and need to know who died where and what time they were at what place, this book will be very useful. I had just a casual interest (drove though the area on a recent vacation) so I found it was way more than I wanted to know. Writing is somewhat dry. But, now I know all about it!"},{"Title":"Prairie In Her Heart: Pioneer Women of North Dakota (ND) (Voices of America)","review":"This book brings the story of the prairie woman settler to life in vivid detail. The pictures are great, and even humorous at times. My favorite - the woman sewing her child's ripped shorts as he rests on her knees.The text catches the readers imagination and pulls them into the North Dakota frontier era with excerpts from historical diaries and documents.

In regards to the sections where they help you prepare for the different parts of the test, those are pretty horrible and lacking content. Luckily I had studied for the LSAT and had used the Powerscore Bibles, so I had a strong grasp for critical reasoning and reading comp, but where I needed some guidance was in the sentence correction. Because I was disappointed in this series of books I turned back to the Powerscore series (Sentence Correction Powerscore Bible). EXCELLENT.

It is interesting because it brings a shaddy comparison of miths and facts about the GMAT but it does not tell you how your answers affect your score, it seems to keep things secret.But the real 800 questions are very helpful for the good amount of practice you're gonna get, just don't expect good explanations on the correct answers or how to solve the most difficult problems, and also use a dictionary to undestand their english, it is too academic for some."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Please, don't waste your time on test preparation.

Most of the questions in this book are over 10 years old and they share approximately 90% of the questions with the 10th edition.The result is the difficulty level and types of questions contained in this book are no longer fully reflective of the questions one will receive in the real GMAT. If you need proof, download GMAT Prep (just google it) from the providers of the GMAT and you will see the GMAT Prep questions are substantially different and more difficult than the questions from these guides.The 1400 questions contained in these guides, however, are still somewhat useful, particularly if you are shooting for a lower end (450-620) score range.If anything, GMAT Prep, which is provided free by the makers of GMAT, is a far better reflection of the real GMAT. Although GMAT Prep does not provide solutions (only answers) to the problems, it contains hundreds of questions in its data bank which will help you prepare for the tougher GMAT problems."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Book is helpful mainly as a long list of sample questions and answers. Doesn't provide much teaching of what you need to know in certain sections (eg the math section doesn't cover some of the more complex rules of geometry etc that you need to answer the questions). Advice on how to take the test is pretty basic too. I would say this is a good book if you are reasonably confident that you will do well and it really is just a review book to remind you of a few things you may have forgotten; the answers are clear and well written, and so are helpful for 'brushing up' on what you may have forgotten, although at least one is wrong (or not fully right), and there are quite a few typos, but if you know your stuff this won't really through you off (beyond the fear that there could be mistakes on the GMAT itself!)"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I have just started preparing for GMAT. Have written another similar management entrance exam, so I have that material as a supplement to this. But this book feels good.

What I'd do, is I'd make an answer sheet out of a notebook paper, do the test, go back, grade myself, and here's the thing, KEEP THE ANSWER SHEET UNTIL THE DAY OF THE TEST. When my husband who doesn't know how to study to save his life went to Princeton Review for a practice test, the idiots there told him to &#34;toss the answer sheets so he can start fresh.&#34; Seriously?No. Label, date, and score the answer sheets, and keep them in a stack. After you have a good number of them, make another answer sheet with all the questions you got wrong the last time, with the page number and question number noted, and do them again. Every time you get a question wrong you should go back and look at that question and think about what went wrong. Why did you get it wrong?I did this over and over again until I got about 86% of the questions right consistently, and I thought that's not enough to get me the score I wanted, but it turned out this book is a weebit harder than the official GMAT, so I scored very well on the test.I credit this book more than I credit the Princeton Review book for my score. I hardly even touched the Princeton Review book because I didn't feel it had much to offer. However, my husband found the Princeton Review book to be helpful. I'm guessing if you need help setting the foundation for your math skills or teaching you basic grammar, then the Princeton Review book will be helpful, otherwise, this is the only book you need."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I think the practice tests help more than anything.

I was more focused on quick review (skimming) and doing practice tests."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I hated the GMAT but I have to admit this book was helpful.

The diagnostics are good, with well explained answers. The review sections are excellent, particularly for the math and sentence correction.While no computer tests come with this one, I think it should be the baseline for most people's studies. I feel I've already got my money's worth, just from the conceptual errors I've found in my understanding."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"If you are serious about taking the Gmat and getting a good score, you absolutely must buy this book along with the other two official supplements. Between the three books, you will have access to over 1,000 problems that have been retired from the Gmat and are 100% representative of what you are going to see come test day.My scores:Powerprep 1 (Official software) - 700 - no studyingPrinceton 1 - 630Kaplan 1 - 560Kaplan 2 - 600Kaplan 3 - 580Powerprep 2 - 730Actual Gmat - 750I am 100% certain that using all three books is what raised my score those last 50 points. On test day I was the only one at the center and I got to know the receptionist pretty well. She told me that she sees hundreds of these scores a year and the ones who get 700+ all have one thing in common - they have all done every problem in all three books.My advice: spend the money on all three. Work every problem, noting which ones are hard and which you get wrong. When you are done, go back and work the hard/incorrect problems again. Then, when you are done, start over from page one. You effort will be rewarded on test day."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I used the Kaplan guide and the official GMAT study guide to prepare for the GMAT. I first went throught the Kaplan guide cover to cover. I found the math review to be very helpful, and some of the test taking tips were useful. However, once I began reviewing the official GMAT study guide it became apparent that the practice questions in the Kaplan quide weren't quite accurate reflections of what the actual questions would look like. Practicing questions is the key to success in taking the GMAT. I've read some reviews in which people say you should only study the harder questions in the official review guide if you are finding the questions too easy, but I disagree. The key to doing well is to understand how the question writers try to trip you up, and you can only get to this point by practicing as many questions as possible. I went through every question in the GMAT study guide and by the end I could really begin to anticipate what the question writers were looking for. I ended up getting a 740. To summarize: the math review and some of the tips in the Kaplan guide are somewhat helpful, but I wouldn't waste much time on their practice questions. The practice questions in the official guide are indespensable - complete every one and review your incorrect answers and you will do well. I noticed a few reviews where people dismissed the value of the official GMAT guide because one or two questions had incorrect answers. They are nuts to devalue the book because it has a couple typos. Trust me - this book is the key to doing well."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"The official guide, along with the quantitative review is good for extra problems.

Though some of the explanations/concepts are not so well written, this book has the \\"REAL\\" content. Most of the questions listed in this book are supposedly taken from previous GMATS. And that explains why you see such a similarity between problems/questions in this book and the real GMAT ones.Having said that, just this book alone will not be sufficient for most of the people as there is a very less emphasis on explaining the basic concepts. I recommend using Princeton and/or Manhattan series books as a supplement to brush up the fundamentals and then use this one for practicing GMAT-like questions."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I only used, \\"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition\\" and the free CD to study for the GMAT.

You will learn the various ways used to lead you in error and consequently, you will develop the feel to spot and eliminate wrong answers.The rules of grammar on which the GMAT Sentence Correction questions are based are best outlined in this guide. I had a lot of difficulty with the Verbal section until I read through the explanations here.Overall, this book shows you all the tricks of the GMAT. I did not have bad surprises when I took the actual test; it seemed that I had seen all the questions before."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This book, coupled with the Official GMAT Verbal and Quant Review Guides (by the same company, GMAC) is enough to give you a thorough understanding, of the type of questions that can be expected in the GMAT and the reasoning needed to answer them correctly. I found the reasoning provided with each answer, especially useful. Another nice thing about these books is that the questions are arranged in increasing order of difficulty. So, if you find some questions very easy, just jump a few questions forward. The only setback with these books is that they do not give detailed explanations in the 'concepts review sections'.You will need to turn to other books/websites to get tips and tricks for the exam. I recommend Princeton for this purpose: The Princeton guide gave me very clear and effective test taking strategies that helped me a lot. I highly recommend NOT USING Kaplan, especially to take practice tests. The scoring is very tough, and you are tested in areas that are absolutely unnecessary for the GMAT. Also, very low scores on these tests are discouraging. I highly recommend taking the two Powerprep practice tests available for download from the GMAC website. These tests consist of 'retired' GMAT questions, and are very much identical to the actual GMAT. Your scoring on these tests would be identical to your actual GMAT score.My practice scores are as below (in chronological order):Powerprep Test 1: 630 (35 days before my GMAT)Princeton Test 1: 650Kaplan Test 1: 600Princeton Test 2: 670Princeton Test 3: 700Princeton Test 4: 720Kaplan Test 2: 530 (One day before my GMAT - Very, very discouraging!!)Powerprep Test 2: 750 (One day before my GMAT)Powerprep Test 3 (Reinstalled): 760 (with some repetitions from Powerprep Test 2)GMAT: 750 (Verbal 40, Quant 50)My GMAT Prep consisted of lots and lots of practice, analysis of my practice test results, and noting down where I erred, and making sure that I did not repeat my mistakes."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"After 3 months of study, I just took the GMAT last week. This is my first and only attempt at the GMAT-CAT. In fact this is the first standardized test I have taken in 12 years. Overall I am happy with my score (770 Q51 V44).The only study materials I used were:- Official 11th Edition- Official Verbal Review Guide- Official Quant Review Guide- Official GMATPrep Software (sent to you once you schedule your test)- Manhattan GMAT Guides (reviewed for techniques only)The three official books are the absolute bible for sample problems. I am a firm believer in quality over quantity. I NEVER did any problem that was not provided by the real GMAT company...NONE. Using problems written by other vendors is not needed, and could be counter productive. I would rather fully understand 200 official problems, than slog through 1000 non-official problems.STUDY TIPS:- First master all the problems in the printed official guides (11th, Verbal Guide, Quant Guide). NOTE: Getting the correct answer is not the same as \\"mastering\\" a question.- Any problem you miss or find changing, repeat many times (even after you may have memorized the answer). Keep repeating the problems, until the basic skill is fully understood.- Keep accurate records every time you do a problem (correct / incorrect, easy / challenging / stuck).- Focus on core concepts. In truth, the GMAT tests very few concepts, but will use these simple building blocks to construct an unlimited number of tricky problems. Know the core concepts, become aware of the tricks, and the rest is timing.- Only once the printed materials are exhausted (took me about 2 months), then you should \\"graduate\\" to the GMATPrep software. This should be used mostly for developing timing skills. In the end, you need to gain the confidence to flex your time during the actual test. You should be able to answer simple questions quickly, so you can invest more time in higher value problems.This book is not a problem solving technique book. You will not find tips and tricks. Basically this is book should be considered a \\"question bank\\". In the quantitative section it will provide the questions and an answer key...period. For the verbal section, it will provide very useful detailed explanations of the correct answers. If you are you looking for a book on techniques, I would recommend the well organized Manhattan book set.Bottom-line: you need this book for any serious attempt at the GMAT."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Here's how one old geezer (47 y/o) prepped for the GMAT. I started in late June 07 and first bought the Princeton Cracking the GMAT and Math Workout books. I worked through all the quantitative sections in those books and skimmed the verbal (I am far weaker in math than verbal). That took about a month. Then I bought the GMAT Official Guide and again worked through the quantitative areas and skimmed the verbal. That took another 4 weeks. In the meantime I had signed up for the test and received the GMAT prep software. I took the first practice test in mid-July and scored 560. That was fine with me because I only needed to score 500 or better to get into the grad program I wanted. When I completed the Official Guide (about three weeks later) I took the second practice test and scored 680. I reviewed certain math topics for another two weeks and took the test Sept 6. My official score was 670, not Harvard-worthy but plenty good for someone who took their last math class twenty years ago. So my advice in a nutshell is use the Princeton books, the Official Guide and take both tests on the GMATprep software. The practice tests are great for acclimating yourself to the actual test taking environment and learning how to pace yourself. And don't be afraid to guess on math questions- a wild guess is better than taking 5 minutes to work out one problem. Good Luck- believe me, if I can do it you can too."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"The previous comment about all questions in RC and CR being the same is incorrect.

There are less questions in the 11th Edition than the 10th Edition overall. One reason for you to HAVE to take the new version over the 10th is that you have used up all the questions in the old book.Price.Its way more expensive than the older version. Originally the 11th edition guide was set for $32.95 retail (pre-release stated price)but now, the website and everywhere else is pricing it at $36.95. Again, unless you have done all the questions in the 10th edition, or can't get your hands on the 10th edition anywhere, you might want to consider the 10th rather than the new.Relevance.Supposedly, the explanations for the answer choices have gotten better. I have yet to review the answer choices, but i must say that the answer explanations, in the 10th Ed, in nearly all the Verbal sections were absolutely useless. If you used their methodologies to arrive at the answer, you are more likely to hurt yourself than to help yourself. The explanations in the 10th edition were not systematic, so it always relied on internal logic for each question. More often than not, GMAT questions are similar to one another and I am sure the people at ETS (The people who wrote this book) knew that, but they seem hesitant to reveal the \\"tricks\\".Overall it's not a bad book. Considering I been staring at my green/blue 10th edition for so many years, its nice to see a bright orange cover and nicer paper material inside the new book.As for actual functionality, if you have a guided instructor, the 10th and 11th edition might not be that big of a difference. If you are working alone, and the rumors are true about better answer explanations, then you might benefit from the 11th Ed.Irregardless of which one you decide, I really want to emphasize - all GMAT students MUST practice with the Official Guide. There is nothing out there that develops \\"air-tight\\" questions free from inconsistencies like the GMAT does. You can always use additional questions from various vendors as supplements, but the Official Guide is a must for your foundational GMAT preparation."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I just took the GMAT and used this book and the Kaplan 2007 book (and CD) to study. I would definitely recommend starting and ending with this book (and use the Kaplan one in between for its larger qty of questions and tests). I started with the diagnostic test and then worked through the sample questions. I found the practice tests to be excellent at reproducing the actual GMAT, both in the type of questions and the scores (I got a 760 on the GMAT and a 770 and 720 on the practice tests). Unfortunately, there are only two tests, which is why I used the Kaplan book for more practice. Kaplan was good for practicing your speed, but it's not very good at teaching you the concepts you need to know. It completely missed some math topics, and tested you extensively on things you didn't need to know. Also, the verbal section of Kaplan is crap...the sentences are poorly worded (and sometimes just wrong) and it's frustrating if you're trying to figure out what good english should be like (since I wasn't educated in an ivy league, my spoken english can be rather...bush-like). It's also very frustrating/discouraging because my scores on the practice tests were between 550 and 650. My recommendation is to start with this book to get a feel for things, then use Kaplan for mass quantities of stuyding, and then finish up your studying with this book again so everything that you actually need to know is fresh on your mind for the test."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Don't panic if you get low scores on Powerprep practice exam. Check out my scores:Kaplan (first try): 530Powerprep 1: 600Powerprep 2: 590Powerprep 3: 610Actual GMAT score: 670 (88th percentile)This book is GREAT practice, as the problems are all old GMAT problems. Keep in mind that the HARD problems are in the last 100 questions of each section. The easy ones are in the first couple hundred, and might waste your time.This book has answer explanations, but NO tips or tricks. Definitely use this book along with the Kaplan and/or Princeton review books. The tips and tricks are what help you solve the tricky problems in the limited time available."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Weighing in with over 800 pages, 800 practice questions and answers, and a bright orange cover, this book is the best twenty-two bucks you'll spend on preparing for the GMAT, hands down. When you're in the market for practice questions, your number one priority is authenticity. Since the Official Guide is written by the same folks who write the test itself, it doesn't get any better than this.There are some drawbacks. The section overviews are well-nigh worthless, and the explanations are often opaque. You'll never find the \\"faster way\\" in this book, but if you're working with a tutor, that's what he or she is for. The book claims that questions are organized by difficulty level, but there are no markers to indicate what those difficulty levels are; also, I suspect they are organized only in the most general manner.Most students will start with the Diagnostic Test (section 3), which is actually one of the more challenging parts of the book. The questions, on average, are set at about the level of a 600-650 test taker. Because the diagnostic is not adaptive, your score (the book provides a conversion table) is not all that predictive of how you'd do on the computer-based GMAT.In other words, this book is far from being the perfect GMAT resource, but because it is the one location where you'll find hundreds of authentic test questions, it's a must have. It should be at the center of your preparation from day one."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I recently went through the whole GMAT experience. I purchased this book and borrowed the Princeton Review 2006 edition. The Princeton Review book is great for preparing for the test. It especially helped on the Sentence Correction Section and gave some good insight on the Critical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension. The book also gives a very good math review. While there were a couple of items that I felt like it missed, it is still by far the best Math Review out there. I read the Princeton review book first and did all the practice questions in it first. As for the practice exams, I felt that they were very accurate and on the same level as the real GMAT. I received two 710s on the Princeton Review practice exams. I also got this Official Guide. It has lots of questions as advertised. The review sections were pretty weak. The one major thing it does provide is insight to how the test makers think. When reviewing their answer explanations, you start to build up an idea of their logic. It helps come test day. I also used the GMATPrep software to take a practice exam 2 days before the test and scored a 730 on it. On test day, I felt fully prepared. When you are finishing it, you feel like you did worse than you really did. In the end, I got a 760 which I am happy about. I could not have got this score without both books. If you just need a decent score and are only going to spend money on 1 book, I would buy the 2006 Princeton Review edition. If you are striving for the best, get both. Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"If you're taking the GMAT, you must work through this book. I made the mistake of buying every study guide out there (Kaplan, Princeton Review, Barron's...), but on the day that I walked into the test center, the Official Guide was the only book that I had used.I took the GMAT a single time and scored a 770. Here's how I did it:1. I bought the Official Guide.2. I bought Jeff Sackmann's two e-books, The \\"GMAT Math Bible\\" and the \\"Official Guide to GMAT Review\\" and used them to work through each problem in the Official Guide.[...]3. When doing a set of problems from the Official Guide, usually 10 to 15 at a time, I timed myself. Anytime I took longer than 2 minutes to complete a a problem or I got it wrong, I read Sackmann's explanation and re-did the question from scratch.4. I worked through the Math Bible methodically, trying to do at least one full chapter a night.5. Six weeks before I took the test, I[...] This is the official site of the GMAC, and the only place that you can access these two practice tests that use the same scoring logarithm as the actual test. Two weeks before my test date, I took the second practice test.All in all, I spent about two months studying for 1-3 hours a day - and I work full-time, so it wasn't easy. But it was worth it. You *need* the Official Guide if you're studying because it's the only resource with actual questions from the GMAT. The rest of the books out there use made-up problems and many of them aren't very accurate. Because the Official Guide doesn't rate each problem's difficulty, you should consider a companion book (like the ones mentioned above) that rate the problems and offer better explanations."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"It is imperative that when you practice for the GMAT you actually practice with questions that are most likely to appear on the GMAT.All questions are GMAT are copyrighted, that means other guides cannot reproduce or even represent the questions with minor modifications. Since you cannot predict the question that will come on the GMAT, the best thing to do is to practice on questions that have previously appeared on the GMAT.This guide book does exactly that, it gives you a LOT of past questions arranged in ascending order of difficulty for both the quantitative and the verbal section. According to me, it is the best guide book you can find for practicing for the GMAT."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This is the book put out by the company that actually creates the tests. I believe it is a fair assessment, and reflects the test pretty accurately. I just took the GMAT yesterday. I used this and theCracking the GMAT, 2008 Edition (Graduate Test Prep)(without the CD/DVD). I would say the Princeton is much better for basic math review (and review in general). I found The Official Guide reviews to be too cumbersome and dry to use as I was trying to remember math I took 15+ years ago.The explanations with the sample tests in The Official Guide are good however. There are hundreds of sample questions, so be prepared to spend some time. For me the Princeton worked as a way to get back into the material. The Official Guide practice tests then functioned as a way to see if my understanding was sufficient.However, I would say the sample tests in Princeton are easier, and this is a more accurate reflection. I found the most important thing I did was to download the practice test from mba.com and simulate the actual test in 4 hours, minimal breaks. It looks exactly the same as the real test, so you will be much more comfortable. Good luck."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I took a Kaplan prep course and studied very hard. I did all of the required homework assignments and I attended every class. The problem was this: the Kaplan preparation questions are slightly different from the actual GMAT test questions. If you want to do well on the test, it helps to see \\"real\\" questions. I estimate that of my 120 point improvement, my score went up about 50 points just because of the practice questions in this book.If I had to do it all over again, I would just buy this book. It has everything I would have needed. Tons of actual test questions, great review summaries, explained answers.In short: Take a class only if you need the structure. Get this book, take the diagnostic test in it. Take the two tests you'll get from GMAC when you sign up for the GMAT. Good luck."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I found this book very helpful because I knew that the questions were truly representative of the actual test questions. The sample questions are organized by question type (problem solving, sentence correction, etc.) and by hardness (the first is the easiest, the last the hardest). This makes it easy to focus on problem areas and not waste time on questions you find easy.The downside of the book: besides the sample questions, most of the information is available for free from the GMAC website (mba.com). Some sample questions also appear in the free software (also available at their website), but supposedly this won't be the case after 1/1/06."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"One great question bank for GMAT takers. I haven't taken my actual one yet but I have found this book very helpful, given the fact that this is put together by the test makers. I also have their Verbal (purple) and Math (green) workbooks, but I see many of the questions overlap with this fat, orange guide. If you are trying to learn tactics or strategies that tell you how to tackle different question types, you will NOT find these GMAC-published books so helpful. However, if you are seeking a great resource for real GMAT questions that actually appeared in the previous exams, yeah, please go for this OR the workbooks for verbal and math. I don't think you need all three."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I used three different books (Kaplan, Barron, and this one) to prepare for the GMAT and I have to say that this one helped me the most. The reason why I think this book is the best is that it has not only tons of sample questions but they are also very close to the real test questions. Furthermore, this book has very detailed reviews for each question that help you to understand the systematic of the test questions."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I have been studying for GMAT for a few weeks now and I think the OG is a great source for a good practice on real GMAT questions. But having said that, use the OG only once you grasp all the basics and when you are almost ready to take the GMAT. The OG does not contain any math conceptual content, so use it only for practice towards the end.In order to get a real GMAT prep - I would recommend you buy the set of 9 books of \\"EZ Solutions,\\" or whichever book(s) you think you need most help with. These books are very detailed oriented and cover everything on the GMAT math. First use the review modules to get the concepts and then use the workbooks for practice. Some of the most challenging topics in GMAT math, such as permutation/combination, probability, geometry problems, complex word problems, etc., are brilliantly explained in these books. Also, the EZ Advanced Workbook is a \\"must have\\" if you are aiming for a high score. It may be a good idea to buy Barron's without the CD (don't waste money on the CD version for any book). After doing all this, use the OG and you will see a dramatic difference in your scores. If you still need more practice, you may consider buying the Kaplan book (but really not needed). Save your money by not buying anything else. You don't even have to take any of those pricy courses. I followed this process and my scores have jumped from the 500-range to the 700-range.

How will people be truly prepared, if that's the case?!The math review is helpful, but there is little to no advice when it comes to the sections regarding data sufficiency and sentence correction. One of the tips for sentence correction just tells you to read! Books, newspaper, whatever, because they generally use correct grammar. What?! Seriously, GMAC?I use the problems in this book for drill, in tandem with the Princeton Review books for strategies. I think that's the best way to go. I sure hope the 12th edition has improved on the misprints and whatnot... buyer beware!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Make sure you check couple other books (not from creators of GMAT exam as this one is).

I only want to briefly warn anyone that thinks of buying this book to PREPARE FOR THE GMAT that they will be disappointed. Yes there are wonderful reviews of math concepts and verbal analysis, however the sample test and practice problems will mislead you to how well prepared you think you are. For example, of the over 220 practice math problems I got over 90% of them correct, however I did not score even in the top 70% on the test. Similar results for verbal. I am severely disappointed since I actually have a strong math background but have been out of school for many years. The review was good but the questions are not similar in difficulty or mechanics as the ones I got on the actual test.

After taking the test the first time using only the Kaplan and Arco guides I was not happy with my score, nor the review material in either book. I then purchased and used the Princeton Guide and the Official Guide (big orange one). An important point concerning me was that it helped raise my score by 90 points to where I needed it to be. More importantly, for this review, is to let you know that the tips, practice tests, questions and hints on how to prepare and take the exam were top notch in the Princeton Guide. Using the Princeton Guide as your strategy and the Official Guide for the practice questions is the best way to raise your score. The diagnostic test in the Official Guide helps and the warm up tests in the Princeton Review both help give you a feel for what type of questions you'll need to practice most. Use the 2 online practice tests from Princeton Review after you buy the book also since the Official Guide only comes with questions in the book, no CAT.My advice:1) Read the information about the test and thoroughly understand the time limits per question to finish on time2) Take the warm up test and the diagnostic test to determine your strong and weak points3) Go through the Princeton Review, every section to learn strategies4) Go through the Official Guide and answer the first 20, middle 20 and last 20 of each section to get a feel for what level of difficulty you are consistently scoring well at5) Then take a practice exam and time it6) Go back and answer the next 20/20/20 from the Official Guide7) Then take the other practice exam8) Then just finish as many questions in the Official Guide as you have time forI would recommend at least 1 month preparation and if you don't score as good the first time, take it the very next month after studying the addional weeks.The best things are having a very good feel for timing (practice timed tests) and do as many practice problems from the Official Guide as you can. Finish the book if possible. I did about 75% of all the questions in each section. I answered like 30 questions almost each night for a month until I was sick of GMAT type questions but well aware and familiar with all the questions types.So 2 books: Official Guide and Princeton Review and you are off to the score you'll need.

Here, I will review this book and its importance in the overall preparation.First, I was short on time in preparing for GMAT and applying in time. So, I didn't had time to go over all the material and guides available in this universe, and then compare and review them.Second, before you start your preparation, or make your plan, you need to understand what GMAT is and what it measures. Then try to understand how much time and effort you will need to achieve a good score, for the school(s) you are applying to.- OG will certainly help you to understand what is GMAT, what it measures and how the different sections test your those capabilities.- The Diagnostic Test, taken under strict examination conditions, will measure your current performance and identify the areas you need to focus.- The Verbal and Quant sections of OG are mainly a collection of past GMAT questions, their answers, and explanatory solutions.- There is very little theory/concepts and very generic strategies. However, do read them carefully.Once you identify the areas you need to focus on, find the guides with concepts, fundamentals, and tips and tricks. Do your research by reading reviews, and consulting your peers who have used them in past. Every guide is different and have different difficulty levels. What works for one may not work for another.For Sentence Correction, I will recommendSentence Correction GMAT Preparation Guide (Manhattan GMAT Preparation Guides). For other sections, I used an old, borrowed edition ofNova's GMAT Prep Course (with Online Course). Unfortunately, I cannot comment about Kaplan, Princeton, Veritas etc since my aim was to get a good score and not compare all these guides. (I spent 3 weeks overall and got a very decent score)Coming back to OG, here is what I recommend:- Do all the questions.- Do all the questions, at least three times. By doing so, you can master a lot of concepts and calculations.- Do not get discouraged if you get low scores on simulated tests of the other study guides. Actual GMAT level is closest to this OG. Other guides' sample exams have a hidden marketing motive too. They want you to buy their books or take their course. So, their questions' level may not be same as that of actual GMAT. In fact, I found some of them very difficult. (Won't take names, but I took those online free sample exams from those famous names in Study Guides & preps)- If you have time, get GMAC's Verbal and Quant supplements to practice more & more.At last, it's all about speed & accuracy. Best of Luck!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This book will give you a lot of the questions you should be familiar with to take the GMAT but it does not give you a great background on how to get the knowledge you need. If you're planning on taking the GMAT, this book is definitely the one you want. But if you need help in the math area, you really ought to consider taking an algebra/geometry class at a community college or at least taking a review course. Of course this depends on the type of program you're trying to get in to.I used this book in addition to taking the Veritas ($1200 for 3 months) review course and checking out all the other GMAT books from the library. Overall, this is the best of the group and the one you should buy first but you'll probably want to use a few others in addition.By the way, my score was in the 89th Percentile, although my math was in the 53rd. I wish I would have taken an algebra and math class as I am trying to get into one of the top MBA programs."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I have taken the GMAT last year and scored in 86th Percentile ranking. This book contains tremendous number of questions. They are not necessarily tough but they provide good insights. I also used Princeton, Kaplan and Manhattan (only for Sentence Correction). However they turned out to be more volatile in terms of the results of their tests and my actual performance. The percentage of the correct answers in this book and my actual performance were closer. I strongly recommend this book to the GMAT takers. Good luck to you all who will take the exam:-)"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This book will not reveal the tricks on how to succeed at the GMAT, [...]However, the \\"Official Guide to the GMAT Review\\" will give you plenty of practice problems. Also, one of the essay topics that I received on the real exam was published in the Official Guide, so I had already seen it before I took the test, although I hadn't practiced that essay topic. The people who publish this book are the people that write the test.....it doesn't get any better than that!

I've found 7 in 20 pages. Come on.The errors go beyond having \\"x2\\" instead of x^2. The errors go to basic concepts that if a trusting reader were to follow, the test-taker would be in trouble. Sometimes the diagrams don't match the word descriptions. In the review of coordinate geometry, the equations given and the graph representation are way off. If you don't have your high school notes handy or are a little more than rusty, this could hurt you.While I'm sure the rest of the book is helpful, I am giving this 1-star because it smacks of laziness and it's kind of insulting. It's troubling to think that these mistakes are acceptable for an organization that administers a major graduate admissions test. We wouldn't get into B-schools with errors like these.To the GMAC: take notes from the LSAC, and leave the test review to the pros."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This book has 800 real GMAT test questions and detailed answers. No other book has the real questions and there truly is a difference. I studied the Kaplan Book, Kaplan 800, Kaplan flashcards, and Princeton Review...knew all the subjects well --- but when I took the test the questions were slightly different from what I had been studying and it shook me. I received a 650 on my first test and now I'm studying again...using this book.This book is a wolrd of difference and going through all 800 GMAT problems has helped my confidence and skill level immensley."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"\\"GMAT Review\\" (\\"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition\\") by the Graduate Management Admission Council is an essential and challenging piece of preparing for the GMAT. While I have the 11th edition, I suggest purchasing whatever edition is most current (at present the 12th edition,) as questions and emphasis shift over time. The strong suit of this book is without question the questions themselves, which are actual GMAT questions. The book has no real weak points, but if forced to pick one I would say that some of the reviews at the outset of the book are somewhat cursory. Partially because of that I also bought The Princeton Review \\"Cracking the GMAT\\" preparation book with DVD. Between the two I found optimal test preparation.I would not even think of taking the GMAT without this book. I recommend buying the latest editions of both \\"The Official Guide for GMAT Review\\" and \\"Cracking the GMAT.\\" Study hard and good luck!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Although I bought this book late in my review schedule, I still was able to make the most out of it. The questions I answered were fairly easy but it helps you get familiar with the types of questions on the GMAT.I only applied to one program and thanks to this book, it has helped me achieve the score I needed to get accepted!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Most people will not need to purchase several GMAT books at $30+ each to succeed. Nevertheless, I believe that many people would benefit from having other books that focus more on skills and strategies to complement this one. My most important point is this: other books will no doubt be useful in some way; however, this one is a MUST, it is the \\"cornerstone\\" for further preparation.One thing to note about this book: it will NOT teach you the fundamentals of math or correct grammar or critical reading, etc. It is more accurate to think of this book as a collection of practice questions which assume you already have those skills. In other words, if you need to brush up on these things, get out the old math textbooks from college and the old grammar and syntax books from high school.Another thing about this book: It keeps the test's \\"goals\\" in perspective. Though many of its questions are difficult, the GMAT is not filled with impenetrable journal passages or advanced calculus; the test is trying to determine your grasp of the fundamentals of math, numbers, logic, and communication. Spending serious time with this book helped me think the way the test \\"thinks\\".Finally, download the free Test Prep software from www.mba.com. The software is formatted EXACTLY like the test, and it was invaluable in my preparation. The practice software was a bit easier than the real thing, so keep that in mind. For example, Practice Test 1 I got a 700, Practice Test 2 730, and Practice Test 1 again (reinstalled) 710.My score: 700 Analytical-45 Verbal-40Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Best prep book I used for the GMAT. I stumbled on it 1 week prior to taking the test, and wish I would have used it from the beginning."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"The questions in the official guide are relevant. Kaplan questions point you in the wrong direction and are a waste of time. I focused entirely on the official guide during the last 2 weeks beforethe test and I loved the verbal section esp because its highly accurate in the kinds of questions you are faced with in the real exam.The quantitative questions are not good enough ie hard enough and so even the official guide is inadequate if you want to score 90 percentile and beyond in Q.powerprep1 : 760 q:49 v:44Kaplan1 : 560kaplan2 : 610kaplan3 : 690kaplan paper : 670Kaplan4 : 660 (50/36)powerprep2 : 770 q:50 v:44After practicing with other Quant books and the Sentence correction guide of Manhattan GMAT, I improved my score.Actual : 770 (q50,v46)"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I purchased this book, the Princeton Review one, and the Barron's one, and I found this one to be the most helpful for studying the GMAT. This is the only \\"official\\" GMAT book, so it is the only one that contains real questions from the GMAT. It also provides review sections that tell you exactly what material you will find on the test. Since this is the official book, you can be assured that the material is accurate and provides the best representation of the types of questions that will be on the actual test.There is a diagnostic test that is helpful in gauging your current level of ability. And there are tons of practice questions - enough where you porbably won't have enough time to go through them all unless you start studying several months in advance.It is also essential to get the free GMAT CD-ROM that you can request when you sign up for the test. I think you can also get it as a free download even if you haven't signed up for the test yet, but the CD is available for free if you have signed up. The software provides full-length practice tests that are a necessary means of preparing for the real thing.Definitely get this book first, make sure you download the free software, and then I would also recommend that you purchase another book such as the Princeton Review one in order to get a different perspective on how to approach the test. A different book would be helpful to gain some additional strategies that the offical GMAT book doesn't offer.This combination of two books and the software and a reasonable amount of study time allowed me to increase my score by 70 points, and my starting score was already well above-average. I think it would be very possible to raise your score by 100 points or more by studying with some good books like this one and studying diligently.Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I used this book in conjunction with the Princeton Review and Kaplan books. The Princeton Review is a huge help for its review of the math fundamentals, but lacks a bit on questions. The Kaplan book is good because it prepares you for a harder test than the actual exam. This book, however, does the best job at just grilling you endlessly with questions.As most of them are actual retired test questions, they are the most accurate in terms of preparing you for the test. The wording in most is very similar to the actual exam, unlike a lot of the Kaplan questions. And many ranges of difficulty are covered, letting you prepare on multiple levels.The only shortcoming of the book is that it alone will not prepare you for the test - you need a review of the math section and some additional guidance for the verbal, which is the purpose of the Princeton and Kaplan books respectively. I don't consider this a failure, though... the quality of the questions more than makes up for an inadequate review section.This should be the last book you use as it's the most similar to the real test. I recommend doing every single problem in the book and doing at least a dozen of the suggested essays. Give yourself time allotments to finish groups of questions - this will help you focus. And then do as many full practice tests as possible. I ended up taking over 10 practice exams, half of those in the week before the test.I scored in the 96th percentile on my first and only exam with a perfect score on the essays. I did this using only books and didn't take an expensive class. It takes a lot of time, but it pays off."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"After searching high and low, this official guide should be your ultimate resource for actual questions from past GMAT exams. Other guides from Princeton Review, ARCO, and Kaplan come close, but you should really test yourself on the real thing. One good advice is to sit down and actual time yourself like in the real exam setting. This means that you move from one problem to another without going back to review your answered questions. The actual exam will not be paper-based but you can simulate by moving forward only. This is a computer adaptative exam so your responses determine the difficulty of the following question. Therefore, you can only progress forward since these questions try to mimic this by placing more difficult questions at the end (assuming you get the easy ones right). So, don't cheat yourself by going back and forth on questions since you cannot do this on exam day.The book consists of a diagnostic exam with various practice problems for verbal (sentence correction, reading comprehension, critical reasoning)and math (problem solving, data sufficiency). For the essay portion, there are several topics to choose from but you can't really grade yourself. Your best bet is to just read through some examples to get an idea of how is it graded. Also, review and review your mistakes and then revisit them later when you have purged your memory of the correct answers. GMAT will give you access to PowerPrep download software (CD available as well) once you have registered for exam appointment. I would recommend that you save this for the very end. Once you feel more confident, you can get a real assessment of how you will perform on a computer-adaptative GMAT exam. Good luck and keep this book close to you. It will definitely provide you with the best preparation for GMAT exam.Here is my experience in a nutshell: Kaplan visited my school and gave a practice exam on Saturday. I did average but not spectacular (don't get overly depressed over it, people always improve after practice). Two years later, I practiced with Kaplan book and this official GMAT book. I took another practice exam at Kaplan prep center. My score improved by 40 points. Later that month, I took the GMAT exam and my score increased another 10 points (total of 50 point improvement). Also, I did decent on the essay portion after just practice on some sample question. I just typed up my response in MS Word to an essay question from this official GMAT book. Now, I don't know what other people would expect in terms of improvement. But, you should not expect miracles like 100 point increase after tons of practice. Well, if this happens to you, then I guess that you have been extremely lucky and no need to go crazy for that perfect 800 score (unless you have a really big ego). If you are like the rest of us, then just moving up by a few points at a time is a very good sign of your preparation. I would just set my goal each day and don't stress over dismal scores. Just focus on where to improve like on critical reasoning, reading comprehension, etc. Plus, read over the explanations carefully since it goes over how to eliminate the obvious wrong choices. It just makes life alot easier when you can eliminate it down to just a couple good choices. Anyways, enough of the lecturing and get your butt in the library quiet room with this book."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I was initially intimidated by the size and the range of question difficulty of this book. It made me wonder if I could ever be ready for the test. But it turned out to be the best prep book among all that I used. There are conceptual reviews and explanations for answers. There is also a pool of essay questions, but I believe that it's only about 90% complete now because GMAC is constantly adding new questions to the pool. For people who know the concepts well and just need practice questions, this book itself or along with the other official GMAT guides (for verbal and quantative reviews) might be enough. But for others, it's better to supplement the official guide(s) with a prep book from Princeton, Kaplan, or others. I personally used Barron's, and you can see my review for that book here on Amazon. Finally, contrary to some reviews of this book, there are NO incorrect answers. In my opinion, I probably wouldn't have scored above 700 if I hadn't used the official guides."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Contrary to the information posted on some MBA chat sites, most of the reading questions and the CR questions are carried over from the 10th edition and/or the retired tests sold in PDF format on the MBA official store. (I haven't checked the math as thoroughly, but it looks pretty similar.) So if you have the 10th, you won't get as much as you might hope from buying this new edition. You will get what GMAT calls \\"improved\\" explanations. Improved? Maybe. They're still pretty circular at times (eg, D is correct because it's uh....correct), but they do seem more detailed and better organized. The two supplemantal volumes, one on verbal and one on math are pretty much the same story, old questions, \\"improved\\" explanations. They are all good study tools, just not as new as the GMAT folks would like us to believe."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I have worked for both Princeton and Kaplan. This is the material that I used in class, because no company gets the questions in the verbal section quite right, and good verbal practice is important since you need to get less verbal than math questions correct for a higher scaled score.Everything in the guide is accurate (except for the first combined sets question in the diagnostic exam!), though not particularly well organized. The unofficial guides give you a better summary of test content and strategies - use this book to practice those strategies.The only other problem is that this guide does not give a good sample of 700+ level questions. I scored in the mid 700s on the real test and most of the questions I saw were on a whole different order of difficulty. Also, if you want to score above a 600, make sure you practice combinations and permutations - they aren't covered very well in this book.The official guide is the only way to study for the verbal section (if you need more problems, use LSAT logical reasoning and reading comp questions; they are like GMAT questions but harder), and gives you an overall accurate picture of what to expect. Look over this book before you decide whether to spend 1300+ on a class you might not need"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This book does a great job of breaking down questions and problems. It shows you the patterns used in the tests so that you can recognized WHICH kind of problem is being presented. It explains a lot! However, you have to be careful because there are several errors, especially in the math section. The answers are right, but the mathematics getting to the answer is not always correct (ie. multiplication sign used where an addition sign should be)."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I skimmed through this book thoroughly and believe me it really paid off!. I used a \\"three - hundred\\" hour game plan, covered in roughly 2 months,with this book as a basic element of my plan. The questions and problems contained in this book give you a very close replica of the real GMAT questions you will encounter on the actual exam! They are actually selected from retired tests and liken closely the problems you will get on the real GMAT.Another upside of the book is that questions are organized in order of difficulty. Consequently, after taking the diagnostic test included in the book you can zero in precisely your performance level and start practising with the appropiate difficulty level questions!Compared with other preparation books I used(Kaplan GMAT - 2005 edition with CD included and Princeton Review - Cracking the GMAT 2005 edition also with CD)this was by far the most compelling!This does not mean you should rely solely on this book in your preparation, but practise with other books too, such as the ones I listed above. Those will give you a broader perspective and comprehension of question solving techniques and basic concepts that are indispensable to ace your GMAT. Don't forget that in the OG 11th edition you will find only lean methods and principles of how to solve a math problem or approach a verbal question!However another good aspect of this book is the answers and explanations section, which gives you clear, plain and detailed structure of the correct ad incorrect answers!Good luck with your GMAT!P.S. The price of the book rendered by this site I found it to be by far the best!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"The Official Guide is an absolute must when preparing for the GMAT mainly because it provides practice questions that are similar to what you'll see on the exam day. It offers abundant questions and explanations of the answers. In particular, each of the Critical Reasoning and Sentence Completion answer choices is explained in detail. When going though the Sentence Completion answer choices, I began to notice more quickly which choices were irrelevant. This made it easier to eliminate wrong choices and focus on the remaining 2 or 3 possible right choices. I wish the Math Section had included tips for answering questions faster. If you follow the sometimes rigorous methods of finding answers, you'll end up wasting time on the exam, especially with the Data Sufficiency questions. Even without helpful tips, this book is great for lots of practice. The Sentence Completion and Critical Reasoning Sections alone make this book worth its weight in gold. Some words of advice: don't underestimate the amount of time it'll take you to go through all the questions in this book. I did most of them over a one week period and it was brutal.

Good supplement for the Official guide 114. The solution explanations are very detailed and well-written - please make it a point to read the solutions carefully if you are following this book, read explanations even for the answers you got right - this would ensure that your line of reasoning was correct.What's not so great about it:1. CERTAINLY NOT A SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATIVE TO OG11 and KAPLAN 800 (if you are targetting above 700 scores)2.

These two were good enough to provide me with the familiarity of the test I needed, and to get a score that will not prevent me from applying to any MBA program.The guide has a review of all the things they are going to test you on during the test. First you can take a diagnostic test that will let you know which sections you should focus on improving more, and which ones you are quite good at. The diagnostic test results are separated by question TYPE so you don't waste time once you have the results.The guide then offers you a good review of each question type, and the things being measured. For quantitative sections, it lets you know the math you are expected to be able to do, and how to approach the problems. It also shows you where many people fail to answer correctly by pointing out some common mistakes. This is particularly useful for the Data Sufficiency part since most of us don't usually have to answer this kind of question ever in our life.This book is quite good at offering you what it should, familiarity with the questions you will be asked during the test so you know what to work on. The main purpose of this guide is for you to be able to use your time wisely during the test, and not waste time (or get an answer wrong) because you are not quite sure what the question is looking for. The guide shows you the specific wording used in the test, and how this wording should point out to you what to focus on, which is useful when answering questions based on reading passages. Another useful thing was getting familiar with the sentence correction questions, cause there are some quite repetitive things that will help you discard wrong choices right away, thus saving you time.Overall, this is the best guide for you to save time during the test without hurting your chances to get a great score."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Just in the early stages of going through the book but it's a very useful book with questions that are quite challenging and helpful."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I did the self diagnostic portion of the book and also did one of the practice exams.

The only thing this book is missing is extended explanations of some of the concepts commonly used in questions."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"It is ofcourse a must buy because it comes from the makers of the test.But then this is not exhaustive.

People are saying that the questions in this one and the verbal and math supplements books are the same so I went to Barnes and compared the reading comp sections and all passages were different. So...I don't know if they're comparing with the 10th edition or they're on something. If you're studying for the GMAT, at least get this book. It has a gang of questions from actual exams which is great for the verbal section because I would think verbal questions are harder to mimic than math questions.AT LEAST PURCHASE THIS BOOK OR THE SUPPLEMENTS.Manhattan books seem good too. I'll be ordering them within this month."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"For a more detailed review please refer to user Youssef J. Habbouche's review. I'm only going to include what I he hasn't.I'm actually giving this book 3.5/5 stars. Reason is because as the official prep book by GMAC, I think the number of typos and errors are unacceptable. For example #20 of the Problem Solving section:20. Of the five coordinates associated with points A, B, C, D, E on the number line above (diagram included in text), which has the greatest absolute value?&lt;options>(A) A = -2(B) B = -1(C) C = 0(D) D = 1(E) E = 2Quick glance at the options and you know there are 2 possible answers A and E. Answer according to text is A. There are other errors and typos like this scattered across the pages of this book. If you have a keen eye they shouldn't be too hard to pick out. Although it can be quite frustrating since the last thing one needs while preping for a test like this is to start second guessing one's ability.Overall it's a very good prep material especially because some of the questions in the book did show up on the actual test. If the errors and typos are a minor thing to you, this book is the way to go. Using other books as supplement might also help. Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"The content isn't organized very well in this book, but it was still extremely helpful in terms of the type of problems.

The example questions in this book are more what like you will see on the GMAT, but I found that the online practice tests were closest to the real thing.The review section in this book will confuse you even if you know the material, and does not cover anything but background so it was pretty worthless. There were also errors in this book (which I was surprised because it is from the GMAC jerks).I would get this book as the questions are pretty difficult and good for practice."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This book should be the first one you buy during your GMAT prep as it contains retired GMAT questions from past exams - this gives you a much better feel for the types of questions you are likely to encounter on the day. There are plenty of questions to practice with in both the quant and verbal sections - although beware that if you are also purchasing the old exams from the [...] that some of these will be replicated.The real weakness with this book is with the level of detail in reviews. Particularly in the maths section, it does assume a level of knowledge and some topics are not well covered at all (e.g. combinations, permutations). If, like me, you are someone who has not touched high-school maths in 10 years, then it may be worth purchasing a couple of specific maths review books to aid you in this section.The only other flaw is the lack of time practice available with this book, but it can be mitigated by downloading the free GmatPrep software [...] or by purchasing the old paper exams from the same website. If you cluster the maths and english sections, it will give you a very good feel for how to manage your time on the day.I had only a few months to prepare for the GMAT, and bought this book, the Princeton Review, Kaplan, as well as the old tests and diagnostic tools on the MBA website. These all helped me to get a score of 710 on the first go. The official GMAT tools are much better to rely on, but the others are a good source of additional practice questions."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Unless you are one of the lucky few who don't need formal instruction to prepare for standardized tests, you can not use this GMAT book as your only resource. But, if you are using other instruction or practice materials the Official Guide is great for testing the accuracy of the strategies you've learned.It's true that this guide will not tell you how to test better, but some people have left reviews saying there aren't any explanations. I don't understand why they're saying that though, because I thought one of the best features of the GMAT Review is that it explains every single answer in both the quant and verbal sections very clearly. There are some typos, but it's not like you can't figure what they meant to say. Some people have also said that random questions they tried from the book were too easy. I wonder what sections they tried, because at least in the quant portion the questions become increasingly difficult. So the first 50 questions are pretty easy, but the last 25 are much harder.Just as a side note, I took the 7 week Veritas GMAT prep course and scored a 630 on the test right when I finished the class. But afterward I spent the next month testing the strategies in this Offical Guide and improved my score to a 700. So I would definitely say it's helpful."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This is such a great study tool. The questions and answers are GREAT! The answers walk you through each question in detail, as well. Purchase this book before you pay for the GMAT Prep Class!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This book can't be beat if you're looking for a book that will give you an overall picture of the format of the GMAT. The book contains questions for all the math and verbal sections as well as providing essay examples.Another benefit of this book is that the questions are real questions from past GMATs. I think this is especially helpful in the verbal section as it is difficult for other authors (Kaplan, Princeton Review) to create realistic verbal practice questions.Use this book to get some great practice working a whole lot of real GMAT questions, but if you are looking for a book that helps you re-learn math concepts and has more of a textbook feel, look towards Kaplan."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"Forget kaplan or courses on preparing for GMAT. This book is essential if one wants to score a hihj grade. The more you use it, the better. A final remark: On each chapter, the most diffcult questions are the last ones. That's where one should start."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"The GMAT review book was brand new and completely unmarked. This was very helpful in doing exercises and utilizing the book to the fullest.

What makes it extremely useful is that it is the official product of the people that make the GMAT, so the questions and problems you will find in this book are similar to the ones on the test.I would also like to point out that I studied from 2 additional books which I would also recommend. First one is Princeton Review (it is excellent in explaining the techniques that ought to be used for test taking and you get 4 test that you can do on your computer) and the second one is Barron's GMAT prep (it has a lot of timed tests which are great for practicing since they emulate the test taking environment and conditions although the questions are not as good as in other mentioned books)."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This is a very necessary book for GMAT prep. Also recommend you go to GMATClub.com and look through all the great info there too.

Wouldn't waste money on a class if I were you."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This is a good review book if you are current on the types of problems you will be solving.

A great practice book, but only if you understand the theories behind the questions."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I just took the GMAT a few weeks ago and used this book in conjunction with Princeton Reviews Cracking the GMAT and the Kaplan Premier Program. While this book does not focus on teaching the concepts and fundamentals, it is ESSENTIAL due to the sheer volume of practice problems. Use the book as needed. If you are doing well on a section, only do the last 100 or so practice problems in each section. I was struggling on the verbal section, so I did all the Reading Comp, Critical Reasoning, and Sentence Correction problems and saw my verbal score climb 8 points from the PowerPrep test to the actual test!Best of luck to you!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This is some fantastic prep material. There are a few typos and there's some overlap between this book and the GMATPrep software. However, neither are showstoppers and I believe this is the only prep book with actual questions from previous tests so it doesn't get any more real than this.Here's what I did to study for the test:1. I took the first practice test from the GMATPrep software without any studying and got a 580.2. I put much dedication into finishing this book and thoroughly understanding the answers. This took about two weeks (a couple of hours after work everyday and all weekend afternoons).3. I had almost two weeks to go before the test so I took a week off from studying so I could get in a couple of days' work with the EZ Solutions Advanced Math book right before the test.4. I took the second GMATPrep test a couple of days ago and scored a 700.5. I took the real test today and got a 740.In hindsight, I'm not sure the EZ book helped that much beyond getting my brain going again after the break but I am 100% sure that this OG plus the GMATPrep were mainly responsible for the jump from 580 to 740. Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I purchased this book as my primary study book for the GMAT but I think it makes a better supplement to the Princeton Review or Barrons book since it has tons of problems but no actual tests. I didn't realize that until I bought it so be warned. If you are just looking to do question afer question to get practice, with none of the time contraints you face in the actual GMAT, this is the book for you. I found it useful overall, but not as useful as I thought I would. One last point, in terms of knowledge and improved learning, the quant explanations are very very useful, but the grammar and sentence correction ones didn't really help me improve my score."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This book begins by stating that it is virtually all you will need in order to score well on the GMAT. I went through the book backwards and forwards - again and again and again. Mind you, I have an MBA from a very good school already and am well able to study and master material. Upon taking the GMAT for my PhD program, the test had nothing even remotely similar to what this book prepared me for. Certainly, there are basic math principles involved, but the overall format and question types in this book didn't at all resemble what I was tested over on the actual GMAT. Outside of that, I was amazed at the number of grammatical errors in the book, especially as it is an 11th edition. Many of the exercises have incorrect verbiage and/or signage as it relates to math problems. If you are getting prepared to take the GMAT, you had better not leave it to this product."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"It is a must-have for every GMAT takers. It provides you lots of practice questions from past exams, which are in the same style as those that will appear in the actual exam. Practice with them improves your confidence. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"This book is definitely necessary if you are planning on taking the GMAT, even if you are planning to join a test-prep course.The book contains +800 retired questions, which are the best approximations of what you'll see on the actual test. The good side is that you'll be able to focus on the type of questions that you feel you need more pratice and you may practice a lot if you want. The weak side is that the answers for some verbal questions are not really convincing, it lacks test taking strategies (that's why many people go to Kaplan or any other test-prep courses) and in my opinion it should provide a separate section for hard, challenging questions (which are scarce in the book).Overall, this book should be the cornerstone of your preparation and should be used as a complement if you will be taknig a test-prep course."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","review":"I bought this book to be used as the required text for a GMAT prep course I am taking.I've only been using the book for a week now, so my review is still in it's very early stages.Two things I might mention:1. Another student in my class bought the same book,same edition through Amazon. Her book is oddly enough different from mine. A good way to check to see if you've received a more recent version is to go the to Data Sufficiecny section. At the beginning of that section there are the \\"Directions\\". The most recent book will have Directions A through E. The slightly older version will have Directions A through D. MAKE SURE YOU GET THE VERSION WITH A-E!!!!2. The review of basic math skills could offer more. If you haven't used these skills in some time, you will find other resources will be necessary in order to regain those skills.

Trow's series of mysteries featuring Sherlock Holmes's sometime-collaborator Sholto Lestrade of Scotland Yard is the sort of kid who was too superior, too literary, in high-school to enjoy Conan Doyle's tales, and who relishes having a support group now to affirm how silly they were. The sad thing is that a potentially interesting plot is lurking in here somewhere, but buried as it is in snide sniping and smug self-satisfied smirking ... who cares?Doyle's Lestrade is somewhat dull. Trow's is a bumbling incompetent who puts Nigel Bruce's Watson to shame. Both bumbling _and_ incompetent. Bumbling: on p. 14, \\".. the inspector somersaulted gracefully over the top step and caught himself a sharp one on the .. knocker.\\" Incompetent/stupid: on p. 13, when his superior tells him that the victim's \\"favorite reading, apart from Private Member's Bills, was the Marquis de Sade\\", poor Lestrade can only wonder (after sensing a joke re 'private members') \\"was there a French connection?\\"Some may find Trow \\"full of humor\\" ... perhaps, of a rather poofty, sniggery 5th grade sort. See above ('private members', hnyuck hnyuck), or on pp. 19-20, \\"They practised every vice known to men. Not to mention women?\\" \\"Women?\\" \\"Please, I asked you not to mention women.\\"The humor is insufferably cute and twee, not so much witty as half-witted and anachronistic: p. 23, \\"... outside the mellow, yellow entrance porch.\\" Now does 'mellow' really apply to a porch? Under some circumstances, I guess, but there is nothing to indicate that this particular porch is 'mellow' -- clearly, just a chance to refer to the Donovan lyric. Yuck, yuck, shnort. There are also lots of quaint references to Doyle, e.g. further down p. 23, \\"... shown into the study. It was scarlet ...\\" Get it? \\"Study in Scarlet\\"? Yuck, yuck, shnort, gasp. The chapter titles are all take-offs (not worthy of being called puns) on titles of Adventures in the Canon, e.g. \\"The Blue Carb Uncle\\" and \\"Boscombe's Odd Place.\\" Elsewhere on the same page, \\"'Ah,' he smiled, 'the old secret-drawer ploy'\\", certainly a reference to Get Smart. Yuck, kschnarf, ....Trow's work is like a substandard Monty Python skit put on paper. It does not translate well. Also, MP had the sense (usually) to keep their work short. The tone of this novel might work in a short story, but doesn't in a novel, much less a series of (according to the back cover) sixteen!

For instance, restaurant descriptions in Frommer's are first categorized by neighborhood and then by cost. This book contains a list of top restaurants by neighborhood and cuisine (only names); however, for descriptions/cost, you have to thumb through an alphabetical list to find the restaurants listed. It gets extremely frustrating and annoying. After spending money on this book, we left it at the hotel and decided to use websites and other travelers' recommendations rather than use this book - we travel about five or six times a year and this is a first.Also, the practical information is incomplete. For instance, this book suggests using a shuttle to the Del Coronado from the ferry landing, but it doesn't say where the shuttle stop is or how frequently the shuttle operates. There is no information on ferry timings either. San Diego has a pretty good trolley system, but this guide does not even have a map of the trolley system.The maps (if you could call them that) are also missing key information. Other guides show a map of a neighborhood and then have markers on the map showing hotels, restaurants, places of interest, etc. This book contains only half-complete map with some street names. Highly irritating.This was the first and last Best Places book for us. We only bought it because it was city specific. We will stick to our usual suspects."},{"Title":"Winston Churchill: An intimate portrait","review":"Lady Violet Bonham Carter, the daughter of British Prime Minister Asquith, was a close personal friend of Winston Churchill for nearly 60 years. The value of this account is rooted in that fact for I dare say Winston had many admirers and critics but few personal, intimate friends with whom he would truly confide. Winston talked a lot about himself in letters and at dinner conversations. However, there aren't many glimpses of the ruminations behind that facade, save for those provided by Churchill himself, which then must be considered in the context that he was on stage from his earliest teen years and always playing to the crowd and history. In proof, let us borrow Lady Carter's quote of A. G. Gardiner who allegedly wrote that \\"in the theatre of his mind it is always the hour of fate and the crack of doom.\\"This is a splendid little account from Lady Carter where she focuses on the period from 1906-1916, however, there are a few contextual items the reader should bear in mind. She was a confidante of the circles of power and British elite society. She led a privileged life in a particular period of English history following the heady days of Queen Victoria's Empire. She adored her father and Churchill.That being said, I found her portrait of Winston interesting and illuminating. She provides snippets of his emotions, self-doubts, ruminations, anxieties, comments, goals, ambitions, character and personality that are valuable because they are firsthand and connected to specific historical events. That adds to the mosaic of any tepid or serious study of Churchill. She is not critical but offers some analytical insight. For instance in discussing Winston's relationships with his servant and administrative staffs, she admits that \\"Winston might be-and indeed he was-exacting, arbitrary, often unreasonable and always inexhaustible. Yet he was also always human, and he was their friend.\\" So, while she is clearly an adoring fan, it cannot be said that she is only fawning in this book.As you would expect, there is a graceful style to the prose and there are over 20 illustrations. It is not an exhaustive autobiography but her firsthand account offers these things to the student of Churchill - a woman's view; a social and political peer's view and a confidante's view. In the preface, Lady Carter quotes Gray's remark to Horace Walpole that \\"any fool may write a most valuable book by chance, if he will only tell us what he heard and saw with veracity.\\" That is the value of Lady Carter's witness. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Winston Churchill: An intimate portrait","review":"and she was a personal friend of Winston Churchill, booster of his career, constant well-wisher, messenger, whisperer of secrets, conduit, facilitator, socialite, grande dame, and political operator in her own right. But these reminiscences add little to Churchill's legend, beyond shared moments when events in the background carried her along. She needed heros like Winston & her father (also a prime minister). She seems not to have noticed that, when Winston was most down, she wasn't there for him. The book IS \\"an intimate portrait,\\" and it illuminates political and social life for British aristocrats in the early Twentieth Century; but I learned more from Lord Moran's biography and Churchill's own writings."},{"Title":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart: A Study in Biblical Theology","review":"The hardening of the heart is a difficult concept that appears to be a condemnation and has been my struggling point. I have to question how a hardened heart could be a disciplinary act and not a condemnation. One point from the chapters that stuck out was God's loyalty to his promises. After reading through the process of idolatry, hardening and the role of jealousy leading to repentance in Romans, and how that parallels to the Old Testament, I do agree with Meadors. The hardening separates one from God and leads to unnatural acts. It amazes me that God is able to take a sinful characteristic such as jealousy and use it to bring hardened hearts to repentance. While the book showed this clearly for Romans, I still have to contemplate how it works today when we don't have a clear separation like the Jews and Gentile to facilitate the jealousy.Meadors shows how the hardening of the heart is a discipline that God repeatedly uses throughout scriptures. From Pharaoh to Paul's contemporaries, God has hardened hearts as a step in the process of rehabilitation. It is not a condemnation but leaves room for repentance and transformation when Christ removes the veil and the truth can be seen.This is a great resource if you are struggling with the concepts of Idolatry and the hardening of the heart!"},{"Title":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart: A Study in Biblical Theology","review":"\\"Idolatry and Hardening of the Heart\\" written by professor Dr. Edwards is a truly an amazing book. It is both deep and inspiring to read. Edwards looks to answer the issues surrounding Idolatry and the hardening of the heart. As a college student it helped me better understand the destructive power of sin and how Idolatry leads to a hardened heart. After reading this book I feel that I have a much deeper understanding of the issue of Idolatry and why in the end hearts are hardened when they turn away from God. This book really helped show me the importance of the heart and why we need to protect it. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a deep yet inspirational read."},{"Title":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart: A Study in Biblical Theology","review":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart is a very compelling book that helped me better understand biblical theology and some controversial topics that Paul addresses in Romans. I found Paul's multiple references to Old Testament Scripture fascinating and realized how interwoven Scripture is. I gained a greater appreciation for Paul's writing and the way he was able to relate to and gather support from his audience. Overall, I completely agree with the author's conclusions and find his ideas well supported and founded on truth. Every argument had more than enough Scriptural evidence to support its ideas. Meadors really challenged me to dig deeper into Scripture and understand from every angle Paul's message to the church in Rome. I better understand that while God displayed His sovereignty in the hardening of hearts, He did it to accomplish His purposes and to demonstrate His grace and mercy."},{"Title":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart: A Study in Biblical Theology","review":"Edward Meadors is a Professor of Biblical Studies at Taylor University. In this book he explores the role of God in the hardening of peoples hearts, through it we can come to better understand God's purpose in hardening peoples hearts, and the role of idolatry in the world both past and present. The book was well structured and showed a large array of the idolatrous practices people have fallen into over the years. The book is very readable, and refreshing because idolatry is mentioned quite often in Christian literature, but rarely is the hardening aspect touched on. The final chapter of contemporary application, and in my opinion the final chapter would do quite well as a stand alone print. I would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in understanding not only idolatry and its role in our lives, but also the effects of it."},{"Title":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart: A Study in Biblical Theology","review":"The book is a well disciplined treatment of Biblical theology regarding the first two commandments."},{"Title":"Category Freaks Volume 2","review":"Like many of Sakurako Gokurakuin's books, you may have to read this one a couple of times to really understand whats going on-- but the art is so good that you won't mind a bit.This volume focuses alot on a Norse deity called Hain-Uwele who is selling \\"flesh dolls\\" as sex slaves to her customers. People think they're buying a souless slave to do anything with, but Hain-Uwele has actually put a \\"freak\\" into each doll, which eventually possesses the human.Izumi also appears in this one--hes usually just the eye in Asagi's hand. But Asagi gets sick from contact with Hain-Uwele and Izumi has to seperate and become human.My favorite part of this volume was about Ayu, the little blonde hacker who's in love with Naoki. Ayu is dating a guy possesed by a freak, and Naoki comes to his resuce.The fact that pretty muck everyone in the book is either possessed or has a split-personality adds to the confusion, but the people are so pretty you may not really care about the story.And amazon-- please get Sensitive Pornograph in stock...."},{"Title":"No Man on Earth","review":"Thad was like no other man on Earth, an Earth of the future (2081) written in 1964.

Thad sets out to find his father, a journey that will take him outside his culture, across the world, and into interstellar space. The search is handled interestingly, as Thad discovers the truth about himself (and the author presents an imaginative array of cultures).I didn't expect to enjoy the book as much as I did, but Walter Moudy has a few really great scenes that stick with you.

At first I thought it might be an echo of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, dreamt up by Knopf, Cain's publisher, to lend some literary pretension to a novel they weren't sure about; but that play wasn't written until some years after Postman was published in 1934. It was recently suggested to me (by Joseph Feinsinger, one of Amazon.com's best reviewers of literature) that it might be a rejoinder for the saying \\"opportunity knocks only once,\\" which was the sort of pabulum given to out of work people during the depression. Cain's original title was \\"Bar-B-Que,\\" which is entirely appropriate for a couple of reasons (the caf&eacute;, the burning car), but was perhaps a little too morbid for Knopf's sensibilities.At any rate, the title finally chosen is somewhat magical as is the novel itself, the first of Cain's hard-boiled, loser tales that somehow caught the imagination and psyche of depression America. Re-reading the novel today one wonders why, but then again, I can see why.First there's the raw sex with Frank forcing himself onto Cora, biting her lip, etc. and she loving it, that was somewhat shocking for its time. Ditto for the spontaneous sex they have in the dirt outside the car after Frank has beamed Nick. Then there is the fascination we have with stupid people doing vile deeds rather clumsily (with whom we might identify). But more than anything else it's the style. Cain raised the dime novel to something amazing with his no nonsense, no time to chat, no description beyond the absolutely necessary--a pared-down to raw flesh and bones writing style that made even some of the icons of literature sit up and take notice. Edmund Wilson, long the dean of American literary critics, was intrigued by the novel, as was Franklin P Adams who called it \\"the most engrossing, unlaydownable book that I have any memory of.\\" (Quoted from Paul Skenazy's critical work, James M. Cain (1989), pp. 20-21). And Albert Camus said that his internationally famous masterpiece The Stranger was based in part on Postman. The alternate English title, \\"The Outsider,\\" perhaps reveals its debt to Cain more clearly. Today the sex seems rather tame and the terse style seems almost a burlesque, having been so often imitated. I personally think that Cain, who was a one-time editor of The New Yorker and a relatively sophisticated literary man, was actually taking Hemingway's primer-prose style to its logical conclusion by simply cutting out all of Hemingway's poetic repetitions and anything else that didn't move the plot.Well, how well does this stand up after almost seventy years? It was made into two movies, a 1946 version starring John Garfield and Lana Turner and a 1981 version starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, which you might want to compare. You can read the novel faster than you can watch either movie. I read it in an hour and I'm no speed reader. There was also a play and, believe it or not, an opera. The atmosphere is suburban naturalistic, set in the environs of Glendale, California, just north of L.A. where there really are (or mostly were) oak trees. (The name of the caf&eacute; is the Twin Oaks.) The story is a little confused in parts, and a little unlikely elsewhere (Cora really would not be such an adept at gun toting, and the Frank would not be so quick to fall for the D.A.'s line of chatter and turn on Cora, nor could Nick be quite so blind to the hanky-panky going on behind his back). But what Cain got so, so very right was the underlying psychology. This is a classic triangle, the old guy with the resources who can't cut the mustard anymore with a young wife who longs for love, a little excitement and to be rid of \\"that greasy Greek.\\" Even deeper (and this is characteristic of Cain) is the suggestion that Nick encouraged Frank and kept him around, using his presence to spice up his own libido. Furthermore, Frank is a kind of depression-era anti-hero, who beat up on the hated railway dicks, the kind of guy who has become a film noir staple, a man who acts out his basic desires in an amoral, animalistic way. I see woman. I take woman. I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and sleep when I run out of gas, a kind of natural man on the run, the kind of guy we think we would like to be for a change (a brief change) in our daydreams around two p.m. on a blue Monday afternoon.Cain followed this up with Double Indemnity (using some insurance fraud research he had left over). Double Indemnity appeared as a serial in Liberty magazine after being rejected by Redbook. It was also made into a classic Billy Wilder movie starring Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson in 1944 a year after it finally appeared in book form.Cain, along with Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Nathanael West and later Ross MacDonald created a kind of southern California milieu that Hollywood has mined again and again with such postmodern films as, e.g., Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997). Read this (during lunch) for its historical value as a precursor of film noir and the hard-boiled detective novel.--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Novels and other Fictions\\""},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Whenever the question of the origin of the &quot;hardboiled&quot; school of detective literature comes up in conversation, three names always get mentioned: Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and James Cain. Hammett was the master of the character, Chandler of the atmosphere.And Cain was the master of the plot. Not in the sense of trying to tease us with the &quot;whodunit&quot; like the great British talespinners; Cain's books are not mysteries in the true sense of the word, because we usually know almost from the outset Who Done It. But Cain will keep you on the edge of your seat following the incredible turns of fate that his characters experience. And perhaps that's the key to Cain, not only in this book but in all of his others: the real major character is an unfriendly fate, which sooner or later destroys the protagonists. Cain's stories are ugly - his characters are all either ugly and stupid or ugly and clever - and perhaps this is the ugliest story he ever wrote.Hollywood was always both fascinated and repulsed by Cain; Warner Brothers made &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; into a movie, but only after they turned it over to Rayond Chandler to do the screenplay and &quot;sanitize&quot; it (Billy Wilder got screenplay credits along with Chandler, but the book was Cain's; it's more than worth a read too). &quot;Postman&quot; has been made into a movie twice, and while both versions are admirable each in their own way, neither one of them manages to express the utter futility of life, and the sense of just how amoral the average man can be in the right situation, that are the hallmarks of Cain's work.I think it's not the sex in his novels (of which there is some, but tame stuff by modern standards) that made Cain unsettling in his day, but rather this sense of futility, and that is why Hollywood, and society in general, had a hard time accepting Cain as a mainstream writer. Great? Yes. Give him a read - it's like watching a train wreck. It's horrible, but you can't take your eyes off it."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"When I was 12 I climbed on board something called The Texas Cliffhanger at Six Flags Over Texas. It was a small four or five person bench with a cage around it that lifted us something like five stories into the air. Then it pushed us forward and dropped us. The entire ride lasted maybe a minute, but I never forgot it and I by God knew I&#8217;d had a thrill. The Postman Always Rings Twice is no different. It is wild and one of the shortest novels I&#8217;ve ever read. But believe me, I know I&#8217;ve read a novel.Not only is the book short, its pace rarely relents. There is not an overabundance of description or other literary devices. It slams the door, straps you in and drives you to the end. And you get there fast with no detours and no fluff and nothing extra, just the point. You rip right through piles of mistrust and angst and murder and love and passion and lies and truths and you end in reality. And for Cain, reality is a cold floor and a long walk and a knotted rope swinging in the wind.I believe this novel started a whole line of fiction and movies that continues to this day. First and most obvious, the noir genre has its roots here. The colloquial speech, the first person narrative, the looker dames who are in where they ought not be &#8211; it&#8217;s all here. Second, the love triangle involving a drifter and a young woman married or indentured to an older, wealthy man....I&#8217;d recommend this one wholeheartedly. Not just for its place in literary history, but for the pure joy of a good read. Lie back and let it take you for a quick thrill."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This is a book that never gives you a chance to catch your breath. More happens in 116 pages in this book than in most 500-page novels that I have read. James Cain doesn't mess around with flowery prose or deep narrative insights into the characters or the period or anything else. His writing is strictly minimalist, and that gives this book its raw, gritty feeling. You don't learn much about what's going on from some detached, third-person narrator. Instead, you get up close and personal with the characters themselves, who are all complex and fascinating.Much of this book is dialog, often extending for pages without even a \\"he said\\" or \\"she said\\" interspersed between lines. Cain has a real gift for getting at the heart of his characters through dialog. The voices of the characters are so expressive that you really don't need much narration to get a good sense of what these people are all about.At the heart of this story is an illicit love affair and a murder. There is an uncomfortable tension throughout the book, so strong that I wanted to put the book down at times to wipe the sweat off my forehead and let my pulse return to a normal rate."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Unlike the detective fiction of Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Hammett's Sam Spade, James M. Cain's brand of noir in \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" is concerned more with the drama behind the crime than with the investigation of it.The novel begins with a flurry of premonitions: A dangerous young drifter named Frank Chambers stops for a bite to eat at a California roadside lunchroom owned by an affable but naive Greek named Nick Papadakis and his much younger, beautiful wife Cora. Frank accepts a job offer from Nick and almost immediately begins an affair with Cora, who confides to Frank that Nick disgusts her and she feels trapped in her marriage. She suggests that the only way out is to kill Nick, and Frank, who really doesn't have anything personal against his new boss, decides to go along with it.After a false start, Frank and Cora finally manage to carry out their crime, although not without a significant amount of bodily sacrifice. Of course they tell the police that Nick's death was an accident, but the District Attorney is suspicious of the circumstances -- particularly when it is discovered that Nick had a considerable insurance policy on his life. From this point on, Cain uses the principle of poetic justice to ensure that Frank and Cora pay for their crime through their arrogance and foolishness.Frank, Cora, and Nick make an interesting love triangle. Situations in their lives seem to have brought them together partially because of their relative stupidity -- for a guy who's spent his life on the road, Frank shows he even lacks street smarts when he gets suckered by an obvious pool shark; indeed, a story like this relies on fundamentally stupid characters. Nick, of course, never suspects his wife is having an affair; he's just a simple immigrant who's proud and grateful to be living the American dream of owning his own business. The smartest character turns out to be Cora's lawyer, Katz, who probably guesses the truth about Nick's \\"accident\\" right away but knows he'll make out like a bandit no matter what happens to his client.The characterization, mood, and style of this novel reveal the source of noir fiction: When the corruption and violence of the '20s erupted into the squalor and desperation of the Depression of the '30s, noir must have emerged naturally as the time's most representative artistic expression. Here we have characters who are so poor and hopeless that they're desperate enough to do anything and violent enough to turn to crime."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This is a book you read once and can't stop thinking about. It's what I call a 'blue book', one that is soulful and strangely mellow. It actually makes me feel like I'm underneath a very shady tree on a sunny day. Reason being that the light is very blue green, so a 'blue' book.Before I try to make sense of this, let's continue.Frank Chambers is a young drifter who rolls into town, goes to work in a diner for Nick, a tough Greek, falls for Nick's young wife Cora, then decides, with Cora's help, to murder Nick and take over the restaurant. What should be simple becomes more complex. The first murder attempt fails, the second one is successful but easy to see through. With the help of a very smart and very crooked lawyer, both Frank and Cora are soon free. That, really, is where the problems start.Frank and Cora love and hate each other fiercely, speaking with remarkably accurate, real dialogue. Cain doesn't even attribute his dialogue, so pay close attention to who's speaking. The book is mostly just people talking, in very real language, full of slang and fragmented sentences. It's like listening to a REALLY interesting conversation.Frank and Cora are two very small, unremarkable, inconsequential people caught up in something too big for them to understand. They mistake happiness and hope for lust, hate, anger and even apathy. And just when things look alright, one little, honest accident washes it all away. This book shows us how fragile everything is, or at least how fragile it can be. That's what elevates this to the level of tragedy. This is something to live with and dwell upon, something you can never quite shake off, no matter how hard you try.(...)"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This novel was another stunner from Cain. Set out in a then country area of California, outside of LA in the early 1940s, most of the action takes place at a diner on the main highway. This too involves a wife very unhappy with her husband, Cora with Nick. She finds a possible way out of her life with this brutish husband when drifter Frank comes into the diner and hangs around doing odd jobs for them. The couple plot to kill Nick so that they can end up with the diner and each other. There was one movie version done by John Garfield and Lana Turner in the 1940s that was absolutely faithful to the book. There was a 2nd version in the 1980s with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange that deviated somewhat from the novel, especially towards the end. I enjoyed both film versions equally and would highly recommend them. A Cain novel is very hard to put down once you've started and the man used no excess words. He too was an expert at looking at the best and worst of people as brought out by crime and its punishment."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"James M. Cain, along with Chandler and Hammett, really created the literary genre which would be turned into film noir. One revels in the image of Cain, who was himself an insurance adjustor, sitting at his desk dreaming up the perfect murders which form the basis of his novels.In Postman, Frank Chambers interrupts his cross country rambling at a diner owned by Nick Papadakis after getting one look at Nick's wife, Cora. That first look conveys everything we need to know about the relationship between men and women in noir fiction, &quot;Except for the shape, she really wasn't any raving beauty, but she had a sulky look to her, and her lips stuck out in a way that made me want to mash them in for her.&quot;Frank and Cora become lovers and are soon plotting to murder Nick, but find they don't trust one another and &quot;Love, once you get fear in it, turns to hate.&quot;As the novel closes, Frank is on Death Row. One of the other inmates theorizes about the sub-conscious and how he's not responsible for his crime. But Frank says, &quot;To hell with the sub-conscious. I don't believe it. It's just a lot of hooey, that this guy thought up so he could fool the judge. You know what you're doing and you do it.&quot; This is another quintessential element of American noir--the &quot;heroes&quot; are not victims of the psyche; they are knowing actors &amp; when the time inevitably comes to pay for their sins, they accept punishment stoically, knowing that they deserve it for their evil deeds. There's an important lesson here, as we close the Century which saw a sustained assault by the partisans of Freud and Marx upon the notion of personal responsibility.To quote the immortal philosopher Baretta, &quot;don't do the crime, if you can't do the time.&quot;GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Time does not diminish that incredible book. It is better than either movie. The narrative keeps you moving until you just have to finish it."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"The Postman Always rings Twice is an Americal classic--a great book by any standard. Cain's plot for the book is simple enough: an immoral hustler who lives by his wits gets in cahoots with an equally desperate and amibtious woman who is seeking to escape her loveless marriage.Cain's book is remarkable for its suspensful account of a well laid out murder plan that succeeds but doesn't bring the two perpetrators much happiness. The book stands out for its blunt and realistic portrayal of vicious criminal behavior.It's helpful to know that Cain was a screenwriter in Hollywood before he wrote the book. That I think is the reason for his sharp dialogues, some of which will stick with you forever! Cain's great dialgoue writing skills are a key factor in keepign the action tight throughout the many twists and turns of the book.I haven't seen either of the movies based on this book, for one reason or another. Surprisingly, I've read this book atleast a half adozen times and the book has left an indelible impression on me. I can literally see the entire movie in my head everythime I think about it!"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"(1934 edition)Author: James M. CainGenre: Mystery/Suspense (Hardboiled)Plot Summary:A drifter, Frank Chambers, wanders into a roadside filling station and cafe where he is offered a job by the owner, Greek immigrant Nick Papadakis. Frank quickly becomes involved with Cora, Nick's sexy wife, and the lovers decide to do away with Nick before they hit the road together. Things, however, do not go as planned, and the two find themselves behind bars. The plot begins to twist and turn as Frank and Cora become pawns in a bitter rivalry between an overzealous DA and a mysterious defense attorney.Geographical Setting: Outskirts of Los AngelesTime Period: 1930'sSeries: NoneAppeal Characteristics:Expect the unexpected in this classic of the hardboiled genre. Cain is a master of suspense and this short, easy read will keep you wondering what will happen next. The prose is stripped bare. Do not expect much description of the scenery or character development. Still, despite a lack of characterization, you will become emotionally invested in the lives of the two main characters and hope that they will find a way to survive together. The story is told through the eyes of the anti-hero, and the reader gets a dose of dramatic irony as it becomes apparent that he is not as wily as he thinks he is. At times the plot twists can seem a little contrived, and realism is sometimes sacrificed in order to keep the story jumping. However, the story is so engrossing that you will not have time to sulk.Read-Alikes:Fans of this book should try other novels by the author, such as \\"Double Indemnity,\\" \\"Mildred Pierce,\\" and \\"Serenade.\\" Other writers in the hard boiled genre would also be of interest. Dashiell Hammett, Mickey Spillane, and Raymond Chandler will give you similar reads, but from a detective's perspective. For more tales told by the criminal, see \\"After Dark, My Sweet,\\" \\"A Hell of a Woman,\\" or \\"The Grifters\\" by Jim Thompson. All of these books are written with a minimal amount of verbiage and give you a window into the criminal mind.Red Flags:Violence and sex are prevalent throughout the novel, although neither are depicted graphically. Casual racism and mysogyny are also present."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Like reading about crimes of passion? This is it! Like a hard punch between the eyes. Cain was a master at this type of sordid tale. Noone does it better. Noone."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I had to read this book for my AP English class as summer reading. I usually hate the books that my school makes me read. However, right from the first page, it had me hooked. Cain uses simplistic style and makes it easy to read and a very fast-paced book. Only problem is that you have to get used to the way he writes. Cain usually does not supply information in regards to who is speaking and it gets confusing after one quote follows another without speaker information. The way Cain writes captures the reader and makes the reader want to read even more of the book. Instantly, readers will connect with one of the characters. That's what makes the book so special. It's a good read for anyone into crime kind of books."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Despite only taking a few hours to complete, this was as intense and exciting as any crime novel I've read. James M. Cain manages to squeeze a whole novel's worth of characters, plot twists, and emotions into only 116 pages. Like Ernest Hemingway, Cain employs a minimalistic writing style to fashion uneducated, \\"simple\\" characters with complex emotional undercurrents. He knows when to understate a scene and when to use vivid, erotic images to shock his readers. His pacing is nearly flawless, except for one awkward scene with the briefly-mentioned Madge Allen character. And the conclusion, while somewhat of a cliche, is typical of the best 1930's roman noir fiction.The only reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 4 is that I wish Cain had added more dialogue and development scenes at the beginning to show how Frank and Cora fell in love and fed off each other's neuroses."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Say you were reading the thoughts of OJ Simpson. Similarly, James Cain has given us the thoughts of a man driven by passion to possess a woman and willing to pay any price to do it. She encourages his passion, and plots with him to kill her own husband. The writing is crisp, honed down to the bone, and erotic for its time. What raises this murder story above the average for me was the interplay of the judicial system with the lovers. Although the trials did not establish the truth of what happened, a weird justice resulted. The district attorney and defense counsel here put John Grisham's cardboard cutouts to shame. A quick read, a fun read, a guilty pleasure."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"It always seems that the best books are full of cliches. Then again, they needed to become cliches somewhere right? That's the pantheon of books that The Postman Always Rings Twice sits in. This film noir classic sets the stage for most of what follows in the genre, and with good reason as it cuts a story of romance, revenge, anger, and the human condition that sucks you in and refuses to let go."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"You have probably heard a book described as one \\"you couldn't put down.\\" Mostly that just means that the reader did not want to put it down because it was so good, not that he actually didn't put it down. Well, this is a book that I literally did not put down. I started while eating my breakfast and didn't stop until I had finished it.This is a noir story in the tradition of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, but it is written from the viewpoint of the amoral murderer, rather than from the viewpoint of the detective. The narrator is a young drifter, who becomes romantically involved with a sullenly sexy young wife who is physically repulsed by her older Greek husband. The situation seems to the two lovers to have only one solution, but it takes them two tries to accomplish their bloody goal. And that is only the beginning of the story.This is a really creepy book--the only thing I can think to compare it to is the Ripley books by Patricia Highsmith, also about an amoral murderer. And it is absolutely riveting. I can't figure how Cain did this, writing about such despicable characters. While I was reading, the characters seemed absolutely alive to me. I completely surrendered myself.Dashiell Hammett said about this book, \\"A good, swift, violent story.\\" That pretty much sums it up."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I liked this story because it was ironic - like life. They managed to get off on the first occasion when they tried to kill the Greek (and even got $10,000 insurance money out of it); they even got off on the second occasion when they had killed the Greek. But, on the occasion when they were supposed to be setting off for a life together, and nobody was meant to get hurt, the girl ended up dead and the guy ended up going to the electric chair for killing her. Sod's Law, as they say."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A portion of my review originally from my blog, The Reader's Commute.The Postman Always Rings Twice follows Frank Chambers, a drifter, as he takes a room and a job working at a roadside diner. The diner is owned by Nick, also known as \\"The Greek,\\" with a rambunctious voice and greasy hair. His wife is Cora, a true femme fatale and the object of Frank's affections. Check out Cora's introduction:\\"Except for the shape, she wasn't any raving beauty, but she had a sulky look to her, and her lips stuck out in a way that made me want to mash them in for her.\\"Hello, Fifty Shades fans! That's the kind of sexy, sadomasochistic vibe we should all be looking out for!Frank and Cora fall in love, and hatch a plot to kill The Greek. Naturally, the scheme falls flat, and what follows is a roller coaster ride of little victories and failures that eventually ends in despair. The effects that jealousy and paranoia have on Frank and Cora make this a gripping read, full of dirty deeds, backstabbing, and steamy reconciliations. The strength of this work is definitely found in its sparse prose, giving the reader only the details necessary to piece together the plot and understand the characters. A scene between Frank and Cora, after a staged car accident, was one of the strongest scenes in the novel.I found the book to lag a bit towards the middle (the introduction of Madge and the pumas sort of threw me for a loop), but as I neared the final pages I hoped for more. I think that this novel is a wonderful introduction to the roman noir, and an easy book to pick up."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A drifter blows into town and sticks around at the roadside diner because of the beautiful wife of the proprietor. Cora and Frank begin a steamy affair right under proprietor Nick's nose, and they decide to prove their affections by murdering Nick the Greek. Their first attempt is a failed one, but they don't let that discourage them. They come up with a more elaborate way to plan the \\"perfect murder.\\" Of course, crime never prospers and in the end, fate catches up to both of them.James M. Cain was a master writer and this book is possibly his best work. It is a highly satisfying read from start to finish. Not a page is wasted. The characters are fascinating and even though they're wicked, we still care about what happens to them and hold our breath to find out if they'll get away with murder. I've read a lot of murder mysteries but very few compare to the craftsmanship of this novel."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This book is gritty, raw, and very well written. Don't know why a few of the reviewers on here can't figure out the significance of the title. Anyway, if you want noir, come to this book. It's a little over a hundred pages, wound tight and ready to explode in your hands."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This book is absolutely fantastic. The writing style is fast-paced and brutal. The plot is pure noir. The mixture of sex, violence, and racism give this a seedy rawness that is very powerful.Generally I prefer Chandler to Cain, but nothing Chandler wrote was a swift, as hard-hitting as this. Double Indemnity is also good, but the movie is better -- in this case, both movies fail to live up to the book. The original movie is decent enough but fails to capture the violence, sex, racism, or seediness, the Jack Nicholson movie is simply awful. So just go ahead and read the book."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A blurb on the back dubbed this &quot;a swift, violent story&quot;. Yes! Bracing and breathtaking in its economy and speed. Apparently L'Etranger used this as its model. Whether or not you like the early 20c american school of minimalist, hard-boiled writing, this is worth reading for the invigorating pleasure of seeing an absolute master at work. Could be read at a single sitting."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Poolroom hustler, con artist, auto mechanic, bum--Frank Chambers, after being thrown off a hay truck he'd stowed away on the night before, wanders into the Twin Oaks Tavern and talks the owner into a giving him a free lunch. Then the owner offers him a job fixing cars. Frank hesitates. Then he sees the owner's wife. Frank takes the job.Thus begins this tawdry tale of desperation, lust and lies. Published in 1934 and banned in Boston for its violence and eroticism, &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; is like back alley fisticuffs--it ain't pretty, but it works.&quot;I sunk my teeth into her lips so deep I could feel the blood spurt into my mouth. It was running down her neck when I carried her upstairs.&quot;No, this isn't &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; It's two careless people who somehow fall in love in spite of each other and then convince themselves they can get away with murder.The results are less than spectacular.This story is bare-knuckled, unflinchingly masculine, and briskly told in 116 pages. Frank Chambers himself narrates, peppering the narrative with 1930s colloquialisms and a drifter's outlook.It's as American as a motorcycle cop on a California highway.I should also state for the record, both movie versions of this book were terribly miscast."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This classic noir novel does not disappoint, even in our cynical age. This would make a good book for an airline flight or some time when you have a few hours to kill. Very erotic for the time it was written, what was probably as shocking for its 1934 readers was the almost total lack of conscience of the two main characters (it's hard to call them protagonists), until later in the book when Frank starts to be haunted by the Greek while living in his old house. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Once you start to read this book, you will be gripped. I couldn't put the darn thing down for a minute. The way it is written will have you staging the whole thing in your imagination as you read ... a sort of running movie trailer. I don't know when I've read a book that captures the same smoldering intensity of the love/lust as exists between Frank and Cora in Postman. The obsessive nature of their relationship is summed up by Frank when he surmises, &quot;What did she have that makes me feel that way about her? I don't know. She wanted something, and she tried to get it. She tried all the wrong ways, but she tried. I don't know what made her feel that way about me, because she knew me. She called it on me plenty of times, that I wasn't that good. I never really wanted anything, but her. But that's a lot. I guess it's not often that a woman even has that.&quot;Now how could one say it better than that?!"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I'm usually not a big reader of crime novels, and I didn't think that I would like this one very much. I was very interested in reading it though because it started a genre of fiction and because it was named on the Modern Library's Hundred Greatest Novels of the Twentieth Century List (which is an interesting list that I don't always agree with). The Postman Always Rings Twice turned out excellent and may well have earned its place on that list.The Postman Always Rings Twice is a hard-hitting, gritty novel of a man and woman who conspire to kill her husband and who end up caught in their own web of deceit. The novel is short. The raw sexual power and violence must have been a shocker for this book's time. The prose is surprisingly clean. It is fast-paced and short. It comes out punching and finishes you off quickly."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"In one sense, this is a quick and entertaining read, about an affair and a murder, paced and written like a movie. But it isn't a simple crime novel at all, with a couple who are mismatched except in their desire for each other and their willingness to kill, Freudian themes of the unconscious impulse, and the uncertainty of the truth of the narrator's words. Still it is just as fun as riding a roller-coaster, short and speedy, and it is well worth it to merely enjoy the plot."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Since I love the movie version of this story so much, I decided to give the book a try. And I'm glad I did. Packing the same emotional wallop as the movie, this is a definite page turner. The story has all elements essential to a good mystery: betrayal, a murderous plot, an inquiring police detective and a scheming prosecutor. Despite the main characters' obvious shortcomings, the end is touching and very human. This is a classic for all crime story lovers."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Okay, the story's really sensational. And yes, some of it isunbelievable. And it's short--shorter than most Stephen Kingnovellas. But what fun it was to read! Total pulp, nifty dialogue,sex, violence, etc. I had a great time reading it, and I think you would too. Don't bother reading Double Indemnity--Postman is much, much better. (Though, I would recommend Hammett's The Thin Man, if you're into this type of fiction.)

Cora and Frank are two star crossed lovers who plot to get away from Nick, to whom Cora is married."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Having recently read this for a second time (it's a short read for a dark evening), I've decided that Cain's novel is more devious, even more insidious than I remembered. A sense of futility and hopelessness is pervasive: Frank and Cora are doomed the moment they meet--he's a drifter, she's an unhappily married woman, both harbor vague ambitions and are fatally attracted to the other, and her husband is in the way. Or as she says, \\"I want to work and be something, that's all. But you can't do it without love.\\"In only one hundred pages, there are two crimes and two deaths, a headline-screaming trial, and a scorching lust-driven affair. It's one of the most tightly written crime novels ever published, and the ironic closing tragedy is one of the more memorably unique plot twists in the genre. That said, its episodic parts are somewhat disjointed and its police procedural and courtroom scenes are sketchily inauthentic. In sum, the novel is 99% attitude, and it has lasted the test of time for its style rather than its substance. I wouldn't place this among the best examples of noir, but it's surely high among the second rank."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"and so did I! Obviously ... loved it because it was very existential (...) but I'm not he, so I loved the book for different reasons. I love a smart person who can get into the stagnant minds of dumb people and give plausible reasons for why they do the idiotic things they do. James L. Cain did that masterfully in this short novel.

Tightly written and carrying no tedious padding, this is a perfect weekend book. Cain describes the settings and physical descriptions of the people with exquisite flair, and his dialogue is wondrous to read. While I praise the brevity of the novel, it's low word-count is the only reason I did not award &quot;The Postman&quot; five stars. I feel a five-star book should not be something that can be read so quickly.From the opening paragraph, I was hooked. Cain wastes no time introducing his characters and setting the table for a raucous reading experience. When the story came to an end, I knew I had discovered a master craftsman, for his book left me with that most elusive of reading experiences: I wanted more, a lot more, but I knew the story ended where it had to. Great stuff! I can't believe this was his first published novel. I'm definitely going to hunt down more of his work."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A very fast paced mystery with familliar themes- infedelity, greed, murder and double-cross.Written in the same style as Hammett and Chandler; clsoer to a screenplay than a novel.I liked it better than the Maltese Falcon because the characters were more beleivable.This novel can be finished in half a dayand it is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS IVE READ THIS YEAR.CAIN REALLY DOES NO HOW TO HOOK AN AUDIENCE WITH HIS VERY VIVID IMAGINATION.

It's hard to imagine how the whole tone of this book could ever be put on screen.Cain's protagonist (don't call him a hero) is named Frank. And he is frank, as well as amoral and impulsive, with no idea that this sets him apart from the world. Nick, the Greek, is warm and generous, I guy I might have liked. In other words, the kind of guy that Frank instinctively parasitizes because Nick just can't imagine the Franks in the world. And, the reason the book was banned in Boston, there's Cora. She's halfway between them, in several senses of the word. She knows those animal urges as well as Frank does, but has a human hand on the leash that controls them.It's a compact story.

Gritty and emotionally wrenching, this book unapologetically exposes the dark underbelly of human nature.When waitress Cora Papadakis and aimless drifter Frank Chambers first meet, the mutual animal attraction is powerful. So powerful, in fact, the two of them conspire to do away with Cora's husband, a hapless Greek immigrant. I don't think it would be giving anything away to say things end badly for all concerned.A short novel with plenty of dialogue, The Postman Always Rings Twice is a very quick read. Interestingly, the passage of time has served to alter reader perception. The sex scenes, deemed positively scandalous when the book was first published, are rather tame by today's standards. Nevertheless, you will not want to miss this viscerally intense classic."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"No sense chewing the same fat twice (I covered the \\"basics\\" in reviewing Double Indemnity), but a few additional points should be made. In Double Indemnity we have the same story as Postman. Instead of a drifter, vapid vixen vamp loser, and a cafe owner, we had an insurance salesman, sexy seductress, and a wealthy businessman. The plot? Same thing: the meeting, the sparks, the plan to kill the obstructionist interloper, the plan going bad, the consequences. But, here was the birth of the noir genre. The seed was planted, the flowering from which inspired a multitude of thriller fiction writers to follow--up to, and including, the present day. For this we owe James M. Cain a deep debt of gratitude.Reflecting the despair, desperation, near-panic atmosphere of the Great Depression, Postman does a better job than do the affluent characters of Indemnity--the impact is more surreal, more profound, more lasting. (This, in sharp contrast to the joyous, \\"there's a better day coming\\" gospel of the happy-face Warner Bros. and MGM musical extravaganzas of that period.) Cain also established a milestone in dialogue in his books, particularly this one: let 'er rip, don't let spoken comments attributions get in the way, just get out of the way and let the action (much of it consisting of pure dialogue) build, swell, and burst with an eruption of meanng. I have long thought that James M. Cain's contribution to American literature was not only the \\"Birth of Noir,\\" but by presenting convincing evidence that minimalist writing--by way of vivid, gritty dialogue as the chef ingredient--was the best, to-the-point way to hone and present character--and, importantly, to move the story. Aspiring novelists can only benefit from studying Cain's techniques with a microscope."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Opportunity may knock once, but fate may ring at your door more than once and has a strange way of turning on you.The characters in this story went about life without any consideration or thought for anyone but themselves and in doing so, set the stage for an almost comical tragedy! Though it's hard to feel sorry for the main character after his hand in murder, you still do, but only slightly! After all, he did tempt fate, and fate turned on him and gave him what he, and most of the others deserved.As for the writing, this book gave birth to a genre that we still enjoy today! Hard to believe that a story with the twists and turns of this one could be told so sparcely in words, and yet be so compelling in just over 100 pages!

So I decided to read it and came away plesantly surprised. It's laconic, short, dark, and undoubtedly a ground-breaking novella. This is the bad boy that started the whole roman noir and existentialism genre back in 1934. Albert Camus, the author credited with fully developing existentialism and the depiction of characters devoid of conscious, credited Cain as his inspiration for his very similar masterpiece, The Stranger, after having read The Postman.The two leading enigmatic characters, Frank and Cora, as does Meursault in The Stranger, assume ultimate responsibility for their heinous acts of free will without any knowledge of what is right or wrong or good or bad. Being a novel noir genre fan, I recommend the once-banned Postman to anyone who has the stomach for some mild eroticism, violence, and moreover, clever writing."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I finished reading The Postman Always Rings Twice a week ago, and i was astonished at how a short book could pack such power, you can read it in half a day...you could understand why he did what he did.

Cain is both a writer's writer and a poet of the streets. Perhaps the most striking evidence of his talent is his use of dialogue. Two- and three-way conversations are captured with a fine ear, and the voices are so distinct that you never wonder who's saying what, even though Cain rarely uses the old &quot;he said&quot; / &quot;she said&quot; tags. I urge all readers who like tough writing, all fans of the passionate and violent, and everyone who ever quoted PULP FICTION to buy this book and meet the grandaddy of them all."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Set in the backdrop of the 30s Depression, Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice typifies hard-boiled roman noir, with seedy characters aimlessly drifting towards nature's dark side. We see this epitomized in Frank and Cora, whose existences are two-faced and bleak, their ideal happiness seemingly at the expense of others. Yet, Cain aptly takes you along with their schemes, and with a minimalist approach to narrative, exposes his character's flaws and sins. With deceptive, dishonest and generally \\"no good\\" people, Cain's novel uses dangerous situations, murderous plots, and gritty suspense to keep you entertained.Cain sets the stage for his gritty novel when drifter Frank Chambers stumbling in to the Twin Oaks Tavern while checking to see if the coast is clear. When he's introduced to the owner's wife, Cora, it sets in motion big trouble ahead. Taken to one another, Frank and Cora begin an illicit affair and concoct a scheme to bump off Cora's husband. Whether it's Frank's bad nature that rubs off on Cora, or whether she's just a naturally rotten person too is hard to say. Maybe Cora says it best, \\"We're just two punks, Frank.\\" A perfect murder, however, might not be so perfect.What Cain brings to this novel is a simple approach to narrative and dialogue, yet effective turmoil and suspense. It is dialogue heavy at points, and at times I found the dialogue a bit confusing (identifying who was speaking), but mostly Cain uses simple, snappy dialogue to hit you quick, often with a cynical tone. A fun part of the read was just following the characters attempt to outmaneuver each other, like Frank and Sackett playing cat and mouse during questioning.One can read The Postman Always Rings Twice and be reminded of what a noir should feel like, with shady, but street smart characters. It is a quick, easy, short novel to read, but in its one hundred plus pages, it does leave a taste for wanting to read more Cain noir novels."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A drifter takes what he intends to be a temporary job at a roadside diner but is soon involved in an affair with the owner's wife, which leads to a plan to bump the husband off.James M. Cain had an engaging story and stripped his prose down to the essentials, producing one of the greatest sustained examples of narrative momentum I can recall. With scarcely any interior dialogue (despite the use of a first person narrator), he paints a penetrating psychological portrait of the conspirators as their relationship evolves from their initial attraction, through their attempts at murder, until their post-crime mutual mistrust and reconciliation. The end is shattering, completing Cain's bleak portrayal of the human condition."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This book is a quick read. The plot moved swiftly and there are enough twists and turns to keep anyone interested. The two main characters actually seem believable. Believable enough that some parts of the book actually made me uncomfortable.

Before there was \\"Psycho\\" and \\"The Stranger,\\" there was this 1934 novel by James M. Cain, a dialogue-driven, first-person narrative in the form of a diary by a man on death row.While I still haven't figured out just where the title of the book relates to the story (who cares?), what I have figured out is this novel just plain works. This page-burner is a half-day read at best. It's as though someone lit a fuse on a stick of dynamite and you read faster and faster until it all blows up on the protagonist of the story and his lover, two killers who are in their relationship for the money, sadistic and masochistic carnality and, ironically, love.The book stuck with me for days. Cain didn't waste any time on the flowery descriptions common with works of literature -- no talk of the sounds of leaves crunching underfoot beneath a sky of azure. He jumps right into the eerie plot and takes you into the minds and actions of two amoral people and what they'd do for money and their own brand of twisted love.Many reviewers call it noir. Others would say it's full of existential dread a la Camus. I call Cain's unique style \\"existential dreadnoir,' and it's insanely readable and impossible to put down. Grab a couple cups of coffee, read it in five or six hours and be prepared to examine your thoughts for at least a couple of days.Unsettling and karmic and full of irony, it's titillating crime reading at its best."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"One of the greatest noir novels ever (and a short one, clocking in at only three discs in this unabridged audiobook), read by the great actor Stanley Tucci.

Cain brought a new edge to realism.The novel is narrated and written in Chambers' inarticulate vernacular which adds to its unique realism.Anymore detail or fancy words to describe something and the whole wouldn't have worked.Not only a book you can read in one sitting, its one you will read in a sitting as it grips completely.An underestimated giant in American writing and the realism genre. Don't miss it or think the many film adaptations can compare to the written work."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"There's not many novels that are that are more hardboiled than The Postman Always Rings Twice.It's hard as can be. You know the story: A drifter, a man, the man's wife. The man ends up dead at the hands of the drifter and the man's wife.I've read 50 Shades of Grey. You want sadomasochism? This short novella has more scenes of that than that modern bestseller. She asks for it, he gives it to her, she likes it. She asks for it again.The story and writing is like a .22 to the brain pan - short, direct and effective. I love the fact that it wasn't dragged out for 80,000 words. I found the writing so direct it had a few too sharp edges. It was a bit clipped and abrupt but, then again, that's the mood. Finally, when I finished I was exhausted. What a ride.It's a little book that kicked off a lot in 20th Century America. Nice."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"James M. Cain's first novel, The Postman Always Rings Twice, is a short violent book that was \\"banned in Boston\\" for its sexual content. Written in 1934, the obscenity was extremely tame by todays's standards. I liked this, typical of the dialog: \\"I kissed her. Her eyes were shining up at me like two blue stars. It was like being in church.\\"The title is metaphorical. There is no postman in it. It's more a reference to the fact that something will always come back to those who commit evil. One way or another, there's no escape. The story moves fast with tough dialog and a murder being planned. The lover's, Frank, the drifter, and Cora, the Greek's sexy wife, are into it with no turning back. I kept picturing Lana Turner or Jessica Lange, \\"a woman ready for anything,\\" as I read it. That's the trouble with seeing the movies before reading the book, even though it's been years since I saw them. But it didn't destroy the pleasure of the book--gritty, sultry, excellent writing.On the back of the book, Cain is quoted: \\"I make no conscious effort to be tough, or hard-boiled, or grim, or any of the things I am usually called. I merely try to write as the character would write, and I never forget that the average man...has acquired a vividness of speech that goes beyond anything I could invent.\\" Good advice on writing.Cain helped set the standard for noir fiction. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"\\"Postman\\" guns its motor early and pushes out onto the open road of literature during it first few pages. Unfortunately, it can't keep up that pace and devolves into wonderfully trashy pulp in the end. That said, the prose still startles, snaps and delivers even 75 years after it was written.But for me, the high point of the novel comes very early when Frank convinces roadside dinner owner \\"Nick the Greek\\" to buy a new sign for the place. The argument for the new sign goes like this:\\"Well it's out of date. Nobody has bulb signs any more. They got Neon signs. They show up better, and they don't burn as much juice. Then, what does it say? Twin Oaks, that's all. The Tavern part, it's not in the lights. Well, Twin Oaks don't make me hungry. It don't make me want to stop and get something to eat. It's costing you money, that sign, only you don't know it.\\"And so \\"Postman\\" announces a new world."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Another book that I was introduced to by 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die list. My first venture into the genre of American crime noir, and a successful one.This short (only about 100 pages) novel is narrated by Frank Chambers - a homeless bum, a morally deficient good-for-nothing fellow who gets by by hitch-hiking, gambling and turning shady deals. One day he comes across a roadside diner/gas station and is quickly hired by its owner - a Greek entrepreneur Nick. The only reason Frank sticks around is because of Nick's wife - a blond femme fatale Cora. The two quickly find themselves involved in a passionate, violent and destructive love affair that eventually leads them to the decision to kill Cora's husband. Surprisingly, they succeed in getting away with the crime, but they never quite recover from what they've done. Guilt, fear and mutual suspicion push them to their demise...I actually found myself very surprised (pleasantly) by this novel. It was very intense and rather risque (I can only imagine its reception when the book was first published in 1934). A great blend of sex, murder, corruption, violence, and, ironically, love.P.S. I also watched a movie adaptation of this book with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. That movie was something... Very provocative."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I've long admired Albert Camus's \\"The Stranger,\\" and I've just finished James Cain's \\"Postman.\\" The similarities are remarkable, and I'm told that in fact Camus acknowledged a debt to Cain. Both writers create criminal characters who live on the outside of their worlds and who act with strange detachment. Camus's character shoots an Arab seemingly without much thought or intention. Cain's killer uses more premeditation, and his detachment is modified by his passion for his victim's wife. Curiously, he sort of likes his victim too, but he lacks free will and a moral center. We see in Cain's portrayal something of the famous \\"absurdity\\" that moved Camus, although Camus found it appropriate to make his character less passionate.Moreover, Cain provides the prototype for the absurd justice system that Camus depicts. Cain's lawyers and police are without moral values, whereas Camus's are bent on trying his protagonist for not having displayed the proper feelings at his mother's funeral rather than for murdering someone. Both novels are darkly ironic, especially in the fact that the custodians of moral behavior have no moral center themselves.The crime in Camus's novel, according to society, is merely the indifference at the heart of the protagonist's character. The crime in Cain's novel, from the point of view of the justice system, is simply to get caught. And both books end with a sort of realization or epiphany on the part of the protagonist. In this regard, Camus's ending, in which his character becomes aware of the \\"benign indifference\\" of the universe, has more philosophical reach than Cain's, but nonetheless the parallel is clear.It is not surprising that Cain's novel--more like a novella, really--has been made into more than one good film. It is quickly paced, with a gritty kind of speech. And the sexual passion comes across as loud as hellcats going at it in the night. In the genre of noir fiction, \\"Postman\\" is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Okay, so now that this reviewer has recently warmed you up with review of James M. Cain's lesser works, including the minor classic Double Indemnity it is time to bring up the big guns- The Postman Always Rings Twice (hereafter, Postman). I have reviewed elsewhere in this space both the movie versions of this novel- the original one with John Garfield and Lana Turner in black and white in the 1940's and the color version with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange in the 1980's. Both have there merits although the Nicholson/Lange version produced at a time when there was a more permissive atmosphere in portraying raw, primordial sexual passions is closer to the sense of Cain's novel.Both films also take some license with the story line from the novel. That line, in summary, went something like this- Girl is unhappily married to older uncouth owner of a highway diner and gas station in sunny California of the 1930's. Boy an outlaw tramp, who also happens to be handy, very handy, with a wrench, comes down the road and hubby puts his to work in the station. Boy meets girl. Bang. Hubby is doomed but the newly formed couple, after a false start in clearing up that little matter, seemingly is ready to start a new life together once the murder rap is cleared up. Or are they?After a fair exposition of Cain's works in this space, including a few short stories not reviewed, it is apparent that he was onto something about the way that novelist could look at crime and the vagaries of human passions. Most of his works, including Postman, center on the reactions of his characters to the way that their lusts (and it is mainly the distortions caused by their lusts that Cain wants to look at) lead them inevitably to crime, mainly the most heinous one murder. Moreover, as demonstrated here, no crime no matter how perfectly committed or maneuvered around, will go unpunished either as a result of the psychological reaction and revulsion against their crimes, no matter how deeply submerged, of the characters, as here, with Frank and Cora or by some quirk of fate. No police or gumshoes need apply to solve these crimes.I have sometimes mentioned in reviewing Cain's work that the women tend to be femme fatales and that is true to the extent that these women have strong sexual identities, use that fact, and are, usually, to the extent they are fully developed by Cain stronger than the men. But then we are back to the old Adam and Eve story, aren't we? After all Eve was the one who took the chance. I would argue, as an aside here to the theme presented in Postman, that as conventional as Cora is in many ways, trying to make a go of the diner and trying to create a stable environment after the close call on the murder rap, that there is also some primitive Christian notion at work here. Something about the fates being played out a certain way and the gods best stay on the sidelines while they get worked out. But, hey, why don't you read this little gem and try to figure it out for yourselves."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A voyeuristic look into the shallow, callow amorality of people on the side of the interstate. The sex scenes still have clothes ripping, lip biting, carnal shock value--probably why it sold so well!"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I had read \\"Double Indemnity\\" a few months back, and liked it enough that I thought I'd give this a go. Aspects of this reminded me of DI, though TPART was actually written first, so I'm willing to forgive any similarities.A drifter hits town and becomes smitten with a bored housewife. They have a fling, and then decide to remove the husband permanently... and things spiral down from there.On the plus side, it's a quick read (just over 100 pages) and managed to keep me interested. The down-beats would be a rather chunky and clunky bit of exposition towards the end that threw the rhythm off, and Cain's prose - very rushed and unpolished. Granted it was his first novel and he was probably going for that effect anyway.I was a bit surprised to learn this was banned (by Boston, at least) as obscene upon its release, though I guess I can see why: the main characters flaunt their lack of \\"moral fortitude\\" so this was probably quite shocking for the time it was written. To an extent, this novel inadvertently functions as an odd little time capsule of the period.Worth reading once, if you like anti-hero crime fiction."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"James Cain's short and enigmatically-titled novel, \\"The Postman Rings Twice\\" (1934) began a new form of genre writing and noir film. It is tough, tersely told and raw, with a portrayal of sexuality that was extreme for its time. The novel works well because it depicts a sense of place - the dingy and poor areas, both rural and urban, of California in the 1930s. The characters are painted well in short, pointed strokes. The writing style is tough and laconic.The story is told in the first person by Frank Chambers, a violent 24-year old loner and drifter. At the outset of the story, Chambers is thrown out of a truck in which he had stown himself away in Mexico. He finds himself in rural California about 20 miles from Los Angeles. He is offered a job at a small gas station and restaurant, the \\"Twin Oaks Tavern\\" owned Nick Papadakis, whom Chambers calls \\"The Greek\\". Chambers and Papadakis' young, frustrated wife Cora quickly begin a seamy affair. Cora is attracted by Chambers' strength, youth, and sexual brutality.Chambers describes his and Cora's two attempts to kill Papadakis in which he narrowly avoids detection. The murder attempts are interspersed with stories of games of pool in shabby halls, drinking and wandering on Los Angeles streets, the gritty life of a waitress in \\"hash houses\\" full of sexual come-ons, and a short trip to Mexico that Chambers takes with another woman, Madge. Cain also portrays the defense and prosecutorial lawyers that occupy this level of the criminal justice system. But most of the book centers upon the torrid relationship between Chambers and Cora, as they betray and try to separate from each other. Chambers is an unsympathetic, immoral character for most of the story, but I found myself feeling for him and for Cora as the book comes to an ironic, fated end.The novel has been made into at least four movies and it created a new form of pulp, crime novel. But in this case, the novel transcends its genre. With its tight style, portrayal of lonely lost people, and dismal places, \\"The Postman Rings Twice\\" is a work of literature separate from noir. The novel is available in a separate text; but it is probably best read as part of a Library of America volume of \\"Crime Novels, American Noir of the 1930s and 40s\\" that includes five additional works by five different authors.Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1930s and 40s: The Postman Always Rings Twice / They Shoot Horses, Don't They? / Thieves Like Us / The Big Clock / Nightmare ... a Dead Man (Library of America) (Vol 1)Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I had some spare time in between brushing my teeth and flossing, so I decided to read this thing cover to cover. It's nearly that brisk a read. The triangle Cain sketches out is so classic--the boorish husband knocked off by the young wife and her drifter lover--that it was already part of my mental furniture before I even read it. You'd think it would come across as too worn, but instead it remains remarkably fresh. Well, great writing never goes stale. This is an incredibly disciplined piece of work, always moving swiftly but never cheating the reader of detail. Cain knows how people from all strata talk (the dialogue is stylized, but it always rings true), and he knows just how things can go terribly wrong and why. Life's losers and winners, caught here for all time.I get pretty fed up with people saying Cain merely grafted a crime plot onto a Hemingway-esque prose. Oh, is that how he did it. As if that's so easy. Plenty of writers have tried to ape Hemingway; few have absorbed the style and made a living thing of it the way Cain does here. (And he manages at least one thing Hemingway never did--he makes you laugh.) I'm also a bit impatient with everyone who says how tame this book's sexuality is for the modern reader. Anyone who finds Frank's and Cora's encounters tame has been watching too much assembly-line girls gone wild. This is the real stuff, still smoldering some 75 years later."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This book is a quick and gripping read.

Written with curt statements, little detail, and almost exclusively dialogue (could be a movie script), this book quickly outlines a thorough story in about 100 pages.The protagonist, Frank Chambers, is basically another impulse driven, good-for-nothing, tiger on the road. He is the bad boy which good girls fall for. And the girl in this book is Iowa blond beauty queen, Cora Papadakis - whose surname comes from older husband Nick Papadakis. Frank's character reminds me immensely of Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\" hero - Dean Moriarity.Cora hates herself and her life. After Nick employs Frank, she falls for the help. The femme fatale employs Frank to free her from her misery - which means murdering Nick. After botching the job the first time, and failing to run away while Nick sits in a hospital bed, Frank meets up with Cora for a second chance (hence the title).The second attempt leads you through another botched caper which only leads to an ingenious and fruitful legal maneuver which climaxes with the insurance agent perjuriously testifying in order to save the company money. Money acquits evil.But, if you sleep with dogs, you wake up with fleas. A few escapades later, Frank and Cora mutually mistrust one another to the point where each believes the other will do to them what they did to poor Nick.The ending is classic irony. And, that is what makes the book so ingratiatingly wonderful for film makers and readers. Love is conquered by the unknown. Isn't it usually \\"Love conquers all?\\" Then the unknown conquers all, or does it?If you are looking for flowery prose, detailed description, or poignant passages of reflection - forget about it. This is Hemingwayesque, it is Marlowe-like or Hammett-influenced. This is about dialogue, slang, or street talk. This is classic fodder for film noire.

What I discovered was 100 plus pages of violence and moral vacuity that made Hammett look flabby and sentimental by comparison. James Cain was not content to portray his characters as morally bankrupt. He obviously thought it more effective to shove moral bankruptcy right into the reader's face.The action moves very fast. Frank meets Cora and the attraction is electric. Their first physical encounter is brutish. That she is married makes not a whit of difference. Cora describes her husband in the most repulsive terms imaginable. They plot to kill him. Everything goes wrong.It is not difficult to see why POSTMAN was surrounded by controversy upon its release. The violence and sex are right up front. The characters show no misgivings about the adultery they commit. But I think the real issue with this book, what really sent people into tizzy fits, is the atmosphere. One would have to look long and hard to find characters so bleak and amoral. That Cain allows these characters to unfold as they do without a word of disapproval compounds the effect.

He posits a clear number for how long a witness should be believed. He says that it's 200 years. He also thinks that it's only when Christ's message is no longer believed by anyone at all that he will return. He bases this on a calculation adding the Gospel writers (200 years a piece), plus the disciples testimony.

They tend to fall roughly into one of two categories: 1) lightweight quasi-phrasebooks that make liberal use of phonetic spellings and sweep grammar under the rug; 2) bone-dry reviews of the mechanics of a language, peppered with the occasional vocabulary for memorization.How rare it is to find a book that preserves the flavor of a language while laying it forth in an eminently practical manner; such is the present volume. New words, conjugations and formulae are introduced in the context of short readings and quotations, often humorous, from Voltaire, La Rochefoucauld and many others.The authors have made ingenious use of cognates, words recognizable by their English counterparts, to tap an instant vocabulary. It's gratifying to discover how much French you already know as an English speaker. This approach gives you the opportunity to put that knowledge to work immediately, and to build upon it -- not without effort, but without the drudgery that you might expect from such rigorous fare. The preference for real French text (as opposed to textbook cookery -- &quot;See Pierre run. Run, Pierre, run!&quot;) ensures that material is covered in a natural and useful order.Although it provides simple guidelines for pronunciation, the book's focus is (as the title suggests) on the language as written.

It replaces no other text. French for Reading Knowledge differs from the traditional, as well as the current oral-aural type of text. It differs in aim, approach, teaching technique, vocabulary, reading material, etc. How it differs cannot be told here because a short description would be inadequate, and a long one would be read only by those who do not need to read it. In view of this, we should like to make but one brief comment: the basic vocabulary, basic for reading only and extremely small, includes those words which the student will need for further reading in any field. There are a few words, though, which are not generally basic. Obviously, they had to be included for practical purposes. We wish to thank Professor Casimir D. Zdanowicz, who foresaw in an Extension reading course the development of a new method and offered valuable suggestions for the preparation of this book. We are grateful to Dr. Lorentz H. Adolfson, Director of the Extension Division, and to Dr. W. M. Hanley, also of the Extension Division, for continous professional support and encouragement. We are greatful, too, to Mlle Germaine Mercier and to Mme Francoise Jankowski (nee Cusin) for reading the manuscript and making valuable suggestions, and to Miss Ethel A. Schenk, Specialist in charge of Placement and Attainment Examinations at the University of Wisconsion, who was consulted on various matters.\\" [from preface by Joseph Palmeri, E. E. Milligan]"},{"Title":"French for Reading Knowledge, 2nd Edition","review":"I bought this book in the hopes that I would be able to use it to pass my graduate language examination. I worked with the book for about five months, I made it about half way through the book, I took the test, and I passed quite easily. So the book definitely works. The book is clear and there are a ton of translation exercises at the end of each chapter so you get a lot of practice translating passages as you make your way through.There are a couple of things I did not like about the book. The translation examples given at the end of each chapter were sometimes frustrating. There were two things that made them frustrating at times.First, sometimes the sentences, when translated literally into English, did not make a lot of sense. It was sometimes quite difficult to make sense out of them. In some ways that is a good thing since it gives the reader practice translating which is the whole point of a book like this. I think the practice I got translating those difficult passages, trying to figure out how to make sense of them and translate them into intelligible English, was quite helpful when I took my test. It was still quite frustrating at times, however, especially since there are no translations in the book, so the reader is often not entirely sure whether they are actually translating the sentence correctly. I wish that the move to more difficult translations had been more gradual so that the reader had a little more time to build up their confidence. I would recommend the reader use Google translate to check their translations. It is not perfect, sometimes google's translations are clearly way off, and sometimes the sentence they come up with makes no sense in English, but most of the time it is a good way to check your work and make sure you are translating correctly.The second thing I found frustrating is that the authors put a lot of words in the translation exercises that were not covered in the book. A lot of times they would present a verb that you had never seen before, and it would be conjugated, and you would have to figure out what the original verb was by comparing it to other verbs that conjugated in a similar way. I will say, again, that this was good practice for taking a language test. It is necessary, when translating, to be able to figure out verbs you do not already know from their conjugations. It was, however, still quite frustrating at times. I wish, again, that they had been more gradual in their approach. I found myself losing confidence because I felt like I was being given some translation exercises that I was having a very hard time translating fairly early on in the book. Although, who knows, perhaps if it had been more gradual I would not have passed my test. All I know is that I definitely found myself getting frustrated, and losing confidence, at times. Perhaps that is unavoidable.All in all, I feel quite comfortable recommending this book. It worked for me, and I have a feeling it would work for others as well. It is not perfect, in my opinion, but perfection is probably an unrealistic ideal. I would also recommendEasy French Readeras a helpful companion volume to this work. The more practice you have translating the better you will do when you take your language test."},{"Title":"French for Reading Knowledge, 2nd Edition","review":"This is literally the worst language textbook I have ever seen. I have studied German, Spanish, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin - all on the graduate level - so I have a good sense for the ins and outs of language textbooks. The biggest flaw of this book is its organization, or lack thereof. Rather than organizing its content into chapters devoted to specific topics, this book has sections which throw a random barrage of topics at you in no apparent order. You get a bit on nouns, some adjectives, verbs, more adjectives, pronouns, a bit more on verbs, all in the space of about 15 pages. It makes connecting the dots to see the big picture almost impossible.Also, the exercises in the book are very bad. Rather than coherent sentences, half of the practice exercises are random collections of 2-3 word phrases. And there are tons of words in the exercises which have not yet been given to you in the vocab of the section. Sure, you can look them up, but when you're bombarded with foreign words from the opening pages on, it gets disheartening.Stay away from this book. It sucks."},{"Title":"French for Reading Knowledge, 2nd Edition","review":"maximum thoughts arise regardless of enforced line limits. book good belong the measure. read french for teh future. allows the mind to develop reading comprehension. nice for those knowing latin or germna. pick up french after a year of study. pass those graduate exams."},{"Title":"How to Break Bad News: A Guide for Health Care Professionals","review":"I first came across a reference to this book in a medical ethics class.

I recommend it very highly for all physicians and mental health professionals. The authors explain that, despite the American focus on informed consent, some patients who develop life threatening disease do NOT want to know all the details, or even the prognosis, of their condition. A wise and useful six-step protocol for breaking bad news is proffered, incorporating both readiness to fully inform and readiness to respect the patient's psychological vulnerabilities. Since bad news comes in many forms in this life, the skills and attitudes described have wide applicability in the helping professions.

These expectations were partly satisfied with the first volume, which describes Jefferson's formative years- if such years can indeed be set apart from the life of a man who never ceased to grow. However, as I closed this fourth volume, I was forced to admit that I had gained very little new insight in its purported subject, and that the whole volume had proved rather tedious to read.The six-volume series has been described as a major achievement in the half-way house between history and biography . Laudatory though this comment may be, it summarizes for me the major flaw of Malone's enterprise : its failure as biographical writing. Nowhere is this clearer than in this fourth volume, where Jefferson himself seems to recede in the background while the author retells the most tedious details of the workings of his administration, however unrelated to Jefferson himself.The un-biographical character of the work is reinforced by its format : instead of following Jefferson chronologically, Malone has chosen to offer us a series of chapters organized around such themes as the executive appointments, Marbury vs. Madison or the Louisiana Purchase, thus imposing conventional textbook divisions on the organic flow of Jefferson's life. As a result, the biography reads as a series of historical essays, and certain important topics are relegated to the next volume. Nothing is said for instance about Jefferson's personal relation with Meriwether Lewis or his involvement in the preparations of the Lewis and Clarke expedition.Perhaps even more regrettable is the general impression of Jefferson given by Malone as a relatively unintellectual man who had apparently done most of his reading in his youth and never bothered to systematize his thinking, being more concerned with his presidential duties, his social life and the occasional joys of the countryside.Apart from a few interesting chapters, therefore, such as The Religion of a Reasonable Man , and the welcome refutation of the Sally Hemings myth, this curious hybrid of a volume should be eschewed by those who seek a genuine understanding of Jefferson the man. To them, David Mayer's The Constitutional Thought of Thomas Jefferson , and a good selection of Jefferson's own writings, should prove much more profitable reading."},{"Title":"Jefferson the President: First Term 1801-1805 - Volume IV (Jefferson & His Time (Little Brown & Company))","review":"Jefferson: The President First Term 1801-1805:Jefferson: The President First Term 1801 - 1805 is the fourth volume in a series of six. This volume is exclusively Jefferson as the President of the United States. Jefferson's first task as President was to unite a politically divided country.Jefferson's immediate goal was to show a peaceful transfer of authority and then never lose sight of this goal then maintain unity within his party. Jefferson was more moderate politically than his party partisans, but he did require unity and loyalty.Jefferson was a man of paradox, he was recognized as the head of his party, but he longed of his home in the Virginia foothills. Jefferson put his faith in the individual as he sought to increase personal freedoms, but he was plagued early on by the Hamiltonians wanting a stronger central government. Later on John Marshall appointed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by John Adams in his waning Presidency would be at odds with Jefferson. This conflict was mainly a political viewpoint, but the arguments would be heated as the successive phases took shape. This is where Malone takes more of a Jefferson view and not the whole view of his adversaries Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr and John Marshall when writing, thus this book is insufficiently critical of Jefferson's occasional political errors, faults, and lapses, also there is his alleged failure to come to grips with Jefferson's life as a slave owner and his alleged (and still unproven) relationship with his slave Sally Hemings.Jefferson's first several months in office were distinguished by a high degree of collaboration and consensus in the cause of government \\"retrenchment.\\" They were characterized by a continuation of the intense, behind-the-scenes political intrigue that Jefferson had mastered as leader of the opposition under John Adams. Jefferson's knack for cutting a deal when expedient would mark him, then and now, in critics' eyes as a hypocrite. But it also demonstrated the extent to which he was pragmatic when it came to politics in a democratic system that was only then discovering how to replace the European system of command and control with one of compromise and consent.Jefferson had forethought and wanted the river rights of the Mississippi, when Spain ceded New Orleans to France. Jefferson, fearing that the western territories' only outlet to the sea would be lost, authorized the payment of $10 million for the port city and the adjacent lands to the east, but Napoleon offered to sell the entire 828,000 square mile Louisiana Territory for $15 million Jefferson acted quickly. This later worked toward the Louisiana Purchase and the expansion of the United States west of the Mississippi. Jefferson was determined that New Orleans should be part of the United States. So, by shrewd diplomacy, the deal was struck. But to acquire West Florida was not to come till his second term and so with the exploration of the Louisiana territory with Lewis and Clark.Jefferson symbolized freedom and democracy, but friends clearly showed respect. Jefferson's composure while President showed that he ran a balanced government. This is a very good and scholarly work, but the deals and facts are there... only thing the author needed to do was bring out Jefferson the man more to the forefront. I got the impression that Malone wasn't clear enough about Jefferson during this time, yes we get facts, but not all of the facts. There is more to Jefferson during this time period than Malone cares to write about. Jefferson's ability, his reading at that time, and his other interests, regrettable, as there have been other books that more clearly show Jefferson's intelligence during this time, not just his presidential duties, his social life and the occasional joys of Monticello. There is nothing about Jefferson's headaches. A more accurate description seems to be stress headache, resulting from involuntary muscular contraction from nervous tension. Jefferson himself attributed the onset of his headaches to the pressures of work. Today we would call these psychosomatic, stress in nature, caused by dread of politics. But Jefferson's headaches would be severe enough for almost total incapacity, which would endanger his own legacy as it teetered on the brink of ruin, Jefferson, by his own admission, would lay helpless and insensible.This organization of this book is a division into thematic chapters. We see Marbury v Madison, The Louisiana Purchase, and some of Jefferson's organization as President, but it is lacking in Jefferson's friendship with Meriwether Lewis or for that matter any personal relationship detail, be it friendships or working relationships."},{"Title":"Jefferson the President: First Term 1801-1805 - Volume IV (Jefferson & His Time (Little Brown & Company))","review":"What can be said about this monument to Jefferson scholarship? I am sure that somewhere in universities around the United States there are &quot;scholar squirrels who want to put down this invaluable resource in Jefferson studies. It is always the way that mice attempt to gnaw at lions. This is not a perfect work (and my remarks refer to all of the books in the series as a whole), there are somethings, namely Sally Hemmings references which are wrong and will not sit well with American 21st century mores. There is the issue of slavery which was handled much differently 50 years ago than it is now.Jefferson is not worthy of our interest because of Sally Hemmings and because he kept slaves. Jefferson is great because of the Declaration of Independence and his fight for the rights of man. While it may have been hypocritical to preach liberty and keep slaves, it is doubtful that slavery ever would have been abolished if Jefferson had never gained the prominence that he did. This book and the others that follow show why we should continue to honor the public man even though his private side may have been wanting."},{"Title":"The Cabala (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"I became aquainted with this novel shortly after reading Wilder's later and more famous novel \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\". That is also well worth reading by the way. ...Initially I simply liked it but shortly before reaching the middle of the book I became 100% entranced. And I think you will too! Bur there are things that you will have to be ready for.Basically this is a book for people who love to admire literary construction. If you are a DEVOUT Hemingway person this will not please you. Wilder writes long and descriptive paragraphs and describes his characters down to the tiniest detail. The reason I love this is because he so obviously cared about what he was writing. If you're like me and tired of the stream-lined effect of much of \\"modern\\" writing you will love this. Even if this jewel-like prose is not your cup of tea perhaps you can still appreciate what I find a forgotten masterpiece.So what is it about? Well to begin with it concerns a young, unnamed American student who is pursuing his Archeological/Classical studies in Rome between the wars. Here he runs into a strange group of people known locally as the Cabala. They are made up mainly of aristocrats and have great prestige if little real power. \\"Samuele\\" (as the student is called by one of the Cabalists) proceeds to chronicle this group's last exploits. Last because the group begins to drift apart right in front of \\"Samuele\\". What is the book really about? Well I for one am still figuring that out. The Cabalists are to a certain extent symbolic of decadent and dying but still important and lovely Europe while \\"Samuele\\" represents the \\"new Rome\\" America. But Wilder goes far deeper than that. I really don't want to spoil anything but certain themes that are raised are acceptance (of change, death, etc.), unrequited love, the reasons behind love, loss of faith and the nature of a civilization's construction. That sounds like alot but Wilder manages to ballance it brilliantly and create a huge number of great characters and interweaving storylines.All of this is expressed in some of the most lovely prose I've ever read. You can just loose yourself in the warm sea of Wilder's writing. Sample: \\"As a mere girl, if I may presume to reconstruct the growth of her personality, she sensed the fact that there was something that a little prevented her from making friends, namely intelligence. The few intelligent people who truly wish to be liked soon learn, among the disappointments of the heart, to conceal their brilliance.\\" This is the start of a charachter's description. All of which in this book are magical. Wilder creates people who are real yet we truly love with all our hearts. That is the key to some of this book's greatness. Much of the love thrown around in this book is un-earned and yet it is love all the same. Why do we love some people and not others? Why do we love people who don't deserve it? There are no answers in words but this book SHOWS us how and why that happens. This could only be done by an author who had a truly mature and yet warm heart. \\"Samuele\\" and Wilder pull no punches in pointing out flaws yet they do so with deep and profound love and understanding. This leads to lines that can simply pierce the heart: \\"They dreamed of one of those long conversations that one never has on earth, but which one projects so clearly at midnight, alone and wise; words are not rich enough nor kisses sufficiently compelling to repair all our havoc.\\" Those words define both the futility and the absolute necessity of forgiveness and reconciliation. Wilder also knows history, music, literature and art FAR better than most writers and with that at his fingertips he can often rise to an amazing quiet eloquence: \\"Nay, I have heard of your city. It's foundations have knocked upon our roof and the towers have cast a shadow across the sandals of the angels.\\" I could go on forever and ever but I'll just mention the amazing, breathtaking end a little. One thing: it features an cameo that you won't soon forget! Find this book, read it and make it a part of your life. You will not regret it!"},{"Title":"The Cabala (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"Lots of people took great pleasure in lambasting Thornton Wilder's inclusion on the Modern Library list of the 100 greatest novels of the twentieth century. Setting aside that publicity stunt, Wilder is an underrated writer, whose finest books, such as THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY and the wonderful THEOPHILUS NORTH, mingle shrewd observation, fine and wistful writing, and profound insight into the human heart.THE CABALA was Wilder's first novel, written when he was in his late twenties and appearing the year before his most famous book THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY. It chronicles a young man's sojourn in Rome and his involvement with a mysterious group of eccentric and charming individuals who are known as the Cabala. In many ways, THE CABALA presages THEOPHILUS NORTH -- in its sharply observed yet movingly nostalgic depiction of its setting (Rome), in its affectionate yet shrewd portraits of the men and women who make up the Cabala, and in its deft storytelling of each of the linked incidents into which Wilder's narrator finds himself drawn as he gets to know the Cabala more and more intimately. The indescribable last chapter presages magic realism -- and, for my money, is better than any of the more ponderous and better-known recent examples of the genre.In sum, this early novel by a fine yet under-appreciated writer is well worth reading and may well (and should) spur the reader to explore more of Wilder's works."},{"Title":"The Cabala (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"If you've ever been young, travelled while young, and met memorable characters in exotic places, here is a wonderful book from one of the masters.

They all have wealth and a burning desire to turn back the clock; to reinstate Kings in Europes republics, with the Kings divine right to rule (this was the case in Tsarist Russia up to 1917!). As Wilder puts it;\\"(The Cabala) lose sleep over notions that the rest of the world has outgrown several centuries ago.\\" But for the new to flourish, the old must die....A short book full of witty obsevations and satire on class,etiquette and the ludicrous pretentions of Europes old aristocracies,it also carries a thought provoking philosophy on the nature of religion and Gods.Gods of all sorts come and go and with it the power they give and lose to the followers of that God. The Roman Gods are long dead (or have morphed)to be replaced by our current single God, started by the Jews and then altered via various new prophets into the offshoots of Christianity and Islam....these in turn being fragmented into all sorts of different sects each with their own version of God.The old European God of the Catholic states giving divine powers to his chosen,losing out to the new Protestant God who is more democratic about things.The old worlds and the new. All these ideas flood into your mind on reading Wilder's intelligent witty and erudite novella.Who knows (God only?!)what God we'll be worshipping 3000 years from now, but we'll have Wilder's 'Cabala' to amuse us about it!"},{"Title":"The Cabala (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"I chanced upon Wilder when I had almost given up on finding readable modern works, uncontaminated by the Hemingway school of chiarascuro journalism. He is vaguely reminiscent of both Henry James and Lawrence Durrell in the sensuous way he limns almost every sentence at three levels of meaning: the superficial, the witty truism and the emblem.If only the Cabal had a smidgen more in it of plot, and less of Proust, it would be a masterpiece. As it is, it reminds one of Woolf's Orlando - a great work that disappears at times, all too preciously, into its own navel."},{"Title":"The Cabala (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"When Samuele, a student and writer, goes to Rome with his friend James Blair, Blair introduces him to a group of strange people known as the Cabalists. As he gets to know them Samuele gets more involved with their activities, and on the surface they seem very mysterious and odd: a priest who doesn't believe in prayer, a 16-yearold boy who commits suicide after committing incest with his sister, and a girl who believes she is the god Mercury. In fact, she reveals who the Cabalists really are to Samuele: they are the pagan gods of ancient Rome, grown old and useless now, thanks mainly to their human-like weaknesses. Just before sailing back to America, Samuele has a \\"conversation\\" with Virgil (or at least his spirit), a rather sophomoric complaint by Virgil against Milton and Shakespeare for not \\"honoring\\" him enough. It's part of Wilder's satire, but that particular scene is unfortunately weak. The importance of the book goes beyond the storyline and the characters, neither of which seem that compelling or memorable, and rests on Wilder's attention to style and form, which is as classic and formal as the ancients themselves."},{"Title":"Home Life in Colonial Days","review":"Alice Morse Earle has written several books on life in Colonial America. This is the first one of her books I've read, and I am eager to move on to another volume, perhaps Child Life in Colonial Days. Mrs. Earle's &quot;Home Life&quot; is a fascinating description of everyday life --- the chores, the tools, the dwelling places, the foods, the sights and sounds --- that Colonial Americans knew. Have you ever seen a strange tool or implement in a museum, an antique shop, or hanging on the wall at a country restaurant, and no one seems to know exactly what it is or what it was used for? Read this book: its many illustrations will more than likely include that mysterious object; and Mrs. Earle will describe clearly what it was and how it was used. This book should be in the library of every enthusiast of American antiques. Without a doubt, this book contains information found nowhere else in a book now in print. This is not a history of Colonial America --- although it contains many interesting tidbits about our country's earliest days. It is, however, an excellent description of everyday life in America, 1600 - 1800, with special emphasis on New England and Virginia. As such, this book would be useful not just to historians and antique collectors, but to writers, museum curators, and anyone who wants to understand Colonial America."},{"Title":"Home Life in Colonial Days","review":"This hundred-year-old work retains its vitality and usefulness.In her wonderfully readable narrative, Earle conveys life in the colonies with vividness missing from most conventional texts. Starting with basic shelter, which were sometimes actually caves in the earliest days, she goes on to describe in detail the critical element of food supply, with careful explanations of culinary practices and useful drawings to illustrate the often-obscure utensils. (This latter feature will fascinate antique buffs.) Also covered are the home production of textiles, the dress of the colonists, travel, religious and social practices, flower gardens, and other matters, providing modern readers an insight into everyday colonial life hard to find elsewhere.Earle's work is a feast of enjoyable information for history readers, collectors, and anyone else who wants to know how the early settlers lived. (The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately ineradicable feature of the page. This reviewer does not &quot;score&quot; books.)"},{"Title":"Home Life in Colonial Days","review":"I just finished this book and I loved it.First, Alice Morse Earle is descriptive and it is fascinating to read her personal feelings as she looks back in time, writing this in the late 1800's. She often speaks of things that they were still doing or using in the late 1800's that I have never heard of and she'll say \\"much like we still use\\" when she spoke of how they cleared snow from roads with horses and plows.Each chapter is more interesting than I could have imagined:Homes of ColonistsThe Light of Other DaysThe Kitchen FiresideThe Serving of MealsFood from Forest and seaIndian CornMeat and DrinkFlax Culture and SpinningWool Culture and Spinning (and cotton)Hand-WeavingGirls' OccupationsDress of the ColonistsJack-knife IndustriesTravel, Transportation and TavernsSunday in the coloniesColonial NeighborlinessOld-time Flower GardensAlice went over in detail the tools, fixtures, techniques and reasons for techniques. It was amazing to read about how much exercise and time women spent making material for clothes.She talks about the earliest forms of tools and how they developed and why they developed and often mentions important inventors, most of whom we would never think about, because we don't have these crafts or trades like flax weaving anymore.She writes about sustainability and surprised me in the weaving chapters on how colonists were able to gain freedom from England with their abilities and work ethics.There are line drawings so we can grasp a better understanding of what these objects and tools looked like.The transportation chapter was fascinating when she wrote about old travel routes like the \\"New Connecticut Path\\" and what travel conditions were like and the time it took to get from one place to another.She was most sentimental about gardens and olden day flowers and she wrote about invasive plants that still plague us today.She uses interesting quotes and writings from writers who lived in Colonial times and I appreciated that because those writers are probably not published and there are wonderful descriptions from people who lived thru these experiences. Alice also includes the old spelling.Some might find her writing to be too descriptive and sentimental but I loved it and highly recommend reading it if you are interested in this era.

Grunt work some of it, but some of it precise; over twenty distinct, careful, intricate, labor-intensive steps--taking weeks worth of labor--needed just to process flax to the point where it could be spun into thread to be woven into the varieties of linen that clothed many people in those days, and that weaving process involving many more steps.Soft, spoiled, lacking their grit and enterprise, and largely unaware and unappreciative of their skills and sacrifices, as most of us are today, we are not anywhere near their equal."},{"Title":"Home Life in Colonial Days","review":"A. M. Earls's Home Life in Colonial Days is a very interesting view of history as they were written in the the late 19th century. It is apparent that Earls did much research, visited many locations, and quotes from many sources and poems to support her observations, but as a product of the time,she did not use citations or footnotes. The edition I purchased of A. M. Earls' Home Life in in Colonial days is disappointing in that it is lacking the figures and plates which were originally included. Most of Earls' discussions center on New England then some on Pennsylvania and a little on Virgina. I found the the writing style easy to read with a noticable but not overbaring Victorian romantic style. There is no chonological or regional organization. The chapters are arranged by broad topics such as Food from the Land, Jack Knife Industries, Wool and Weaving, Transportation and Inns. There were incites and descriptions of lifeways and crafts which I have not before encountered. There are many nuggets of interesting informaion contained through out the work.

The presentation of the numerous specific techniques is split in two parts: explaining probabilistic and analytic approaches to the analysis of algorithms correspondingly. Probabilistic techniques (inequalities of moments, limit theorems, large deviations, etc.) are very useful in the analysis of complex random structures, as they often yield simple estimates of their asymptotic behavior, where more accurate techniques fail or become prohibitively laborious. Analytic techniques (generating functions, singularity analysis, saddle point techniques, Mellin transform, analytic poissonization and depoissonization) on the other hand, represent a toolbox for exact modelling of the characteristics of the algorithms, yielding estimates of unparalleled precision.As indicated by its title, this book is mostly devoted to the analysis of a special class of combinatorial algorithms -- ones that operate with sequences of symbols, or sequences. For example, it includes a detailed analysis of various algorithms for searching and sorting alphanumeric sequences based on digital trees (tries, digital search tries, Patricia-tries, etc.), redundancy expressions for popular Lempel-Ziv data compression schemes, average complexity estimates for text pattern-matching algorithms (such as Knuth-Morris-Pratt scheme), and so on.Following the famous tradition of &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;, the author wraps many (in some case very difficult to derive) results in the form of exercises, so that active readers can have fun solving them.

Here, we're looking at a (short) 8th-century Chinese syncretic work which incorporated (imported) Indian Mahayana Buddhist concepts with indigenous Chinese Taoist concepts. The arrival and assimilation of Buddhism with native Chinese beliefs over several centuries was a seminal occasion in Chinese history, and produced an important volume of religious/philosophical literature, of which this treatise is a sophisticated representative. Alas, this body of literature is hardly known outside of the scholarly community and arcane specialist study, which is really a shame in many ways. We'll get back to that in a minute.We're looking at, in this case, an obscure work entitled the \\"Pao-tsang Lun\\" (or Baozang Lun- \\"Treasure/Jewel Store Treatise\\"), which one discovers was rather highly esteemed in Chinese Buddhist circles by important thinkers such as the eminent Chan/Hua-yen master Tsung-mi, as well as famous medieval Chan (Zen) masters such as Yun-men, Yen-shou, Ta-hui and others. In fact, two cases in the Chan classic \\"Blue Cliff Record\\" (Pi-yen Lu) were derived from the Treasure Store Treatise, which ought to catch the attention of Zen students interested in probing the background context of \\"Golden-Age\\" Chan in more depth. We can go further...Zen students OUGHT to be paying attention to much of medieval Chinese literature displaying an assimilation of Buddhist with Taoist concepts. Why? Simply because these works are a good background for deepening one's understanding of the cultural milieu of their favorite Chan masters.Author Robert Sharf is well-known to fellow scholars (or should be) for his many contributions to Buddhist studies, from his penetrating examination of new Japanese religions and Japanese nationalism, to his examination and critique of East Asian scholarly trends in general, to an interest in Asian iconography and esoteric/Tantric streams of Buddhism (not to mention fine translation work here as well). Alas, his name probably doesn't ring a bell with readers of popular Zen (and other Buddhist) literature. The reason for this is the same as in any discipline- fact is, there is a huge gulf between the popular literature of religions and what the scholarly community knows and discusses (this is as true in Christianity as in Buddhism). What is perhaps sad about this \\"gulf\\" between popular vs. scholarly knowledge is that many are not even aware of the magnitude of the gulf...but I digress.Back to the book. The title, \\"Coming to Terms with Chinese Buddhism\\" is probably well-chosen, for what Sharf examines actually goes far beyond merely a translation of an obscure text. In fact, among other topics, he attempts to entirely re-focus scholarly trends regarding so-called \\"sinification\\"- i.e., how Buddhism and Chinese culture developed through their mutual encounter and dialogue. Sharf sees many problems with prior scholarship in this regard. A detailed description of his critique won't be attempted here, but suffice it to say Sharf takes issue with the trend to see Chinese cultural developments during this period as the interaction of distinct, discrete \\"sects\\" or \\"schools\\" or \\"lineages\\"- i.e., as separate, autonomous entities such as Pure Land, Sanlun, Neo-Confucianism, etc.. His contention is that scholars not only have set up a false so-called \\"master narrative\\" that views these interactions in terms of distinct sects, the exaggeration of \\"separate entities\\" can, according to Sharf, even be extended to supposed distinctions between \\"Indian Buddhism\\" vs. \\"Chinese culture\\" in general.What to make of all this? Certainly Sharf's critique of the tendency to categorize is peppery and no doubt has provoked scholars to re-appraise assumptions concerning the issues of sinification, but probably not all critics will buy his own analysis. One suspects Sharf might have overstated his case to some degree, and indeed, Sharf seems to contradict himself later on when examining various \\"influences\\" on his translated text itself - he can't seem to help himself when identifying various concepts of \\"sects\\" having conceptual similarities with the Pao-tsang Lun - i.e., the Ox-head \\"school\\" of Chan, \\"Gentry\\" Taoism, \\"Two-school\\" Taoism, etc..A logical deduction seems to be that the various \\"schools\\" really DID have some lines of demarcation, and although Sharf may have a point seeing distinctions to be exaggerated, scholars are probably going to keep on describing Chinese sinification processes in terms of the interaction of distinct \\"schools\\". It may be difficult to do otherwise. Although a common thread certainly would be expected to run though Buddhist doctrinal developments in China, there are also tremendous differences in emphasis on particular doctrines among various \\"schools\\", as well as differences in the external cultural contributions.Sharf goes on to develop other themes in his book, which a short review can't do justice to. Some of his excellent contributions, too many to detail here, include an important discussion of how certain Indian conceptual terms correlated with, and thereby were transformed by, Chinese cosmological beliefs in terms of \\"sympathetic resonance\\" (kan-yin). There's little doubt in my own (humble, of course) mind that Sharf's penetrating discussion makes a very fruitful contribution to East Asian studies in this regard...Also interesting is Sharf's deconstruction of so-called \\"lineages\\" in an Appendix on \\"esoteric\\" (Tantric) Buddhism in China. Sharf looks closely at later Japanese tendencies to extract a self-conscious \\"esoteric\\" school or lineage from the T'ang period and the resulting Japanese attempt to attach a \\"pedigree\\" to Japanese esoteric schools, such as Shingon and Mikkyo. Sharf sees little evidence for a self-conscious Chinese esoteric movement separate from the Buddhist mainstream. This is another section that no doubt challenges conventional assumptions and makes for good discussion, particularly regarding the claims of the Japanese esoteric schools.Now that we've established this book offers much of interest to scholars of Buddhism and East Asian culture in general, what about Joe Blow Buddhist fan in general? I'm thinking here of our typical Zen devotee, who has waded through the modern pop books on Zen (and unfortunately, the great majority of these modern efforts belong under the \\"pop\\" label), and who have perhaps waded through some of the translated T'ang and Sung Period material on the great chan masters, and have maybe even tackled a few of the major Sutras (no easy task for moderns). What can a book such as this offer him/her?Probably the simplist reply here is to recognize that works such as the Pao-tsang Lun represent a period when the merging of Mayahana doctrines with indigenous Chinese thought produced some very interesting literature, which also reached a high level of sophistication. The fact that classical Chan masters of the stature of Yun-men (Unmon) were inspired by such literature (including other works more properly attributed to Seng-Chao, dating back to the 5th century) is food for thought. Zen people, take notice. It behooves practitioners to become more familiar with the background material that helped formed the teachings in their chosen discipline, no?"},{"Title":"Coming to Terms with Chinese Buddhism: A Reading of the Treasure Store Treatise (Studies in East Asian Buddhism)","review":"The author, a respected Buddhologist specializing in East Asia, has conducted a solid inquiry into the nature of the Chinese cultural environment that produced the _Baozang lun_, or _Treasure Store Treatise_.

Whether the writer uses a pencil and legal pad, typewriter, word processor, or clay tablet, good English is good English.

I would say this is the first time I see a practical example of use of reflection at this level in many years of developing Web applications.The book is clearly not for begginners. Without having a good grsp of C# concepts such as: abstract object oriented programming and .NET Reflections, this book it would turn to be a waste of time.

They are a family that enjoys life, and life gets even better for Molly when her sister/best friend, Beth, moves to town with her husband and four children. But things take a turn for the worse for the Campbells when, Wendy and Rip Porter, Joey's biological parents, decide they want their son back.Most of the chapters in this book are lengthy; sometimes including way more information that I thought was necessary. However, the story did evoke emotions; especially when Joey had to visit his biological parents. I felt so bad for the child, but, just like Joey, I was also comforted by the truth that God was with him."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"I could give a good revue of all of Karen Kingsbury books but this one was particularly touching. I am sure that all adoptiveparents have the fear that the child they are raising could be taken back someday by the birth parents. In this case thebirth father was a cruel and heartless man. The birth mother showed her generous love for her son by finding a wayto let the adoptive parents continue to have custody of the little boy."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"A very emotional story.

Sometimes books and the movies made of them are not totally the same."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"Anger. Love. Hope. A faith tested. Trust in God. Family. That is what this book is about. It is an adoption story that really captures your heart. Ms. Kingsbury brings a little bit of her life(the adoption process) to her story. She brings the love and trusting in God.In this story, it is a battle between two mothers: one biological, one adoptive. The biological mother is an abusive relationship and that is why she gave her baby up for adoption in the first place. While the biological father is in jail she has the baby and gives him up for adoption. The new family is in love with this child and loves him with all their being, as if he was born to them naturally. The biological father is outraged when he is released from jail and since the biological mother forged the fathers signature on the adoption papers they try to get the boy back. The adoptive parents are heartbroken,wondering why God would allow this, but they only want what is best for the child so they reluctantly hand the child over. They are devastated but they but it in gods hands, knowing that if they put it is His hands the outcome will be what it should be.This story will make you smile, it will make you cry, but more importantly it will teach you the meaning of FAMILY and TRUSTING IN GOD! It will really make you feel like you are in the story, holding the little boys hands, blowing on the Dandelion and making wishes, and hugging all the characters!Good work, Ms. Kingsbury!"},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"I did not know this was a Christian book and was disappointed with all the references. Also, felt the characters were not well developed and the entire story was expected and boring."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"A trailer for the movie looked interesting so I made the mistake of buying the book without researching the author. \\"Inspirational author\\" is an understatement. I was pulled in by Jack Campbell's realistic, non-religious viewpoint and I thought it would run throughout the book as they faced the awful dilemma of losing their son. But the religious preaching overwhelmed the story and Jack proved to be weak and simple-minded. The book is cheap propaganda. Stating that \\"all children need to go to church\\" is pathetic. The story is implausible and undeveloped, with a blatant implication that a god saved them all. And the scene in the movie trailer which caused me to buy the book never occurred. The book was very disappointing and a waste of money."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"Marvelous!

However, this book and another I picked off of Amazon recently hit me like a rock with religious fervor from the first chapter:\\"Molly looked at Joey now, golden-haired, his eyes adoringly on Jack as they considered the options at the pop machine. What they had was fine, wasn't it? They believed in God, in a distant sort of way. What harm was there in finding Him at a lake instead of in a few? Besides, they already had everything they needed.\\"I can just tell exactly where this story is going to go, and the sacharine-sweet religious moral that this story is going to hand me. Why am I so clueless about picking up on the \\"Christian Fiction\\" tag?

Within the first few pages I was drawn into the story, that I couldn't put the book down and finished it in 1 day! Karen Kingsbury captured the essence of each character and I felt as though I was present during each scene. This book brings up that one main topic that I stuggle with from time to time \\"why can't I see God's plan, and has he foresaken me?\\" Thank you Karen for sharing."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"I enjoy reading fiction with a Christian theme, but don't like to be hit over the head with the message. What I enjoy about Ms. Kingsbury is that she is able to weave the message through the story in a way that is effective, but not so strident that she loses the average reader. This book is no exception.I found nothing contrived about the storyline - people do lose custody of children as old as Joey, and it's heartbreaking for all concerned. I particularly liked the character of Allyson, the social worker, who while being forced by the \\"system\\" to follow the letter of the law also exhibited a sense of what was right and wrong. So many times the social workers are portrayed as non-caring bureaucrats.I found every element of this story to be plausible, up to and including the ending. I enjoyed how Ms. Kingsbury built up to the conclusion, although it was certainly not a huge surprise. There is nothing that I would change about this book (big of me, I know!), and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good summer read with a nice, gentle Christian message."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"As a parent of an adopted child, I did think that the book was realistically presented.

For the next four years Jack, Molly and Joey live a delightful loving life together in Palm Beach that includes her sister Beth, her brother-in-law Bill and their son Jonah, who is Joey's best friend.Feeling guilt Wendy informs Rip after his release from prison what she did. He persuades her he has changed and they demand custody of Joey claiming fraud. Social worker Allyson Bower agrees with the Porters and a court rules they have custody. Joey is removed from the nurturing of the Campbells to the Ohio home of the Porters where Wendy sees first hand her mistake as Rip remains an angry raging person. Joey though in fear prays to God just like his cousin taught him and finds comfort with the Lord's presence even in the violent Porter home.Using complex social issues involving parental rights, Karen Kingsbury provides a deep inspirational family drama with a strong cast of characters whose moral dilemmas seem very real. Readers will appreciate little Joey as he comforts his adopted mom, his biological mom, and even his aunt with his youthful belief that God will take care of him and them. Rip is abusive and violent and obviously bad for his son but despite this angry man, fans who appreciate a well written exciting inspirational tale based on realistic social values and issues will want to read LIKE DANDELION DUST, a sort of religious take on Taking Isaiah.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"I love Karen Kingsbury, but this book was so \\"cutesy\\". I felt it was more on a child's level than adult. I did resent the little boy's prayers ending in Gee his name. (for Jesus' name) Any little child I know can say it better than that.

While I do tend to think her writing can be a bit extra nice, I commend her for not using certain language just to be main stream. I read this book a few years back when it first came out and really connected with it more than some of her other books because it touched a nerve of the reality of adoption. It is true that situations can arise where a child is returned to the biological parents due to loop holes and errors - what a horrible experience for all parties. What I genuinely thought was unique about this storyline was that as a reader you end up rooting for both sets of parents in different ways. I am glad it ended the way it did but I was left a little sorry for the parents who he did not end up with because either way there was pain and suffering.

It would make me want to make absolutely sure that what happens in \\"Like Dandelion Dust\\" could never happen to me if I adopted any children. The book is provocative in another way: it makes you ask yourself, \\"Would I take such drastic measures if I were in the adoptive parents' situation?\\" Like most of Karen Kingsbury's books, this one hooks you and keeps you turning the pages. My only complaint is that like most of Kingsbury's child characters, the little boy in this book is just too unbelievably cute and perfect.

Kingsbury performs masterfully, taking us inside the thoughts and feelings of her characters, pressing us deeper into faith in God, especially through the eyes of a four-year-old boy.

YES, it happens very often.

But trust me, you will love this book for so many reasons."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"Neither this book's cover nor the copy on the back enthused me to read it. I'm a guy and am drawn most to books that promise some excitement, whether that be through physical action or (preferably) a mind-thumping, heart-racing thriller. So this book sat on my desk for two weeks and I regarded it much as I might have a vulture that was sitting there, rasping, \\"Read me.\\" I wound up taking it to Boy Scout camp (I was a sponsor) where I ...read it in one day!! In fact, I almost finished it before lunch.Now, some people make a determination between writers and storytellers. Those who do so generally praise writers more. I prefer a good storyteller, myself; because good writing--even great writing--doesn't hold my interest if there's no story there. Kingsbury is a simple writer and a GREAT storyteller. (Notice: I didn't say \\"but a great writer\\"; to write simply is a gift many writers don't have--and which modern publishing sometimes frowns on.)The StoryMolly and Jack Campbell have everything. Great house in a fancy neighborhood, high-paying job, and a beautiful little boy named Joey. Things just absolutely couldn't get any better.Until it's discovered that Joey's birth mother forged the signature of Joey's birth father, so the adoption was a fraud. Joey has never known anyone else as his parents, but suddenly he's being thrust into a volatile household of people he's never met and, especially, a father who doesn't know how to show love without violence.Molly and Jack begin to explore every option they have for keeping Joey, even some fraud of their own. Hovering around the edges of all this drama is God. Joey believes in Him, Joey's cousins believe in Him, even Molly and Jack claim to believe that there is a god, but will they trust him to work this out? Can they give up their son to save their son?The WritingAs I stated above, Karen Kingsbury is a great storyteller. After my initial reaction to the cover, discovering what was on the inside was like going to a restaurant that appears to serve only your least favorite food, only to discover they make your favorite dish to perfection.Like a good meal, I walked away not just satisfied, but happy. I was pleased with how the story had carried me along and how it had been resolved."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"Like Dandelion Dust by Karen Kingsbury is a fabulously written story. Jack and Molly Campbell have the perfect life with their adopted son Joey. Until Joey's biological father Rip decides he wants his son back, and the courts agree with him. How far will Jack and Molly go to protect their son from his abusive father? I hadn't read anything by Kingsbury before, and I now sincerely regret that decision. She knows how to craft a story filled with emotion and drama without going into melodrama or stereotypical characters. Her descriptions of characters' actions make each scene come alive in a way few authors can. I was moved to tears at least twice during the book. And while the book has a Christian message, it's never pounded down the reader's throat, but the way God affects each person by the end of the story is profound. This is a deep emotional novel with the message that God is in control, and we need to have the faith of a child to trust him."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"I just got done reading this book. I knew that I wouldn't be able to put it down when I started. That's the way it is with all Kingsbury books but I wasn't ready for this one. Wow- it was so great.

Have plenty of Kleenex ready."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"I'm a devoted Karen Kingsbury fan. I've read many of her books and loved them all. All but this one. While it still has her wonderful writing and deep characters, the overall feeling of the book is depressing. It's heavy ... dark. Yes, it has a happy ending, but it's slower than her other books.Digging deep into the psyche of the characters, she portrays them well, but I found myself skimming and turning pages to get to the action. Will I read another Kingsbury book? You bet.

I knew what was going to happen at the end of the book from the very beginning, which really ruined it for me. i think the author over-explained and repeated the characters thoughts too much as well. overall it was not a good book, i wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"Let me start by saying this is my first Karen Kingsbury novel. It won't be my last. I found that Karen has an amazing ability to bring the reader on an emotional roller-coaster ride. It was equisite the way she made me cry and even the feelings of love, joy and grief that crept up as I read this book.The writing itself was unobtrusive so that the characters took center stage. It was a dark story with a heavy feel but that did not put me off at all. Life is sometimes dark and I like that Ms. Kingsbury didn't sugar-coat it.I took mental notes as I read this work and hopefully some of her ability to evoke an emotional response in readers will rub off on me.I recommend Like Dandelion Dust. From what I've heard this is one of her heavier novels but very well written and absolutely worth a read in my opinion."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"Molly and Jack Campbell lead an idyllic life - they enjoy a loving, compassionate marriage; Jack has a great job, they've enjoyed the perks of his business success without being swallowed by the \\"corporate monster\\", they drive an Acura SUV, and have a loving son in Joey - a gift from heaven above, an adoption that's allowed them to have everything they've ever wanted in life.The icing on the cake: they've just moved to Florida to live with Molly's sister and life-long friend Beth and her family. Though Beth has gotten a little \\"preachy\\" in the last couple years as she and her husband Bill get more and more serious about their \\"God Thing\\", Molly is looking forward to meshing their families - a bright future of walks in the park, weekend picnics and family adventures on the lake.If only she could get Beth to stop harping about church and an intimate relationship with God and enjoy the ride. After all, they have the best life could possibly give them - what more could God possibly give?Several states away in Ohio, however, Wendy Porter - abused, victimized birth mother of Joey - trembles in both excitement and fearful anticipation at the release of her husband Rick from prison, after his arrest for assaulting her several years before. She has good reason to be excited: Rick claims to have found \\"religion\\", given up the booze, and has taken anger management classes, promising her a whole new world and a brand new Rick.She has good reason to be fearful, though, for she's hid both her pregnancy and adoption from Rick these past years. What will be his reaction when he realizes she not only kept the truth from him, but forged his name on the adoption papers - what will happen to the \\"brand new Rick\\" then?Along the way, she begins to rethink her decision to give up her only son - what would she do for a chance to have him back in her life again, and at what cost? Her prayers are miraculously answered when a judge renders the adoption invalid, ruling that permanent custody of Joey must revert back to she and Rick.However - doubt plagues her heart. Has Rick really changed? Will he be a danger to Joey, and is the boy - who loves his adoptive parents fiercely, with utter devotion - truly be better off with them?And what about the Campbells? They are devastated, their perfect lives destroyed in an instant. No ruling can change the fact that in their hearts, Joey belongs to them.What will they do? What lengths will they go to keep Joey by their side, how low will they sink before the finally approach the God they've ignored for so long?Like Dandelion Dust, by Karen Kingsbury, is a well-told, emotional tale that is heart-wrenching, especially for any parent or anyone who has worked in child protective services. Kingsbury pulls all the right strings, and the plot - thought somewhat standard - is one you can't help but be engaged by. It's like an experienced bowler setting up a 7-10 split - a can't miss in the sentimental department.There are few plot holes in the Campbell's scheme to keep Joey from their birth parents - who themselves faded from the limelight over the course of the novel - and Rick Porter is too firmly placed in the \\"accepted role\\" of an alcoholic, abusive husband who is just a bad person, and not someone struggling against terrible inner demons, which would've been a little more interesting and realistic.Also, while the set-up of the emotional tone is one that can't miss, the \\"set-up\\" for the \\"no matter how good our lives are, we'll need God someday\\" plot-line is a little too obvious for my tastes. The Campbell's lives are just a little too good, presenting the obvious foil that something \\"bad\\" is going to happen to them, making them want to turn to Christ. It works, but there are just tons of Lifetime Channel and Pax movies that read just like this.Though the ending is somewhat anti-climactic, the writing is good and transcends certain stale plot points. Like Dandelion Dust is a novel best read with tissue box near, and after finishing, the first thing you'll want to do is grab that dear \\"little one\\" in your life, give them a big hug, tell them that you love them, and thank God for the big AND small things He's done in your life.4 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"This was one of the books that I picked up on our trip to the Border's that was closing.

As an adoptive mom and a former foster-mom so much of what this book is about is very true.Like Dandelion DustThe adoptions laws have changed so much in the last years that some states allow bio-parents up to 6 months to change their minds. Even though this is a fiction book, I could not help but think about the cases I know where the bio-parents did get the baby back, after the adoptive parents believed child was theirs for ever and ever. This book had a wonderful ending and I am happy it did, as many, many adoptions do end that way. In fact more end happy than sad. Karen is a wonderful author and I love every book she has written. Her words flow directly from God to her and then we have the privilege of reading her words in the form of a book. We are blessed."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"This is one of my favorite books by Karen Kingsbury apart from the Baxter series. I loved reading about how the Campbells dealt with the drama of almost losing their adopted son. I would have done the same exact thing if someone had tried to take my child away from me. I love how the characters in Karen Kingsbury's books deal with everyday situations that real people deal with every day. I feel that I learn so much about life and myself when I read one of her books."},{"Title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"There are already thorough reviews about the plot, so I won't go into that. Just adding my comments about Kingsbury's writing.At first, I thought, this is a 4, because I couldn't really think of anything that wrong with it. It kept my attention, produced characters that are interesting as well as a storyline. I've said before, I think Kingsbury is a good writer, not a brilliant writer. As another reviewer her for this book (Samuel B Tuttle), stated that she is \\"a simple writer and a great storyteller\\" (but not a great writer.) I think this is aptly put, and that's exactly why I like Kingsbury novels. The writing doesn't really have to be of the highest caliber to make good reading; I have to remind myself how hard it would be to write a novel like this, be it that or not.If you're not into Christian fiction or similar genre you might say this is not a good book. It all depends on what you're interested in. Looking at it strictly on whether or not it's a good story, I think it is. If you're looking at it for highest caliber of writing, then I would give it a 3.I would like to see her write about characters that don't always have to be rich, beautiful or powerful. Her characters often seem stereotypical. Example in the book being Rip. I know he was a drunken hothead, but still, would he really not try harder to behave himself for a couple of visits not amounting to more than an overnight stay? To abuse the boy physically and verbally the first time he saw him I don't find believable. But I think the emotions and feelings and everything about how the parents felt about their son being taken from them were very well conveyed."},{"Title":"Selected Political Writings (Roots of the Right : Readings in Fascist, Racist and Elitist Ideology)","review":"As philosophy:This work is fairly bad to mediocre, at best.First off, the entire work's pet theory of the degeneration of bloodlines has been rendered ridiculous by genentics, in hindsight.Putting that aside though, reading Gobineau is painful in the same way Marx is. He sees everything through a very narrow lens. The thing that absolutely kills me is that just when he's finally coming up with an interesting idea, his crazy pet theory on the degeneration of the blood of races pops back up. He actually raises some good ideas regarding why civilizations fall and whether nature rather than nurture plays a role. He also has a few good points regarding the ridiculousness of descriptive equality (which as is noted in the intro forced political theorists towards \\"moral exhortation\\" and away from descriptivism). These points are few and far between, though.Expect lots of post hoc reasoning on precisely who had more aryan blood (whoever did the conquering had it, of course), generalized racism, mingled with hysterical bitterness over Gobineau's social position and cherrypicked history lessons designed to prove a point, though not very well. Early on, for instance G cites the Aztecs to prove that fanaticism can't destroy an empire (though they were fanatical when civilization fell, right? and others couldn't question the wisdom of the god-king right?).Another ideologue. Kind of like reading anything Marx wrote after 1844. Occassionally the guy will have an idea, but instead of inexplicably connecting it to the class struggle, it's about the regeneration or vitiation of blood lines.For a philosophy of history, read Spengler or Hegel.As History:This edition works really well. I'd recommend it. It's one of the few good primary sources heavily in use during the nazi era besides Mein Kampf and tends to be difficult to find in reliable scholarly editions. The introduction, while somewhat overly apologetic, nicely contextualizes the work. It also breaks up the work into selections, which makes for easier reading and reference. Of particular interest, IMO is section 7. In something I found very odd, given Wagner and Hitler's subsequent love of G - G likes Jewish folks. A lot. I'm not being sarcastic. I suppose Hitler must've skipped that section.This book is an invaluable primary source in terms of understanding Nazi Era Germany.Conclusion:So, in short, my review is mixed. If you're looking at this historically and curious where the nazis got some of their ideas from, it's great and it's not as long-winded, grandiose and wildly irrational as Rosenberg (one of the other major popular sources of ideology). If you're concerned about racism, you might want to at least read the introduction - most of these same notions continue to pop up in modern society. You should be able to rebut them.To everyone else, Gobineau's writing and ideas are pretty awful, frequently illogical, utterly dated, and I'd avoid it. It's painful to read. The author is boring and long-winded and inclined to connect everything to his pet theory. Even the racist nutjob set will probably be disappointed. As I mentioned previously, G. likes Jewish folks."},{"Title":"Love","review":"There are some readers, the editors of this volume for instance, who would like to reduce this astonishing book to an expression of Stendhal's love for an untouchable woman. Anyone willing to look a little beyond armchair psychology will find a work that is possibly the first 'Pale Fire'. On the surface the work is a philosophical and scientific discourse on the nature of love, and as such it has so much truth and insight that I urge you to give it to your loved one so that he/she might understand you a little better. But this treatise is a translation from the inchoate notes left by an Italian suicide, Lisio Visconti. It is full of anecdotes, stories, digressions, contradictions, repetitions, ellipses, declamations. The writer's objectivity, Kinbote-like, is continually undermined by his obvious madness, his reminiscences of a failed love affair, and that of a friend, Salviati, who may also be Visconti. This textual instability is a constant, playful joy, and perfectly mirrors the difficulties of the book's subject."},{"Title":"Love","review":"Love by Stendhal is a classic, but the marvel about this book is that you get to experience the thoughts of this Nineteenth Century genius, whose love and obsession for a woman - Metilde - drives him to write this detailed and extremely insightful explanation about the passions and obsessions involved in romantic love. Without the assistance of Modern Psychology, Stendhal is able to explain with surprising precision and insight the feelings we experience when we are in love and the causes for such feelings. Anyone interested in understanding romantic love should read this masterpiece. Stendhal is honest, objective, and realistic ... despite being horribly brokenhearted."},{"Title":"Love","review":"This is Stendhal's analysis of Love. It was allegedly written because of his unrequited love for a woman named Methilde Dembowski. He analyzes in the work the kinds of Love , and the stages of Love. The work contains many aphorisms of great insight and beauty. For Stendhal one kind of Love the love he is afflicted with is a romantic love which is a kind of Madness. In the first part of the book he analyzes this kind of Love.In the second part of the book he analyzses different national types in relation to Love, finding the French lacking and the Italians more successful.This is a ' classic work' but in my reading of it it lacks the depth I sense is required to give a more convincing and comprehensive explanation of that Passion which makes us most human."},{"Title":"Love","review":"Stendhal spent a lot of time thinking about courtship, romance, and love. He spent a lot of time observing it. He spent a lot of time writing about it. How much personal experience or success he had, apart from one big rejection, is unclear. The one concept he may be most noted for is the \\"crystalization\\" which occurs after an initial period of dating when doubt, fear, and uncertainty about the love object occur. According to him, this process is necessary to compel lovers together to quell those very doubts. It is a mental process in which the beloved is idealized to an extreme degree. Apart from this, many of his musings seem quite dated as they are nearly 200 years old, and relationships between men and women have been affected by modern culture, feminism, etc. Apart from this, one conclusion that can be drawn is that there is too little love and that this part of human experience is mostly underdeveloped. This is probably so here in the U.S."},{"Title":"Love","review":"This is a hymn to the loftiest among all volitions. Only someone who has loved and who has suffered would be capable of making discoveries of such a sublime order. The beautiful anecdotes with which this highly philosophical treatise is sprinkled, only serve to enhance the profundity of this work. But this book is much more than a hymn to love. Reminiscent of a physician, Stendhal endeavours to comprehend the anatomy of love. And if love be a disease, Stendhal succeeds in laying bare its aetiology better than all our contemporary psychologists combined. But the hopelessly poignant thing is that this is the sole disease that man willingly embraces. This Stendhal knew. After all, he contracted the disease himself. To Stendhal, no less than to Meister Eckhart and Novalis, there is a higher love. Stendhal, with his almost scholastic penchant for distinctions, is careful to remind us that this higher love is not a mannered or gentlemanly love. This higher love is verily a passionate love, but it must needs be distinguished from physical love. \\"Some sensitive women\\", says Stendhal, \\"are almost unaware of the idea of physical pleasure\\", yet for these women, \\"the raptures of passionate love have practically effaced the memory of bodily delights.\\" And \\"such people [...] have a knowledge of pleasures utterly inaccessible to those moved only by vanity or money.\\" The crude-minded may well accuse Stendhal of presenting his readers with a chimera. But that would not have bothered a great mind like Stendhal in the least: \\"I am writing for a mere hundred readers. If you have never suffered from the weakness of the strong and are not in the unnatural habit of thinking while you read, this book will rouse your anger against its author.\\""},{"Title":"Love","review":"Although sex, love, and reproduction can be differentially manifest they derive from a common causal nexus. By examining the behavior of love Stendhal indirectly addresses the conscious mode of sex and reproduction. Unlike the pagan attitudes toward love of many before him and as observed in modern times, Stendhal's love is well dressed, well mannered, honest, quixotic, honorable, and implausible,...yet witty, saucy, importunate, irrational, and realistically disastrous; quixotic I think being the rubric term. Indeed, the book reads like a serially condensed version of Cervantes' encounters between the true hearted lads and lasses of 'Don Quixote.' Stendhal even goes so far as to recommend Cervantes in Lisio Visconti's list of literature. In this book you will essentially get the following:I). Stendhal's psychology of love, in which the stages of hormone poisoning and its concomitant cognitions are delineated. Within this framework he introduces his neologism 'crystalization;' i. e., as in how a plain twig, when left in a salt mine for some time, is pulled up covered with stunning, perfect crystals: these crystals representing the amplifications and embellishments the lover's mind dresses their object in. Stendhal goes on quite a bit regarding feminine pride, showing blatant respect and reverence for his objects of desire, but lamenting such foibles as false modesty, insipid prosaism, and vanity love.II). This section reads like a cultural travelogue of love for western Europe from the early 19th century. Here love is a ruse used to chronicle what he sees as regional stereotypes of behavior. His self-deprecating dislike of all things French and antipodal regard for all things Italian pervades his cross-cultural mind set. As a Frenchman Stendhal only accepts the 12th century chivalry of Provence. This section of the book also evidences his strong advocacy of women's rights (although he does recommend life imprisonment for adulterous wives), and his excellent psychological juxtapose of Don Juan and Werther.III). The fragments are probably the weakest part of the book but they add texture and pace. As the introduction by Stewart and Knight suggest, the fragments are an attempt to weave objective credibility into Stendhal's otherwise lugubrious pining over Mathilde Viscontini Dembowski.IV). The appendixes are an interesting anecdotage containing chaplain Andre's 31 articles of love from the 12th century French court, and further elucidation of crystallization and it's advent in the salt mines of Salzburg. Here the book ends with two engaging tales, the near pedophilic chivalry of Philippe Astezan, and the vanity love of Felicie Feline.Overall, Stendhal is lugubriously Quixotic, wittily irreligious, and insouciantly saucy. He captures a mixture of Laclos' intrigues, Plato's daemon of the Phaedrus, and Montaigne's candor. A dated but highly original work."},{"Title":"Love","review":"This is the finest and most illuminating book on a subject of universal interest. Stendhal probably gets certain things wrong (I think the claim that \\"crystallization\\" only produces illusion is oversimple--it creates a peculiar vantage point, which makes some things easier to see, and other things harder to see) but he gets so many things right, and has so little competition, that this book has to be a must read, a classic, for anyone who cares at all about romantic love at some point in their life... that is, everyone."},{"Title":"Love","review":"the tedium of stendhal's love. the majority of sentences in the first book reads like maxims. a couple of sentences chosen at random: \`you might say that by some strange quirk of the heart, your beloved communicates more charm to her surroundings than she herself possesses. ... the man whose heart has leapt at the glimpse of his beloved's white satin hat in the distance is surprised at his own indifference to the greatest society beauty.' sentence after sentence linked together within the text without warning and until the reader is staring at a chained link fence. ont to say that stendhal is not the maximist la rochefoucauld or montaigne, two writers he quotes, were, although his reflections are much too melancholic. and he uses footnotes and attacks opinions of his day, taking the political personal and then generalizing the personal in a manner all too obscure that his anecdotes drown in a thick sludge of tedium. and to make matters worse, he assembles his material in the form of the kama sutra, we get alchemic recipes concerning love. some of the chapter headings: concerning the birth of love, concerning hope, concerning the different beginnings of love for the two sexes, concerning infatuation, concerning thunderbolts, concerning modesty, concerning glances, concerning feminine pride, concerning jealousy, cures for love.love sent me scurrying back to nietzsche who loved stendhal. nietzsche referred to stendhal as one of europe's greatest voices, one of its greatest spirits. it's easy, if one takes the time, to read how nietzsche was influenced by stendhal beyond making death of god remarks (that stendhal made such remarks first poured a little envy into nietzsche's ichors), his love of the french arts and of maxims and, the later nietzsche, troubling political and religious statements.unlike nietzsche, stendhal's gifts lay in storytelling. still there's the feeling that the nietzsche most influenced by stendhal was affected by the stendhal of love, and nietzsche's work casts light on stendhal's shadowy love.even without the light of nietzsche, it must be remembered love is a collection grown from unrequited love, the source of melancholia. and what begins as a joyful wisdom, falls flat. love had been in the shadows of lawrence sterne's brilliance.things pick up considerably in book two with glimmers of the stendhal of the red and the black, with a nod toward the charterhouse of parma. even those sterne shadows begin to fade when stendhal moves toward a concern of love in different climates. love flourishes better in hot climates, he says, than in cold climates, with the exception of switzerland of where stendhal's anecdotes read like the original farmer's daughter jokes. nor is the united states spared, of our national innocence (before playboy, porn internet and high profile political adulteries and church sex scandals) stendhal wrote: \`... we see that the americans, without the misfortunes of governments, feel themselves to be lacking in something. it is as though the springs of sensitiveness had dried up in these people; they are rational, but they are not at all happy. ... there is such a habit of reason in the united states that the crystallization of love there has become impossible.'in book one, stendhal developed a phenomena, a principle, of what he called \`crystallization', as a metaphor of love from an activity at the salt mines of salzburg, where \`they throw a leafless wintry bough into one of the abandoned workings. two or three months later they haul it out covered with a shining deposit of crystals. the smallest twig, no bigger than a tom-tit's claw, is studded with a galaxy of scintillating diamonds. The original branch is no longer recognizable.' what stendhal calls \`crystallization is a mental process of the perfection of the loved one.' an interesting and often amusing philosophy, until he becomes overly sententious. and much of the book is amusing and urbane.the appendices, if you get that far (the often tedious text, rather compact at less than 275 pages, john updike referred to as \`long'), are not to be skipped. the salzburg bough, ernestine, and an example of love can stand alone as short stories or, if true, anecdotes."},{"Title":"Love","review":"This is an incomparable work of beauty, inspiration and genius"},{"Title":"Puzzled Programmers: 15 Mind-Boggling Story Puzzles to Test Your Programming Prowess : Solutions in Basic, Pascal, and C","review":"I can't speak for professional programmers, but Puzzled Programmers is a great book for us duffers in the programming world. It contains 15 puzzles of increasing difficulty, held together by a surprisingly interesting narrative about programmers and a tech writer at a Silicon Valley company in the 80's. The puzzles, which would be difficult, if not impossible, to solve by hand, are intended to be solved by computer. The puzzle for the reader is to write a program that solves the puzzle.The book is a bit dated, having been written in 1987. The answers are given in Pascal, BASIC, and C. The benchmarks for run times are for an 8 Mhz CPU. But that doesn't matter. The challenge is in analysing the puzzle and developing an algorithm to solve it. How that algorithm gets fed to the computer is of secondary importance.All but one of the puzzles deal with recreational number theory. For example, find the smallest integer that is the sum of two cubes in two different ways. The odd one out involves the computation of a probability. The solutions get progressively longer, but number 15 is only about a hundred lines of code in BASIC. Most are much shorter.If you like puzzles and learned to program, but never get to do it, this books for you."},{"Title":"Dunkirk.","review":"End of May 1940 and the German Panzer columns have reached the channel. The BEF along with one French Army and the Belgian Army are cut off from the rest of France by an armored corridor. The British and French try to break through and reconnect but cannot. The British finally realize that their small army needed for the protection of England might be in jeopardy and the war lost. The Belgian Army collaspes and Britain pulls back to the Dunkirk enclave where they try to extricate their forces. Jackson writes about the military aspects of this operation from a British perspective. He tells of the gallant withdrawl and the land, sea, and air operations that resulted in the saving of over 200,000 British and French troops. This was certainly a costly operation but it resulted in saving the British Army.This is a nice short book about the Dunkirk operation. This is an entirely British perspective, as only one German pilot had his opinions stated in the book. It also tells of the SS murder of British prisoners.This is as good a book as Walter Lord's book. A nice read."},{"Title":"Dunkirk.","review":"Five stars for this work on \`The Miracle of Dunkirk' for the following reasons:# This work is concise and succinct while also managing to cram in a bunch of detail. This is not a work designed to be pored over by students at Sandhurst. It eschews minutia and much of the niceties of military nomenclature and just tells the story. Which makes it a great read for the layman and for those with an overarching interest in military affairs but for whom a deeper study of every aspect of the campaign is not on the agenda.# The book is flowing and manages to intertwine the gravity of the military situation with the gravity of the political situation. Both fields are dealt with and in fact they complement each other very well and show how difficult it can be for the machinations of nations to keep up with the highly fluid nature of open warfare. Some of the personalities involved come out smelling better than others.# Even handedness is a difficult thing to achieve in the sphere of military history. Here it is handled by merely telling the story. The merits of nations are left to the side and it's the merits of the actions of the people and troops involved that is given more time. This humanises the work and is in my opinion one of the reasonsfor this book being such a breezy read.# Maps are supplied which aid the reader. Perhaps there could have been a few more of them but there are enough for the reader to be able to follow proceedings. A selected bibliography at the end is useful for those wanting to explore further.A fine work if you take it for how it was meant."},{"Title":"Dunkirk.","review":"I remember first reading this book in college back when I was a youngster. Robert Jackson's book was so visceral! It was almost like I was there at the front lines with those troops in 1940, decades and decades before I was born.The French and British Allied forces are detailed thoroughly, as are the Germans to a lesser extant. The German Wehrmacht was incredible! So mobile and tactically thorough, one wonders what would have happened had they not invaded Soviet Union in 1941 and instead concentrated all the rest of their forces in the Afrika Korps in North Africa. They very well may have driven the British out of Africa and with the Soviet Union mollified, guarding their eastern flank, Germany and Italy could have consolidated their gains, perhaps even linking up with their Japanese Axis partners in the Indian Ocean thus threatening British controlled India. But these are just alternative scenarios best looked at elsewhere.The German point of view is not discussed overmuch in this book, which I feel is a mistake. Aside from hapless pilot Erich von Oelhaven, forced to bail out of his shot down Dornier DO-17, the first hand opinions of the Germans are rarely mentioned. This is only a slight quibble, however, as the first-hand point of views expressed by British troops run the gamut; one will truly enjoy them.I wish they would write more books about the onset of World War II before American entry into the war. The American point of view always tends to be biased in favor of United States instead of looking at the big picture and discussing all points of view from the good, the bad and the ugly perpetrated by all sides in this horrendous war.This book is a Four and a Half-Star book, so I rounded it up. Jackson's research and interviews are spot on and nourishes a book that should be on every military historian's shelf. I own two, a hardcover and a softcover.

I believe that the author probably has more of a practical grounding in NN's than most given his experience in the defence industry. I also have Rogers' book, Looney (Pattern Recognition Using NN's) and Masters second book. Sure the code in this is not OO but it is probably the most readable C you will ever get in a book, easy to compile and I didn't find many errors in the compilation (Borland CBuilder, GCC) however I did keep getting errors in Rogers' code (not declaring variables (CBuilder) ). If you can understand C you can read the code and understand NN's. The description of annealing is better than most geostatistical texts.As mentioned by others, running the programs takes a bit of working out and this is the main defficiency I find. Looney's and Rogers' books are more academic and I find slightly harder to follow. Rogers' introduces a description language for NN's which I didn't find useful. I find it easier to read the code and each chapter and that has given me a reasonable understanding of NN's.Looney and Rogers' cover different algorithms. Rogers' OO approach is good. I have used Looneys RBFLN and it works well for my applications.My interest in NN's is practical applications in the earth sciences and my reading/interest is based around this.

A practical intro with plenty of readable source.If people think the theory side is a bit light,they're ofcourse right, but that is exactly what the author intended to do.This book delivers on what it promises,no more no less.You can actually get to work after reading it ;)I would for instance recommend \\"Bishop, Neural networks for pattern recognition\\" to get a more solid foundation,(which admittedly is not a bad idea). All in all worth every penny/dollar/euro."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"There is a wave of present computing subjects that passes and leaves promising work buried in its wake when it is too advanced for current thinking and technology to make it catch on. The stealth fighter concept was buried in the Russian radar modeling theory of the 70's. Locheed engineers spotted it and produced the SR-71, B2, and the F-22 using this information. Modeling of extended gun barrel range enhancements(HAARP) allowed a researcher to develop a very large gun that would inject payloads into low earth orbit in the 1980's. Blumburg Capitol has been working on stock market predictors and has built several supercomputer clusters to give them the edge in rapid technical analysis of the market using GPUs. This book is one of those passed over knowledge treasures that has been forgotten by our demands for the latest and greatest entertainment. There is subtle treasure here for researchers.If you want to know the kind of computing engines that they are using to find solutions, perhaps even yours, then read&#34;Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++&#34;. The book introduces several different approaches to neural computing( think parallel here ) that can inspire you to find a solution within the book to your computing needs. The price to look is just the cost of shipping. If you want to save some typing then buy the complete version( with floppy ) for about $130. If your time is worth anything, you will buy them both and reap the benefits of years of research.Now for the downside. This book was written in the early days of C++ and the author's skills lie in his research, not his programming skills. The C++ is written as though it is in C, the classes are elementary at best and OOD is not in these works. There is no working website source for eratta and followup development. The material in this book requires a kind of programming archaeology to reconstruct the thinking of the researcher. Nevertheless, you are given a glimpse of how to train your program to spot emerging trends and get your target predictors to work much better than they have before. Here is another hint, since these learning models are similar to the design of the( insert your species here ) brain, you may recognize your own decision patterns in these models. So, you can design a better working brain for yourself using these models. This kind of computing is for the advanced programmer and altering the models to meet your requirements is going to take weeks to months.Einstein said, &#34;Inspiration is better than intelligence&#34;. Here is where you can find that inspiration. So, if you want to spot that emerging business deal, the 'stock of the month', vacation deals, or the best approach to that girl you wanted to impress, take a look at these contents. This book contains the way to build decision makers that can bypass emotional bias, cultural blindness, and faddish nonsense. It's going to take some work. But, If you want to get that edge on the future of almost anything that can be measured, then I recommend that you read this book."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"I am just starting to learn neural networks, and this book hit the spot. It is not overloaded with math, and its approach is very practical and well suited for programmers/engineers that want to start working with neural networks. I would recommend this book to anyone that has a background in computer science or engineering and wants to learn how to apply neural networks."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"This book isn't for a beginner. There're many good beginner's book for NN (or general AI), but this book delves into a bit more detail, and requires careful reading and understanding to appreciate the book.I have given negative review for this book in the past. What I want at that time was a quick reading and code. This book is not like that. You have to have some basic knowledge in AI (at least read any introductory book once) to understand it.I highly recommend this book for any one just got bored with introductory books on AI."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"This book is exactly as advertised. Other excellent books on Neural Networks will have you buried in mathematical notation that will challenge even readers with some statistics background and a couple of semesters of Calculus. These books are definitely worth your while if you can handle the math, but even then, translating these books from theories to solving real problems is no easy feat. By contrast, this book presents a good introduction to basic feedforward neural networks that is very readable to users with a moderate math background, and probably readable with some effort for motivated readers with limited math. You can read this book and come away with a reasonable understanding of how a feedforward network functions. Still, that's not even the strength of this book.Not only is this book &quot;practical&quot; in the sense that it is readable, it is practical in that it tackles a host of additional topics necessary for using a neural network in the real world. It discusses annealing and genetic techniques for avoiding local minima. It discusses singular value decomposition for avoiding problems with redundant inputs. It discusses the best ways of building training sets and preparing input data, as well as ways of evaluating the performance of networks and attaching confidence measures. It would be easy to charge right in, use a neural network as a black box, give it a dataset and train it, and then wait for it to pop answers out. The only problem is, this will yield results that are worthless in the real world. All of these concerns have to be addressed to build a model that can actually be used for something.I was very happy with the code base included with this book as well. In addition to a neural network using conjugate gradient descent (as well as Kohonen learning), code is integrated into the main program for annealing, genetic initialization, and singular value decomposition, as discussed in the text. I found the section on how to use the program slightly confusing at first, but once I figured out how to operate it, it was easy to set it up and use it. The code base is C++ that is deeply rooted in C, so it won't impress object-oriented gurus at all, but it should be understandable and fairly easy to work with for users with a good background in C, but who aren't C++ experts. For me, the bottom line is that the code works, it's not hard to understand (in my opinion), and it shouldn't be that hard to extend to perform new functions. In this day and age, it's probably worth mentioning that the program comes with a simple command-line interface, so if you want something that runs in a spiffy GUI, you'll have to write one.I would recommend this book strongly as a first book on neural networks for readers that are interested in learning neural networks in the context of solving practical problems. I would also recommend this book to readers who have a book or two discussing the theoretical aspects of neural networks and want something that will help them translate that into attacking practical problems, and also provide a code base that will give them a head start."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"Some of the other reviewers of this book must have suffered from a misconception about the book. It is exactly as advertised, if you don't think so, compare it to Neural Networks, A Comprehensive Foundation by Haykin or Artificial Neural Networks by Schalkoff. Those are REALLY academic. Neural Networks is a very difficult topic,but this book does the best job I've seen yet of explaining Neural Nets in a Straightfoward, understandable way. C++ Neural Networks &amp; Fuzzy Logic by V. and H. Rao tried this and failed. The math is very needed, and I respect the approach of only looking at one type of neural net (feedfoward 3 layer) in depth rather than a billion short, unexplained looks a many. Yes, the code is not the best I've ever seen, and it gets a bit rough to follow, but it explains the ideas. Overall I'd say know a little about what you're getting into before buying ANY book on Neural Networks."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"Easily the best treatment of neural networks I have ever read. Outstanding treatment of the innards, how they work, and years of practical experience boiled down into heuristics for programming (with optimized source code examples!), configuring, training, and evaluating nets. The theory is brilliantly explained within each topical context in lieu of boring chapters on NN theory and math. Mathematical expressions are used only where they add clarity and are not gratuitiously used where the author's excellent English can do the job. And talk about English! Masters is one of those phenoms who speak math and English with equal facility. The writing is simply outstanding. The book is so good it is hard to decide what parts are most valuable. Amazingly, it is as useful for the novice wanting to learn something about neural nets as it is for a professional looking for tips and techniques! I have made the book mandatory reading for my team of knowledge discovery scientists and engineers"},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"The author does a great job with this book. He presents the complex material of neural networks in a very simple manner making it understandable to anyone interested in: (1) finding out more about neural networks, (2) using neural networks in any field, (3) applying neural networks in any field of research (ie: medicine, biology, finance, etc...). The author goes over everything that one needs to know about neural networks -- from the basics to how to implement your own network. Not only does he present the material in a concise manner, but he also gives C++ code to implement a neural network both in the book and on disk. Overall, I think that this is an excellent book to begin with if you are interested in neural networks and their applications."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"As an undergraduate Math and Computing student, when I took up a high-level course in Neural Networks as an open elective, the only book my instructor recommended was Neural Networks by Simon Haykin. I got that book, and was soon put off by the mathematical rigour it had.It was sometime later that I came across Practical Neural Network Recipes in C++ by Masters'. This, by all standards, is an exceptionally well written book.It has the complete code for a neural network application, including Conjugate Gradient based back-propagation, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm powered optimisation, and much more. The code, although not very object-oriented, is clear and easy to follow. Undergraduates with a limited knowledge of mathematics will most certainly appreciate the way Masters' deals with the underlying concepts behind neural networks training and use. He simplifies the mathematical equations, and the code listings serve to see the math in action. The more mathematically mature can look into the excellent references provided in the text.When much later in the course I went on to study Recurrent Networks (RNNs, which Masters' doesn't cover in his book), I found myself going back to Masters' when I had to implement algorithms for RNN training. This is one book that will teach you to convert complex mathematical equations into working code. Its a skill that is of much importance to most computational science students. This book is a must have for all neural networks students and practitioners alike."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"I do not recommend this book. I returned it within 10 days of my purchase, as I found it hard to follow and vague in many areas. Instead of buying this book, I recommend Object Oriented Neural Networks in C++ by Joey Rogers. It provides a very clear explanation of what NNs are, how they work, and how to implement them."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"Very nice job.The only negative criticisms I have deal with the computer code:1) The appendix does not do a good job of describing how to run the code. The various input parameters are described, but that's about it. Not even a short description on how to compile the code.2) The author claims the C++ code is ANSI standard. This is not true. The code as distributed requires the &quot;conio&quot; library, which is not an ANSI standard! However, for others who come across this, simply comment out all references to &quot;kbhit()&quot;, &quot;getch()&quot;, and create an empty file &quot;conio.h&quot; and you should be in business."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"When I received Pratical Neural Network Recipes in C++, I was pleasantly surprised on how easy it was to follow. Even though I have an extensive calculus background, I believe almost anyone with a background in statistics or college algebra can follow along. As far as content, Masters has shown his ability to explain a complex subject without making it overly complex. I was happy that Masters did not get too in depth with mathmatical proofs. Instead, he sticks to the point -- how to make artificial neural networks that aid in everything from pattern recognition to stock forecasting. He also explains several different kinds of networks such as genetic, hybrid, and multilayer feedforward, and the various benefits and pitfalls of each. The Neural program that comes with the book was also of great help (It's on a 3 1/2 floppy, not a 5 1/4). I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about NN's."},{"Title":"Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++","review":"The book's title is misleading. They should have take out the words &quot;Practical&quot; and &quot;C++&quot;.

HUAC's stated purpose for calling these 12 men was to expose the corrupting presence of communists in the entertainment industry and, it hoped, bar them from further employment in Hollywood. Ten, the famous Hollywood Ten, did indeed testify, were found in contempt of congress for their unwillingness to fully cooperate with the House committee and were duly punished for their intransigence. Subsequent to his appearance before congress in 1947, Dmytryk was sentenced to spend six months in a minimum security federal facility.\\"Odd Man Out\\" is Dmytryk's story of that time. It is a unique story. Most if not all of the people who were banned by the HUAC influenced Hollywood blacklists were indeed communists, or had joined the party at some point in the past. As Dmytryk writes, naming names was the ultimate sin. And, although \\"HUAC was out to expose a movement rather than nail a tiny group of individuals, and in that, however illegal, unethical, and un-American it was, they obviously succeeded,\\" the blacklisted individuals were supposed to maintain a united front. After prison and a couple of years in the wilderness, though, Dmytryk had a change of heart. Never a True Believer, it seems, it became obvious to him \\"the Ten had been sacrificed to the Party's purpose as a pipeline for the Comintern's propaganda... and ... if I were going to be a martyr, I wanted the privilege of choosing my martyrdom, and making my family suffer to protect the American representatives of a foreign agency would certainly not be it.\\" And so, as a condition for reinstatement, in 1951 Dmytryk testified again for HUAC, this time as a friendly witness.Time has exposed the communist witchhunt as a dark blemish on America's record, and those who were blacklisted have become noble martyrs. Dmytryk started out a hero but became the turncoat villain in this story. His second testimony in 1951, even though he named no new names, was never completely forgiven. Towards the end of the book Dmytryk recounts an encounter with another blacklisted director, Jules Dassin, who refused to share a stage with him and yet felt free to excoriate him during a round-table discussion of the blacklist era. Dassin's reaction wasn't untypical, and even today the blacklisted individuals are revered without quarter. Save for the turncoat Dmytryk, who, unfortunately, was forced to deal with the devil and testify against his former friends and denounce his past involvement in the communist party in America. \\"Odd Man Out\\" convinced me that he did the right thing, and reminded me that history is rarely a clear-cut matter of Right and Wrong. If you're interested in a different perspective on this difficult time I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Odd Man Out: A Memoir of the Hollywood Ten","review":"This book is a much needed contribution to the historical record, to undo all the mindless junk that's been said for years about what the Hollywood Ten was all about. Dmytryk's memoir is candid, honest and gets to what the heart of the matter was all about. And because he was the only one of the Ten who recognized that, he is treated now as a pariah by those who seem to think that fealty to the American Communist Party is more noble than &quot;naming names&quot;, even when in Dmytryk's case it forced him into prison in the name of beliefs he no longer held.Probably the best memoir of one man's break from American communism since Whittaker Chambers's masterpiece &quot;Witness.&quot;"},{"Title":"Trees and Other Poems","review":"This was a present for my dad.

I am a single mother of two autistic children and while reading this book I was touched beyond words, I hope one day to inspire other parents as Junee has for me and many more parents around the world. Is there any way of emailing her or atleast a way for me to say thank you to her and let her know how much she has touched my family?"},{"Title":"Smiling at Shadows: A Mother's Journey Raising an Autistic Child","review":"When Dane Waites was born in 1974, tolerance towards autism was just starting to move out of the shadows and into the light. His behavior was autistic from infancy; he smiled at trees and at the shadows they made on his walls. Largely nonverbal, he reached some milestones at a later rate, e.g. mastering toileting at age 7.The boy also celebrated his first Christmas at age 7. The Waites, wanting him to enjoy Christmas as his peers did, taught him about Santa. Junee Waites even said that once introduced, she feared Santa would be with them forever. By the time Dane reached his teens, he accepted the explanation that Santa only comes to younger children. Dane's poignant comment, \\"I'm too old for Santa, right\\" makes one feel a tad sad for him. One cannot help but wonder if Dane still believed. I think another approach would be to tell him, \\"Dane, Santa is fun pretend and a game many people play with their children as a Christmas tradition\\" or whatever verbiage got through to him. The remote possibility that Santa might remain an enduring belief far past that of his peers was unfortunate and in which case, it seems the honest approach would be better. Fortunately for all, Dane learned to open gifts without fear of the unknown and participate in holiday activities.Dane was enrolled in a mainstream kindergarten and it was there he met his lifetime friend, Jenny. She accepted Dane unconditionally; she said that she knew he could talk and when she asked him her name, he said, \\"Jenny.\\" She was his defender and protector; a photograph of the pair at Dane's 5th birthday party shows Jenny at his side, ready to go to bat for him at any time. I just loved that part.Jaeger, the German short-haired pointer was another faithful protector Dane enjoyed. The beautiful dog (1983-1992) was an important part of Dane's life and rarely left his side. Her untimely death might make you cry, but you will certainly be cheered by the strides Dane made.Dane's immediate community accepted him as well. There was a large Italian community in his town and he learned to make many Italian dishes; Junee took conversational Italian and out of this, many friendships were made. Dane was quickly and readily absorbed and accepted by his friendly neighbors; from these friendships came lasting bonds and an abiding respect for Italian food, language and culture.Dane's world expanded tremendously; the Waites took Dane on trips and moved twice during their son's boyhood. Dane was happiest when outside and enjoying nature. Luckily a farm family with 3 children had him work with them on their farm and Dane thrived in that environment. He also got to travel to the Fiji Islands and appreciated Fijian culture. I like the way he took an open interest in other people.Junee Waites is wonderfully candid about life with Dane and working within his challenges. She is a person I truly admire and her unflagging faith in her son along with the kind nuns and priest who also taught him and helped him understand and appreciate his faith truly warms the heart. I loved the part when Dane received his First Communion at age 10 and the priest who wrote a lovely account of this in a book. Dane's spiritual development is nicely chronicled as well; an especially moving account of this was when Dane told a man in a wheelchair he would pray for him. Dane also insisted on bringing apples to feed homeless people in a neighborhood park.The Waites' odessy with autism came full circle when they encountered Jenny, Dane's boyhood friend in a restuarant. By then the manager of the place, Jenny told them how she understood about Dane and knew how to reach him as only a compassionate peer could. That was my favorite part along with Dane's First Communion.Dane's travel and spiritual development no doubt helped him become a rather well rounded young man. He also demonstrated physical prowess in early adulthood when he took up running; marathon biking and weight lifting. Although still autistic, Dane continues to remain an active, thriving member of his society and has held down jobs since the age of 14.Junee Waites provides readers with rich descriptions of the parts of Australia where she and her family lived; readers are treated to the places that they visited as travelers. To make a good thing even better, a list of resources as well as descriptions of resources available in Australia are provided. This is truly an outstanding book. It makes me think of the hymn, \\"On Eagle's Wings\\" and the song \\"You Are the Light of the World,\\" as Dane emerged from shadows into the light of conversing and providing explanations of his experience with autism."},{"Title":"Smiling at Shadows: A Mother's Journey Raising an Autistic Child","review":"I read this book from cover to cover and then I read it all over again. I am a mother of a child with special needs (including autistic traits)and know of many others with young ASD children. This is a book I could recommend to them, for the insight it offers into both autism and a parent's journey. I learned so much, began to see life through the eyes of the ASD child and to understand why he acted as he did, and related it to much of what my friends' children did, or my own. The mother's love shone throughout the book yet she was very honest about how she felt and how hard that journey was at times. Always though, it was a book of hope and of love and remained positive throughout.Like the previous reviewer, I too would like to write to the author to say how enormously helpful this book is.

The beginning is a bit philosophical, but the nature of the problem demands a philosophical treatment. For those who have read extensively on the problem of undeserved suffering, this book may be overly simplistic, but for anyone else, it serves as a good, honest inquiry into the problem and represents the Biblical view well. Page-for-page, it is the best introduction to the issue I have read."},{"Title":"If I Were God, I'd End All the Pain: Struggling with Evil, Suffering and Faith","review":"Why would a loving God allow so much suffering? All of us have wrestled with this question at some point. Almost every day as a pastor, I encounter people who are dealing with serious trials - people who may be asking this very question.In the short book, \\"If I Were God, I'd End All the Pain,\\" John Dickson is not afraid to ask the question \\"Why?\\" In fact, he believes it's a healthy question that God Himself invites. The author shows that while there is still much mystery woven into our suffering, we can also be confident that Christianity provides the very best explanation for evil and suffering.After showing why suffering does not disprove God philosophically (ch. 1), the author explains how four alternative faiths attempt to explain suffering.* Hinduism views suffering as karma, i.e. bringing balance for past wrongs.* Buddhism, which actually developed from Buddha's quest to explain suffering, believes all suffering is just an illusion. It stems from a desire or affection for things of the world (e.g. comfort, health, money, love, etc.). If we can simply strip away these desires and enter a state of nirvana (non-existence), then suffering will cease.* Islam believes all things are pre-determined by God, and that suffering is a direct result of Allah, the great \\"Unmoved Mover.\\"* Atheism endures suffering as the natural, unhappy by-product of our random, godless universe.In contrast to these four views, the Bible has a satisfactory explanation for suffering. Human violence and injustice, which causes so much of the suffering in this world, is really a perversion of the independence God originally gave the human spirit. People now live as \\"a law unto themselves, without reference to the Creator,\\" and we are reaping what we sow. But what about the profound suffering caused by natural disasters, disease, death, starvation, etc.? These are a result of God's curse upon the world for our sin (Gen. 3:17-19). \\"The earth bears the scars, as it were, of the traumatic rift that has occurred between us and God; it contains an ever-present reminder that the Creator is displeased with our defiance of him.\\"The author does not merely explain suffering, but provides three comforting truths that give hope and peace even in times of suffering:* God will eventually judge and repay all the injustice in the world.* God will eventually restore and re-create His world in perfection.* By sending His Son to the cross, God Himself has suffered to the greatest degree, and through His suffering provides a substitute for us, so that we do not have to spend eternity apart from Him.\\"If I Were God, I'd End All the Pain\\" is a brief but helpful Christian apologetic on suffering. While the Bible does not claim to give us all the answers, it gives us enough to keep clinging to God and persevering through life's darkest moments."},{"Title":"If I Were God, I'd End All the Pain: Struggling with Evil, Suffering and Faith","review":"A major strength of this book is the author's mantra that he (with Bible in hand) does not have all the answers to suffering. This is a wise tone because the topic calls for a humble approach. The author begins by surveying how non-Christian worldviews handle suffering. The alternatives are not pretty and this must be kept in mind when tragedy occurs and the Christian God is doubted or mocked as a result. The author then explains the purpose of human free will, the fallen state of man, Christ's communion in suffering, God's redemptive plan, and heaven. This enlightening book is suited for Christians and non-Christians alike."},{"Title":"If I Were God, I'd End All the Pain: Struggling with Evil, Suffering and Faith","review":"If I were God, I'd end all the Pain is a brief look at the sobering issue of evil. Dickson clarifies the problem by breaking the issue down: In one sense, the Problem of Evil is a challenge to belief in a Good God and in another way it is a profoundly personal issue that causes many people much reflection and angst.In this very short book, John Dickson discusses the topic genuinely and reasonably from a Biblical Perspective. He also shows a deep respect for people's feelings and opening himself up to the audience by telling a deeply moving story from his own life."},{"Title":"If I Were God, I'd End All the Pain: Struggling with Evil, Suffering and Faith","review":"I am hoping to have more copies of this soon so that I can give them away.

Little Bear is so cute, and she loves how curious and naughty he is! The sniffing game that his parents play with him is especially cute, and she makes us recreate it while reading. This book has been especially helpful in getting her ready to move from our room to her own big-girl bed, as Little Bear learns that sleeping with his \\"guys\\" in his own bed is really the best place for him. We read it every night before bed, and I suspect she will love it for years to come."},{"Title":"Finding a Preschool for Your Child in San Francisco & Marin","review":"A friend gave me this book, and it is a helpful starting point to research preschools in San Francisco. It's helpful to be able to easily reference the school hours, educational philosophy, whether or not children are required to be potty-trained, etc. The only problem with the book today is the fact that it has not been updated in a few years and much of the information about the schools, particularly the tuition (!) and contact info, is not up to date. Also, as a previous reviewer mentioned, this book does NOT tell you how to navigate the preschool admissions process, waiting lists, etc. - which is equally important in SF to getting your child into the right preschool! I'd recommend this book as a helpful reference tool, but if you're looking for information on choosing and getting your child INTO preschool, you should also read \\"How to Choose the Best Preschool for Your Child: The Ultimate Guide to Finding, Getting Into, and Preparing for Nursery School.\\""},{"Title":"Finding a Preschool for Your Child in San Francisco & Marin","review":"I grew up in a place where you just call up the nearest preschool and say, hey my kid is 3 and you drop them off the next day. But getting your child into preschool in San Francisco is about as competitive (and expensive!) as getting yourself into graduate school. I bought this book for a litle wisdom and insight on the process so I wouldn't end up having to educate her myself. It outlines all the preschools who responded to their survey on factors such as admission policies, parental views, costs, teaching focus, etc and provides some overall background on popular preschool \\"teaching philosophies\\". However, what it doesn't tell you is which schools are the most popular, which schools are the hardest to get into unless you build a library or know someone famous, which schools will actually call back when you try to get information, and which schools require a visit when child is still in womb. These are the kinds of things that could be helpful to know. Instead, it says more reassuring things like, all kids find the right school, don't let the process intimidate you, don't worry, blah, blah, blah. So while its a good start, I guess I was disappointed about what it doesn't say and what I really wanted to know. In fact, I finished the book more anxious about the process than when I started."},{"Title":"Finding a Preschool for Your Child in San Francisco & Marin","review":"This is from 2004 people.

It gives a nice summary of each school that responded to the authors' request for information and it was one of the few resources I've found that includes information on public preschools in the city. I would not recommend that parents use this as their sole guide in finding a preschool - check out savvysource.com, ParentsPlace's \\"Choosing a Preschool\\" class or preschool information night, or \\"Babies By the Bay\\" for more information - but it's a good starting point and I was happy to pass my copy along to a friend.

Blumenson makes excellent use of Patton's personal letters, especially those to Patton's wife, to reveal the human side of his tough-as-nails persona. Patton with nervous indigestion? Patton feeling worthless and inferior? Who would have guessed! Highly recommended for those interested in historic figures and military history, but who don't want to get bogged down in minutae such as detailed battlefield tactics. This book focuses on the man, as it should, and not so much on the wars that made his career. That being said, my only complaint is that for the chapters about actual warfare the book could have used some basic maps of North Africa and Western Europe, especially France, showing the route of Patton's advances and major battles. I sometimes felt lost as Patton rolled through one village after another to attack the enemy."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"The one primary reason this ranks as the paramount biography of Patton is because the Patton family never tried to control the author. The secondary reason for the success of this biography is because the author, Blumenson, served as a young lieutenant under Patton.I surprised about a number of facts regarding Patton. First of all, he was dyslexic, but was able to overcome that problem through hard work. He was also kicked by a horse later in life, and this may be the reason for his \\"unstable\\" and volatile character.There are plenty of fun facts in this biography. I was surprised that Patton was an Olympic athlete in the pentathlon. I did not realise, though, that the pentathlon was built around an officer carrying dispatches (i.e., horse, sword, pistol, swimming, running). He also should have placed first, but they could not decide if his pistol round had punched through the same hole twice (so the judges counted it as a complete miss).Patton had many doubts about his manhood. He joked, while at West Point, that he made a fine woman as a dancer. Since West Point only had men at the time, they had to trade off when learning to dance. There is also a serious character flaw in Patton regarding his niece. Although he denied it, it was pretty obvious he was having sex with his niece. This is where we, as the reading public, must give all thanks to the Patton family. They trust Blumenson so much that he is the only man they have given full access to the family papers and letters. At no point did they tell Blumenson to hide anything. They recognized that their family member was an historical figure,and insisted on a complete analysis--warts and all. Otherwise, how can you form an opinion on the man?Blumenson ends his biography with a chapter \\"Behind the Legend.\\" Patton's ideal of leadership is one key to understanding him. On page 307 he states \\"slef-confidence and leadership are twin brothers.\\" As Blumenson states, \\"the sublime irony is that Patton's self-confidence was an act, forced and assumed, put on, riveted to his exterior.\\"Blumenson is quite informative and a must see. He is positive that, had Patton lived a lengthy life, he would have been discredited. He was a real embarrassment, great in war but terrible in peace. The author is also a very humble man, even though he is a retired colonel, and always makes the emphasis when he speaks about Patton."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"This is an extraordinary biography for, while Blumenson's admiration for George Patton is evident, it brilliantly illustrates all the sides of Patton's personality - both positive and negative. The book truly goes beyond the popular perception of the General -and far beyond the movie- in exploring his character and motivations. Not an overly long book, but thorough, detailed, and very enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"I have always regarded General Patton as one of the greatest warriors in the twentieth century. This book confirms my admiration. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and learned a great deal about the general. If you are interested in finding out the truth, read this book. Blumenson does a good job portraying his career. It's an entertaining read and you won't be bored with the narrative."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"I recently caught a few minutes of one of my favorite movies, \`Patton' staring George C. Scott and wondered if he was really that great of a general and that much bigger than life. What made him tick? What drove him?\`Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945' by Martin Blumenson gave these questions a pretty good shot. Yes, Patton was that much bigger than life, one of the greatest soldiers of the 20th century or any other century, and was held in awe by his troops as well as the enemy. Yes, George C. Scott faithfully portrayed Patton, even down to some of his speeches that seemed word-for-word as recorded in the book. He approached war religiously, studied it, thought it, taught it, acted it, ate it, and slept it. He actually did get depressed at the thought the War would end before he could make his mark. He was the world's foremost expert on the use of tanks (from WWI experiences). His Third Army was the best force in WWII, disciplined and relentlessly fast and effective, covering more ground quicker than anyone else. They captured an amazing 400,000 enemy soldiers, and could probably have won the war if Ike had let Patton continue on to Berlin with his great breakout after Normandy. The enemy conceded after the War that they always had to know where Patton was - he was their main focus.What drove Patton? He would tell you that his genes were replete with highly successful military types on both sides of his forebears, and that he was therefore destined to be great. Higher society in those days (and maybe today too) thought that their success in any given field was mainly due to better genes. Also, he was raised by very loving, well-to-do parents who pulled all the available strings to support him in his military career. By the way, I somehow didn't picture Patton, who could be ruthless, as having very loving parents, but I was wrong!Patton was a great believer in esprit-de-corps (that was surprising too) and the men who served under him were proud to be doing so. He would tell them that they were the best army ever and they acted like it! Ike, in Patton's view, looked at the men as pieces of the organization chart.The battle descriptions were probably a little too concise, but that didn't bother me since I just wanted the overall flow of events but a greater sense of the man. The author undoubtedly had command of the subject from the amount of detail on each page. The book flap said that he served under Patton and spent his career writing about it in various papers and books. He was able to \`short-hand' the battles.The book reminded me a little of the book\`American Caesar', which was about Doug MacArthur, Patton's counterpart in the Pacific, who brilliantly island-hopped to hold off the Japanese; and he did this with a much smaller force until the war in Europe was over. Like Patton, he also felt the call of destiny for his greatness. He was also an actor like Patton, putting on a persona for the troops and the public every day. Interestingly, Patton even asked to serve with MacArthur after the war in Europe had been won, but Ike knew that two gigantic egos could not work together.It's true: there was nobody like Patton - except maybe MacArthur."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"Although there is no doubt in my mind that Patton is one of the most brilliant generals of 20th century USA, Blumenson seems to be a bit biased towards this controversial figure. He rationalizes all of the various controversies that surrounded Patton to put Patton in the best light. There is no controversy, or 'dirt' dug up on Patton here. Otherwise a fairly quick and very interesting examination of the life of Patton."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"I saw the movie with George C Scott, and was inspired to learn more about Patton, and this was the first book I picked up. It turns out that this was the right one, as it is fast reading, relatively short, and gives a good overview of the man behind the legend. I feel that the author is objective, and is not biased, which must be hard. He talks about Patton's weaknesses as well as his strengths. He even discussess Patton's later years when he became delusional and described the Jewish people as &quot;lower than animals&quot;. I particularly liked the end, where it states that if Patton had lived, he would not be the legend that he is today. I have since read &quot;The last days of Patton&quot;, an entire novel, which is only covered here in one short chapter. Of course, this is not a bad thing if you have not read a Patton book before. I HIGHLY recommend this one as a first Patton book to read or give as a gift to a friend."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"While not the definitive word on Patton, Blumenson's work is probably the best short biography on one of the most complex figures of American military history. I recommend reading it in conjunction with the newer and more comprehensive PATTON; A GENIUS FOR WAR by Carlo D'Este; after which you can graduate to Blumenson's two volume editings of THE PATTON PAPERS, 1885-1940 &amp; 1940-1945. As a staff weinie, I also enjoyed BG Oscar Koch's interesting G-2: INTELLIGENCE FOR PATTON. Koch was perhaps the best G-2 in the ETO during WWII. Patton's urbane and erudite aide, COL Charles Codman, also produced a delightful memoir, DRIVE, which though OOP is available on the Net."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"Martin Blumenson's \\"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945\\" is an insightful, succinct biography of the most famous American general of the twentieth century. Much shorter than Carlo D'Este's \\"Patton: A Genius for War,\\" this book would make a good introduction to Patton for the general or casual reader.Focusing more on the man Patton than his actions, Blumenson's biography is very insightful and provides both a description and analysis of Patton and his actions. He works hard to explain why Patton acted as he did and to fully uncover the private Patton.However, this is not a full, definitive biography of Patton and leaves out many details of his life. For example, Patton's role in the firing of Terry Allen, a very controversial move, merited about one sentence. While the book is filled with many nice pictures, there are no maps to help illustrate Patton's military campaigns.This book focuses on Patton the man and not all of his actions, and at times is a bit fawning. Serious readers looking for an in-depth biography of General Patton or a reference should turn to D'Este's excellent biography, but general readers looking for a shorter treatment (less than 300 pages of text) should enjoy this excellent book."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"This biography starts with Patton's family roots, covers his growing up years, and works through his career in the military. The book is only about 300 pages and is a fairly quick read. There are lots of pictures.Patton grew up in California, his father was Old South gentry, and his mother's father was a fairly rich self made man. Patton idealized his military roots. Fairly early in life Patton wanted to become famous and felt the honorable way was to do so in the army. Patton appears to have had dyslexia. School was a struggle for him which he overcame through hard work.As a teenager Patton meet Beatrice Ayer who later become his wife. She was from a rich family. Through her emotional support Patton was able to keep struggling all his life against his self doubts. Without her support it doesn't sound like Patton would have been nearly as successful. They had two daughters and a son.The kind of character description of Patton this book gives is a gifted man who was focused on himself. He wanted glory and he wanted to be known. He wanted to be famous. He often did things to make sure he was noticed. He pulled strings to get the attention of higher commanding officers.Also unfortunately he wasn't faithful to his wife. There were a couple mentions of how many condoms he used in a short period. Patten had a long affair with his niece. And after he died, the niece killed herself. She left a note that she would be with Uncle Georgia before Beatrice.Strategically and tactically George Patton seemed to have been almost without peer. He studied war for over forty years. But his greater gift may have been his ability to train and motivate large groups of soldiers. In two instances Patton was given an army and fairly quickly he improved the level of performance several levels. The Third Army, which was under his command from after D-Day to the end of the war, was largely an untrained and unseasoned group of men. But they took the most number of prisoners, and moved the quickest across dozens of miles in a day. George Patton seems to have consciously taken on an act of swearing and cussing to be at the level of the common solider, but then when he meet with his officers he was much more refined. He told his Third Army they were different, he told them they were on a righteous cause, and he asked a lot of them. They came through.Over all George Patton comes across as a flawed person who achieved some greatness. Martin Blumenson did a good job in giving the reader insight into the life and character of George Patton."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"Blumenson's portrait of a man who believes good soldiering is all about the warlike personality he projects was entirely new to me. Patton literally thought of himself as something of an actor, giving likeness to the embodiment of leadership that would make his units more confident in battle. It certainly explains the indescribably haphazard risks Patton took, such as leading a company of tanks into battle on foot.Blumenson peppers the biography with hundreds of quotes from Patton's own letters, showing great familiarity with the daily thought processes of the man and his dual nature (Patton often ridiculed himself for being weak, doubts he shared with only his closest of relations).Patton despised Montgomery, Eisenhower, and Bradley because he felt they were not aggressive enough in prosecuting the war on the Germans. He also believed they held him back by limiting his resources and sidelining him. Blumenson gives several examples of how politicking and timidity cost the Allies thousands in casualties. Patton CONSTANTLY interjected himself in his superiors' decision-making processes to create the perfect scenario to advance his fame, his name recognition, and his carreer. He pushed his men hard, and when he thought they were slacking, he jumped into the trenches with them to spur them on. Blumenson himself notes that George C. Scott's portrayal in the movie is very accurate.Blumenson thinks that frequent head injuries had aggravated a condition that predisposed Patton to mood swings. This, in combination with the end of the war during which Patton mounted achievements one after the other, gave him a sense of emptiness and morose. This explanation is not satisfying without medical support."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"Anyone who lived through World War II likely has a warm spot in his or her heart for General George S. Patton, Jr. The darling of America, clearly America's best fighting general of that war, and perhaps America's greatest fighting general of any war, he was larger than life and the kind of man one could never forget. Perhaps that's what made this, the third biography of Patton that I have read, so interesting to me and, even at this late date, so enthralling.I first read a biography of Patton back in the 1970s. It was the book from which the movie \\"Patton\\" was adapted: \\"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph\\" by Ladislas Farago. After reading that book, I felt that the move had missed the mark. It seemed to me that Patton's life prior to World War II was ten times more fascinating than his actions in that war. More recently, I read a second biography of General Patton, this time written by his grandson, Robert H. Patton, and entitled \\"The Pattons: A Personal History of an American Family (The Warriors).\\" That book concentrated on Patton's family history, his military heritage and his psychological makeup.This book seems to lie somewhere in between. It briefly addresses George Patton's family history, especially as it pertains to his military forebears, and throughout the book delves into his psychological makeup as revealed by his letters and diary entries over the years. But those aren't the focus of the book which is much more direct in tracing Patton's life and military career and, in doing so, seems to contradict some of Farago's earlier work, at least as I remember it.So, if I was going to read a biography of the General for entertainment, I'd read Farago's book; if I was going to read a biography to gain an in-depth understanding of the forces driving Patton and his psychological makeup, I'd read his grandson's book; but if I wanted to learn who George S. Patton was, what he did during World War II, and why he is so revered by the American people, I'd read this one. But all are great books."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"I have read many books on George Patton, but so far this one is the most enjoyable book to read. It is not a definitive biography, nor do I think it was written to be so. This is just a concise yet detailed description of Patton from beginning to end. Patton was a master of the \\"one liners\\"; yet eloquent at the same time. He could be cruel yet tender, brave but yet emotional, an inspirational leader yet full of self doubt.This book seems to be the inspiration for the movie, because almost all the scenes are described in this book. Yet I noticed the movie is based off of a book by Ladislas Farago. This is an inspirational story for everyone. George Patton struggled with dyslexia in his youth, but through his self-will and detirmination he willed himself to exceed. A great American story that is a must read!"},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"This is a great short bio of Patton. Blumenson paints him as a fragile, yet great leader and how those two worked back and forth. His last few pages are a great summary: \\"...one of America's greatest soldiers, one of the world's great captains.\\"I read this book for a master's class and it provides two great take aways:1. Insight into his early life--Patton grew up in a displaced Virginian family in California. His views of his family and himself shaped him as a military figure.2. The interaction of his fragile and volitile personality with his outer shell which strove for personal excellence and glory for his family.It's very hard to write on Patton without taking a side--either critical of him or supporting him. Thus, the Patton family did endorse this bio, but there are pro-Patton themes (prejudice), especially in his interaction with Bradley and Eisenhower (my only downgrade of the book).This is a very good book to use as a baseline for further study. Worth a spot in your library."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"I loved this book. I saw what George Patton was really like. It told how and what he was. He might not been the by the book general but he got the job done. It was exciting to read what read the story of Patton. I found out things, I had never heard or read about. Great story about a great man."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"Blumenson looks at Patton as he was and how his legend developed. A lot of good information about how he saw himself and how he interacted with his fellow generals.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945","review":"The problem with Martin's work about Patton is that it's not very objective nor does he reveal many important facts, For instance, Patton's nickname while he was at West Point was \\"Bootlicker,\\" which is very indictive of his personality. In all honesty, I have never been all that impressed with his legenary battlefield abilities. Being a military historian myself, Patton's claim to fame was fighting third rate German divisions that were in France to rebuild from their thrashing in Russia. Also, it surely helped that Patton's superiors (Bradley) had access to the German's codes (Ultra, which would make any general look good. Nevertheless, similar to Douglas MacArthur and Winston Churchill, who both came from influential and privileged families, it doesn't appear to me that Patton ever grew up and that much of success was a result of his continuous bootlicking. Moreover over the last several decades, I have met quite a few veterans who served in Patton's Third Army. And to a man, they hated his guts. For the simple reason, he was quite prepared to further his career and his ego over the bodies of his of fellow soldiers and to hell with the ultimate cost."},{"Title":"Sociology On Culture","review":"I had to buy this book for a class - at first I was very hesitant to read it but it is a very insightful discussion of culture, by one of the best in the history of the field. It IS difficult to digest - Williams speaks in general terms a lot, and some concepts need a deal of time to understand. But it does pay off. I feel like I've gained an essential insight into the field, the direction it's going, and a thorough critique of it all. The only reason I didn't rate it higher was because the print I received was very poor - extra binder glue, faded/unreadable ink, stuck pages, etc."},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"While the book is highly academic and authoritative, it is also very accessible and enjoyable to read. Here is a very brief summary:The book begins with a chapter on Early Greece (776-480 BCE). Crompton points to the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus (in the Iliad) as \\"exemplars of male love.\\" He goes on to point out:Greek poets sang of male love from almost the earliest fragments down to the end of classical time.Mythology provides over 50 examples of homoerotic love, especially love by Gods of male youths\\"Man-boy relations played a significant part in the social organization of such Dorian communities as Crete and Sparta\\"In some Greek communities it was the boy's physical beauty that was desired, in others it was his character that was admiredIn nearly every classical Greek community, the homosexual relationship between an older man and a younger boy was not only accepted, it was admired and held as a civic virtue and a bulwark against tyranny.Man-boy love was used in many communities (e.g., Sparta) as a means of military training and indoctrinationIn the second chapter, on Judea, he points out that the early Jewish customs and laws were strongly opposed to homosexuality, though he does show that the destruction of Sodom was originally attributed to failure of the city to live up to its obligations of hospitality, and only much later (in Catholic teaching) was Sodom's destruction associated with homosexuality.The third chapter focuses on Classical Greece (480-323 BCE) and shows that here too, Homosexuality and bisexuality were not only considered perfectly natural, but were acclaimed at every level of society. Many Greek writers, playwrights and philosophers not only practiced homosexuality and pederasty, they praised it and held it up as an ideal. Plato was a notable exception who held boy-love as an ideal as long as it was not consummated.In Thebes, a general argued that pairs of man/boy lovers would make great warriors because they would fight for one another's safety and would fear cowardice in the eyes of their beloved. He created the \\"Sacred Band of Thebes\\" which became the most powerful army on earth, and which made Thebes the greatest military power.Chapter 4 turns to Rome, where homosexuality was more constrained: it was considered fine to have homosexual sex with a slave so long as the free man was dominant, but it was shameful to have homosexual sex with a free born person or as the passive partner. Crompton notes that homosexuality was seen as part of the \\"will to power\\" and a type of dominance. He also notes that the famous Roman poet Ovid wrote many homoerotic poems, though he decried Lesbianism as unacceptable.Chapter 5 turns to the early Christians, and here everything changes. While homosexuality was not a central issue in early Christianity, Paul's Epistle to the Romans began 2000 years of virulent prejudice against homosexuality.Clement of Alexandria created the \\"Alexandrian rule\\" which held that \\"pleasure sought for its own sake, even within marriage, is a sin...\\" He also held that it is a sin for men to shave.For the first two centuries of Christianity, however, Roman custom continued to accept homosexuality, and Plutarch wrote that the \\"mortal reflections of the divine [derive from] young men radiant in the prime of their beauty.\\"Beginning with Constantine, however, Roman law changed, and became much harsher in its persecution of homosexuals. It was around this time (390 CE) that the understanding of the story of Sodom changed and in the City of God Augustine described Sodom's destruction as a result of homosexuality among the populace.Saint John Chrysostom \\"ranks as the most influential of (Christian) Greek fathers, second only to Augustine\\" and he instituted organized persecution of homosexuals as a Christian obligation. He denounced male love as \\"monstrous, Satanical, detestable, execrable and pitiable.\\" (He also denounced Jews as \\"sensual, slippery, voluptuous, avaricious, possessed by demons, drunkards, harlots and breakers of the law.\\")Chapters six and seven focuses on the medieval period Throughout this period homosexuals were persecuted and murdered relentlessly in Christendom. Medieval Islam, however, held a more ambivalent attitude. Like Judaism and Christianity, it prohibited homosexuality, but Moslem cultures were pervaded by homoerotic poetry and art. Nonetheless, the theologian Malik of Median whose \\"school of jurisprudence became the dominant one in Spain and North Africa, endorsed the death penalty\\" for homosexuality. Crompton states, \\"Muslim religion paradoxically forbade, allowed and exalted homoerotic desire... sexual contact was forbidden, but the man who admitted to love for another male might still be respected.\\"St. Aquinas endorsed Augistine's opinion that homosexuality is the \\"worst\\" of sexual sins, and specifically stated that consensual homosexuality is worse than the rape of a woman (because such rape might lead to procreation). By the same logic, he held that masturbation was worse than rape, because of the loss of the seed.France at this time began to consign homosexuals to the flames and mutilation was common. English law was severe but not as barbaric as France or Spain.Chapter 8 turns to Imperial China (500 BCE to 1849 CE). Crompton shows that homosexuality was a central aspect of Chinese culture for nearly 2,000 years.He traces canonical anecdotes about homosexual love through Chinese history, and tells three famous anecdotes (the story of the peach, the story of Lord Yang and the story of the cut sleeve). Each of these involve emperors with male lovers. The first emperor confirmed by historians to take a male lover was the \\"Yellow Emperor\\" a central figure in Taoism. The first ten Han emperors also had male lovers according to the famous historian Sima Qian.During the Ming dynasty, homosexuality was a central part of the culture. Xie Zhaozhe wrote in the 16th century CE, \\"in today's Peking there are young boy singers who go to all the gentry's wine parties... everyone uses them.\\" He goes on to describe rampant, explicit male prostitution at every rank of society.A shocked Portuguese missionary wrote that for the Chinese \\"unnatural lust was neither forbidden by law, nor thought to be illicit, nor even a cause for shame.\\" Crompton writes \\"Chine, indeed, provides us with the longest documented period of tolerance in human history - two thousand years extending from 500 BCE to the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644.Chapter 9, Italy in the Renaissance shows that \\"Greek Love\\" became more fully understood, at least among the intellectuals of the Renaissance, ,but this came at the same time as an increase of efforts to suppress homosexuality, and a surge of unprecedented violence against offenders. Crompton states \\"In the end, more men and women fell victim to homophobia in the three centuries from 1400 to 1700 than in the Middle Ages.\\"At the same time that a record number of homosexuals were being tortured, beheaded and burned, Donatello was creating his homoerotic sculpture of David that stands as a landmark of Renaissance art; the first free-standing nude in a thousand years. \\"For the first time since antiquity we are asked to admire the beauty of a naked image.\\" This was followed by homoerotic art by Botticelli and Michelangelo.Michelangelo attempted to \\"present himself as a lover of male beauty who was Platonically chaste\\" but the record documents that he was an active bisexual, as were Cellini and Carvaggio.Chapter 10 turns to the Inquisition. This is, of course, the most painful part of the book to read. While the horrific deeds of the Spanish Inquisition are detailed, there is little that is surprising. What is interesting is that the disgust for homosexuality was used by Spanish leaders to justify persecution of the American Indian tribes, some of whom tolerated or actively incorporated homosexuality.Chapter 11 discusses France from 1517 to 1715 and chapter 12 is on England from 1533 - 1702. Crompton states that legal oppression was \\"fiercest in Spain, severe in France and Italy and rare in England, and seem to have been almost totally lacking in such northern states as Russia, Denmark and Sweden. The myth in England, for over two hundred years, was that homosexuality did not exist in Britain and was entirely a Continental phenomenon. While this drove homosexuals underground, it did avoid the persecution seen in Spain and France.The final chapters discuss homosexuality in ancient Japan and then provide an historic overview of the role of homosexuality in civilization."},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"Homosexuality and Civilization is a monumental yet compendious book. The fruit of decades of scholarship in primary documents, it is written in Louis Crompton's customary, classy style: easy, open, colloquial. Some of you may know his excellent book on Shaw. Especially interesting is this book's focus on various cultures' laws concerning homosexuality because it enables Crompton to get around the claims of certain cultures that homosexuality barely exists within them. Belknap Press has done itself great credit in providing enriching (and expensive) art work illustrations yet keeping the book's cost very reasonable."},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"Louis Crompton has produced in HOMOSEXUALITY & CIVILZATION a definitive book about same sex relationships from the beginning of civilization to the present. Not only is this 624 page compendium thoroughly documented with copious footnotes, bibliography, valuable indices on both written content and illustrations, it is presented in an elegant format by Belknap Press of Harvard University Press - all of which become s additive but secondary to the brilliance of Crompton enlightened writing style. No dry treatise this, though the scholarly ethic is always in evidence. Crompton relates his reportage and commentary in a fluid, highly readable fashion, a fact that makes this book read like the great historical novel.Although others have written excellent 'justifications for homosexuality' on various platforms that usually seem to border on glorified gossip for a hungry audience of fellow travelers, Crompton relies on myriad quotaions from historical documents, poetry, stories, myths, histories, and intact evidence of teachings of the great minds from twenty-four centuries. He wisely begins with Early Greece then Classical Greece where love between males was glorified and honored, to Rome where same sex relationships were an integral part of the Roman warriors' lives. He quotes liberally from the poetry of Sappho, Homer, Plato, Ovid, Cicero etc and integrates the lyrical with the writings of Caesar and Alexander and other emperors and leaders.Then comes the change. With the introduction of 'Christianity which was born when Rome was stood at the peak of its power and Greek culture still dominated the Mediterranean world.' The single most destructive concept of homosexuality as an abomination and a crime worthy of (and receiving) the death penalty is the brief story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Even though Crompton demonstrates that the inception of the hate campaign resulting from this Judaic story may have originated from an incorrect translation from the Bible, this Levitical evidence was the reference used to torture, imprison, slaughter, and burn at the stake countless men and women who were even suspect of same sex love or who engaged in the act of sodomy. The Story marches forward like a pestilence through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance with the Inquisition only an example of the fury that the Church used to destroy sodomites, considered to be the cause of all misfortune in battles, disease, and civic unrest because of God's fury at peoples who allowed this crime.Make no mistake; Crompton does not march against the Church as the source of all evil in telling the story of the homosexuals' plight. He writes lyrically of the wonders of the Renaissance and the Papal patronage of the great master works of art in the history of Western Civilization. He quietly continues to demonstrate that these holy works were from the minds and hands of homosexual artists such as Michelangelo, da Vinci, Caravaggio, Botticelli, and Donatello. He talks about the Popes, the kings, the emperors, the famous men and women of the political and religious and artistic world who were known to be homosexual.Crompton does not exclude Eastern Civilization in his massive book. As a matter of fact his beautifully written accounts of Chinese and later, of Japanese histories provide a welcome breath of dignity to the ongoing slaughter and genocide of the homosexuals in Western Civilization. Because the Judaic Bible was not part of the culture of these civilizations, there was no rule or law against same sex relationships. Influenced by the Oriental mind being at one with nature include being at one with all beings in nature, and while it was accepted that unions between man and woman were necessary for the proliferation of their civilizations, more often than not the purer 'love and passion' stories were those between men. The Samurai are shown to be deeply involved with male lovers who were the driving force for valour on the battlefield.Once the atrocities of the Inquisition began to fade and the Age of Enlightenment and Reason altered man's view of the law as at least equal to the dogma of both the Papal authority and the Protestant Reformation, Crompton writes of the gradual decriminalization of homosexuality, examining the differences between the timelines of France, Spain, the Netherlands, England and the United States and leaves his thorough investigation in the Supreme Court ruling of June 26, 2003. \\"Our story concludes here, at the moment when executions finally cease in Europe. Looking back over twenty-four centuries, what pattern can we see in the dozen societies we have examined? Most striking, certainly, is the divide between those that called themselves Christian and those that flourished before or independently of Christianiy. In the first we find laws and preachings which promoted hatred, contempt, and death; in the second, varying attitudes, all of them (barring Islam, which, like Christianity, inherited the lethal tradition of the Hebrew scriptures) to a radical degree more tolerant.\\"This book is not a light read; reading one chapter a day is about all we can fully absorb and relate to our own knowledge of history. But Crompton is both knowledgeable and a thoughtful writer. His book is generously illustrated with examples of paintings, sculptures, images of the people under discussion, and extant documents. One could comfortably use this book as a text for the general study of Civilization. The fact that Louis Crompton has added the parallel history of homosexuality to his intellectual tracing is a welcome addition to scholars and to all readers who long for an understanding of a topic that has rarely been more relevant than it is today. This is a brilliant book and an extraordinary achievement.
