It shows a horrible world, where its occupants are monitored constantly by hidden cameras or concealed microphones. No one can think to him or herself in this country of Oceana, because Big Brother is watching you. In this world, 2+2=5, because Big Brother is always right. Powered on the hate of the traitor, Goldstein, the Party (the higher position that runs Oceana) is unstoppable. George Orwell perfectly illustrates this grim future with such description, it almost seems real. Honestly the best novel I ever read, and from my favorite author, George Orwell."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a book about the ultimate in man's inhumanity to man. George Orwell, and many others realised that, if you controlled the thoughts of everyone in the world, then you are literally omnipotent - because nothing can be proved to exist outside the human consciousness. The part where O'Brien says that Big Brother will last literally forever gives one pause for thought. Because it is true that, in an Orwellian society, nothing can ever change. Big Brother is literally an eternal God."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I love reading the clasics, and this is the best I have ever read. The characters are belivable, and the setting was wonderfull. Sure, I'm 12 and this may sound silly, but I allso enjoyed the love story. The ending was sad, but very well written and thought out. I think this book is realy wonderull and, unforunitly , Orwell didn't miss by to much."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a truly amazing book- probably the best I've ever read. Orwell keeps the reader interested from the very beginning by describing a world that is so different from our own, yet ironically it's a world we can all relate to. There is so much interesting detail on each page, you can ponder and debate every section of the book seemingly forever. From Winston's illegal diary in the corner of his room where he is hiding from the telescreen, to his torturous questioning in Miniluv where he is being brainwashed into thinking that two plus two is five, this is a superb book. Doubleplusgood."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I enjoyed this book back in 1984 when I 'HAD' to read it for a class project. I enjoyed the book then more as a work of science fiction. I just got a kindle and decided to re-read some older books that I had not purchased due to limited shelf space.Now that I read this book, I am struck by the warnings of what can come out of too much control in the hands of the few. One passage that really had me floored was...\\"...in the general hardening of outlook that set in about ...practices that had been long abandoned... imprisonment without trial...the use of torture to extract confessions... not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlighted and progressive.\\"This written almost 60 years ago! This book is a must read as the messages are just as relevent today."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is without a doubt one of the best books ever written. It shows the reader the consequences of having an authorative government going to the extremes in controlling the thoughts and actions of its citizens. 1984 also brings up in interesting idea about the reasons for wars. According to Orwell, wars are fought not to gain territory but to get rid of the excess of material and wealth the citizens create. Another way to look at the book is to take our contempary setting of today and see what would happen if people didnt stand up for their rights and beliefs and laid all their trusts and fears upon their government."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As hard as it is to say what the single best of most anything is, George Orwell's 1984 comes as close to that title as any I can think of. The vision he presents is so engrossing that one is left haunted. He gives the world he envisions such texture and reality that it almost becomes real. There is a reason this book is referred to so often: it represents many of our worst possible fears. The complete control over every facet of existence wielded by Big Brother over Winston and the rest of the polity is so frightening that the images conjured by this book are used even in contemporary politics."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's, \\"1984\\", is a classic and detailed adventure that will leave you asking for more. The story is set in London where Winston, the main character, works for big brother. But he soon finds himself questioning Big Brother and how he works.For a while Winston tried to blend in with the crowd and not really stand out. But when Winston starts to remember his childhood, he begins to question Big Brother. Winston soon finds himself wondering what life was like before big brother. But unless he takes a real chance, he has no way of changing anything.One flaw I found with the book was its detail. I like a lot of detail, but this book overdid it. I would soon found myself thinking about other things and not the book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's depressing look into the future is more possible today than it has ever been. Winston Smith, the book's main character, is continually watched by Big Brother, the face of the government he despises. War is continuous, love is outlawed, and Big Brother is religion.Winston Smith, a worker for the Ministry of Truth (or Minitruth in newspeak), goes to work everyday and falsifies records to make it look like Big Brother is always right. There are other ministries with names that contradict what they do. The Ministry of Peace (Minipax) deals with war. The Ministry of Love (Miniluv) deals with hate. Citizens are brainwashed not to notice what is going on. If they do, the government of Oceania wipes them out. Cameras are everywhere, microphones are everywhere, and spies are everywhere. George Orwell tells his tale in a way that makes it seem real, and in a while it very well may be.1984 not only gives an insight on what the government could be like, but the book is full of deceptive and interesting characters. Winston acts like Big Brother is god, but he really loathes him. Julia wears a belt that symbolizes chastity, but she sleeps with members of the Party. O'Brien is a member of the elite Inner Party, the group that controls Oceania, but he acts as though he is in cahoots with Goldstein, the enemy of Oceania. There are also plot twists and symbols in this book that make it even more interesting. This book is a must-read for anyone that cares about the future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is an inexpensive classic and a great read. I recommend this book for anyone interested in a great book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I enjoyed hearing this on a recent driving trip. The story is dark and depressing, but thought provoking, especially considering current governmental politics.The production quallity is good. It consists of one author reading without sound effects, and while men on audio books always sound rediculous reading in a faux woman's voice, that part is status quo.I bought this new, lent it to some freinds, then sold it on ebay. All in all a great book that I'm glad I read and a good deal in the end."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If there's one book you read to further your awareness of the politics of the world around you and the abilities of someone else to control your emotions and thoughts, read 1984. 1984 is essentially 2007, ---silent rivers run deep...in the Bush Regime.What becomes evident through reading the book is the fact that the real ruling people are not the puppets and appointed officials holding high positions. The people behind the curtains- the banking families in particular make the people in high positions subject to their own mercy.If you do some research you will find that high tech criminals count the USA's votes, and that as long as we retain a \\"democracy\\" where one man is on top and a select group of people are pulling his strings, anything you see on the news will follow the same model- governments within governments, and intercompetition between them. The philosophies of 1984 are more relevant now than never. Objective reality is governed by the media, and indifference is bred in people's minds to suit the avoidance of a possible utopia where every man is equal. \\"War is Peace\\" \\"Ignorance is Strength\\"Read this book or you may never know how powerful you/they are."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book relates the experiences of one Winston Smith in a world where all people belong to one of three totalitarian superpowers. In this dystopian novel, the state requires nothing less than the complete submission of individuals' inner thoughts. \\"The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about.\\" There is no escape (\\"Nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess.\\") and no practical hope for a free future where human rights would exist once more.The story is beautiful in parts--such as in the places where it deals with a forbidden love and an individual's struggle to maintain his identity--and incredibly hopeless in others. Orwell is an amazing writer and I spent a lot of time underlining different phrases and sentences. This book is frightening. As Erich Fromm writes in the afterword, \\"...it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too.\\" I recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites. Classic in every respect of the word. George Orwell's vision should be taken with a grain of salt, but look at all the striking similarities there are to the world that we live in. With all the recent and upcoming advances in science and technology we would do well to remember the world in 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book arrived in great shape. The theme of the book is so relevant to what I am experiencing in my chosen profession. \\"Big Brother\\" supervisors watching to make sure one does not upset their apple cart. Expectations are limited to resources available to the workplace. Racism and bullying is tolerated because independant thinking is no longer allowed; comformity is preferred."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I really liked this book. It is well written and it really made me think about the value of having privacy inside my own skull.

Maybe 2044 but at some point in the not too distant future, Orwell's prediction might actually have become a reality for the citizens of the world.It is incredibly easy to compare Oceania with North Korea, but with the NDAA, PATRIOT ACT and other Government measures \\"to keep us safe\\" there lies a very uneasy feeling that we as a society are heading down that same road.Scary but a classic must read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Amazing book, but really hard to get into at first I thought, but once you get past the bogged and clogged down and very over descriptive first quarter, a story and narrative finally emerge and you are sucked right into Winston and Julia's very touching but also very tragic love affair. From here on in it is quite simply a page turner and I challenge any one not to put the book down once this love affair begins."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The gloom and doom atmosphere that is pervasive throughout this story is awesomely put forth by George Orwell in his masterpiece of political fiction.It starts with the bit about the language that is being dummed down for the ordinary people so their vocabulary is kept restricted in order to keep them uninterested in higher thought such as philosophical ideas. The term he coined is \\"double-speak\\" whereby words are combined to express simpler thoughts, an effective method to wipe out entire concepts that could before be expressed in their full beauty.It ends with the electro-shock treatment of our \\"hero\\" who is inextricably trapped in the web of the government-machine. Not very uplifting but very thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A timelees classic. One of those books you keep forever on your bookshelf and take down every couple of years to read again, with just as much enthusiasm as the first time you read it. It shows that no matter how dark things get, there is always that spark of human endurance which finds some light, even if only for a limited time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Imagine... a world completely controlled by government. Nothing is kept private, and emotions are almost nonexistent. If you are considered different, you are killed. Sadly, Earth will soon come to this unavoidable fate, and George Orwell predicted this in 1949. Written from the perspective of a middle aged man who lives in the near future, \\"1984\\" by George Orwell is a compelling novel that describes what will become of the world. The story takes place in what is assumed to be future America, and the story is told by a character named Winston Smith. Smith works in a modern office building, and has a quiet life that he lives by himself. But one trait of Winston does make him unique from his peers. He secretly despises \\"Big Brother\\", the government figure that controls the world he knows. He dare not say anything of his feelings towards this subject, for if he shows any emotion, the Thought Police will erase his existence forever, making it seem like Winston Smith never existed. Yes, Smith is the type of man to never show what he is thinking, and the only emotion he displays is his fabricated love for \\"Big Brother\\", who is always watching. All of this changes as soon as Winston finds out a young girl named Julia is in love with him. Their love for each other is so dangerous and unheard of, that it fuels their hate for the government even more. The themes of this book are rebellion, sacrifice, and honestly, and I recommend \\"1984\\" for anyone looking for a good read. I believe it should be required in school curriculum, for it contains realistic, yet nightmarish visions of America's possible future. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate Orwell's work at a 8."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is a must-read classic. It is kind of scary to think that Orwell wrote this in the 1940s. It's a must-read for anyone, not just sci-fi lovers!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Just imagine a world in which the government controlled EVERY aspect of our lives. In George Orwell's 1984, the government does that and more. Not only are activities and living conditions controlled, but people's thoughts and even reality itself is under the control of the governmental party. The characters in this novel are very well created; from the mysterious and overwhelming Big Brother, to the main character - Winston - who is a simple office worker with a very complicated job. There is even a steamy romance thrown in there! This spooky tale of a negative utopia will have you deep in philosophical thought, as well as on the edge of your seat from suspense. I highly recommend it, definitely worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1948 novel \\"1984\\" depicts a nightmarish totalitarian society in which the government controls all aspects of a persons life.This novel follows Winston Smith, the protagonist. Winston's character is one which Orwell creates in order to evoke sympathy from the reader. I know that while reading this novel, at times I felt very bad for Winston and was really scared for which outcomes Winston was placed in. Orwell does this well by creating a gloomy atmosphere in the novel.Winston lives in Airstrip One, geographically known as London. Airstrip One is the textbook definition of a dystopia. It is a poverty stricken area with many people sick and living in ruins. Everywhere on the streets signs posted saying, \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" are present. This omnipresent aspect of the novel, \\"Big Brother\\" is what first begins to create a menacing environment for the novel.This novel was Orwell's idea of what a communist society would be like, and his idea is not only true, but it is one that is beginning to form in modern society. Written during the communist scare in the late 40s, Orwell prophesied that this would be what the world would come to in the near future. If one is to consider the mass movement in media and technology today, reading this book would make one question fear the direction that technology is headed. With webcams, tvs, phones, microphones, computers, and cameras of all different shapes, sizes, colors, and uses placed around every corner, Orwell's imaginative idea of the future might be more accurate than fiction. The government coming into total power using everything we take for granted against us could seem like a very plausible aspect of the near future!This fantastic novel provides excellent insight into what the government is actually capable of, AND, currently is DOING, such as in North Korea. The thought of this occurring though seems too dark, too scary, and too frightening to imagine-almost unreal.Orwell writes this novel in such a way that it has a fear factor to it. Although I quite love this, it might not be for those who are faint of heart. It's underlying message-that these events are highly plausible- might leave people scared and worried. This is because Orwell does not sugarcoat anything. He writes with cynical and harrowing details, presenting everything clearly and concisely. By the end of the novel, I was convinced that what had occurred to Winston was far worse than death.All the things we take for granted such as love, freedom, justice, and independence are alien concepts in \\"1984.\\" Any small instances of these ideas, and Orwell abolishes them from the text as fast as he can. Orwell seems to be destroying all of Winston's hopes throughout the novel. Every time Winston has a shred of hope that good will triumph over evil, Orwell goes out and makes it completely the opposite. He doesn't share this view that he creates for Winston, so he manages to also destroy it in his own character by the end of the novel. Orwell ensures that he will frighten you.I personally enjoyed \\"1984\\" both as a novel and as a possible warning for where the future is headed. Although it is a book which some people might find bleak, it is one that manages to get the authors point across. Orwell raises questions in his novel about government, mass media, and absolute control over mind, body, and soal. These questions really have no easy answer, and most answers still remain unclear. I believe \\"1984\\" is a must read for people, in order to understand how important their lives really are. You better get it in your hands now before \\"Big Brother\\" is watching you too...

It has plenty of current day predictions of invetions.

I just re-read the book and it still packs the wallop now as it did then. Perhaps even more so since one can see parts of this book coming true.This was required reading back in the day, and I am glad it was. A series of \\"Negative Utopias\\" such as Animal Farm, Farenheit 451, Brave New World warned of the dangers of societies where personal freedoms are lost, the individual and free spirit are crushed.These warnings and themes are ingrained in our speech today, which is a good thing. 1984 speaks of a world always at war, citizens are under constant surveillence, history is changed on a daily basis. It is a sharp criticism of Communism, Fascism or any government that restricts personal freedoms.It can be a depressing read, since the environment is dark, oppressive, gloomy and the sad ending is foreshadowed by the characters. But it has to be dark, because a society so stripped from freedom would be impoverished. Highly recommended for all High School students, for anyone who hasnt read this, and yes, for those who read it a long, long time ago."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is a dystopic novel. It describes a possible future world where totalitarianism completely controls the lives of the population, leaving no space for freedom, privacy, individuality etc. The novel is very often cited nowadays. Recent events, such as more video surveillance, making communication snooping legal, communist parties appearing in western countries, make the novel seem like a warning, as the world described therein is not unlikely to happen.I read the book as a non-native English speaker and found it easy to follow for my level (C1). I liked that the author invested a great effort to describe in detail the totalitarian world and the mechanisms which keep it alive. The horror of living in such a world is very well highlighted by showing experiences from a typical citizen.All in all, a must-read book, not necessarily because it entertains, but because it educates."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those.

Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.If he gets caught, he will be sent to the \\"Ministry of Love\\" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity.

Most of it I did pick up on though and I must say that I love the story as much as I love Orwell's intentions with this book. Much more graphic of a novel than I first expected, and humorous at the most unexpected times, I know now why this is a classic novel."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What is the most significant novel of the twentieth century? Justify your answer with specific examples.The 20th century produced a plethora of literary masterpieces. Choosing, and then asserting which novel is the most significant is supremely difficult - almost as difficult a choice as Abraham had when the Lord asked him to sacrifice his only son, Isaac. I personally love the mental stimulation in works of fiction. In particular I love the human drama and savage social criticisms that are found within fictional dystopias. As such, I believe the most significant novel of last century was \`1984' by George Orwell. The book addresses (and attacks) issues of authoritative governments, propaganda, sectorisation, thought control, social classes, as well as rebellion, and love and hate.As a novel, \`1984' is so highly regarded that it has been reprinted into some 65 world languages. This fact alone speaks volumes about the importance of this particular piece of literature. Orwell writes his novels for anyone who can read, albeit some people may find a dictionary necessary at times. By writing simply, Orwell doesn't exclude anyone from his novels.\`1984' is simply written, easily read and thoroughly brilliant. It is about government totalitarianism in Britain - but it could be about any country on the planet. The government in the book are a brutal regime that use lies, propaganda, and power to keep their citizens in a state of fear and subjugation. We have seen Orwell's sage words come true in various world governments; including Zimbabwe, and perhaps more poignantly, North Korea. In fact, the word \`Orwellian' stems from \`1984', and can be used to refer to any tyrannical government.Winston Smith is the main character in the book. He works for the government and his job is to write propaganda - including wiping out official facts, and embellishing government statistics. The world is broken down into three super-states, and the British government he is part of is in \`Oceania'. Here we see more future events scribed before the fact. Oceania can be regarded as similar to the modern day European Union. Currently, sectorisation is in progress all over the world. APEC, OPEC, the G20 and a host of other blocs and conglomerates reinforce this point.This literary masterpiece has been studied rigorously in various high school English classes all over the world, and this is testament to its significance as a novel. My high school used both \`1984' and Orwell's other classic, \`Animal Farm' as texts for senior English lessons. It is somewhat ironic though; that in the 21st century the \`Big Brother' concept has been turned into a smutty, distasteful television program.\`1984' is a book filled with human drama. It is about us not letting go of our democratic values, and making sure that we, the citizens, keep our governments transparent and accountable. It is about the courage of one man to rebel against tyranny, but sadly it also finishes with tyranny winning in the end. The book foresees actual historical events, and lets us know that dystopia is a possibility anywhere, anytime. \`1984' is used in many classrooms around the world - and some aspects of it are part of modern day popular culture. These facts, as well as the points already outlined make this book the most significant novel of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book was a little worn and was written in but it is just fine.We enjoyed reading the book and i will continue to buy from Amazon.It was here when you said it would be.Again thank you for your promptness."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Used book but in good shape.

It describes an entire world that has been corrupted, and the corruptors as well have made themselves blind to what they are doing. The story is well written and keeps you on edge for its entirety. Althought it leaves much to be figured out by the reader, it is extremely descriptive. Even if you follow the story closely, each new step is a shock, and every discovery will intrigue.

Life isn't interesting in this time. People disappear because they go up against the Party or even just thinking about it gets you in trouble. It was interesting and kept me reading just to find out what would happen revolting against the Party. It's a book that may drag for a while but a definite read till the end."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There are many reviews for this book, so I will not say what has been said so many times before.

There is no disease, and there is no jealousy of any sort. What would happen if there would be no thought allowed too? Would not this eliminate pain, worries, and jealosy? Would it be chaos, or would it create the ultimate utopian society? In the city of Oceania, one man would dare to question the paradisiacal utopian society which was created. Winston Smith was alive during the glorious revolution, when Big Brother and the Brotherhood commandeered control. From then on, there were three basic rules: war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Big Brother was supreme. If you uttered a word against him, you would be vaporized, and erased from society. Who controls the present controls the present controls the past. Those who control the future controls the present. Winston needs to find a way to end the reign of Big Brother, and time is running out. The Thought Police are coming for him, and by the time he finds how to vanquish them, it may be too late."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I believe George Orwell was a visionary, a bit imaginative, but very intelligent nonetheless. His views on individual privacy and freedom of thought in 1984 are a very serious issue.Freedoms are beginning to be limited in our country, whether in the form of tighter airline security or the banning of books in schools. What is next, the ultimate oppression of our thoughts? What would it take for a government to control thought?In 1984, the majority of Oceania's inhabitants are compliant with \\"Big Brother's\\" oligarchical totalitarianism. This greatly bothers me because I think that in the event of another devastating depression era, the world could again turn to radical forms of government, including ones similar to the principles of \\"Ingsoc\\" (English Socialism).Some say that society would never resort to supporting such a system; with this I must disagree. Take a look at leaders like Lenin, Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Society followed these destructive men regardless of what some knew then, but all know now. The people wanted change-needed it; they were desperate, and this will happen again.Will you be a denier? Ultimately, a system resembling Ingsoc will be an option, with thoughtcrime as its consequence. Do you wish to keep your privacy, your freedom to thing? I do."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I think that part of the impact of 1984 is lost now - I think it meant A LOT more to my parents growing up in the '60s.

Orwell was a wise, wise man...."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Terrifying Totalitarian Dystopia. 1984 is not a book. It is a muscle that grips the attention unrelentingly from first to last like a vice, rearranging your consciousness and perception. I pick this book up and cannot believe it is so light. Because, to read it is like the feeling Winston gets when he looks at the pyramidal headquarters of The Party: \\"It's too big. It can never be destroyed!\\"Orwell, more than any historian, made the greatest stain on the memory of Stalin with this book. 1984 poses the terrifying proposition of what would happen if insane leadership were not deposed as happened in Soviet Russia. It is also a euphoric, exhilarating plea for individuality. The right to think differently, the right to act differently. The simple, basic, human right to be an individual. Is there a more salient point to be made? I doubt it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"i thought the book 1984 was the most well written book ever"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book many years ago and have re-read it several times. This is a must-read for all who would dare to close their minds for it describes the end result of a dictatorial society in which no-one is allowed to think, speak or publish freely. The &quot;Thought Police&quot; will punish anyone trying to do so! It is an exciting storyline with a profound message. Yet, despite all our freedoms there are not many such thoughtful, newly written books on the store shelves these days. I would therefore, like to sincerely recommend one that issued recently. It too reminds us to keep an open mind and lend an ear to our global ecological mess. It is a sharp 21st century social critique in the form of an exciting, fun and enlightening science-fiction, entitled, &quot;ACCUSED BY FACET-EYES&quot; (C.B. DON) --- and just like &quot;1984&quot;, it too makes one stop to ponder about our many thoughtless human actions...but thank goodness that we have the freedom to do so!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Yes, this book is simple to understand by anyone. You do not need to be a philosopher or literature student. This book illustrates Orwell's vision of what would happen if humanity saught a utopian society. This is a book not of the pleasure and perfection we usually think about with utopian literature. It is the anti-utopia. This book will allow you to see humanity in it's true light.Orwell uses the ideals of 'the party', 'big brother' or a governmental power to illustrate his point on socialism. What ever Orwells means are, the fact remains that we can replace his governmental control with that of any particular group, and their need for complete power. It is the great agenda conspiracy. He makes his point. What I gather from the deeper meaning of this book is that humanity has an agenda. To gain power and create the world they wish it to be. Power is to be a God. This is the type of book that can be stripped down and analzyed page by page philosophically.The book is about a man named Winston. It is about his struggles to survive the world he exists in. A world where individuality, religion, unorthodoxy, love, compassion, and free thought are crimes punishable by torture and death. The party and big brother are all people in this world are to live for. They are not to live for themselves or their fellow humans. Hate is taught, war is life, the people are simply cogs in the party machine. They are worse than slaves, they are objects in the party's main goal...power."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There are only a few books that I believe should be on the required list for any student; this is one of them.1984 represents the world that we most feared; it is a world where pain is synonymous with living, and illusion is synonymous with progress.This book is designed to scare everyone who reads it into imagining a world where there is no such thing as personal freedom, there is no private property, and the ability to love is a crime against society.Prior to the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's, this was the staple vision of what we considered to be the future of Western Europe and Asia. It is this horrific vision of an all-comsuming and controlling State apparatus that keeps the reader thankful for what freedoms we do enjoy.Orwell elegantly argues that the true danger of the world is that people can be easily manipulated, controlled, and ultimately defeated in the struggle for individuality. Like its counterpart, Brave New World (by Huxley), Orwell creates a world in which individuality is not only lost, but humanity forgets that we ever had the capacity for it.Orwell masterfully describes every detail of this world, with the greatest care to the cold, and impersonal touch of opression. His arguments are both compelling and smattering of intense nuggets of rhetorical flavor; once you begin this book, you will not want to stop. Moreover, you will feel compelled to continue as you are drawn into the intense world of helplessness and despair that every fiber of your being will rage against. I urge any interested reader to dig into this book, and to finish it in one sitting if possible."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Viewed one way, George Orwell's work reads like a quasi-biography. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a man trapped in a totalitarian society whose first major act of the novel is to begin a diary, so that people in the future can piece together what his present was like and what the past was like, too. That, of course, is exactly what Orwell was doing: writing this novel as a warning to future generations. Orwell was not, as one earlier viewer noted, ahead of his time. He was very much a man of his time. The world during the period preceding and contemporaneous with his work was afire with the sorts of totalitarianism - Nazism, Communism, well-intentioned but disastrous Keynsian socialism - descibed in this work. F.A. Hayek's book (\\"The Road to Serfdom\\") on the threat socialism was to basic human freedom, which may or may not have influenced this work, came out around the same time. Orwell makes it personal. And he reminds us, rightly & properly, to fear anyone who would bend and distort the truth for their own purposes. When others fear the truth WE have reason to fear THEIR motives. We have, of course, seen this recently: the college newspapers refusing to print an anti-reparations ad or the theft and destruction of conservative newspapers on college campuses. No one who genuinely believes in the validity of their argument need fear the effects of dissent: if wrong, it still helps them to clarify their argument; if right (presuming they care for the truth), it serves as a valuable course correction.Orwell's novel also serves to show the importance of organizations - civic groups, churches, even corporations - as a bulwark against government power. Without them, the government can quickly crush any individual it deems a threat. A lone voice in a large country is seldom heard. The freedom of assembly allows men to magnify their voices. In this novel there is nothing that stands between the government and its citizens. When the government is able to bend any group to its will (think of the lawsuits against the Boy Scouts or the Rotary Club), nothing stands in its way, and the end is truly near.Given the dreariness of the movie I was rather scared to pick up this famous novel - I was 12 when that red letter year came around, and I wholly remember the hype. But through the depressing storyline the personal struggle of Winston Smith shines through. And so does the storyline of mankind itself."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is a real kick in the face for anyone who has read it. Especially if you are in the middle of an instituition (prison or school...is there a difference) and have grown up hating beuracrats.

I first read it in 1984 and had a lot of fun picking out the items he got correct. I reread it recently and it is even more fun. The writing is not real uplifting, but all in all it is a good book. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell writes beautifully of the horrors of a future withoutthought, without love, without language. This book is aboutthe erasing of memory and with it the human soul. Finally wehave the articulation of pure hell where a human beingis likened to a cockroach . . . watched, forever, watched."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Even though George Orwell was a socialist he chronicled totalitarian socialism in this book and he like most socialists did not realize that is exactly where all socialism ends up and is where we are all headed.He coined things like big brother is watching you, newspeak, thoughtcrime and doublethink...and thoroughly goes over what a socialist society does to language to limit thought, and the ability to discuss any idea in order to stop treats to its self or even simple changes much less a full revolution.Have you noticed all the cameras the government (Big brother) is putting up all over the last 10 to 15 years?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"While 1984 is now considered a cautionary tale about totalitarianism, it should be remembered that Orwell was an ardent socialist. Perhaps the most important (and least discussed) element of the story of 1984 is the doublethink of its author: Orwell's ability to condemn an outcome, while advocating its cause. Even as Orwell portrayed the corruption of socialist government in Animal Farm and the cruelty of totalitarian government in 1984, he insisted that these are perversions of socialism, rather than the inevitable fruit of socialism.This is the same foolish idea as Marx had; that human nature is malleable and can be forced to adapt to a socialist zeitgeist. Sadly, many people suffer the same delusion today; believing that government has the right to mold human nature rather than the responsibility to yield to human nature and respect our natural rights. Socialists do not like that human nature opposes slavery (i.e. socialism) and insist that with enough socialist indoctrination and through the force of socialist government, human nature can be remade to love subjugation.When we look to the troubling conclusion, it appears to be a break from the tradition of a successful resolution for the hero of the novel. Just as Brave New World ended with the State purging its misfits from its midst, 1984 ends with the arrest and reeducation of its misfit. Could it be that this was a successful conclusion in the mind of a socialist? Could it be that socialists are so wedded to their ideology that they have lost the ability to sympathize with human rights to liberty and freedom of conscience and would rather sympathize with the State? What if the ending reveals that the hero of a socialist novel was never meant to be the individual; is the hero in fact the State?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Classic book, should be read by everyone, a cultural keystone of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It was sad reading this book because more and more of Orwell's fiction is becoming reality with each passing day (with people gladly surrendering their freedom for feelings of \\"security\\" since September 11, 2001).By reading all the reviews, a prospective reader will know who Winston Smith is, what he does for a living, what got him into \\"trouble\\" with the Party, etc. But what one can't grasp from these reviews is seeing what Winston goes through in his \\"re-education,\\" that is his brainwashing in order to toe the Party line again.I never suspected old Mr. Charrington as a member of the Thought Police (who set Winston up from the door) and his \\"comrade\\" O'Brien was a real piece of work. While in the Ministry of Love, when O'Brien told Winston that his mind was like his only Winston was insane, I thought, \\"How delusional we are.\\" But, then again, \\"What can you do...against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy.\\" (page 234)So many of the things that Orwell wrote in 1949 have turned into fact. The far right religious and political folks have used \\"1984\\" as their blueprint for absolute and total hatred (whether intentional or not). One of the requirements of being in the Party is that a member was prohibited from learning foreign languages or having any contact with a foreigner at any time (other than to see them rolled by as prisoners). Maybe that's because \\"If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similiar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies.\\" (page 174)This should be required reading for everyone and a blueprint on how to reject an absolute dictatorship bent on complete mind control and historical alterations."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"So I guess after Suzanne Colins wrote The Hunger Games a bunch of other people decided to write reality show books because they wanted to make lots of money too.

But in the book which I guess got taken from Big Brother show, its like a countrywide reality show and everyone is trapped in the country which instead of Jersey Shore is called Oceania so I guess its set in Australia or something?

In the mean time people talk really wierd because its the future even though the book is 1984 which was like 30 years ago. Way before I was born. So why do they make us read it in school? Like none of it actualy happened even though I don't remember the 80's.What I didn't get about the book is why people don't just say whatever Big Brother wants them too so they can stay out of room 101. Like you have to say that two and two are five, and red and blue make orange, but you have to actually believe it which is really confusing. Even though his girlfriend Julia says they should just make stuff up like the government wants, winston who is the main character tries to start a rebelion. he just ends up getting attacked by giant rats or something.

The government is fighting a never ending war against Eurasia (a.k.a. East Asia). The society is repressed and very poor. They are constantly making war machines and mutitions for the ever growing army. One citizen (Winston) slowly learns about the shame his life is and tries to break free from the government's control (Big Brother). Winston's job is a that of a writer. He gets to make the news and other human interest stories. Life is mundane and dry for Winston until he meets the woman of his dreams. Can Winston survive the brutal regime of Big Brother? Is their really a war? Is this novel worth buying? Check out 1984.Sadly this novel is becoming true, Many parellels can be found, Oceania's public enemy number one is a figure named Goldstein (Osama Bin Laden). No one knows if he's alive or even real. The war against Eurasia a.k.a East Asia (Terrorism). Is this war even necessary or worth it? The ever increasing threat of an unseen enemy. Revision and dumbing down of historical events. Enemies of Oceania (United States) shipping enemies of the state to the ministry of love (Gitmo).

I would recommend EVERYONE READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is one of the most important books ever written. Many people in the world think that Orwell was a hypocrite of everything, but in truth he was a genius who saw the numerous corruptions that go on every day and was able to predict what they would end up as.In the book he highlights many important factors of the human mind and shows why the one aspect of greed is the most dominant in all humans. Don't listen to what other people say about communism or how it's just another simple criticism of Stalinist society. The story takes place in Britain, not Russia! Orwell challenges the ability of humans to be good-natured and not become completely absorbed with power.1984 highlights how the government can keep you blind to things that are going on all around you and can make you believe something that can't be proven without a doubt. You don't know for sure that the Civil War happened the way people say it happened, when it happened, why it happened, how it happened and where it happened, because you weren't there. Orwell shows this in the book very well."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Pros: This book seemed to be a science-fiction book about the future, but in truth, it was a sci-fi symbolism of totalitarianism in Orwell's time. Yet, this book is so timely today! It reminded me of the way Bush and friends control our thoughts with smart words; GOOD Americans believe in the war and TRAITORS believe in other causes. We should always keep our own opinion and forget the always-swaying popular opinion. And that was just ONE of the many things I learned from this great book! I highly suggest this book.Cons: It was a bit repetitive and it's a very heavy read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"One is easily gripped by the horror and turmoil of 1984. George Orwell's novel about a totalitarian state and how it, the government, controls all the people of the state and tries to control thought. The book had a subtle and interesting plot. Orwell's characters generally demonstrated the emotions received within the context of the story. Winston, Orwell's protagonist, acted as a human trying to hold on to what makes him human his, emotions and ability to think freely. Now could a totalitarian state exist as it is portrayed in 1984? Yes, it could occur if we as humans do not fight for the liberty indebted to us by God. We fight totalitarianism by proper education, proper families, and proper participation in society. If nothing, else the message one should get from the book is to simply vote. If we as humans do act lackadaisical with our participation in the democratic governments, then we could lose the freedoms our fore fathers fought so hard to win. That is why one should read this book. One does not have to like what 1984 says or represents. Readers should then learn that &quot;Action is Freedom&quot; and stop a totalitarianistic societies from existing. As a literary work I thought the 1984 was a little too wordy and unfortunately forced up high school students. The ending is not what I hoped for, but none-the-less I think people should read this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Okay, this review will have spoilers, I am sorry, but it's the only way I feel I can make my point. I will say, without spoiler, that this book could have been amazing. I gave it two stars because the writing was very detailed. I could see it. I knew what the hall looked like, the house, the coral. I KNEW what he was seeing. But two stars is all I'm giving for that, and here's why... I followed this book, I felt the build up and the suspense, I loved it four stars worth... &lt;spoiler> until he started reading Goldstein's book. That's when the story began to fall apart, when I realized that there wasn't going to really be a story at all.At this point, it really felt like Orwell wrote everything up until then just so he could give a long drawn out speech about a society that could have been and if it had been, it would suck. And I think I may have still clung on to liking the book, I would have overlooked the lecture part, if at the end, there was something to walk away with, some point to the story other than 'if this happens, it will be bad'. Yeah, it would. But this is a book, give me more than a lecture. There were just so many parts that I could not get on board with.Let's start with his meeting with O'Brien. O'Brien told him that there would be no group meetings, there was not an organization. Winston would take his orders from O'Brien, himself, or maybe one or two other people. Though Winston held high suspicions of everything and everyone throughout the book, why not even a slight apprehensiveness here? Why not question why he might have to throw acid into a child's face or spread a venereal disease? If you are questioning everything about your society and world, why blindly grasp on to this line of reasoning without even asking about it? I understand that you are raised with a different set of standards and understandings, but you are telling me that you are suspicious of EVERYTHING else, but that this line of talk seems acceptable to you, and that you should blindly accept it? No questions? No sneaking worry that perhaps something is not right?And Julia in all of this? In earlier conversations, she had stated quite clearly that she had no desire to rebel like this. She wanted to rebel mentally and sexually, but that was all. And yet, he denounced everything for her, he said that she would also throw acid in baby's faces. She only spoke up when it came to them separating. Why? She was a strong woman earlier, very strong in her stance on only being a rebel from the waist down. She knew that his form of rebellion is suicide. But now, in the presence of O'Brien, she was mousy. She apparently wanted this too and had not a word to say otherwise. Why? Why, Julia, did you abandon EVERYTHING you had previously said, wanted, felt... and done it blindly without discussion?Then came the book of boredom. I kept waiting to read something to the effect of \\"so the government using mind control by lacing the Victory gin and using subliminal messaging in the Tele's\\" but no. Just Socia-Political garble again.Okay, so then they were caught. And it was O'Brien that was the Thought Police. Saw that coming after the meeting. And they start torturing Winston, okay... but why? O'Brien says to make you back to a good little follower so we can kill you then, as a believer... You know, because that's how we do it. We go through all this time and effort for no real end effect, just to kill you after you re-convert.Oh, and somehow, we can actually read your mind. Huh?And in the end, what was that? He was a good little lazy boy? What was the point of the whole thing? Of him knowing society and the government was wrong? Of him loving Julia? Of any of it? Why tell me a story like that? If not one single thing came of it, what was the point? There was nothing to hold on to, in the end. If, let's say, he was that shell of a man, but had constant dreams of Julia, his perfect love, though he could not recall who she was... only the feeling of that perfect happy... I could hold on to that. If, he died with her name on his lips, I could hold on to that. If she turned out to be the bad guy, or O'Brien turned out to be the jackass he is but was ALSO Goldstein, or Goldstein was actually Big Brother, or anything that was actually a twist, a plot, or somehow monumental or even pretty big, I could hold on to that. But this story just ended kinda blah. It was just 'This guy thinks the government is wrong. He realizes they are jerks. Some hot chick likes him and they get together. He then makes a friend from work who he thinks hates the government too. He promises to do mean things to get back at the government if his friend asks him to. But what? His friend ends up being a governmental prick and torturing him until he really likes the government. Then, he doesn't like his girlfriend anymore and he gets to drink gin all the time and the government doesn't change at all, and the girlfriend doesn't really like him anymore either. The end.' Where is the story in that?And I know! I get flak because it's revolutionary and deep and BIG BROTHER and all that. But I'm holding my ground on this one. Two stars at MOST!Ug"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This 1949 classic has lost none of its punch. With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s.The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted. This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read. The founders of our Constitution would be appalled at the current state of the USA and what the Bush cabal is doing to it/us.The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden. Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible in light of our dyslexic Bushisms.It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it. To bad it can't be updated with all the words our low IQ president has created.Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us. But with the Patriot Act, the boldness is destroying our Constitution.Here's how 1984 applies to current events:WAR IS PEACEThe new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;FREEDOM IS SLAVERY&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are losing many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHAmerica's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you.

Orwell has brought to light a situation that any society could potentially face if they aren't cautious. The main character Winston Smith lives in a totalitarian state to the \\"Party,\\" the dictators of the colony of Oceania. What makes this book so fascinating is the fact that is was published in 1948. Yet, the situations in this book still ring true today. Freedoms are constantly trying to be suppressed; privacy is a concern in today's society with the creation of the internet and cameras. It's remarkable to think that Orwell predicted a society that could potentially be an example for today's culture. Trying to imagine a world where every move you make is recorded and watched to control is not only terrifying because it sounds like it could happen, it's terrifying because one day it may eventually happen. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it as a book that should be read in high school."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is the sort of book that one should not read when feeling hopeless, or with cold, gloomy weather outside. I can say this with certainty, because I was a senior in high school for the first part, and we had one of those cloudy late-winter days for the second part.Having said that, I have to say that this was an excellently written book, with its characters clearly portrayed without becoming cartoonish. The points raised in the novel were horrifyingly believable, and were just the sort of thing to grind off unrealistic ideals in youngsters... and sharpen other ideals.No, I didn't enjoy this book at all - and I am very glad that I read it, and I recommend it to anyone who believes that \\"everything that a government desires is necessarily good.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"From the very first sentence to the last, this book held me on with wide eyes of horror and enthrallment, and a mouth drawn stupidly open at the books prophetic, almost clairvoyant vision of the future, at the magnificent power it holds within the text, the pages. When I finished, I closed the book, put it aside, and went to bed. It had such a profound, powerful, overwhelming effect on me, that I could not really think straight; it was overall depressing, and it left me spellbound. And I know, if you read it, it will leave you the same way too.The year is 1984.The world is now divided into only 3 main sections: Eurasia, Eastasia, and Oceania--the main setting of the story. There is no such thing as the U.S.A. or Canada or Australia or China anymore. It's all in those 3 divided places: Eurasia, Eastasia, and Oceania.The entire world is under the terrible, unbreakable grip of totalinarialism.Theres communism, of course...and theres totalinarialism...which is very much worse. While communists control most aspects of life for their people...totalinarialism controls ALL aspects of life for their people...and now in 1984, I don't know if it is sane or rational to call them 'people' anymore...it would be more fitting to call them, their 'slaves.'Everything is controlled by the Party or the main government system, with Big Brother, an ominous, mysterious creature being at the top of everything. Big Brother is eternal. Big Brother is invincible. Big Brother never dies. Big Brother will never die. Big Brother is watching you. Everywhere you look, every corner you possibly turn, everywhere you are, he is listening...and watching you...watching you to see if you make any mistakes, break any rules. If possibly, you are against the party, against Big Brother. To see if you commit any 'thought crimes', which are negative thoughts towards the party and Big Brother or thoughts of rebellion and rivalry towards them. They scan every possible inch of your face. From the emotion flickering in your eyes, from the gesture of your mouth and nose and skin contractions, from the actions of your throat...to see if there is any evil, any rebellion, any thoughts of hate toward the Party. For the party is invincible. Big Brother is invincible. They control you. You must obey them. Or else.But even if the thought police somehow don't catch you in the act of thought crime, there are always your sons or daughters, who will turn you in. There is no morality anymore in 1984. There is no sanity. There is no rationality. There is no freedom. That is all in the past...and the past is long gone forever.Now everything is based on these three rules of the Party:WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTHwhich are all examples of 'doublethink'(which I will explain a little later).It is the year 1984. And by then all Hell has broken loose...There is no such thing as 'plain English' anymore. That is known now in 1984, as 'Old Speak.' Now, there is something new and better and more efficient; something invented by the Party so that people will have less ways of speaking and writing and comprehending words; thus less thougths; thus again, less possibilities of negative, rebelling thoughts toward the Party. And that is Newspeak. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, and to put it basically, is a deeply cut down and edited version of English or 'Old Speak.'For example, there are no adverbs anymore(quietly, peacefully, quickly, profoundly, words mostly ending in ly)and there are no synonyms of normal, everyday words, such as, 'splendin' or 'wonderful' or 'magnificent' all rooting back to the same thing; the same word; the same meaning, which is 'good.' Instead, to describe something 'very good' or as we call it, 'excelling' or 'exceptionally good', great in fact--they add a plus to the word good, to magnify it, if it needs it. Thus plusgood or very good, or doubleplusgood, meaning very very good, great, and so on.Every year more and more words are edited swifly and more and more words are 'vaporized' forever from the language--thus less words, less thoughts. In every way you could imagine, the Party, ultimately Big Brother is controlling all aspects of life, from the language, the way you talk, your thoughts, the way you think--with Doublethink(a mind technique where 2 contradictings thoughts come into one, and you accept both. For example, lets say you were a boy in actuality, but you used doublethink to think you are a girl, always have been a girl since you were born. You would need to have those 2 contradictings thoughts: \\"I am a girl\\" even though deep inside somewhere, you know \\"I am a boy\\", at once, accepting both. It even takes you to use doublethink in order to understand the concept, in the first place)where you live, always watching and listening what you are doing, and everything else in between. Life, humanity--mankind, as we know it--is going down the drain; blinded by pride, jealousy, selfishness. Trying to keep their audience as far from the truth of things, by keeping them afraid, paranoid, controlled; always with the sense of being watched and heard. Always.Now comes the protagonist of this horrific tale; Winston Smith. He is a middle-aged man, with a varicose ulcer on his ankle, and works for the Ministry of Truth. Or in actuality, since that is of course, an example of 'doublethink', it should be called, instead, 'The Ministry of Lies.' He is a reasonably normal, lonely, distraught man, with a secret. Which is a thought crime. He hates Big Brother. He hates the party. He wants to bring Big Brother down. He wants to bring down the party down. Down with Big Brother! he had written over and over in his diary. Down with Big Brother!When he meets O'Brien, one of his co-workers, his dream comes closer to actuality being commited to reality, and when he once again, meets the love of his life, Julia--the space from his dream and reality is magnified again, and so, he is one rung higher up the ladder from achieving what he wants. Which is, to throw down the party, to throw down Big Brother. Down with Big Brother!But the party is invincible...Big Brother is invisible...He is always watching...Always listening....no matter what........Big Brother is watching you.Although 1984, has long come and gone, Orwells nightmare vision of the future of man fate, under the terrible grip of totalinarialism and it's nasty results, stay as timely as ever, standing all by itself, as one of the greatest novels of all time.Like how it was quoted from the front flap of a hardcover edition of this book:\\"As timely as the label on a bottle of poison.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Well I'm not going to waste time Kudo'ing on this douple-plus-genius classic. Suffice to say it was shattering to read over 25 years ago and mores' the pity if it not being taught at the High School level today.IF you want to gauge a person, simple draw a quote from the book and ask them: 'What is the definition of Power?'...State Orwells' answer as: 'The ability to make someone suffer'..and watch the person stiffen and change the subject..It is a piercing expose on the Human condition that could have been foiled with a single word as the protagonist 'Smith' was being interrogated: 'Do you believe in God'...he responds 'No.'. That answer, despite your religion/faith/higher-power beliefs resonates that the entire 'Negative Utopia' his tormentors, quite successfully present, could have been negated. Smiths' obliteration foiled if he was only able to respond differently..Thank goodness we'll never have a Ministry of Truth like the one protrayed in the novel. Reich-Protecter maybe?Read it, Know it, Remember it and finally..Have a little Faith!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"Big Brother is watching!\\" This phrase has been so popularly used that the meaning is now synonymous with issues like \\"manipulation of truth\\", \\"violation of privacy\\", \\"conspiracy theory\\", etc. \`1984' is a cleverly written political satire often induced with dark humour, exploring life in a would-be fascist-like totalitarian future where everyone was being monitored and compelled to keep in line ('thoughtcrime' is a crime!), where the individual could no longer differentiate between truths and lies (through the practice of \`doublethink'), where history was being constantly re-written to suit the prevailing political agenda, where language had been simplified to the point of uselessness (through Newspeak), where war had to be kept ongoing to reduce economic surplus so that the population could be held under control, and where party ideology had absolute power over a society dominated by fear, suspicion and distrust.We follow the story of Winston Smith, one who disagreed with the party and was secretly envisioning a different kind of life without being under the ever-watchful eye of Big Brother. His hatred for Big Brother and his attempt at joining the rebelling Brotherhood ultimately ended in tragedy and he was captured, tortured and brainwashed. Orwell's gloomy depiction of life in Oceania (his future version of London) is realistic and convincing. The last section of the book is especially thought provoking and really sends chill to the spine. Overall, Orwell's vision of the future in 1984 is intense and highly disturbing. Although we all know by now that our 1984 (dominated by the MTV/big-hair/yuppie culture) has occurred very differently and that the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s marked the final triumph of liberal-democracy over socialism/Marxism, Orwell's \`1984' remains relevant today as a warning against a post-global age of resurging absolutism and religious fundamentalism. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" is the kind of novel that could possibly go unnoticed if given the choice to read it or another, more recent novel. However, after reading British novelist Eric Blair's (pseudonym \\"George Orwell\\") second novel, I am compelled to hail it as one of the best books that I have ever read.Orwell's infamous dystopia begins with the main protagonist, Winston Smith, climbing up a flight of stairs, his varicose ulcer hurting the whole way up. (Ironically, even his name is a readily apparent contradiction [one of many in \\"1984\\"]; his first name is that of the famed British prime minister and statesman Winston Churchill, but his last name is the most common last name in the English language. In that, he is both uncommon and common.) Smith works for the Ministry of Truth- which (can you sense the irony) produces most of the lies that the world of Oceania readily and blindly accepts as fact.His real problems begin when he receives a note from a coworker (or \\"comrade\\", as Inner Party members are required to refer to each other as), Julia (no last name, just Julia) saying just three words (which could automatically get her arrested by the horribly invasive Thought Police): \\"I Love You.\\" They meey many times throughout the novel and actually succeed in making love a few times. (Since the Party wants to destroy all vestiges of true love in its members' lives, Winston and Julia's overt acts of rebellion [i.e. the sex] are the ultimate blows against the society of Oceania.)But, like all things, their romance was not to last. Mr. Charrington, the person from whom Winston and Julia were renting their room (above his second-hand store), turns out to be a member of the Thought Police,and takes Winston off to be \\"healed\\". Through a brutal series of torture sessions from O'Brien, his supposed friend, he learns to \\"love Big Brother\\".Orwell's satire against the former Communist stranglehold on the nation of Russia is a clear reminder of what could happen if love and absolute truth are taken out of the picture and the government is given complete control over the lives of its citizens."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Oh my God, is all i could say as i read this. I was trembling at the power that this book possesed, abosolutly tremblingYou cant understand the magnitude of this book until you have read it. No one can portray this book to the ultimate power it posseses. I cant say it was beautiful, for even though it was beautiful, it was also hideous. Where it was genius it was simple and absurd. Where it was meaningful it was also meaningless. There was strength in what was said and also in what was not said. It was powerful though, never was it weak or declining in a solid purpose.I will tell you one thing though, never read this book if you are a person who feeds off the illusion of false hope, for your comforts are not in this tale. This is a reality that may not be completely true, but do trust me, so much of it is true.The question of life and existence is revealed when Winston is told in the tower of Love that he is the last man alive. So cruel and unhumane the treatment he recieved as he watched his decrepit body in the mirror. It was horrible, but also so powerful, i use that word alot becuase there is not another with the same sense that power leaves in our minds.I can only say that if you wish for truth you must read 1984and you will be left with the same impression,Oh My God"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I just re-read 1984. I had first read it some 40 years ago. It has lost none of its power and brilliance.The book is short by contemporary standards. You can get through it in one day. Notwithstanding its brevity, Orwell paints a rich and enrapturing picture of a bizarre and brutal world. You find yourself drawn into it - believing it. It is as if you are \\"there\\", trapped in a truly psychotic police state known as \\"Oceania\\". You find yourself fearing the things that the protagonists - \\"Winston\\" and \\"Julia\\" - fear as if you were experiencing their lives.The world that Orwell describes is strange to the point of being surreal. Nonetheless, he plays out the failings of the human condition with such brilliance, that you end up believing such a world could actually come to be. Even more importantly, you recognize elements of \\"1984\\" in ordinary day to day life. That is the reason why this book is such a masterpiece. Orwell - in truth - doesn't fantasize but rather hypothesizes a world where recognizable human weaknesses have synergized into mass insanity. He makes it believeable.In short, 1984 is one of the truly great accomplishments of twentieth century literature. It is the type of book that could affect a reader - as it did with me - for an entire lifetime."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"+++++This novel by George Orwell (whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair, 1903 to 1950) is about the effects of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism is a characteristic of a government or state in which one political party maintains complete control under a dictatorship and bans all others.This story, which takes place in London in 1984, follows one man (named Winston Smith) and his love interest (Julia) as they struggle against this totalitarian party (\\"The Party\\") whose leader (actually dictator) is \\"Big Brother.\\" The Party political orthodoxy rules the giant country of \\"Oceania\\" (in which London is located).At the heart of this party's political orthodoxy is the process of controlling thought through the manipulation of language and information by the use of \\"Newspeak\\" which utilizes what is called \\"doublethink.\\"Newspeak is the official language of Oceania (but is not the only language spoken). It is a language that eliminates unnecessary words and is designed to diminish rather than help expressive thought. For example, Newspeak states that there is no good and bad but only good and \\"ungood.\\" Doublethink is the ability to simultaneously hold two opposing ideas in ones mind and believe in them both. The three Party slogans that title this review are examples of doublethink. Another good example is that (2+ 2 =4) and (2 + 2 = 5).The Party keeps everybody in line through Newspeak and doublethink. But they also have other methods. For example, they have the \\"Thought Police\\" that investigate \\"thoughtcrimes.\\" These are \\"crimes\\" of just having negative thoughts about The Party. Another example are telescreens that watch your every move even in bathroom stalls. Thus, \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" at all times.Winston and Julia are discovered to be guilty of thoughtcrimes by O'Brien (who is the personification of The Party). O'Brien also represents those leaders who use cruelty and torture as their primary method of control (like Hitler and Stalin did). He makes them pay for their \\"crimes.\\"This novel clearly shows how totalitarianism negatively affects the human spirit and how it's impossible to remain freethinking under such circumstances.This novel also contains an appendix written by Orwell. Here he explains various aspects of Newspeak and to my surprise he states that by the year 2050, Newspeak will be the only language that anyone will understand. Why does he state this? He wanted to keep the fear of totalitarianism alive in his readers well past the year 1984. (Thus, this novel is still quite relevant for today!)Finally, this novel in a word is fascinating! It is well written and is filled with symbolism and imagination. It begins slow but gradually picks up speed. And the story is very interesting.In conclusion, this novel is a masterpiece of political speculation that serves as a warning to us all. Read it for yourself to see why it brought Orwell world-wide fame!!(first published 1949; 3 parts or 24 chapters)+++++"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"While many of the concepts in George Orwell's 1984 are complex to the point of being implausible, I believe there to be a sense of pragmatism in the text. It's as if Orwell is simply notating an absurd universe that he knows to be true, as if he were Nostradamus predicting the future. I definitely believe that there is a large degree of truth to the novel, just that our society today is much better than 1984's at masking the control factor. Amazon reviewer Daniel Hintzsche wrote, \\"George Orwell created a...chillingly credible dystopia. In our deeply anxious world, the seeds of unthinking conformity are everywhere in evidence; and Big Brother is always looking for his chance.\\" I absolutely agree with Hintzsche on this. I believe that there are many similarities between our seemingly perfect society and the totalitarian dystopia created in 1984.In another review, James P. Brett compares the book directly to today's government. He compares the \\"Two Minutes Hate\\" to the American reaction to Osama bin Laden. This comparison is eerily undeniable. In both instances, a political leader is revered almost to the point of idolatry, and an opposition to that leader is hated with a passion. It is far more obvious in 1984, but the similarity is indubitable.1984 does not, however, simply apply to today's society. The universal themes of the novel aren't restricted to the current decade. As reviewer Guy Tedesco states, \\"No matter what stage of life I am at the book reflects the times we live in. Politicians never change and always practice the art of deception.\\" If you were to have read this book when it was written, you would have compared it to communism, and Nazis. If you were to read this book in the seventies, you could have constructed detailed conspiracy theories. Or, you could even read it now, and compare it to the Bush administration, and the War on Terror. This novel is always relevant to the times, and will never cease to be.In conclusion, I think this book is very pertinent to our society, and should be read by everyone. It is a chilling dystopia that might just inspire us to go out and change the world for the better. Maybe...just maybe."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I thought the book 1984 was great.

For my taste, the author too clearly delivers these points...doesn't leave enough of the wrenching analysis and thought formation to the reader. Some points are so blatantly delivered I couldn't help but cringe, look away from the text, and say &quot;ohh man...&quot;.Not nearly as elegant as Huxley in Brave New World."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Like with Brave New World, 1984 is and inside look to the Progressive Collectivist mindset. Again, all the concepts are there: collectivism, propaganda, control, government as God. Big Brother has arrived."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's most well-known novel may have changed the English language, but that doesn't save it from being a somewhat overrated work of fiction.First, the positives: Orwell is an excellent writer as such - the prose is perfectly fine, transparent, and readable. His critique of Soviet language-terrorism (the &quot;newspeak&quot; of the novel) is dead-on. There are moments of great tension, and the atmosphere of terror is effectively maintained throughout.However, the prose can also be pretty bland, and Orwell can't resist the urge to get overly didactic to make some of his points (take, for example, the interrogation, which sometimes reads more like a propoganda pamphlet than a novel). His characters are dull at best - and as his ironies get more sadistic, they lose all interest. He's so desperate to make his point that it becomes overkill.But in the end, the major failing is that Orwell denies the novel any humanity, or any sense of human warmth. In a novel that is supposed to serve as a warning about the cold regimentation of society, we need an author who's not guilty of the same cold, formulaic approach as the society as he criticizes - otherwise the whole point is undermined. If mental, emotional, and physical freedom are really the powerful (and playful) forces Orwell claims they are, then we as readers need to feel this - but Orwell is incapable of cracking a smile. As D.H. Lawrence said of Melville: &quot;One wearies of the grand serieux. There's something false about it... Oh dear, when the solemn ass brays! brays! brays!&quot;It's not simply a matter of form following fuction (bland prose for a bland society): I'd highly recommend reading Zamyatin's novel &quot;We&quot;, which - let's face it - Orwell practically ripped off. The key difference is that Zamyatin allows those things like humor, love, and playfulness to sneak in through the cracks... before they're crushed by the totalitarian state around them. While Orwell delivers a &quot;message,&quot; Zamyatin delivers a novel. You'll be surprised how much more effective, moving, infuriating, and clever Zamyatin's approach is, why Orwell borrowed so much from it, and why 1984 pales in comparison.So: read it for entertainment, if you enjoy dystopian literature. Its influence has been enormous, and there are things to enjoy. But feel free to laugh at Orwell's pretentions: it's your right."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Amazon offered 1984 for its Kindle E-book reader, but then the electronic version's publisher decided it didn't want to make the book available that way. So Amazon deleted the book from the Kindles of customers who had already purchased it and credited their accounts. A small problem: what about annotations people had made on the book for their term papers? A big problem: what if I buy a book by a liberal and Amazon decides they only like books by conservatives, so they delete the book from my player? This is a despicable action, and I will be boycotting Amazon until they publicly change their policy. There are plenty of places to buy books online."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A case can certainly be made that 1984 is the greatest novel ever written. We know that the Modern Library infamously dubbed Ulysses the greatest novel of the last century even though most people find it completely unreadable. Too many critics and members of the intelligentsia equate impenetrability with greatness, probably thinking that the greatest novels must be aimed only at the gifted few.1984 lacks snob appeal and it is shockingly readable. I guess this is why it gets dissed with the #13 ranking on that list. Of course, my own criteria are different. In my opinion, the greatest novels should at the very least be great reads. Nothing is more audacious or ambitious than setting out to write a page turner that happens to carry a thought-provoking and devastating message. Or, put another way, what's the point of burying your message in a book that no one can read? I've never read Ulysses, but I think I can say that 1984 is simply a better novel because part of what a novel must do is thread its message through a plot that the reader actually can and wants to follow.1984 is a thriller. It is part sci-fi and part fantasy. But of course its is meant to convey the feel of an actual political system that dominated half the globe at the time of its writing. Unlike Animal Farm, which is kind of a roman a clef of the Russian Revolution, the events and characters of 1984 are not meant to correspond directly to events and persons in the Soviet Union in the late 40's. Big Brother is, of course, Stalin. But that comparison is easier to make in retrospect since no Soviet leader was nearly as Big Brother-like as Stalin. But I imagine that Big Brother is meant to evoke any totalitarian leader rather than a particular one. The fact that 1984 does not simply follow history is a major strength since it allows Orwell's imagination to run wild.As you read 1984, you experience the oppression that a citizen in a totalitarian state must feel every day. Orwell conveys many of the brutal tactics of such a state: the neverending assault of propaganda, the isolation of individuals, the destruction of truth and memory. And all in service of a great plot.Perhaps the reason that a book like Ulysses outranks 1984 is that 1984 is ultimately not about a big enough subject. Ulysses after all is about \\"consciousness,\\" or something like that. While 1984 is a perfect evocation of the central political story of the 20th Century, maybe that's just not ambitious enough. But I submit that 1984 is about something much larger. It is about the power of language and the power to control others through language. Central to the plot, of course, is the regime's creation of newspeak and the goal of constantly reducing the number of words available to the citizenry. Simply, the book equates words with freedom, which is a pretty big idea.Anyhow, when I first read 1984, I thought there were two flaws: First, I thought that the \\"reprinting\\" of Emmanuel Goldberg's manuscript was unecessary since it was really just a rehash of things Winston already knew and which were already confirmed to the reader. That part slows the pace of the novel. I still think that's a flaw. The other problem I had was that Orwell ultimately abandons the pitch-black humor that he injects throughout the first two thirds of the book. I no longer have a problem with that. Simply you can't have your cake and eat it. The ending is what it is and it works.Another interesting thought about the ending is this. In retrospect we know the actual fate of the Soviet Union. We know that if a totalitarian system develops a few cracks it must ultimately collapse. But in 1949, the Soviet Union probably looked as impregnable and invincible as Oceania. Which would make this book that much more chilling if read when it first came out.Finally, I'm not sure if 1984 is the greatest novel of all time. It may not even be my favorite. But certainly a case can be made for putting it at the top of the all-time list."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell does something interesting with this book - more interesting even than Animal Farm, a truly wonderful allegory. While Animal Farm seems to do nothing more than colorfully reiterate history, 1984 provides some amazing thoughts on the nature of the nearly perfect totalitarian society (the exemplar form of such a society can be found in Huxley's Brave New World) and the people who control it.While the novel feels dated (the overalls, the proles, the characters), it doesn't hinder the book at all. Detailing an alternate society which began to back peddle after World War II, 1984 is meant to feel dated. With no advancements, an inhumane government, and persistent war, it is no wonder Oceania never pulled itself out of pre-war ideologies and modes. It is a poor representation of what we now think of as \\"the future\\": that shiny metallic world of Blade Runner or Star Wars (or Amazing Tales in Orwell's time). Orwell never meant to write a science fiction novel, but rather a warning in a world in which totalitarian states had yet to be squelched.The book progresses through four stages: first there is an introduction to Oceania and its ways of life, beginning just in the same way most science fiction book begins, with little plot development or action; next comes a long character study (I won't provide too many details) which steps away from the descriptions which make up the first stage; then Orwell gives us a nice solid plot which we believe will quickly take us to the end; and finally a finale which would have been difficult to top. The end is exciting, emotional, and thought-provoking, and ties up the earlier stages of the book nicely - something few books are capable of doing.Oh, and by the way: when reading this one, be sure to buy a cheap copy and to carry around a highlighter. This book is chocked full of great quotes (literally pages and pages). If you're interested in politics, government, and human nature, this very well may become your Bible. I didn't do this and I may just have to go over it one more time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Somehow, 1984 strikes a nerve deeper than any other book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Its ideas the ideas of its main character, Wilson, as well as its author, George Orwell, provide a deep perception into the organization of modern politics. All generations can enjoy this story, a story that will definitely never go out of date. It's characters are identifiable and its ending, one as shocking as any, provides a look at the life that Wilson must lead, and the life that many of the stroy's readers go through every day."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I find it funny that almost all of the reviews are 4-5 stars, or 1 star (with a few exceptions). Personally, 1984 is among my favorite books and is my favorite of the utopian/dystopian genre of books. No, I am not a paranoid McCarthyist nut--in fact I am an anarchist. However, I see a profound message in 1984 that is as relevant today as it was when it was first published in 1949. Among those who rated the book poorly, I found the following types of criticism:1. &quot;Oh, the book is too boring, too long, not enough action, too much description, hard to read, blah, blah, blah.&quot; To you I have one thing to say: Grow up. This book is less than 300 pages, significantly shorter than your average novel. Sure, it was longer than Animal Farm, Brave New World or any of the other books that fill the ranks of the genre, but only because it contained so much more.2. &quot;It was disgusting, the story was poor, Orwell is stupid/depraved, etc.&quot; I personally felt that the story was magnificent, and much more detailed than any similar book, but that is of course only my opinion. Every part of the story had intricate meaning. The sex scenes were vital, for they showed the importance of lust, and how they were defying the state by putting their lusts--not love, mind you--but sexual desires ahead of the will of the state. The torture scenes depict the degenerated position they forced him into--the only what they could break the will of someone so intent on either freedom or martyrdom.3. &quot;Orwell is just playing on Cold War paranoia to make a buck, he doesn't even know what communism is, he is plagerizing other people's work, the message isn't important anymore.&quot; I cannot see is how somebody could claim that he was working with a worn out subject or playing on Communist paranoia. It was published in 1949--the Cold War had only really been in existence for 2 years and very few people had any idea what was going on within the Soviet Union, much less the inspiration to writing about it. Furthermore, to those who think he was ignorant of the tenet of Communism, he was not. He was a member of the Communist party for a period of time in his life and he was neither stupid nor ignorant. He was both aware of what Communism was and was able to comprehend it and its implications. Furthermore, as he has said himself, he was NOT parodying Communism or socialism, but the totalitarian state that had arose in Russia and spread to its satellites, and which was masquerading as Communism (obviously what is depicted within the book is not Communism but a fascist society where the state controls commerce). Communism is a political system by which the state controls real estate and industry in order to ensure the rights of workers. Ideally, it isn't even totallitarian, but democratic, in political function. One reviewer I saw ignorantly proclaimed that Communism was an automated society where robots did all the work, right after claiming that Orwell was ignorant. Such hypocrits.In conclusion, all I can say is that, if you're, stupid, ignorant and close-minded, by all means don't get this book, for it is far beyond your comprehension. However, if you are a reasonably intelligent person that doesn't need car chase scenes to hold your attention so long as there is a good story and a strong message, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A number of reviews have stated that this work is dated and irrelevant today. It would be wise to realize how this is completely opposite of the truth. Doublespeak has dominated American life, such as the Gulf War in which war meant peace, and misery truly meant happiness. Power and money rule, and it could definitely be argued that we live under a totalitarian system of control in America. Beware of power. Orwell is turning over in his grave."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden.Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us.Here's how 1984 applies to current events:WAR IS PEACEThe new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;FREEDOM IS SLAVERY&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are about to lose many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHAmerica's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you. The world portrayed by Orwell may well come to pass by the end of this century."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I'm glad I read this book. It was a fascinating read on the complexities of strict government control. But the story is really more than about government, and it's strict control over the populace. It's about the psychology of humans and living in a society with limited personal freedoms.What I struggled with was the persistent inner-monologue. This book is written like most 20th century literature and is loaded with the protagonist basically thinking/talking to himself for long periods of time, which, to me, can be quite boring and hard to read.Maybe it's because my generation and I'm not used to such writing styles. Most movies and books these days have more action, more conversation and less inner-monologue. Good or bad, that's the way it is.Otherwise, this lived up to hype and icon status that it is known for."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book 30 years ago, and I couldn't believe a Government in total control of people's memories and opinions.

Winston works as a functionary of the Ministry of Truth where history is rewritten to favor the Party&#8217;s line summed up beautifully by the Party&#8217;s slogan &#34;Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.&#34; A little at a time Winston begins to realize that things are not as they should be and that those things should be changed. This book is drowned in hopelessness, but it is something we all need to read and keep close to our hearts, because during these troubling times it is too easy to forget how easy it is to fall into the trap that leads to Socialism to Communism to Totalitarianism.With today&#8217;s technology, Big Brother is a real threat and with the Government growing larger and larger the world of 1984 can become our future &#8211; if we are not careful."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Anybody who has not read this book is depriving themselves of great literature.

I believe that it is out of print (at least the english translation), but if there is enough interest in it that could be rectified. Also, now more than ever the theme of governmental control is very relevant."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Filed under the Dystopian section of fiction, 1984's cynical vision of an unsuperable dictatorship is a classic and profound work of literature. As in Orwell's first novel, Animal Farm, 1984 exudes great amounts of irony and symbolism in an incisive and meaningful way.The story consists of a brief chronology of events in Winston Smith's life. Winston is a disillusioned and repressed worker in the city of Oceania, a militaristic superstate. Winston believes that the bleek status quo was much better in his past, but do to the laws executed by Big Brother, the ubiquitous figurehead of the government, history itself has become alterable and destructible, and Winston can't mesh his thoughts into a coherent pattern. As Winstons circadian afflictions begin to grow on him heavily, a stroke of luck graces his misfortunate life when a beautiful young girl named Julia, who Winston was previously skeptical of, confides her love in him. Julia revigorates Winston's life and becomes an evergrowing source of light and happiness to his newly formed being.On a balmy June day, Winston and Julia's seperate peace is suddenly extirpated by a surprising twist of fate- Winston's kindly old friend Mr. Charington (owner of Winston and Julia's garret), who seems unaffected by the party, betrays Winston and divulges his whereabouts to the Thought Police, a sophisticated and merciless law enforcing team. From here on, things rapidly decline for Winston. He is beaten, tortured, humiliated, and deprived of any small solace to help him. During this period of debasement and castigation, Winston is interogated by his fellow worker named O'Brian, who Winston looks at with idyllic love and compassion throughout the course of the novel. In the paramount scene of the novel set in Room 101, O'Brian quashes all logic and sense that Winston tries to use against the Party, and succeedes in destroying every ounce of humanity left in Winston, forcing him to love Big Brother and betray Julia.1984 displays George Orwell's outstanding brilliance in an earnest, captivating fashion. Orwell's desperate, seemingly hopeless forebodings to society as a whole are thought to have been addressed to Communist or Nazi regimes, whose terrible dictatorships brought about the deaths of millions of innocent people. However, Orwell clearly illustrates that mutiny against any tryanical government is futile. One may be lead to believe that Orwell was a cynical, desolate individual focusing only on the bad or injurious parts of a civilization and the hopelessness of autonomous efforts to enhance goodness in a society. Contrary to this idiology, I believe Orwell's 1984 is a an ingenius device that accurately portrays a society that will be formed from ignorance and repression, but through such a powerful novel, Orwell disseminates his profound and wise message to the masses, and aptly conveys his yearning for a just and egalitarian society for everyone."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Through out the coarse of my reading carrier I must say that I have found only a few novels that may compare with &quot;1984&quot;. The cunning realism that is embedded upon every page is something truly worth reading. Personally as a writer I feel that after reading this novel I have grown and improved my own writing technique. Not to mention the actually genius involved in contemplating the elaborate world of restricted freedom and no piece of mind. George Orwell completely shatters all walls of possibilities when he introduces many variations of mass control as well as mass acceptance of lies. The complexity of the main character Winston Smith in itself is simply astonishing. So tragic and heart felt is his predicament that sympathy is quickly given to the fictional character. This is mostly because of the fact that certain freedoms that we have are taken for granted. While in &quot;1984&quot; the lack of freedom is equally accepted and taken for granted by the people of the novel. Which reminds us to think and judge for our selves what it is right. This is the utmost reason for me appreciating and taking to heart this novel.&gt;&gt;Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak my mind...&lt;&lt;"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is a work of genius.

Orwell not only wrote about the world of the future, but also stood out by writing his idea of the supremely successful, and everlasting government, the anti-Utopia. Within the story Orwell created the Brother Hood, an evil organization with advanced technology and the desire for power, even at the expense of sanity. Winston, the main character of the story, is a comrade under the Brother Hood. He turns out to be quite the odd man out, since Winston is always seeking for some sort of salvation from the evil grasp of the Brother Hood. Since the Brother Hood watches everyone in Oceania, the country Winston lives in, twenty-four hours a day through two-way telescreens, all personal and social lives of its countrymen are eliminated. The Brother Hood skillfully takes apart all connections between its citizens, leaving them weak and alone, also preventing them from rebellious organization. The Brother Hood destroyed the bonds between family members by instilling pure fear, the fear that your spouse, or even your child will turn you in for thought crime. To commit a thought crime, it would have to appear that your mind is thinking in some way that is opposing the Brother Hood and Big Brother's, the supreme ruler of the Brother Hood, bests interests. This is the Brother Hoods way of controlling what you think; giving them the power to break a man's sanity, and mold him in any way they please. This society formed as the anti-Utopia has one advantage over other ruling parties, it does not promise love and equality for its citizens in the end, but sets forth to create hate, separation, and total inequality among people, making their rule everlasting and indestructible."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Why are you sitting there?

In this dystopian future, Great Britain is part of an ideological superstate that maintains a totalitarian grip on society that is all-encompassing, with the population being monitored by round-the-clock surveillance, with government agencies that control all aspects of daily life, and with the very language manipulated to stifle un-approved thinking. It's the story of Winston Smith, who dreams that it might just be possible to oppose \\"the Party\\" and bring about change, and it's about the lessons he learns about the true nature of power in the modern world.I first read this book in 1988, and while I did find it interesting, I thought that it went too far in expanding the Communist system of oppression to the entire world. But, watching the world around me I am astounded to find that Mr. Orwell's dystopia is actually beginning to have its echoes in my reality. I reread the book, and was surprised at just how prescient the book really was. The government wishing to monitor people without search warrants, the limitless laws that seem to reach into every aspect of everyday life, and even the manipulation of language to remove certain words or ideas as \\"politically incorrect.\\"Just how much does this book reflect reality? For those who would lead us, is it true that, \\"power is not a means, it's an end\\"? Is it true that, \\"If you want a vision of the future...imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever\\"? Or perhaps it's a boot on a human neck?Whether this book is a prescient look at a future that is already being built, or a piece of doomsayer literature that goes too far, it is a classic of English literature that cannot be ignored. I find this to be one of the most interesting and disturbing books that I have ever read, and it is definitely one that I think should be read by EVERYONE."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book was AWESOME.

The storyline was different, and though I was sort of expecting some of the events, they were still surprising and realistic. The end was also really interesting, and I wasn't expecting it to end how it did. Read it, it's a classic, and it's really good!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Volumes have been written about this book, so it's hard to add something new to everything that has been said about it. So I'd like to emphasize one aspect of 1984 that in my opinion is often overlooked when people discuss this masterpiece. Quite often, this book is criticized for things like simplicity of its plot or flat dialog. Whether you agree or disagree with this kind of criticism (I personally disagree) I think reviews like this totally miss the point. Yes, there are books with more compelling characters, with much more sophisticated plots and with more complex relationships. But this is not the reason 1984 stays popular. What make this novel special is its masterful portrayal of totalitarianism.Majority of modern Western readers who open 1984 have no personal experience with totalitarianism and very vague idea of this kind of society actually means. Sure, we all read news about countries like North Korea, but we read on the same page that talks about Kim Kardashian's marriage. It takes a book like 1984 -- and there aren't many books like this -- to show true horrific nature of totalitarian society. When you read this book you can almost feel how suffocating a society like this is. You nearly experience the monstrosity of a place where even thinking about something forbidden is a crime and where the state completely owns its citizens. The book reminds us that societies like this have always existed and helps us appreciate the freedom we have a little more.This is what makes 1984 special and this is why this book stays relevant for decades."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those.

I listened to this book during my deliveries via audiobook. It took me quite a few attempts to actually indulge myself into the story, but once I managed it, I found myself wishing to know more. The book is QUITE slow in the beginning. The whole point is to build up an understanding of why Big Brother is hated. The author puts so much time and words into this, that there is no way you can miss it. By the time it is apply, you are hooked. The climax hooks you in and makes you go page after page in a sitting.The ending.... oh my. You just don't see it coming. I give Orwell Kudos for daring to go there, but you just can't be prepared for it.The point of books like this... is to have you turn the back cover over, with a burning in your stomach and a feeling tingling through your nerves.

You wish for more, but you have to be content with what you were given.A lesson you learn from Big Brother."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book while living in South Korea, about an hour away from North Korea. The more I read the more I realized that this is what life is like for those living across the border. I don't normally read fiction books, but this was one that sucked me in. I couldn't put it down. I read Animal Farm in High School but for some reason never got round to reading any more of his work. Orwell's characters are 3 dimensional and very believable. Julia's character reminded me a lot of the Gen-Y youth of today.The book is depressing, but also has some underlying positive messages. Sadly, Winston loses his will and thus his capacity for emotions after being tortured for a prolonged period of time. As I read this part I found myself getting more and more angry with his captors. They methods were unjust, and they not only dehumanized Winston and the others, but also themselves. They became like animals. Reminded me of Dostoevsky \\"If God is dead all things are permissible.\\" The Party wins in the end, and turns Winston into their slave. But on the positive side, the Party had to expend an enormous amount of energy and time to convert just one person. I kept asking myself why the didn't kill him and just be done with it? Why all the effort. The best answer I came up with was that Winston was no use to them dead, and that if he died as a heretic they would have lost. They would not have had total power, hence the need to break him in the last frontier: His mind, his will and his emotions. This reminded me of the Christian martyrs in the first century AD, who refused to bow to Caesar and went to the deaths bowing to God alone. The Party would never have tolerated that of course.The book is depressing but an absolute must read. At the end I had more questions than answers and I was compelled to have them answered. I searched out the Spark-notes and other resources on the net. Any book that does that is doing what a good book should. One last thing, I don't know if Orwell intended this but throughout the course of the book I became more convinced that smaller governments with less power were better for society."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is such a grim, frightening and scary book by George Orwell.

Winston Smith tries to rebel against the government, and meets two people, Julia, a young woman who hands him a note reading, \\"I love you\\" and O'Brien, a mysterious man at his workplace. One of these people betrays him, and, against his own instincts, he betrays the other.This is a pretty engaging and suspenseful book, though like I said, it was quite grim, and I think I preferred Animal Farm, as it was more effective in terms of the point Orwell was trying to make and was not quite so grim.

I thought I hated reading as a child until I came across this book. It started me on my road of Poli-Sci-Fi books such as Animal Farm, Brave New World, etc. It also made me recognize my interest in Non-Fiction books such as histories and biographies.Reading this book as a teenager and now in my 30s- makes a world of difference. There was much that I had forgotten. Now that I'm older and worldlier, the point of this book is taken with much more concern. I do believe we have entered a stage in human history that consists of perpetual war and an eventual police state. While I read, I couldn't help but think of the tome written by historian Carroll Quigley, \\"Tragedy and Hope.\\" Fiction and non-fiction running a parallel course.Twenty years later, I still don't understand how George Orwell had such a keen grasp on human nature and managed to call himself a Socialist. This book and those like it birthed my Libertarian convictions. It is only with centralized governments, such as those that Socialism institute, that allow for such evils upon mankind as portrayed in this book.The \\"Why\\" doesn't matter. Whether its Winston's belief that The Party's purpose of power is due to the belief that men are \\"frail and cowardly creatures...and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves\\" OR O'Brien's admission that the The Party's purpose of power was simply for the sake of power.

Everything is under the watchful eye of the party and with most things being banned, everyone must be very careful of what they do and even more so what they think. Winston is trying hard to hang on to his memories of when life was different, but nowadays he is starting to doubt if things were ever better or if everything was in his imagination. He does not agree with what the party is doing and has always had rebellious thoughts, but it is only when he decides to pursue a relationship with Julia that their actions bring him under the spotlight.I had great expectations for this book but I was somewhat disappointed to find that it was not what I always thought Nineteen Eighty-Four would be. The beginning was good and it had me hooked for a while, until it started to dwindle and even got a little tedious at times. I liked the premise however the characters seemed weak and most of them not very interesting. My biggest complaint about this book though has to be the entire excerpt from \\"The Book\\", this was too long and it quickly got boring, I would have preferred if there were shorter highlights or even just a brief description of the concept. If this book is meant to instill the fear of Big Brother in the reader, it didn't do that at all for me and that is probably why I was disappointed, I was expecting it to be more thought provoking in the way that Animal Farm was. I am still glad that I read Nineteen Eighty-Four and perhaps this would have been more valid in the time it was written, I am just a little let down that it wasn't the great book I was hoping for.I must say that I loved Animal Farm by the same author much more.

Judged by its literary merits, I simply cannot agree that it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I want to address the people who rated this book low because it is just a warning about communism or socialism, and people who rate it high for the same reason. There are many aspects to this book, and one of them is that Orwell is warning anyone who wants to go extreme socialism that you can never get rid of the upper class type people, because even if you get rid of all the upper class, there are still going to be people in the middle class who want to be upper class, and see the revolution as their chance to gain power, or make things equal between them and those in power. They don't want equality with the lower class, because they have nothing to gain from a society where everyone is middle class. This book helps revolutions, by warning them to be on the lookout for anyone trying to take power for themselves in the new government. It needs to be democratic in order to control those people. Orwell accepts it as inevitable that these people will always exist. The power hungry in America are mostly controlled by competitive elections, although having candidates that are similar defeats the purpose sometimes."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is such a great book!

References to \\"Big Brother\\"-references to \\"Newspeak\\" etc... I wanted to know what it was all about.What a disturbing book! Have you ever watched \\"The Truman Show\\" with Jim Carey? I'm talking that kind of disturbing-only far FAR worse. It certainly lives up to it's reputation on that account.It's a great book, moves well and is very entertaining. This is another one where I finished more than half of it in one sitting. (Quite an accomplishment for a dad with 2 small children)I feel adding anything else would be risking a spoiler.

Orwell would not live to see that far into the future (having died only one year after the book's publication), but one can see how prophetic this novel is. Privacy has been a hot topic as of late, from the U.S. Patriot Act to the debate on abortion. This book conveys to the reader the true horrors of a \\"Big Brother.\\"He does this by the use of the world \\"telescreen\\" -- a device where Big Brother can see the citizen and even communicate (most notably with his demands and orders) with him/her. Actions of the citizens are not the only things controlled by the State; thoughts are controlled, and history is constantly rewritten to exclude all that threatens the State. The mind is made to not only accept that 1 + 1 = 3, but actually and truly believe it.One who cherishes liberty will find this novel to be the ultimate dystopia -- a work that makes one appreciate the freedoms he/she has and perhaps should not take for granted."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A very well written piece of literature for its time. In light of the current state of affairs, it is rather frightening. It was a good read in High School and an even better fread today."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984, pictures a compelling sci-fi, thriller, and drama of a utopia in the life of a man named Winston. 1984 reflects on the repetitive pattern of human government. Though slow at first, 1984 easily picks up quickly by part two. In the novel, man tests his freedom against the government. The government engages fear to keep the probes (lower class citizens) loyal and obedient, but underneath of the skin lays a brotherhood that thrives to revolt over the corrupted government. Orwell obtains a talent in writing that creates a streaming movie in your head of a chaotic and depressing utopia which war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. It truly brings out the fear and selfishness that we cannot see from our seat that lays in the potential of our political leader, men that may exist today, waiting to be pushed."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Winston Smith knows something is wrong with his world. Smith spends his days re-writing history. He lives in a society where everything, even \\"facts\\" are tenuous. His movements, and the movements of his fellow citizens, are monitored by The Party. Big Brother is always watching. Freedom is an antiquated idea that no longer exists. One isn't even free inside one's own head. The Thought Police always find out.George Orwell's famous dystopian novel is an excellent and timely read. People often crack jokes about this novel and our present society, but how far off the mark are those comments? An absolutely engaging and frightening read about a forbidden love affair and a corrupt society, I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is one of those books you're supposed to read in school, the kind that all the weird, geeky kids with Chuck Taylor All Stars and too much acne read while ranting about The Man. It's a well-known manifesto of those playing at anti-government, anti-establishment, brandishing about their membership cards for the Society for Creative Anarchy. This isn't for the kids that read trashy romances or pulp novels: it's not for the Collins, Grisham, Crichton, or Clancy fans out there, and it's definitely not something a Harry Potter kid is going to pick up in a few years. 1984 is depressing, it's dark, and as most devotes will tell you, it's happening right now. After all, this is the book that defines what \\"Orwellian\\" means-a word so specific in its meaning, even a spin doctor being interviewed on The Daily Show couldn't put it in a positive light.Considering my choices of literature, it probably comes as some surprise that this is only the second time I've read this book, and really I wouldn't have even been motivated to do so if I hadn't picked up a copy of the movie version of 1984 on DVD. I read the book back when I was a senior in high school-this and Metamorphosis were two works that the teachers at my otherwise fine high school just couldn't be assed having us read. I protested after reading both books myself between Junior and Senior year, and in the end talked the English literature teacher into allowing me to teach \\"The Hunger Artist\\" but it was a rather one-sided compromise, especially when you look at recent statistics. According to one report, the majority of students do not understand or value the first amendment, think that freedom of speech is too unrestricted, that the press has too much say, and that in effect, Americans are too free.It is in this environment that 1984 is more relevant than ever. Look at the National ID cards passed last week without the main media outlets blinking an eye or raising a voice. (Dan Rather, oh distrustful ally of the anti-Bush liberals and libertarians, where are you now!?) In a world where we can go from being at war with Afghanistan to Iraq in the blink of an eye (Er, I mean, we were never at war with Afghanistan. We've always been at war with Iraq. We were never not at war with Iraq. Big Brother Bush says so) and where September 11th is brandished about like a giant banner to take away every freedom known to man, the only difference between the Republicans and Ingsoc is the extent of power and religiosity. While Bush follows a god only he can hear (and really, isn't that signs of a mental disorder, having an imaginary friend that only you can hear that tells you to do things and then acting on that friend's word?) he has yet to understand that to captivate all power, he needs to be God.Of course, the United States isn't the only country with gross miscarriages of justice and invasion of privacy. In addition to China's censorship of the internet, the uniting of England with the US against the unifying European Union (read: Eurasia), there's the almost-but-not-quite-telescreen announcement system in Japan known as \\"The Box\\" to some residents and \\"Off Box\\" to others. Technology was meant to make our lives easier, but as Orwell predicted, it is only being used to impose class systems more rigid than they were fifty-years ago.On the way home from work on Wednesday, David and I were walking past Hyde town hall when we heard the bell begin to chime. He mentioned to me that the bell was given to the town by Joshua Bradley, an Industrialist and self-made man who worked his way up from a mill worker to owner. Rags to riches, the kind of JP Morgan and Andrew Carnegie American dream where hard work pays off if you pull yourself up by the bootstraps and put your axe to the grindstone-it doesn't exist in twenty-first century America. Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson: they were born into the world they've simply modified. There was never a chance they'd be a factory worker somewhere, watching over robots as computers were assembled or working as a flight or train attendant. Donald Trump was never going to be a bartender in a casino. They were born into their class and remained there, entrenched in their wealth.In the past, this would have sent up a cry through the students and middle classes, charging the revolutionary-minded among us to action, to take our piece of the pie, to work harder. Instead, we see lawsuit after lawsuit as people who feel they deserve something for nothing become litigious instead of industrious while the rest go on with the drudgery of the world in which they live. We've become sedated by our technology, dependant on mass media and the Internet for our information. How many Americans first believed we were going to war with Iraq because of Weapons of Mass Destruction? How many people still believe that? More importantly, how many of those Americans still believe Saddam Hussain was responsible for 9/11? How many media outlets bother pointing this out?In the end, we have to look back at Orwell and realize that he knew this. He saw it all happening, saw where we were going, and gave us a picture of a world in the not-to-distant future that is depressing, bleak, and immanent. His book is more important than ever, and if you cannot believe it, take a look at the film version of the book. Admittedly, it was four years after reading the book for the first time that I happened upon the movie, so my memory of the book was foggy at best. So I picked it up and watched it with some skepticism. Surely, so much of that was changed to meet modern standards. Surely, as it is with Hollywood, the only thing it had in common with the book was the title and characters. It was for this reason I put 1984 on my list of books to read-to see how much had been changed. And to my surprise, not much is different at all, to the point that I could see scenes in my mind not because the movie colored my perception (as the film version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did, so that reading the book is nearly impossible) but because it was so accurate.In the end, there was no need for them to change, modernize, or update 1984 because it was spot-on. This is a book that is too important to change, and far to relevant to be relegated to dusty bookshelves in the unused school libraries of the United States, or anywhere else in the world for that matter. It is a book that needs to be read, not banned as it has been in some places. If you didn't read this in school, I urge-no, implore-you to read it now. Even if you did read it in school, a good re-read is always enjoyable and considering the way technology and government are evolving, there's no better or more pertinent time than now."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I'm always struck by the dichotomous reactions to 1984. Some will claim it's brilliantly written, others that it's horribly written. Some paint it as an attack on socialism, others as a brilliant satire of modern republican democracy. I find it utterly terrifying if only because its ideas run further into the fabric of our society than most people know; that because there are no posters for Ingsoc on the walls they assume there is not one stamped indelibly in their mind.Or, to put the point lucidly, the horror of 1984 isn't the telescreens and rocket bombs, nor is it even the Thought Police. The horror is the idea, and the idea is still being fought against even today.I suppose first of all I should consider the writing. It's fantastic. It's subtle. It's appropriate. From the very first sentence 'the clock struck thirteen' the reader is informed something is very *wrong* here. Clocks do not strike thirteen; they strike twelve. It's as common as green lights meaning go. From the very beginning an undercurrent of wrongness is present. Orwell also maintains the difficult proposition of keeping his writing limited to the point of view of Winston while at the same time trying to explain enough of his dystopia to make it plausible and whole.Second, its 'point'. Well, despite the unfortunate name given, Ingsoc (or 'English Socialism') is no more proper socialism than it is facism, or republicanism. All three rely on a precariously perched ruling class and a shortage of the necessities of life. Unfortunately too many were influenced by the satire of 'Animal Farm' and its seemingly obvious parallels to the Soviet Union (try this fun game; the old pig is not Lenin but Franklin. Snowball, rather than Trotsky, is Jefferson and his ideological children. Napoleon is not Stalin but Alexander Hamilton. Insert names as needed. The true genius of 'Animal Farm' is that its archetypes can be filled by the proper people/ideologies of almost any modern government.) This book isn't about the Soviet Union. The SU is, if anything, infinitely preferable.Orwell is attempting to make the point (further explained in his essay 'Homage to Catalonia') that all government has that awful potential, and each is as likely to slide into totalitarianism as another. Those who say the book is an attack on communism area) woefully misinformed; the society depicted in 1984 bears little or no relation to communism or socialism beyond the communal obligation, and this obligation is not to one's fellow man as in proper socialism but to the state, and is then fascism or republican democracy if it is anything, andb) naive if they believe that the fall of the Soviet Union makes the book's ideas irrelevant. Orwell observed more than once that no government is inherently 'better' than any other. Anyone who says of communism \\"Well, it failed in the Soviet Union, didn't it? That proves it didn't work!\\" might well look towards Athens, Rome, France, Germany, and countless other countries where democracy failed even more spectacularly. Any government can fail at any time in any place given the proper conditions. Democracy can collapse. Monarchs can be overthrown. Fascists can be defeated. Communists can be glasnosted out of existence. Orwell observes the Marxist idea that a distribution of wealth, even if still geared towards the wealthiest one percent, would still proportionately increase the standard of living of the average person to the point where they would realize the Highs are superflous appendages, the appendices and vestigial lower ribs of the social body.Totalitarianism, Orwell argues, exists at the core of all governments and, despite the best intentions of its rulers, a government is almost a living entity in and of itself, and will naturally seek to aggregate as much power to itself as possible. Whether one is ruled by an absolute monarch or a representative body this tendency remains.Perhaps the most terrifying moment occurs within the reader: when we realize that Winston Smith is a journalist, and moreso clearly a writer in the purest sense. In the world of 1984, he is what the writer has become. This is what our noble dreamers, our Shakespeares and our Platos, have been reduced to. This is what all of the words come to.Nevertheless, Winston *is* a writer. We see this in his utterly irrational need to keep his journal, to write down his thoughts, in the face of certain punishment. Perhaps a projection of Orwell himself, Winston is a writer who exemplifies all of those other doomed souls who died impoverished, unnoticed, unable to break their addiction to putting the inside of their heads down on paper. We see the horrible things 1984 has done to the writer, and the journalist, made him a heretic, a newspaperman who fabricates lies and destroys the truth.Seen in this light, Newspeak becomes all the more horrific: by destroying the very tools a writer might use, Orwell sees the death of revolution.To those who were forced to read this book for school: god forbid. I'm sorry you were forced into something which is the solemn obligation of any citizen, that to be informed and as educated as possible. It is the implicit guarantee of any democracy or socialist state that one's fellow man (or woman) is dedicated to making the most of themselves, not vegging out wringing their hands over American Idol. If it is painful or sophomoric to you it is because you are painfully sophomoric yourself, and have as little right to your freedom as the air you breathe (which is what brings about dystopia more surely than anything, the willful, arrogant ignorance of the people.) Not only do you not know, you don't care you don't know. Ignorance is worn like a badge of honor, and if totalitarianism comes I can hardly say you do not deserve every agony of it.It is a book not only of but about ideas, and its only optimism is given in Orwell's comments on human nature; that a human naturally rebels against such a state, and it may take a thousand years to destroy it, even if it is only to repeat the mistake again for another thousand. But in those moments between the terrible millenia are the small spaces allowed for such things as simple human kindness and decency, which is the surest remedy to totalitarianism as anything. When humans cease to be competitors for the material they find an almost limitless capacity for mutual understanding.Anyone interested in other dystopia would be advised to read Zamyatin's 'We', Miller's 'A Canticle for Leibowitz', and perhaps the best of all if only for its brutal insight and simplicity, Platonov's 'The Foundation Pit'."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Think about a world where thinking unorthodox thoughts about the government is a crime, punishable by torture and death. Everywhere you go you are in the presence of a telescreen, or a two way television, where people can see you, instead of you just seeing them. Microphones are placed everywhere, catching every single word you speak.This is the world of 1984. A novel by George Orwell, a novel not about what life might be, but of what it is becoming. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one man's attempt to find himself. A communist government, called Oceania are at constant war with two other similar governments, Eastasia, and Eurasia. Eternal warfare is the price of bleak prosperity.The story is about a man named Winston Smith. He lives in a time when the love of somebody is illegal, not just the act, but the feelings and nature toward one another. When Winston meets Julia, a romance sparks. But they can only see each other secretly, away from the telescreens and microphones. They soon join the underground opposition of the party, called the brotherhood. One day, the Thought Police(Some police that can read your thoughts and stuff if you have bad thoughts, they catch you) catch them in their hideout, an upper story room on top of an old antique shop.In my opinion, this novel is a very scary and timely book. The fact that this book can be non-fiction can scare the living daylights out of you. The book is fairly complicated, and the beginning is quite slow. This book is not necessarily meant to create a scare, but to warn people about what might happen in one. The last four words can create a very serious case of depression or it may leave you something to think about afterwards. I know it happened to me. Most definitely I would recommend this book, but I have to warn you that it cannot be treated like an old rag, something that you can just toss aside when you don't want it. It will take you really close to psychosis, and then toss you into a suffocating kind of depression. This is not a novel you will neglect, and it is not a book you can read without wondering about everything you think and do. You'll never hear the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot; again without chills going all over you body, giving you shivers, and fear filling every little space of your body.This book can also be quite confusing to some, and boring at the same time. I am only in the 8th grade, and many of the government aspects of the book were quite hard to catch. The last 45 pages or so of this book though, was very interesting. It reminded me of a parent hitting a child if they were bad. They keep on hitting them until they learn what is right in the parent's point of view. If you are looking for a book in which you can sit down and relax, then don't try this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The scariest, deepest, most intesting, and undoubtedly the best book I've ever read. When I started it, I couldn't put it down. When I finished it, I couldn't pick it up for fear of paranoia. Even now, after I've finnaly somewhat gotten over it, there are still some nights I can't sleep thinking about this unbelievably incredible book. It's ten times scarier than any Stephen King novel, and it's at least as deep, if not deeper, than anything written by Poe or Shakespeare. This book should undoubtedly be a requirement for anyone in the entire world living under any form of government. The story takes place in 1984, but it could be set in 2084 and not much would change. There is absolutely nothing I've ever read which even comes close to projecting the kind of heavy, depressing, absolute fear which uterly consumes the reader and stays with them forever. Of course I would recommend this book, but I must warn that it can't be treated lightly. It will send you to the edge of paranoia, and throw you into a smothering kind of depression. This is not a book you will soon forget, and it's not a book you can read without questioning everything you think and believe.

I understood its freightening warning much better when I read it as an older more mature person.I just saw a show on MSNBC the other night about real &quot;Big Brother&quot; technology that is in use today. Some cities in England are using stratigicly placed surveillance cameras that can actually automatically focus in on suspicious looking characters and run a picture of their face against a database of known criminals. Another example of &quot;Big Brother&quot; technology is electronic toll collection systems that allow the &quot;authorities&quot; to track your whereabouts.Certainly, doublespeak is often used in politics and to shape public opinion today. Bombing innocent civilians and causing widespread destruction is now the meaningless term &quot;collateral damage&quot;. The &quot;Defense Department&quot; is more of an offensive international policing agency that is ready, willing, and able to wreak havoc on any country which is diagreeable to the United States. Nuclear missles are dubiously named &quot;peacekeepers&quot;.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH is America today. How many people in America actually educate themselves about the issues of the day and about the real nature of the politicians running for office? It's pretty obvious to anyone who has bothered to educate themselves that many politicians often don't practice what they preach. People are too quick to just accept sound bites as facts, and don't bother to educate themselves regarding the issues of the day.The only way we can prevent a totalitarian regime like George Orwell described in 1984 from becomming a reality is for every person to be vigilant about protecting their rights and the rights of others, and for people to constantly question things and educate themselves. Unfortantely, I don't have much hope that people will actually prevent George Orwell's nightmare vision from becoming a reality.

Orwell's use of adjectives to create a dank, despairing mood is beyond astonishing; I don't think I've ever read anything which approaches its power.

Many have heard that they should read this book because it's a classic, or because of the amazing predictions from 1949 about life in the future.

Think of the implications of Orwell's predictions. Realize that it could happen.Is it a novel, or is it possible? Are we starting to live in Orwell's world?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a spellbinding book. George Orwell has created in this book a society that could very well the most horrific situation any human being could ever find itself in. I loved every aspect of the book: the plot, the characterizations, the future shock, the political and religious allegories and the appropriate bleakness and gloominess that eventually wears you down towards absolute fear of the future.Though I loved the relationship between Winston Smith and O'Brien and their encounters in Part III of the novel, it was the affair of Winston and Julia that was central to the novel. With these two characters, Orwell gave us two completely identifiable and realistic characters that we like immediately. It was as though the two of them were thrown into a maze of oppression and tried to free themselves, just like any of us today would do. It is here that Orwell gives us the sense of hope that all humans have that good will of course triumph over evil and freedom will come from their slavery. Though it is obvious that they probably won't be succesful in their rebellion of Big Brother, we admire them for being human: to fall in love and to be distinct humans and to have regular thoughts, feelings and memories. In the end, when they are captured by the thought police, seperated, tortured like animals, brainwashed and released back into the collective, it is all the more heartbreaking that they, like human nature, has fallen prey to them enemy: communism. Their final meeting at the end is more heartbreaking in how they know they betrayed each other and have been conformed, resulting in the loss of their love for each other. I don't believe that this was a love story but I thought this relationship served as the means by which the reader would identify their rebellion of the Party and their failure.To those who felt cheated by this ending, it would have underminded and ruined every theme that Orwell made throughout the book about totaltarianism: a man cannot break free of the state and overcome it if the state can succeed in taking away his individuality and place the state within him. To give the book a pleasing ending would take away the message that communism should be feared; for if Winston could beat the Party, everyone after him can as well. To give him that victory would cheat the audience more.Above all, 1984 succeeds in how it will always be relevant in todays society. The U.S. now wants to monitor all activity over the mail and internet for security reasons because of Sept. 11. We are at the starting point of a war which may conduct itself over a long period of time. Security cameras are stationed at every corner in downtown london to monitor the activity of the citizens. We have experienced the serious threats and wide spread fears and panics of communism of the 1950s and 1960s and a cold war between captialism and communism which was very close to being an Orwellian Revolution of sorts. It is a great book in not only being entertaining but being insightful. It surpasses horrific masterpiece, it is a warning."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 by George Orwell is the frightening classic about the loss of freedom of thought in a totalitarian society. Judging from the luminous exposition of the world of 1984's structure, found in latter bit of part 2, Orwell scholarlily traced the history of organized society to date and decided upon a strictly terrifying and inhumane future. The author's vision of 1984 (conceived in 1949) is a cold, shocking and quite believable one. The Americas and England are united under the banter of Oceania. Big Brother is the godlike icon that leads Oceania. The Party is its governmental body. Anything the party says, any moral it promotes, any record of the past (including who has died or who has ever been born) it keeps is correct. One is monitored by the Party at all times and should not find that uncomfortable. If one shows any sign of unorthodoxy, anything but love and obedience to Big Brother and the Party, he or she must doublethink it, let it submerge into the unconscious and be replaced by more appropriate feelings or else he or she has committed thoughtcrime. With the almost omnipotent Party's stringent regulation of thoughts, 1984's protagonist, Winston Smith, feels like a dead man before the narration even begins. Orwell takes readers along Smith's gloomy, hopeless path of deviation, from scribbling of \\"Down with Big Brother\\" in a furtive diary to his falling in love with the spirited, young rebel, Julia to his active mutiny to finally his inevitable detainment and terrifying rehabilitation, a process which takes readers to the black heart of the Party. Not only is 1984 a well paced, masterfully executed narrative, the concepts and principles it explores are awfully universal and still utterly relevant. One could apply Orwell's hypothesis's to both the adulation of figures from the American Revolution and how unquestionable we consider their policies and current events in the U.S. as explained by the exceptional review posted by Jim Brett on October third. 1984 is more than just a superb novel. It is a warning."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"&quot;1984&quot; is a wonderfuly written book, but I woudn't recomend it as a before bed read.

I'm 13, and I almost wish I had waited a couple years before reading it. In the climax of the story, I started crying from fear, and I'm constanly having to reasure myself that the world is not like that, and never will be. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, and I encourage anyone who doesn't mind aquiring a slight sense of paranoia, to read it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"To see some rather disturbing indications that Orwell should be shelved somewhere between fiction and non-fiction, have a look at &quot;When Corporations Rule the World&quot; and &quot;Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television&quot;.Most people dwell on the political aspects of 1984, naturally enough, but I'd like to reiterate the perhaps obvious point that Orwell is a really fine writer. Many of his wry descriptions had me laughing aloud. Mark Twain's classic definition of a classic is &quot;a book that everyone wants to have read, but no one wants to read.&quot; 1984 is a counterexample, a classic that is both eminently readable and well worth reading (unless you completely trust giant interlocking bureaucracies to look after your personal interests)."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is perfect and brilliant in all areas. 1984 is also one of the most misunderstood books of all time. It wasn't simply a Stalinist bash or a sequel to Animal Farm (philosophically, not literally). It was both those things, but it was, and is so much more. In a nightmarish future, Winston Smith is just an average citizen of Airstrip One. He works at the Ministry of Truth, he spends his evenings at the community center, he even helps his neighbor when the plumbing goes bad. Yet there is turmoil in Winston's mind. He hates Big Brother, he hates Oceania and Airstrip One, and he wants simply to be human. But in his society, these thoughts are a crime. Now Big Brother is a TV show, but here it is no entertainment: it demands your thinking. 1984 has been liberally borrowed from (the Command and Conquer video game series, The Matrix, that TV series, etc.) and is more than a political novel: to call it that narrows its scope. It is an inflection on humanity and the human spirit, and a look at that age-old dissenting philosophy. Yet the way O'Brien just attacks everything Smith believes in late in the book just makes you wonder about what you believe in. Truly monumental, and I can't write a review on a great work and stay coherent. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The first time I read this book I could not help but think of all the forms of voyuerism in the world today. After only a few pages I was wondering how close to Orwell's nightmerish vision of the future we are. When will such privacy invading programs such as &quot;Big Brother&quot; (which takes its name from a central figure in this book) and &quot;Survivor&quot; evolve to the point that everyone is watched all the time. Will paranoia push privacy out the door? The Telescreen wasn't the only ominous foreshadowing in the novel. The fliud way The Party wipes out intellectualism is reminiscant of the constant &quot;dumbing down&quot; of entertainmenty today. Am I the only one who has noticed the decreased standards of quality in movies? Overall I highly reccomend 1984. Not only is it an excellent book, it is almost an essential read. In order to avoid the atrocities of Orwell's imagined world, we must learn how to avoid them. I will admit,though, this is not for the faint of heart. This is a moody and cynical book throughout."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell does such a great job expressing his point in this novel. 1984 had a very interesting and thoughtful plot which made the book hard to put down. The first 30 pages were hard to get into but after that it was easy reading. The ending of the novel was a little disturbing but it was so keenly written that the author deserves so much credit for it. If u like thoughtful haunting books read it!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is a story on George Orwell's vision of 1984 whilst living in the year 1989. Instead of the beautiful visions some of us have for future and technology right now, George Orwell writes about the nightmarish vision of 1984 and it's &quot;Negative Utopia&quot;.The year is 1984. You fall into a world containing our main character, Winston Smith. Winston lives in a world of control and brilliance. He lives under the power of Big Brother who is practically treated like a god of mankind. Big Brother created the history you read now, Big Brother is everything, you will serve Big Brother.WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.You must use Newspeak and you must not use Oldspeak but Newspeak is being updating so much that you could find yourself half illiterate the very next day. There are telescreens in rooms and on the streets to watch your ever move and if you think anything that is not righteous of Big Brother then the &quot;Thought Police&quot; come after you in the night. You are told that you are not living but that you are serving Big Brother and that Big Brother is the only person living. You aren't even sure that anything is real, but you are worried of thinking these thoughts in case you are caught. Once a person is caught and taken away to the Ministry of Love (maintains law and order)-they do not return. This is the world that Winston lives in.There is to be said a society called The Brotherhood. But you can never be sure of it because everything is so secretive. And one day Winston gets hold of a diary. It is not right to write in a diary or express your thoughts but he does so anyway. Half sure that he will be killed and half sure that it's something that he must do. And from the start of opening his mind to reality he realises that most of the things he 'thinks' he knows aren't really facts at all. It was true, Big Brother made the past, was the past, is the future too-because Big Brother erased everything else and corrected history at his own will.And then he meets a person who thinks with the same thoughts he has...and then another..and then another...and slowly he finds out that there really IS a Brotherhood to maybe let out the truth.The book is a very worthwhile read. It's also similar to Ayn Rand's ANTHEM. The end is surprising and yet imaginable and interesting to think about and discuss."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Not all doom and gloom from page 1, 1984 is still one of the most intense, dark and thought provoking books I have ever come across. What makes it compelling is the way in which it not only examines the human condition but also bludgeons it to a bloody pulp. So why have so many people enjoyed reading such a depressing story, ever since it's release in the late 1940's? I believe it to be the manner in which the novel blurs your \\"in-built\\" judgement of what is right and wrong, good and evil, in respect to civil liberties and the power of governing authorities. The way it inspires you to look behind the diplomacy and see the agenda. And the way it forces you to examine your own rationale for your assumptions and actions. The more I think about it, the more I like this novel and how it manages to look at the big picture and yet still remain personally affecting."},{"Title":"The Spy Went Dancing","review":"If you are a fan of spy stories &amp; stories about people in 'high society', this is the perfect book for you.

Her purpose being to help thwart various coups &amp; assasinations, yet making sure that she never gave herself away.All of the following words come to mind when reading this book: intrigue; cloak &amp; dagger; gripping; thrilling; glamor; elegance; opulance.This is a book you wouldn't be embarassed to give as a gift or to let a young person read: it's SMUT-FREE.

Not long after they arrive, strange things start to happen: Brandt's cat is killed by a flying spear (just curious--why do all pets have to die horribly in Stine's books?), someone or something is moving around at night in the attic, and Brandt finds Cally Frasier's diary, which is mysteriously still being written in.Apart from the terror at home, Brandt is becoming very popular with the girls at Shadyside High, in particular with Abbie Ayler, Jinny Thompson, and Meg Morris. However, the ghost of Cally Frasier intends to harm everyone Brandt is close to, including the above-mentioned girls. What can Brandt do to protect everybody, including himself, from Cally's pent-up rage? (By the way, since when did Cally get so angry? Maybe it's because she's now part of the evil in the house, but it just seems so out of character. In the first book, she was rather nice.)Like the first book in this trilogy, \\"The Second Horror\\" is just as bad, and I don't mean \\"bad\\" as in \\"good\\". The ending is unbearably awful, and the plot is just plain silly. So, unless you're a really loyal R. L.

But she gets a surprise in the end that she will never forget as she sinks deeper and deeper into the evil. This was a very well written book, much better than the goosebumps series. It will keep you on the edge of your seat right until the end. When Brandt tells all, you'll meet one of his worst fears. Cally is just as bad as ever trying to finish off all competition for Brandt.

In 20 years nobody lived there but then the Frasiers (part one) and Cally Frasier has to stay in the house - as a ghost.Now there are the new inhabitants - the McCloys. Cally, who becomes cruel, because of the house, starts to threat Brandt (the son of the inhabitants) by her diary on the attic. Brandt has to realize that the house is evil - hunted.

The author wrote this story based on a dream she had of her own daughter, Elise, who died of cancer in 1993.The angels are making a beautiful blue dress for Elise, who will be joining them shortly. They want blue pearls for the blue dress and need to find out from the great oysters if this is possible for them to do. The head angel visits the great oysters and finds out that it is impossible for them to make blue pearls. She then confronts \\"the higher power\\" who tells her that it is indeed possible. She only needs to listen to her heart for the answer. She then flies back to the land of the great oysters and follows the sound of beautiful singing that she hears. She finds the small oysters circling their smallest member, who is joyfully singing amid a halo of blue light. The head angel tells the smallest oysters that they will produce the blue pearls, which will adorn the blue dress.Elise must leave her three small children soon, as she knows her time is almost completed on earth. She teaches and loves them the best that she can and imparts the wisdom to them that the only important thing on earth \\"is loving and being loved\\". Material goods are not what is truely important, . . . but that love is. ...The illustrations by Veronique Giarrusso are most bright, colorful, and beautiful. The author also has also written an addendum at the end of the story explaining how this story came to be inspired and written.This book would be a wonderful story to read to young children (3-8), if they know that one of their parents will soon leave them to be with God and the angels. The story is loving, tender, and patient and the pictures will soothe any of their fears.I loved this book and highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Blue Pearls (Barefoot Collection)","review":"This a beautifully illustrated book that will help children understand more about death.

Short (2-4 pages) tales of life on a small unnamed Gulf Island (think, between Vancouver and Vancouver Island, BC). Life is slower, but just as complicated as on the Mainland. The chief delight of the book is in Hunter's wonderful depiction of the characters ~ using the word in its best, fullest sense ~ who inhabit Spinner's Inlet; these characters include several Spinners, as one might guess, and a number of other stock productions such as the Brigadier, the Vicar, the local curmudgeon, the horsey woman. The joy arises, though, in the interplay of these characters and others, perhaps less common, the simple descriptions of the Inlet's lifestyle, the easily shown lessons for living well amongst our fellows which Hunter brings to the tales. There is a gentle humour in the tone of almost every page, and a great love for the places which inspired the Inlet."},{"Title":"Spinner's Inlet","review":"The Gulf Islands of British Columbia is the setting that binds this series of short stories together with the comic friction provided by an eccentric cast of locals. The stories themselves are surprisingly short, often only a few pages. The comedy is of the heartwarming Andy Griffith Show school of humour: all Opie, Aunt Bee and Barney Fife with Canadian accents and island problems. Generally, the plots focus on the various misunderstandings between characters with a rose-coloured tinge. Island idyllism through and through. But funny."},{"Title":"Walking North (Official Guides to the Appalachian Trail)","review":"Mic Lowther self published this book in 1990. Finally publishing it for the public in 2001. I am sorry he did not do it sooner. After virtually reading every account that has been written about walking all the trail or in part, this book is my favorite.It seems that they are careful not to mention actually when his family walked the trail but I would guess in the mid 1970's.

I enjoyed the physical description of the trail, the shelter, the plants and animals and the other hikers. This book answered many questions about daily life on the trail. Thank you for the entertainment and the information."},{"Title":"Walking North (Official Guides to the Appalachian Trail)","review":"The only thing needed to make it &quot;perfect&quot; is more of it. I keep wishing it were longer, because I want to keep on reading Mic's wonderful prose. I've just finished reading this book for the third time (the 1st two readings were of the original edition) and each time it has seemed fresh and new. Here is the review I wrote after reading it the first time. It's still true.&quot;This beautifully-written book has everything--including some wonderfully sly humor and a plot that draws you along so strongly you can hardly put the book down. Mic Lowther, his wife Jerrianne and their ten-year-old daughter Kyra (rhymes with Vera),thruhiked the A.T. in the 1970's. Mic's every fiber was tuned,almost to the exclusion of all else, to the goal of getting to Katahdin before it was closed for the winter. As he says in his book, &quot;I'd designed and programmed computer systems... The Appalachian Trail seemed awesome in concept and scale. I'd seized it at once as a fascinating problem to work.&quot; As for his wife Jerri, &quot;Time in the woods was like a visit with friends to her, and she would...fall quickly to watching birds and identifying flowers and lose all apparent interest in our destination.&quot; And 10-year-old Kyra: &quot;No stranger to the outdoors, Kyra had accompanied us on trips since she could toddle and had traveled through twenty-eight states. But none, she pointed out, on foot.&quot; Kyra, as it turned out, was a practically perfect thruhiker. Well...you probably sense the conflict that developed early on in this hike. But you'll have to read the book to see how it all turned out--I'm not going to give it away here. But I will say that it makes for absolutely fascinating and enjoyable reading.&quot;After you read this one, there's another well-written book about an AT journey called &quot;On the Beaten Path&quot; by Robert Rubin. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Walking North (Official Guides to the Appalachian Trail)","review":"This book is a very good account of a familes time on the AT. It is really hard to put down.

I would have loved to have seen what they looked like after along hike. Maybe thats why they didn't !!!! This really is a wonderful book. Even if your not into hiking I would recomend this book.

I felt as if I were walking with them, and felt their disapointments, frustrations, joys.

Great balance of trail details and personal feelings. An enjoyable and inspiring book. Didn't want their walk to come to an end. Makes you want to get out there and hike too!"},{"Title":"Walking North (Official Guides to the Appalachian Trail)","review":"First off, I would like to say that I did enjoy the book (thus the 4 stars). I felt that it gave me a good feel for the experience of being a long distance AT hiker.That said, I did find a few things that I didn't like. I sensed a strong feeling of elitism from the author. Mic seemed smugly confident that end to end through-hikers were clearly superior to 'mere' day or weekend hikers (tourists). I would imagine that he held even greater disdain for people who hadn't even hiked the trail, but merely read about it (most of those purchasing his book). His condescending attitude eventually grew a little tiresome.Readers watched him instill these views in his 10 year old daughter. He almost sounded proud that she had no interest in associating with a group of similarly aged Girl Scouts that they encountered on the trail. She appeared to prefer hanging out with 'real' hikers than what she seemed to view as a gang of silly little children.Granted, their through-hike happened many years ago, perhaps around 1973 or 1974. Attitudes have generally grown more open-minded in the meantime. I find myself wondering if the attitudes of through-hikers like Mic have evolved as well."},{"Title":"Walking North (Official Guides to the Appalachian Trail)","review":"Be forewarned that the actual hike told about in this book is from the early 1970s (1973?), not anything recent.Mic, his wife, Jerri, and his 10-year-old daughter, Kyra, set off to hike from Georgia to Maine in the days before the AT became as well-traveled as it is today. I found myself wondering about changes in the trail since the Lowthers hiked it about 30 years ago. One thing that jumped out was that they drank their water directly from streams, something unfathomable in 2006 when we need to filter the water. I'm also guessing that the different times the trail followed highways for several miles in the book are no longer the case. And I'm hoping that large sectinos of Pennsylvania are no longer leafless with the putrid smell of gypsy moth excrement as these moths deforest the land.It was interesting to see the different perspectives on the trail from the three characters and how they conflicted at times - Mic being largely a purist who has a timetable in mind; Jerri wanting to take her time and enjoy the sights, and being willing to jump from midway to Maine and hike back to the middle (unthinkable to Mic); and Kyra looking at things more simply, trying to find ways to entertain herself on the trail (mentally building a house) and challenge herself. Mic did a nice job illustrating each of their perspectives, and since 10-year-old thru-hikers are a rarity, this book is a unique opportunity to get this perspective. Mic also illustrates how the trail changes his thinking and its long-term impact on Kyra (in the epilogue).My biggest hope for my upcoming section hike (the Georgia stretch) is that I don't encounter all the rain that the Lowthers did!"},{"Title":"Walking North (Official Guides to the Appalachian Trail)","review":"Having read several accounts of thru hikes on the AT and being interested in the subject, I found this book extremely disappointing. Didn't feel the family took much positive away from their once in a lifetime experience and the book held little helpful information for anyone considering a thru hike,or even interested in, the AT. Other AT books I have read have been either informational, inspiring, helpful, positive accounts of nature and hiking or all of the above. Their family hike seemed mostly an ordeal. Aside from some humerous exchanges with their 10 year old daughter, I didn't find much to recommend this book."},{"Title":"Walking North (Official Guides to the Appalachian Trail)","review":"Annoys the heck outta me. Where are the pictures? I want pictures.This AT hiking book is very different from the other (26, I counted'em) AT hiking narratives I've read. There's no use of trail names, because these three people took it slow and easy, there wasn't the obsession with food, they didn't make any friends, they had no interest in the towns and trail life along the route, they squabbled constantly, and I got tired of the never-ending lectures or mention of the common flora on the trail.I had to wonder why Mic needed to get to Maine by sundown, although Jerri's lack of interest in getting anywhere was just as annoying. I had to laugh though, when at the back of the book was a snapshot of Mic that portrayed him precisely as I pictured him, disgruntled and sour.Going by the other AT narratives I've read, I'd say Mic and Jerri missed the best parts of what the AT's all about. In short, I could have done without the Lowther's and their boring book."},{"Title":"Walking North (Official Guides to the Appalachian Trail)","review":"I've read quite a few books on people thruhiking the AT, and this by far was the most fun to read.

Overall, I thought that the PR made sure to get all bases covered for the SAT II: Writing, which is basically grammar. The review was not bad at all, and allowed me to point out pretty much all the types of grammatical errors presented in the Writing exam. However, I felt that the author was rather frugal in giving the readers enough exercises, and found myself reviewing the same exercises over and over again to learn a certain aspect of grammar (typically, for one type of mistake you'd only have ONE exercise). I found myself going online, reviewing resources from the PSAT Writing section, etc. etc. Basically, you cannot use the book by itself--you probably need some supplements, some of which just take some time to find online or elsewhere (collegeboard.com, and I'm sure there are a lot of resources on the internet for grammar rules). Nonetheless, I made the very best I could of the book and was able to manage an 800. And yes, the PR is KNOWN for being extremely gimmicky in their techniques--take it with a grain of salt, because the author practically imbues the book with these so called ingenious techniques.As for the Literature section, don't even look at it in this book. The whole review basically consists of looking at a few passages and answering very basic questions on theme, voice, tone, literary devices, etc. To be quite honest, the Literature test is extremely demanding and I'm sure that doing the PR's exercise failed to help me one bit. In order to be thoroughly prepared, one should be a strong English student overall..."},{"Title":"PR Sat 2 English 1994","review":"TPR has once again defended its impeccable reputation. It has created a great book with the most review in the shortest amount. Not only does it teach you the grammar you need to know, but it teaches you how to deduce the answers. Plus, it includes the Literature section. Its much better than any of the other review books: Barrons, Kaplan, and Arco. However, I have noticed one error in the tests, but otherwise, it is good. P.S. Despite its review on the back, it lacks the explanations to the answers."},{"Title":"PR Sat 2 English 1994","review":"I am sorry, but I have serious objections to the Princeton Review manner of creating study guides. While some attention is given to actually reviewing the material that is on the test, much information is dismissed as unlikey to appear on the test and therefore unnecessary to remember. Princeton Review bets on statistics of what material is most often tested when deciding what it will teach you.Likewise, and more importantly, the Princeton Review encourages students of its book to rely on chance and statistics in regards to guessing multiple choice answers. Princeton Review teaches the students the techniques that are most likely to help them and, on the side, teaches the material that is most likely to be essential. Well, that which is most likely is not the case 100% of the time. While some suggest that tests are so unlikely to have three questions in a row with the same answer that a student should be overly skeptical if he or she finds his or her self marking three questions in a row with &quot;B&quot;, the fact is that I have taken many tests and many times have I had the same answer for four or even five questions in a row. I got these questions right because I did not doubt my answers based on some test-taking techniques I picked up in the Princeton review but because I had learned enough of the material to be confident.The English AP book is slightly better than other Princeton Review study guides in the amount of actual material it presents to you, largely because of its helpfully organized vocabulary section. Still, the book is not enough to prepare fully for these tests. Since the book does include information and practice test for bothe the Language and Literature tests, it is a reasonable value for the money and deserves a slightly higher rating than a book with comparable quality but only one test covered might."},{"Title":"PR Sat 2 English 1994","review":"This book is detailed and gives the necessary info do to well on the SAT II subject test.

It serves, among other things, as the best record guide to the post-war avant-garde that I've found, although since '95 it has become somewhat outdated.Griffiths imbues the story of the serialist avant-garde with high drama. The hero of his story is Pierre Boulez. Messiaen is the mentor, and Stockhausen the brother, a source of friendly but intense rivalry. Schoenberg is the father figure who Boulez \\"kills\\" even as he carries on his tradition, but of course crediting Webern. The history gives a palpable sense of the excitement of this avant-garde circle, which came together at Darmstadt. Cage and his zen anarchism presents a radical challenge to the integral serialist Project, and begins to explode it.This takes us through the 1950s. The second part of the book is equally good, as the linear sense of progress unravels in the 1960s and '70s and fragmentation sets in. A fascinating development which Griffiths documents, but does not comment on, is the resurgence of sacred music as the secular avant-garde disintegrates. The Estonian composer Arvo Part is but one example of this trend, what might be called the reassertion of the pre-modern in the context of the post-modern. The third section is not as good, and resembles other similar books in being more an encyclopedia of entries on various composers and trends. There doesn't seem to be much alternative to this for now, but it's interesting to imagine how the present period may be reconstructed in light of future developments...In his introduction Griffiths laments the loss of a sense of shared criteria for evaluating the diverse music of the moment. But of course books like this contribute to the construction of those criteria! Peter J. Martin's SOUNDS AND SOCIETY (see my review) is an excellent analysis of how music evaluation is socially constructed -- there are no objective, inherent qualities, and so something like writing a book or even posting reviews to a website serves to shape the reception of the art. An interesting topic to pursue would be the divergent paths of Boulez and Stockhausen, with the former becoming an esteemed conductor and not only championing the avant-garde, but also turning back to the once scorned romantic tradition, while Stockhausen followed an increasingly idiosyncratic path and became a revered figure for the 90s electronica movement, a \\"Father of Electronic Music\\"!MODERN MUSIC AND AFTER is indispensable for anyone trying to understand the rich complexities of contemporary composition. I recommend Morgan's TWENTIETH-CENTURY MUSIC (see my review) for the pre-WWII period, and Gann's AMERICAN MUSIC IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY (see my review) for greater detail on the postwar U.S."},{"Title":"Modern Music and After - Directions Since 1945 (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"My writer brethren here neglected to mention that Griffiths in this reissue,brings us up-to-date a way of completing the tale he began over 20 years ago. Since that time composers have either grown up or become more important, some have fallen from graces completly. Brian Ferneyhough has grown up and Griffiths here gives ample evidence although brief and outlines in form, you read it,and it points you toward a greater exploration of his music. Likewise Morton Feldman became fascinated with the set of problematics concerning longer lengths in music's construction. Likewise the late Luigi Nono, this is the first real description in English of his summary work Prometeo,and gives a good perspective on him.Likewise the late Cage is discussed. Griffiths now writes for the New York Times, and he breathes some new life there of a seasoned reviewer."},{"Title":"Modern Music and After - Directions Since 1945 (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"This certainly is the book to get the low-down on contemporary music. However, here a few points of interest:Firstly, I think the most glaring omission is Louis Andriessen, who not only co-wrote The Apollonian Clockwork, but has also composed some of the most important and exciting non-Webernian music around. What is especially important about Andriessen is that his own 'minimal' style is fully aware of the Modernist heritage at the same time as it critiques or refutes it, as oppoesed to others who just dismiss it outright and have no real understanding of post-Webernian serialism. Also, Andriessen's continuing political ideals make him an interesting study in current musico-poltical relations (now that most are dead: Nono, Cardew; or just write rubbish: Henze).In fact, while I am no authority on comtemporary Dutch music, I certainly know no more about it through reading this book. Which brings me to my second point: the Anglo-West Europe-American-centricity.Not only does he leave out the Netherlands, Finland, Scandinavia, South America, as well as the bizarre history of post-war Polish music, but also Australia and (South East) Asia. Now while I am no doubt partisan, his only mention of Australia is one line about the Elision Ensemble in relation to Richard Barrett, Chris Dench, and Finnissy. I think Australia has some of the best composers anywhere (Liza Lim, for instance), writing from a variety of perspectives and a fuller account of theseplace-specific musics would have interesting, for instance examination of Australia's liminal position between Europe and Asia and how that affects attitudes to composition.While his bit on Part is a witty piece of pomo gaming, he sometimes trips himself up in his pomo considerations (as other reviewers have pointed out): for instance, he says that the postmodern condition entails the loss (both through desire and circumstance) of the dominant-central figures crucial to the Modernist project (eg. Boulez) because there are now 'many streams' instead of a river, but he then later complains that no new 'Generals' have stood up to replace the these old ones in terms of central importance to the musical world. In this way, he doesn't really trace many new paths in his last section, but simply rings up his old mates (Boulez, Birtwistle, Berio, Stockhausen, Ligeti, etc) and asks them what they've been up to recently. But, then again, that is really what the book is for and it does it admirably.And not only is his championing of Barraque timely, but Bill Hopkins too, whose music I was unaware of until reading his bit.One hopes there will be a 3rd edition after most of the 'peace-time Generals' are gone and a final summation of the lasting effects of the immediate post-war project can take place. Until then this is the book to read if you want to know about the good-old music with no tunes that we all love.Also the Strings and Knots is organised in reverse alphabetical (very postmodern!)"},{"Title":"Modern Music and After - Directions Since 1945 (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"Griffiths gives a survey that is clear, insightful and accessable to both musician and educated listener. After poring over many such books (twentieth century musical surveys), Griffths was a exciting and fun read. The detail on composition in the 1940', 50's and 60's is particularly well organized and concise, as well as ironing out many misconceptions regarding 'modernism' and serialism , to which many texts on modern music have fallen prey. The book is useful both for a didactic text and reference text. Unfortunately the latter half of the book, detailing composition in the 1970's, 80's and 90's, is not as well organized as the first half. The structure of Griffiths' discussion becomes less chronologically linear, focusing on individual concepts and composers, that (particularly in the last section 'strings and knots') seems to be in no particular order. Grittiths also seems less objective in the second half, betraying an odor of postmodern polemic. However, the discussion remains insightful thoughout, and still comprises one of the best texts that I've read on music after WWII."},{"Title":"Modern Music and After - Directions Since 1945 (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"Most of the books I've found about post WWII composed music are either narrowly focused (like Joan Peyser on Boulez -good, just about worshipping Boulez most of the time) or intent on dismissing \\"total serialism\\" and its aftermath (Important to note that \\"total serialism\\" was abandoned by its primary practitioners -Boulez, Stockhausen, et al- within a few years of its inception). Even if the plethora of compositional concepts that flooded the world of composed music after total serialism ran its brief course have proven too abstruse to reach wide audiences or have proven (in many post Cage examples) to be too ephemeral to generate much more than transitory \\"happenings\\", a great deal of intelligence and discipline has gone into ways of thinking about and organizing sound. It would be sort of tragic to let all those investigations go to waste as many historians (Richard Taruskin in his final Oxford volume, for example) would.No jazz here, no film scores, no pop, just composers and how they approach the work of organizing sound.Pretty thorough and engaging. Not recommended for those who think Reich, Glass, and Riley are the summit of musical thought."},{"Title":"Modern Music and After - Directions Since 1945 (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"I am a trained musician and avid classical music fan who is turning my attention and tastes to modern composers and found this textbook extremely useful. There was a minimal amount of subjective characterizations by Mr. Griffiths that I really appreciated. He focused more on objective technical innovations and accomplishments made by various composers which really helped me understand what to listen for. It is a broad survey book covering around 60 years and does have a strong focus on Boulez, Stockhausen, Berio, and Ligeti. More than anything I now have a much better grasp on why I like particular composers and not others, and am excited to take the next step in going more in depth with particular ones that appeal to me.On another note, I have been one of those classical music lovers who has kept my interest in the &#34;Romantic&#34; style. Saying that, I have never been so excited about classical music than now because new music feels alive and exciting and I've had enough of the continual repetition of very old and dead music. In my opinion, the extremes of total serialism are very hard to appreciate and probably turn many people off from new music. But since the 1960s post advant garde movement I have found an incredible amount of compelling and exciting music to focus on. Anyone who claims to be a classical music fan needs to read this book or one like it and bring modern musical language and the composers who write with it today back into the mainstream concert halls."},{"Title":"Modern Music and After - Directions Since 1945 (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"MODERN MUSIC AND AFTER is Paul Griffiths' survey of the art music scene from 1945 to 1995, a time when music had first gone from limitless optimism for \\"progress\\" after World War II, to the disappointment of the late 1960s, and finally to the thousand forking paths of the 70s and later. I found the work interesting as a quick read, though certainly not a useful reference work.The initial hero of Griffiths' work is Pierre Boulez, who in post-war Paris was certain that the twelve-tone method of Schoenberg and (even more so) Webern was the future of music, and by relentlessly publishing and composing Boulez was trying himself to make it turn out that way. After speaking something about the French composer's post-war worldview, the author presents the 1950s development of the Darmstadt school, when Boulez was joined at the forefront by Stockhausen and Nono, with important contributions by Cage and Barraque. At the same time, the \\"classic modernism\\" of Babbitt and Carter was flourishing. The 1960s and 1970s is shown as six waves, these being the use of quotation, music theatre, politics, virtuosity and improvisation, computer music, and minimalism. Ligeti, Xenakis, Cardew, Reich, Messiaen get the most attention here. The chapter on the 1980s and 1990s gets the title \\"Many Rivers\\" and discusses Schnittke, Rihm, Part, Kurtag, Gubaidulina, Ferneyhough, Feldman, Birtwistle, and Berio among others.As is probably inevitable in such a work, some important people are left out. Per Norgard, whose infinity series is one of the most innovative concepts of contemporary music, is missing, as is Magnus Lindberg, who established himself as Finland's foremost young composer with \\"Kraft\\" in 1986. Lutoslawski is simply inexplicably absent. Sofia Gubaidulina scandously gets only about a page. However, Griffiths was prescient in including Tan Dun, who was little known then but is increasingly popular now. Another failing of the book is that for reasons of space, most composers only get a few paragraphs, and really, if you already own recordings of a given composer's work, the musicological essays in the CD notes are probably more substantial than anything you'll find here.MODERN MUSIC AND AFTER is worth flipping through for any fan of contemporary music, but I think that it works better as a historical document than as a useful resource for said fans to learn more about the music they love."},{"Title":"Modern Music and After - Directions Since 1945 (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"Good perspective on modern music but the writing can veer towards dryness.For example,there's a huge chunk devoted to Milton Babbitt which seems appropriate enough but you get only the most threadbare sense of why one should actually bother to listen to it!A fine book but worth supplementing with more colourful commentators."},{"Title":"Modern Music and After - Directions Since 1945 (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"I am very glad that existance.

I suppose that was great failure of music invension starting with the 12-note serial method.However there've been many other composers who try to create new sound and their music has attracted people, may be not so many anyway.Probably the music history should get over the methods and invensions and focus on music itself."},{"Title":"Modern Music and After - Directions Since 1945 (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"Book provides very thorough info on music post-1945 to music of the last decade (2000).

Information abounds about time period, costume cuts &amp; styles, ways to splurge or skimp on your costumes and still have them look fabulous, as well as details that an inexperienced costumer might overlook (such as using velcro instead of buttons for ease in costume changes).I would highly recommend this to anyone who is involved in costuming for a production, or anyone who simply loves costumes and loves to recycle old clothes into great new ones.

The text is very simple. Basically, it simply states \\"Boris was greedy.\\" for one pair of pages, and then \\"All pirates are greedy.\\" on the next pair, and then substitutes other words for greedy, like \\"massive,\\" and \\"scruffy,\\" etc.The pictures tell the story, though. Boris and his group find a treasure chest, filled with treasure and a violin. The crew drags the treasure chest aboard the ship, and divvies up the loot. A boy steals the violin from Boris's room, and Boris seeks the boy out for punishment. The boy plays the violin so well, however, that Boris has him spared. Next, Boris' pet parrot dies, and gets a solemn and appropriate burial at sea, in the violin case. Boris and all the pirates are very sad, and, as the text states, \\"all pirates cry.\\"This book required repeated readings with my 3-year old to get the whole story.

Death is treated matter-of-factly with no philosophical overtones (you fill in the blanks when they ask, \\"why did the parrot die\\", or \\"what happened when the parrot died?\\") and children identify with Boris about their self-concepts and reactions to conflict and fears in their life. In the end, Boris teaches children that it's okay to be a nice guy and still be tough, and that it's okay to be sad and cry sometimes.

This book was so much better for her than books that attempt to help children understand death and deal with the subject more directly, and it didn't insult the intelligence and insight that she and all young children have. It allowed her to enjoy a great story - in words and pictures - and process the meaning in her own way."},{"Title":"Tough Boris","review":"Tough Boris is a book I would recommend reading to children.

But this book is MUCH more! It lets children know that death/saddness happens to everyone and it is ok to be sad and cry about it, that crying is a good way to express yourself. It is a good book to prep children for the inevitable things that happen in life...it should be read often...before something inevitable happens.

It is a wonderful teaching tool for exploring characterizatioin and loss. The understated language juxtiposed with sensitively drawn illustrations allows children of all ages to explore their own feelings about losing someone or something you love and how people handle loss. The book gives children, especially boys, permission to reveal their emotions, letting them know that it is indeed normal to cry and express grief, and that we must look beyond superficial appearances and stereotypes to see into another person's heart. It is a beautiful and touching story and I have yet to read it to my students without shedding a tear or two myself."},{"Title":"Tough Boris","review":"I used this book in my classroom to teach how illustrations support text.

In the end, it seems Boris isn't all that tough after all. I think it's a fabulous book that can really stimulate a child's powers of observation and ability to communicate what they see. It also illustrates different emotions, shows children that things aren't always what they first seem to be, and that people have many different facets and layers to who they are.

A young, unmarried, woman named Margarat is working as a Bible translator to the Quicha Indians in the mountains of Ecuador. Most of the action takes place in her mind, where she tells you about her previous ideas of missionary work. The end is astonishing and will leave you with a new view on how God works. This book makes you search your soul for what you believe and why. It draws you into the story line, as if you were actually in the mountains of Ecuador with her! I highly recommend it for anyone planning to go into missions or just with an interest in missions."},{"Title":"No graven image","review":"This book has been on my wishlist since before I had a wishlist. It's written by Elisabeth Elliot (one of my favorite women *ever*), it's about missions, and it's fiction. Unfortunately, it's also out of print. While wandering through a discount bookstore, I found one copy on the shelf, so of course I picked it up, and read it over the course of one day. Just over 250 pages, it was a quick and engrossing read.In her preface to this edition, the author says, \\"When I wrote [this book], I felt that the implications of my message would best be conveyed in the garb of fiction. As it turned out, many readers would have preferred a happily-ever-after ending and they have remonstrated with me about the plot, saying 'I just can't believe that God would allow things like this to happen.' Sorry, folks, He does.\\"That alone intrigued me enough to put my other reading (even Agatha Christie!) aside. Due to our ministry, and the direction God has led in what I've taught over the past three years, I've focused a lot on unexplainable or \\"unacceptable\\" circumstances, and I was interested to see how she'd handle it in fiction.I like Margaret. The setting is completely different from our own, and the attendant difficulties look quite different, but underneath, there is something in her that would probably resonate with most women. Missionary or not, we each have at least watershed encounter in our life that is a turning point in our relationship with the Lord; we come face to face with who we *thought* God was, and with who He now reveals Himself to be.I liked Margaret's freshness and enthusiasm at the beginning of her spiritual journey, and then, of course, life happens. And as she becomes more realistic, the author didn't shrink from describing her doubts and questions. \\"Is this really the way it's supposed to work?\\" \\"This isn't how missionaries reported their work back home...\\" \\"What am I really supposed to be doing?\\" Margaret, though young, began to see straight through the trite and euphemistic, and slightly deceiving language that are the signs of becoming a politician-missionary, a danger of fixing our gaze on the results of our work, rather than on the God who called us to the work, and Whose responsibility it really is to produce results. It's an important realization, and one I'd not thought seriously about before.Many who read No Graven Image might be tempted to \\"remonstrate,\\" as Elisabeth Elliot said, about the lack of a happy ending, but I don't think she could have or should have written it any other way. The spiritual journey Margaret takes is one on which God will probably lead every one of His people at least once in their lifetime. He begins to teach her that if she is to trust Him, she must trust Him as He is, not as she wishes Him to be. We must trust God *Himself*, as He reveals Himself in His Word, in our circumstances...not the God we often remake in our own image. That is no god at all, and He will do whatever He needs to, to shake us to the core, to wake us up, to open our eyes to the fact that our God is not tame, not someone we can \\"get a handle on,\\" and He is not willing to fit Himself into the boxes we build for Him.But He is always good. He accepts our questioning - as He does Margaret's - with patience, grace, love, and mercy. A \\"happily-ever-after\\" ending? Not quite. But there is the hope of one, one day, because God is God, and He is worthy of our worship, even when we don't understand Him. No Graven Image reminded me that He is true."},{"Title":"No graven image","review":"The only thing wrong with this book is that it is out of print. In The best thing about it is that it shows how important good Christian fiction is. In her own plucky style, Elisabeth Elliot shows what it means to be a real missionary. One of my favorite parts is when the missionary (Margaret) helps a not-so-helpful but well-meaning American visiting Ecuador realize that giving gospel tracts to South American Indians who can't read at all (let alone read Spanish) is less than helpful. Don't miss reading this book. Buy it and share it with those you love (including your pastor). You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"No graven image","review":"This is the fictional story of Margaret Sparhawk's experiences as a new missionary to the Quichua Indians of Ecuador. This is Elisabeth Elliot's only novel and, given her own years with the Quichua Indians, we can assume that the experiences and people shared are realistic.Margaret begins very idealistic, with a high and lofty vision of what missionary work will be like, with a desire to be able to make big sacrifices for God, a desire that is more based in pride than in selflessness. She has all of these assumptions that she learned growing up in church. Like if there aren't enough missionaries to do the work available, then it must be because people aren't praying faithfully and aren't willing to come. Or if the work isn't resulting in lots of converts and growth, there isn't enough prayer or faithfulness on the missionaries' parts. Gradually she begins to learn that God's ways are not our ways and His thoughts are not our thoughts. And she learns to worship and follow God as He is, not as she thinks He ought to be (i.e. No Graven Image, the title).This book is thought-provoking, but also relatively easy reading. I enjoyed the insight into missionary life. The ending is not what could be called a happy one. In the preface, Elisabeth Elliot says that people have said to her \\"I just can't believe that God would allow things like this to happen.\\" Her response is, \\"Sorry, folks, He does.\\" And she reminds us through this book that \\"God works in mysterious ways, and His kingdom is full of apparent paradoxes. Evelyn Underhill said, 'If God were small enough to be understood, He wouldn't be big enough to be worshipped.'\\"The reason I give this book a 4-star rating instead of a 5 is that the writing is not quite as polished as it could be. It's good in general, but there are a few awkward moments, especially when Margaret is having doubts about the way she's always been told things are and then changing her way of thinking, the view into her thoughts at times feels a bit stilted. And the ending is a bit abrupt. But, on the whole, the writing is good.In short, I'd recommend this book to any Christian with an interest in missionary work. Just keep an open mind and remember that just because we \\"know\\" things are a certain way, doesn't mean that they are. Many of our assumptions are things that we've just assumed are God's ways, but are actually our own addendums to His Word."},{"Title":"No graven image","review":"Elisabeth Elliot's extraordinary writing skills come to perfection in this amazingly realistic story. Margaret Sparhawk is a young woman venturing out to Ecuador to live by herself among Indians. As a single preacher of God's Word among hundreds of Natives, her task is a daunting one that only a Great God could call her to.Margaret is a heck of a narrator who takes in everything and everyone around her with startling precision: the behavior and hearts of the Natives, the town, the greedy white people who live around, the kind wise ones who have gone before her, and even those of her own religion who occasionally miss the mark in their work. Margaret is innocent and wise from the beginning of the book, though her plans and perceptions regarding her work and the people involved are constantly changing like a kaleidoscope throughout the tale. The book, in wonderful honesty and empathy, realistically covers all of a young missionary's hopes, fears and frusterations; it is completely open about human doubts regarding God and His plans in a way that I think people will relate to rather than be discouraged by. Unxpected turns open throughout the book and Elliot blessedly writes in a manner that's accessible to both Calvinists and Arminians. By the end of the book, there are more questions than answers and the reader as well as the heroine is left with peaceful reflections and the conviction that, whatever else occurs, God is in His heaven."},{"Title":"No graven image","review":"This tremendous book must be read by all sincere christians who are trying to live a life pleasing to Jesus christ. Every one of us have our own fanciful idea of God which sometimes contradicts the Bible.

Every missionary or potential missionary should read this book. Elisabeth Elliot describes brilliantly the mix of emotions that any full time Christian worker who is honest with himself battles."},{"Title":"No graven image","review":"The overarching message conveyed through this great novel is trust in God's sovereignty. Anyone who knows Elliot's past will recognize the special authority she has to write on this topic as she does. This novel impacts the reader with a force not generally felt in non-fiction. I have read the last chapter many times and it always leaves me speechless."},{"Title":"No graven image","review":"Without hesitation, this is a top five novel on my list. Keen insights on the illusions and fallacies often associated with missions. I would place this on a must read for anyone considering missions. But more than for missionaries, this book touches on the central natural tenant of the human heart---idolatry. Man is so prone to make idols out of anything---even good things.Elisabeth Elliot is a fantastic writer. This book, though fiction, has imagery and instances that paralleled her own life as a missionary. So many have a very romantic picture of missions. This book focuses the lens upon reality."},{"Title":"No graven image","review":"I do not know when I have read a novel so quickly. I read it quickly in order to send it off with my daughter who was headed to Africa to work with a missionary team and I wanted them to be able to read this book.Those of us in ministry think that everything is automatic if we are \\"faithful\\" (whatever that is). Mrs. Elliot helps us focus on the God we serve in ministry and not on the idol of ministry itself. This is must reading for every missionary, ministry person or any Christian who has bought the line that says: \\"If you are faithful God must bless your work\\".Pick up and read to the betterment of your soul and your relationship with God."},{"Title":"Learning to Learn in a Second Language","review":"The information found in this book is in one word, practical.

Still, I was hoping my dumb butt could learn something from it. Yet such was not the case. I think that if I were a 12-year-old boy who had the slightest bit of interest in the topic of electricity and magnetism I would have found myself scratching my head, scrunching up my face and saying, \\"Yeah, but...\\" every few minutes as I read it, i.e. it presents just the basic facts yet doesn't do much of anything to explain them (an example would be when the book tried to explain how magnets worked by saying that they were composed of smaller magnets, which I think even a kid would recognize as being a completely useless explanation).But it's a pretty package -- full of colorful illustrations -- and written in a fun and friendly way, so I applaud it for its efforts.

Despite the initial mishap, all seems to be going well until the spacefarers discover that they cannot activate the switch that will return them to Earth! Once again Danny must rise to the occasion and save the day before it is too late.As with all the Danny Dunn books, readers are painlessly introduced to science concepts while reading an absorbing tale.

The tale was interesting and imaginative (after all, who DOESN'T want to be able to float around, like you're swimming in the air?), and led me first to the other Danny Dunn books, and then into the wide world of reading. This book saved one little kid (me) from condemnation to eternal television, thus justifying completely the author's efforts.And after I read this book, I really had to question the conditions I saw in shows such as Lost In Space and Star Trek.

She wouldn't show up until the third book (Homework Machine.) It may well be that's why this and Desert Island were first, to get them out of the way.According to my parents, space flight did indeed seem a hundred years away in 1956. I'll have to take their word on that. But all the same, the way they got the ship to fly doesn't seem all that outlandish (though like Star Trek-style beaming, it would require a LOT of energy) particularly for when it was written.And like most of the rest of the series (read my review for Smallifying Machine) it did a wonderful job of explaining basic science to its audience. I still remember (my mother had the original hardback from her childhood) the illustration of the ship over Mars - looking at its surface, with Phobos a jagged rock in orbit above it, and being awed by that and other things out in space.You can forgive the bang-up ending - the authors would get better with time on that.

It includes a wealth of material on wood frame house construction, from laying out a hole in the ground for foundations, to framing, to &quot;paint and paper&quot;. And it's clear and generally easy to read. It was designed for people in apprenticeship programs and trade schools, so it's oriented toward practical details, not engineering theory, which will make it a good match for most do-it-yourselfers, too.On the other hand, it clearly is an older book. Attempts have been made to keep it up to date with newer techniques, but a lot of obsolete material remains, and it's not always easy to tell which methods are new and which old. The obsolete material could be a plus, in some cases -- if you're renovating an old house, for example.

The Hebrew font is not the best, however very good. on a 1-10, I'd say a 9. This is not coined to Strong's. Which means it would only be helpful to a serious Bible student, with at least a knowledge of the Heberew alphabet. For those, the Strong's just gets in the way anyhow. The front of the book has an extensive section explaining in detail, the different aspect of Hebrew grammar. An excellent refresher, or foundation to anyone studying Biblical Hebrew. Each word listing also has the three letter root word listed on the reverse side of the page. Very convenient. It is a very beautifully bound book, very affordable, and very informative.

The style of having the word on the left and having the shoresh on the right, which the reader can go and look up works perfectly for me. I learned most of my Biblical Hebrew from using this Lexicon alone. The areas of the book that may be a little hard to read are the grammer elements. I used other books for the grammer of Biblical Hebrew, but that did not take away from the value of this Lexicon. I will say that this Lexicon is for a somewhat seasoned veteran of the Hebrew language, but once you get the hang of how it works it is perfect."},{"Title":"The Analytical Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon","review":"This is a top-notch biblical reference and a must-have for your language shelf.

But because I used it so heavily, I am almost never stumped by a form when reading the Hebrew text today.If I were a teacher, this would be a required text to buy. I would rather have my students using a text like this and actually reading the Hebrew Bible, than get frustrated and stop reading the Bible in Hebrew.Minuses:* Yes, the text is small. Get good lighting. Even when I was in college I had trouble focussing on small text when under fluorescent lights, and still do. Either get good incandescent lights or full-spectrum fluorescent lights.* Dated, lists the forms according to an outdated understanding of Biblical Hebrew grammar. That grammatical understanding may have been correct for Tiberian Hebrew, but not Biblical Hebrew. But it is easy to understand the outdated terminology to get the true meaning.* Follows the Masoretic points. The Masoretic points are not always correct even for meaning, not counting that there is no question that they do not represent the pronunciation of Biblical Hebrew when it was spoken by people before the Babylonian Exile.* Sometimes lists the wrong forms and roots for words, based on Masoretic points that are wrong.* Sometimes the definitions for words are not quite on, but usually close enough for beginning students.* Sometimes the relationship between root and derivative are tenuous at best.Plusses:* Lists every word by every form in alphabetical order.* Lists the root from which every word is derived. Looking at the root and other words derived from the same root can often give a deeper understanding of the meaning of words.While I have listed fewer plusses, their value far outweigh the more numerous minuses, making this lexicon a must have for students of the language.While this lexicon could be improved by updating it, even as it stands, it is an invaluable aid to the beginning student trying to read the Hebrew Bible.Improvements that I would make include listing the forms without the Masoretic points such as found at Qumran, don't call forms by incorrect grammatical names based on modern usage, list synonyms and sometimes antonyms, list word meanings based on actions rather than according to semantic domains, based on reading the Hebrew Bible through multiple times and usage of words as they are found in the Bible rather than how they are translated.

Although scholars sometimes frown on these books, not everyonehas what it takes to be able to read grammar from memory, but still want to be ableto check the original language, & not have to rely solely on translations. As goodas most of them are, they can't always give all the meaning of the original. Alsobeing able to read the original words is a good way to check on the translations (inplaces I have seen some really blow it.)Of course it must be remembered that a book like this will not make one a scholar.t will still take work to read the original & even then the result sometimes justdoesn't appear to \\"fit\\". However like a Greek scholar said some years ago, thereare treasures in the original languages that await the student who takes the painsto \\"mine\\" them.One final thing about this particular book.

But what does one do when one is not at the computer, or you have traveled out of town, or the power is out? How does one proceed then? Davidson's book is old, dated, the print is not easy to read, and then there is the time element--it seems so slow to look up the words and to find the grammatical information, ugh!! Especially when one is used to having it at the tips of one's fingertips on the computer. But I belong to he generation that used to do things prior to the computer! I know, I know I'm old--I learned to type on a manual typewriter banging away on the keys and getting the white-out from the desk top when a mistake was made!!! Times have changed.

The grammatical paradigms that precede the lexicon section are succinct, intelligently methodical and impressive in content (though it is designed and best used as a reference). Every Hebrew and Aramaic word (just as it appears in the Tanakh) is listed in alphabetical order--you don't need to figure out what the root word is in order to look it up; it will identify it for you. And the words are analytically and unmercifully attacked with awesome precision (root, proper meaning, metaphoric meanings, gender, conjugation, case, etc.). At the bottom of the page, you are given the scriptures where the words can be found. If you are a student of biblical Hebrew, this is a helpful companion.

Instead of you wracking your brain to remember which obscure tense and verb stem you are looking at (or deciding whether or not you are looking at a verb at all), you can consult your analytical lexicon, which tells all.This book is from the long lost days of British biblical scholarship, being first published in 1850. However, first, Benjamin Davidson remains one of the great names in the study of ancient Hebrew, and secondly, what we know about ancient Hebrew has changed very little, so its lack of modernity is no handicap.I heartily recommend it to the serous student, scholar, and would-be translator."},{"Title":"The Analytical Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon","review":"The complete title of Benjamin Davidson's classical volume includes this:\\"Every Word and Inflection of the Hebrew Old Testament Arranged Alphabetically and With Grammatical Analyses .... [And including ] ... A Complete Series of Hebrew and Chaldee Paradigms, With Grammatical Remarks and Explanations.\\"That COMPLETE title tells the discerning reader that this little volume reprinted from the original of 1848 is literally packed with information on the Hebrew Language forms found in the Masoretic TEXT.Mr. Davidson tells his readers that this volume will take the beginning Hebrew student much deeper, after he has left his beginning Hebrew classes. And he is right.Actually, the MAIN PRE-REQUISITE to easily using this dictionary is to KNOW the HEBREW ALPHABET ![ If the reader does not KNOW the Hebrew alphabet fluently, the reader will soon become adept in that skill using THIS volume!If the reader does not KNOW the Hebrew alphabet at all, he will not be able to function in the simple matter of looking up each word he finds in the Masoretic verse text in question. Explanations are in English, but the words are listed in Hebrew, along with their vowel pointing. ]An analytical lexicon analyzes each word in every sentence in every verse of the Old Testament ( Old Covenant).So, ANOTHER PRE-REQUISITE before using this volume is to understand basic grammar... how the words fit together in a sentence with subject, objects, verbs, 3rd person endings, first person endings, etc.A strong knowledge of ENGLISH or Latin grammar will be sufficient for most words and sentences. An understanding of certain HEBREW grammatical terms, however, such as \\"ABSOLUTE\\" and \\"CONSTRUCT\\" are necessary to translate some of the word forms back into a Hebrew sentence to make it make sense, with its intended meaning accurately determined.EACH and EVERY word contained in the ENTIRE body of words of the Masoretic Text Old Testament ( Old Covenant ) is listed alphabetically by Mr. Davidson. Each word, accompanied by its prefixes , suffixes, and under \\"every modification of form\\" that can be found in the Masoretic Text is listed.The FORMS of each word listed are parsed, as to part of speech, endings, vowel points, etc. Definitions, however, are not supplied with each word's FORM, but rather the definitions of the words are supplied under the Roots.ROOTS are listed directly after each FORM, so the reader does not have to guess what the root is ... especially handy for beginning or intermediate students of the Hebrew Scriptures. The reader must therefore look up the root to obtain a definition, if that is unknown or desired.It seems cumbersome but it actually enabled Mr. Davidson to keep the lexicon in one volume.... and quite affordable.The advanced student will appreciate that ALL THE EXCEPTIONAL FORMS ( those that are exceptions to the rules ) are listed with a cross-reference to Mr. Davidson's 90-page Tables of Paradigms which explains the rule-exceptions via the paragraphs of grammatical \\"remarks\\" in both the Hebrew Scriptures and those few chapters written in Chaldee.The Chaldee Hebrew Scriptures... Ezra 4:8, 6:18, 7: 12-26 and Daniel 2: 4--7:21 and Jeremiah 10:11... also have a section where the paradigms of suffixes, verbs, and the declension of noun forms are listed, as well as paragraphs of explanations in the \\"remarks.\\"ALWAYS THOROUGH, Mr. Davidson divides the explanations of grammar in the \\"grammatical remarks\\" into sections and numbers so that these paragraphs are easily located when listed with the FORM of the word in the lexicon section of this volume.He has tiny footnotes which cross-reference many of the forms to the Scriptures where they are found... a real bonus. Mr. Davidson says in the introduction that:\\"This collection of citations constitutes a concordance of more than three-fourths of the forms of the Language !\\"For those of you who treasure the classic scholars, Mr. Davidson lists those whose works he used:* Gensenius for definitions* Lee, Winer, Biesenthal, Furst have also been compared with alternative suggestionsMr. Davidson's work is a compendious work that has NEVER OUT-LIVED its usefulness and utility for the serious scholar of the Masoretic Hebrew Scriptures.I have used mine for 10 years and it is a gold mine, a wealth, of Hebrew language helps and information.

It portrays how, in just three generations, a proud and free people can be transformed into abject but loyal slaves.The story starts in Africa where Tamboura is drugged by his brother and given to a slave trader. He is transported to the coast where he is sold to a slave ship captain and transported to Cuba.Like the first book in the Falconhurst series, Mandingo, Tamboura is used by his new owner as a sire to breed new slaves. Only Tamboura and his owner's mistress decide on a breeding campaign all their own. When the cuckolded \\"master\\" finds out, he has Tamboura killed and his mistress flees to New Orleans with Tamboura's child in her womb.She calls Tamboura's son Drum and raises him as her slave rather than her child. He becomes a fighting slave who is famous for beating all competitors.His son Drumstick is sold by his white grandmother when he is 17 to Hammond Maxwell of Falconhurst Plantation. This is the same Alabama plantation where the first novel of the series is set. So the last third of Drum takes us back to the characters of the novel Mandingo.Onstott has a great talent for bringing this period and this subject to life.

We are fortunate to have had handed down to us through the ages a book which describes a first hand experience of what actually happened (much as Julius Caesars Gallic or Britannic campaigns). Whether what happened is right or wrong and how people suffered because of its consequence is (and always will be) a matter of debate. The perception of what is a strange and new world (it reads sometimes like science fiction) can be likened to a modern day book of space travel. This book brings to life what may have been the experience of these men in a strange world which they have never experienced before and probably gives us a perception as to why they destoyed it in the end (for a more in depth understanding read : Hernan Cortez; Letters on Mexico, where Cortez is in conflict with himself on whether to destroy the Aztec civilization or not). It must be seen in the context of events which not only transformed the Americas but also Europe (indeed Spain) for ever. This has to been seen in the context of the commencement of a new world order which was started by the disruption caused by the capture of Constantinople by the Turks and the economic crisis that it caused in Europe. Indeed Spain and Portugal were at the spear head of Europe's colonial wars and creation of empires. The rest is history.

It is the story of a 26-year-old widowed single mother who finds herself, at two o'clock in the morning, being held hostage in a new apartment in a new city by a stone cold killer of four people armed with three loaded handguns. What happens between her and her captor for the next 7 1/2 hours is, to me anyway, a story of bravery that escapes description.I live in the city of Atlanta and worked for 20 years as a public defender in the Fulton County Courthouse from which Brian Nichols managed to escape on March 11. I know that courthoue like palm of my hand. In my opinion, Nichols was able to escape solely due to the incompetence of the Fulton County Sheriff's Department, who had him in custody. The four people Brian Nichols killed that day should still be alive, imo.Nichols escaped, killed a Superior Court Judge, his court reporter and a deputy sheriff who was pursuing him. He then outsmarted the Atlanta Police Department by carjacking a car in a nearby parking lot and parking it two floors below rather than leaving in it as the Atlanta Police Department was sure that he had done. He then boarded the Atlanta rail system in downtown Atlanta and rode out to the northeast part of town. He got off the train and a couple blocks away encountered a U.S. Customs agent who had recently been promoted and transferred to Atlanta and was working on his house. Nichols shot and killed him and left in his pickup truck.At 2 a.m. the next morning Nichols encountered Ashley as she was returning from having gone out to buy cigarettes. How she remained calm and managed to convince Nichols let her go at 9:30 a.m. so that she could have a supervised visit with her daughter in Augusta, Georgia was an accomplishment that I think very, very few people - either men or women - would have been able to do.After Nichols surrendered without incident I saw Ashley on television, read about her in the paper, saw her on the Oprah show and on Larry King live. When I read that she was going to do a book signing at a Chapter 11 store in Atlanta near us I had to go so that I could meet this woman in person and tell her that I didn't think I would live long enough to meet someone as brave as she is.I purchased her book and Ashley wrote a nice inscription on it. I have finished reading it. I had my wife take a picture of Ashley and me a copy of which I have on my desk.http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v112/hotlanta_dude/DougieandAshley.jpgThe story of her life should be an inspiration to all. I do not share Ashley's religious beliefs, but I don't doubt for a minute that she sincerely believes the Lord arranged the meeting between her and Brian Nicholas. I personally believe that those sorts of things occur as a matter of happenstance.But whatever the case may be in that regard I think Ashley Smith coming forward to tell her tale of uncommon valor, and doing so without omitting any details of her past life, should make anyone who reads her book want to stand up and cheer.Best of luck to you Ashley and God bless you."},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"I couldn't put this book down!

As a born again Christian myself, I was happy to see someone who is real, honest, and giving God all of the glory. Christians are not perfect. We just serve a Savior who is. Ashley's story is laced with that truth and I believe it shows that the hand of God is always there to guide you when you call upon Him. Regardless of your past, He wants to be the God of your present and future. We live in a world of dying hope and people need to know that there is hope in Jesus. \\"Unlikely Angel\\" shows that.

This was the case with Unlikely Angel. Frankly, after reading it I am not sure why.Ashley Smith tells her story about when she was taken hostage in 2005 by courthouse killer Brian Nichols in March of 2005. She spent seven hours with this man and survived the ordeal at her apartment in Atlanta, Georgia.I liked the fact that it was a true story told by the hostage and was looking forward to it. However, I have to say it was like watching a bad movie where you really want to reach out and change it. The book gets right into the night of her abduction in her apartment. The sequences of events themselves are interesting, but throughout she reflects upon her life, which at times made me cringe. She speaks of her marriage as if it was wonderful but admits he was abusive and into drugs. Ashley also continuously tells Brian Nichols about her daughter whom she loves but does not have custody of because of her drug use. She does describe herself as a recovering drug user but was using the day of the abduction. She seemed to have opportunity to leave the apartment but choose to stay. Ashley does say that she wanted to defuse the situation so that he wouldn't hurt anyone else. That may be true, but the story came off as redundant at times and a little strange. I couldn't help but question some of her decisions.Having not been in her shoes I don't know how she felt and what she must have gone through, but I do rely on the writing to guide me there and it came up short. I read nonfiction so that I can see the lives of others even if for a short time and in this case I was unimpressed.To see more of my book reviews, visit my blog at [...]"},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"This book is a shameless attempt to capitalize on a high-profile crime story, and its \\"author\\" is perhaps one of the most undeserving people ever to be granted the title \\"hero.\\" Smith characterizes herself as a deeply pious woman who has made \\"mistakes\\" in her life and is now trying to play the role of an idyllic Christian mother; yet she admits that she provided her captor with methamphetamine, which she presumably was using at the time and not simply stashing away for just such an emergency.

But her story is like watching a train wreck. I was prepared to be inspired, but I wasn't. Most addicts are con artists, self absorbed, self destructive and oblivious to the pain they cause those around them. Ashley is no different. And she shares that trait with the killer. He is also oblivious to the pain he caused. My heart goes out to the families of the victims and all they suffered and are still suffering. My heart goes out to Ashley and her late husband's families for all the hurt they caused them with their selfish and worthless lifestyle. Like all manipulative con artists, she uses God for her own purposes with no regard for truth. At least she used those same tactics for good for a change and stopped the murderer from doing more harm. I give her talents credit for that at least. She never took advantage of all the support and opportunities before this to straighten out and there isn't anything I can see that will keep her straight now that she has fame (even limited) and fortune. I suspect she'll only contrive to use it as an excuse to further her bad behaviour. I sincerely pray that this does not happen. I will be delighted to learn in a year or two that she did indeed turn her life around. But her pattern of behavior suggests otherwise.

In order to purchase this medicine I had to give the pharmacist my driver's license and sign a form. All this because of crankheads like Ashley Scott who are a plague on our society. Common cold medication has to be regulated to prevent crankheads like Ashley Scott from furthering their drug addiction.Everyone thinks she's some sort of hero and a good Christian. Well what the heck is a Christian doing with Crystal Meth (aka Crank) in her home. I mean, I'm glad that she could use it to save her life but she is not a hero nor is she an angel. She is a plague on our society with one of the fastest growing addictions in this nation (and one of the most highly addictive). And don't kid yourself about recovery - recovery from addiction to Crystal Meth is around 6% success.It's sickening that the media treats her like some sort of hero. Crank users are not heros - they are zeros - losers that plague our society. Buying this book is basically a way to support her habit.

She did let us in on her drug use that night, I am sure that is how she ran into him. only god knows what really happend that night between those two.She said she was out that late going to the store, we all know the truth now. Yea she did manage to get away from a killer, but people who use drugs associate with killers, rapist, and robbers all of the time. They don't go to the pharmacy and get their crack. She played herself off as an innocent school girl, which I found very hard to believe. She drove him around probly looking for drugs. Are we this hard up for a story to believe this bunch of crap about pancakes and butter. At first law enforcement was going to arrest her because they knew her story was fake and she had been seen with him. At first she was thought to be an accomplice. she was forced to admit that she did drive him around that night. It was the press that turned her into some kind of hero and the police followed suit to make this into a sensational story.It is hard for me to imagine two people high as kites reading from the purpose driven life. She most likely woke up from her high and watched television and saw a reward was offered for the men she just spent the night with. this self proclamied angel got a huge pay day that most likely is in the drug mans pocket. I am glad that I only borrowed this book and didn't spend a penny on it. I hope that the victims of katrina will write books so we can know what a true hero is. Their stories are much more fascinating and are true stories of survival. I wonder if law enforcement will still use her story to train people on what to do if they are ever kidnapped (laugh)."},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"I read the book and listened to the audio book.

It shows true Christianity where Christ meant for it to be ... with sinners, in the trenches of failure... not in the hallowed halls of \\"religious\\" whited walls.It's apparent from the story that Ashley and Brian ministered to one another. Ashley was able to get Brian to see his need to face the consequences of what he did. And in a crystal clear moment of potentially facing death, Brian was able to help Ashley see that facing mortality prioritizes life issues like nothing else!This fascinating story showed that God IS REAL and that He is working in people's lives today. And you don't have to be some perfected \\"saint\\" for God to still love you, care for you, and use you as He miraculously works His way in someone's life.I recommend this to anyone who really desires to see how God took broken, flawed human beings and looked down upon them with His grace."},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"With so many of these type of stories ending tragically (Taylor Behl, the young lady in Aruba, etc.) it is such a relief to find one that ultimately turned out o.k.Ms. Smith has written a manual on self-survival that should be read by everyone. Her God-given ability to remain calm in the most stressful of situations no doubt saved her life. Panic would have only accelerated an already dangerous predicament.Though it might not work in every case, Ashley was just what Brian Nichols needed to show him what he was. Not only that, the same was true in reverse. Thankfully, they were both willing to respond. I am a firm believer that God knows who He can trust in certain situations to achieve His purpose. If I could speak to Ashley, I would say, \\"Thanks for being a willing servant -- and for surviving.\\""},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"I thought this book was great.

To me this is the ultimate story of just how much God really loves His children and the lengths He will go to in order to reach a lost sheep. Instead of allowing her to be killed that night, He intervened and not only stopped Nichols in his tracks, but shook Ashley to her senses as well. Now she has a second chance to straighten out her life and get her daughter back, which I pray she does. I also pray that Brian will repent and renew his faith as a result of all this. Ashley is very open and honest in her story and I hope those considering reading this book won't be too quick to judge her before they even give her a chance.I know that if I had read some of the reviews listed here first I probably wouldn't have gotten the book ! May we all keep an open mind, enjoy the read, and thank God for His incredible love for us all!"},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"This book was painful to listen to. I listen to audio books on my long drives and I almost immediately stopped listening as the author's voice was grating. I only kept listening because I was curious as to the whole story. Instead this was a very repetitive narrative, mostly of her life before the incident. The professionals involved in this production should have a) convinced her to let a professional reader narrate the book and b) should have done their job of editing. Like other reviewers I was more interested in the story behind Brian Nichols. Instead we got her version only and very little of it was of the actual incident, she must have mentioned her husbands death years before at least 12 times. If you are at all interested in this story, use your local library and save your money for a good book."},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"I guess I didn't know much about the whole ordeal. I mean, I remember watching the \\"surrender\\" unfold on TV and hearing about the single mom, blah, blah, blah, but I didn't know too much. I think that is what made it such a page turner for me.This book is really good in the aspect of thinking about what you would do in this situation. As for Ashley, it states in the beginning of the book that the conversations are just what she remembers and it's not word-for-word. In reading this statement and then her story, I have to wonder how much of it she actually \\"remembered\\" and how much she made up. It just seemed a little too good to be true. I'm not calling her a liar, I'm just saying I'm not convinced. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book and she was very brave (you would have to be to be able to make it out alive,) but I just didn't come away from it feeling \\"inspired.\\""},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"I am Ashley's Aunt Kim. Her mother and I brought Ashley home with us the night of her ordeal with Brian Nichols. She has been with us (and Paige) since then. I know it is hard for many of you out there to take her story for what it is... A story of redemption. Ashley will be the first to tell you that she was no Angel and no Hero. In fact, she will tell you that she was a drug addict and a woman who made one wrong decision after another. My family lived the horror of those choices she made. We are qualified to comment on Ashley's life.We all struggled with writing this story. We prayed through the process and sought out those that would not lose the message of hope in this story. This is why we went with a Christian writer and Publisher. Yes...God was in this whole ordeal. Yes...he brought some good out of this horrible tragedy. Yes...He wants to do the same in every one of our lives. Yes...whether you want to believe it or not...God has done a miracle in Ashley's life these past 7 months. We have watched her grow physically, emotionally and spirtually. She has shared her earnings in a most generous and Biblical way with her church, victims funds, and other organizations such as Katrina Relief and World Vision. She has made the transition back into Motherhood, seeking counsel along the way. I could go on and on of her healing, but unless you are around her on a regular basis, you wouldn't understand what I'm talking about.Those of you who are skeptics, should have sat in the jail last week as she spoke with inmates on the horrors of her life. I wish you could have sat in on the \\"Celebrate Recovery\\" meeting in Omaha as she poured her heart out to those hurting women. Seeing the looks of hope on those women's faces was such an amazing sight. Ashley's comment...\\" I am so unworthy.\\"I struggled through the book. I cried as I was reminded of all the things she and our family suffered through. But...as I closed the book, I was able to thank God that He loved her enough to reach down and pull her out of her living hell and to give her a platform to share her story to those who are hurting in this world. I realize that my words will fall on deaf ears to those of you who want to be self-appointed judges and critics. But the truth of the matter is this....God knows as well those people close to Ashley what is truly in her heart. We all know the motivation behind her actions and are very proud of her for standing up for God and what she believes is His will in her life."},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"The one star reviews you see were written by people who haven't actually read the book and are cynically disgusted with all \\"book deals\\" for 15 minute celebrities. I too am a cynic who is highly suspicious of opportunistic \\"book deals.\\"It is a shame, because this book doesn't deserve much of the criticism leveled by the detractors who are mostly bitter at the genre and not this specific title.Unlikely Angel is a sincere story of a woman living in the tension between the Christian faith and the reality of a struggle with drugs. She knows how she ought to live her life and yet fails to achieve the ideals expected by her devout Christian grandfather and family members.Despite what many cynics will believe. This book is not a brazen grab for publicity by Smith. She is clearly uncomfortable with celebrity and is driven by the desire to come clean and tell her story as a way of exorcising her past. Addiction and secrecy always go hand in hand and this is her attempt to put both these demons behind her. Oh sure, the publisher wants to make money, but Smith is, present tense, healing from a wounded past.I'll also mention that Ashley Smith is incredibly smart. Though she has yet to finish her formal education and she has never had training in negotiation strategies, Smith has brilliant intuition. Police negotiators, psychologists and business negotiators would do well to pay attention to her technique.Is Ashley Smith a hero? Maybe not. Smith did not intentionally put herself in the hostage situation. However, Smith does show sincere concern for the welfare of other people. She goes back to her apartment with her captor to avoid a public shootout when she could have driven away. For once in her life, she was more concerned for others than she was in getting her next fix."},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"Unlikely Angel: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero is a truly inspiring read. It is a story about bravery, as well as a story about redemption, and a story about what God can and will do when He moves in someone's life. Ashley Smith recounts her seven-hour ordeal of March 12, 2005 when she was held hostage by Brian Nichols, who had shot up the Fulton County Courthouse the previous afternoon, killing three people before he had made his escape. Smith tells the story of her ordeal being held hostage, but she also writes about the murder of her husband Mack in 2001 and the drug addiction problems which cost her custody of her daughter Paige. All of these events build up to Ashley's spiritual awakening, when she finally realizes that God truly does have a plan for her life, and she surrenders herself to His will. A lot of skeptics and naysayers out there have been quick to judge and label Ms. Smith. I'm sure that she would be the first to say that she is neither a hero or an angel. She is only human, but like the rest of us, she is a human being for whose life God has a plan. He has already moved in a mighty way within her life, and I believe He will continue to use her. His plan for her life is far from finished. Unlikely Angel: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero is an excellent read, and I recommend it to Christians and non-Christians alike. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"I am going to have to say that this person literally changed my life and walk with God. I am a Christian as well and I admire the honesty that Ashely Smith used in the book. She says it like it was, not hiding the fact that she was a drug addict. She has flaws in her life. She has Christ as her Lord and Savior and we can all see how God works in real life. He takes the broken and makes it new. He takes the weakest and makes it the strongest. By herself, Ashley could do nothing but be taken in as a hostage and perhaps killed instantly as Brian Nicols was searching for a hideout. He did not need company. He was killing everyone on his path. He was stopped by this 26 year old woman who had faith in God through Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Christ gave her the strength to go and speak the right words, make the right choices. Even when she made a mistake and realized she had offered drugs to a killer, she immediately repented and regreted what she had said. Once the words left her mouth it was out of her hands. She can only pray, and that she did.This book teaches alot about being a Christian. Honesty is most important. The fact that she did not want anyone else killed, including the killer and showed kindness to him to reach him. Jesus says \\"love even your enemies\\". She obeyed. She trusted the Lords words. She hung on to each word of scripture she could remember at the most trying time in her life. She obeyed Gods commands, step by step she prayed quitely and God got her through it, safely. Sure she made a human mistake by offering drugs. She is a human being and we ALL make mistakes. But she was also willing to die and put her life on the line again by returning back to the appartment with a killer who just moments earlier had killed policemen and a policewoman. After it was over, she gave all the glory to God, when the cameras turned on, she kept that glory going even to this day. She says God did it, not her. She is right. Without God in her life, she would not have been alive today. Glory to God!I am glad I bought the book and read it in two days because I was going through some Christian trails myself. I know that not one of us is perfect except Jesus Christ who lives within us. God's Holy Spirit is amazing!!! Trust Him."},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"I admit that I did not know much of what exactly happened in Atlanta on March 11-12, 2005, other than that some escaped killer had taken a woman hostage, and then let the woman go free. It turns out that Ashley Smith, the so-called Atlanta Hostage Hero, in fact has quite a story to share.In \\"Unlikely Angel\\" (276 pages) Ashley recounts the events of that fateful evening, essentially talking her way through the night before somehow managing to convince the escaped killer to let her go. The retelling is intermixed with Ashley's past struggles (alcohol and drug abuse; husband murdered; being an unworthy parent to her daughter; etc.). It is clear that Ashley is taking the events of March 11-12, 2005 to turn her life around hopefully for good this time, and rededicate her life to Christ. Only time will tell whether Ashley succeeds, and I am hoping and praying that she will. Meanwhile, this is a terrific and inspirational read.As an aside, I can't help but question a number of the other reviews posted here. Take for example Sam O'Brien's review a couple of spots below this one: unlike what he writes, the book in fact does contain all the \\"unflattering details\\", and in fact spends a huge number of pages on it, making it clear to me that this guy didn't even read the book. Boo!"},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"Many times God uses ordinary people with very human problems. Even in the middle of trails God gives us something important to do. God was in charge of the situation the whole time because Ashely Smith did everything through God and not on her own. She not only ended up with her life spared but also with the many blessing of God that came after the ordeal was over.The story is a true story and one that many of us who are struggling with our lives today can relate to. I applaud Ashely Smith for setting the example of a true Christian. Not one of us is perfect. Not one of us is without fault. We are either broken or have daily struggles in life. The fact that God used someone just like me to do the extraordinary gives me lots of hope for the struggles I am going through now. I read this book at the most needed time in my walk. I am struggling right now and have now renewed faith because Ashely Smith was honest about her story.

I simply went online to see if others were as blown-away by her gut-wrenchingly honest story as I am. I have not finished the book yet, ,but when Brian Nichols was shown leaving her apt, strolling down those stairs with no fight left in him, I knew something miraculous had just happened. As a resident of Atlanta, I had the worst sense that this alleged courthouse killer could be roaming around anywhere, and that no one was safe outside. The fact that he wound up miles and miles outside the city at a remote apt complex is testament enough that I was correct in my fear ( and I live in the city limits). Also, at the time of her press conference, I was amazed at her sincerity, and simply could not wait to read a minute by minute account of her seven hour ordeal. Having begun reading it ( I bought it the day it came out), I am still amazed at her total honesty. It appears to me that she has no fear of how she will appear to the public (knowing others will mis-judge her motives as apparently they have done by the online reviews here), and that she was more interested in helping others by her inspiring story. As she writes in her book \\"what are the chances of Brian Nichols ending up at her apartment?\\". Remote at worst, miraculous at best. He even agreed with her that miracles do happen. Ashley, my heartfelt thanks that you (and God) brought an 'alleged' killer in without an ounce of further bloodshed in our city. The judge and others who were killed were decent, fair, honest people and tremendous assets to our city. And Ashley, read past those who've misunderstood your message. FOr those of us who the message is meant for, we are receiving it LOUD AND CLEAR. Brian Nichols was most definitely sent to you for a reason on March 12 and my hats off to you for your searing honest account of the ordeal!!

This book is clear, sincerely written, and will inspire others. Anyone who saw Ashley Smith on television, as I did, on the first night that she spoke to the public -- anyone who has seen her since in numerous interviews -- can not doubt that she is authentic, thoughtful and quietly courageous, and that her faith is not only genuine, but the guiding force in her life.

God does not judge people for their pasts, so why should you? Criticizing the woman for being called a \\"hero\\" are only signs of jealousy and foolishness. She may not be a \\"hero\\" in your eyes, but apparently she did a lot more than you ever have to save lives. If she used God to get this man to turn himself in, then she is a hero in Gods eyes, and that is what truly matters.Apparently none of you have ever overcome an addiction. Who are you to call the woman a \\"meth head\\" if you know nothing about her or her past drug problems. How could you criticize someone that our Father has led to overcome an addiction? You are only criticizing her Spiritual journey and her relationship with God.

As I read the book, I was mesmerized by the words of Ashley Smith and Stacy Mattingly (her co-author). When the story first broke last March, I told my local book store owner that the book would be appearing and when it did to let me know. She did ; I bought it and read it in one evening. I was so inspired by Ashley's story. Much of the writing, I am sure was done by Stacy Mattingly, who has assisted others in Christian writing...but the thoughts and feeling are those of Ashley Smith. Because of Ashley Smith, I have gone back to read and re-read The Purpose-Driven Life by Rick Warren. Two people gave The Purpose-Driven Life to me when it first came out...i guess they saw in me a need for Rick Warren's message...they were correct. I have had a problem strewn life..all kinds of problems since early childhood...I think I understand Ashlely. Her life is similar to many of the students with whom I work every day...coming from a \\"good home\\" means nothing...nor does coming from a \\"bad home\\" either..not in and of itself...it is all about the inside of you and what is in your heart. Ashley still has demons to deal with..so do all of us. I probably will never write my book..mainly because I do not have the courage to tell my story for all the world to see. It does take much courage to put yourself out there.

She was put into the national spotlight and everyone's trying to use her to suit their own point of view--making her an extraordinary hero or an utter hypocrite. In reality she's just a person, facing problems, trying to get her life together. She's taken the momentary celebrity/book deal/etc. as an opportunity (I believe) to sincerely make her best efforts at moving forward. The book itself if fairly honest at making that point. In the end, it's an ok book but I think there are many other titles out there that can better inspire your faith or thrill you with suspense. As a book itself, I think it's really a 2 star (sorry) but I'm giving it three stars because I think the trash talking is really unfair."},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel Unabridged CD: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","review":"I read the book in one day and my heart goes out to Ashley and all that she has had to deal with in her 26 years.

IF Ashley's encounter with Brian Nichols is what it took to get her off drugs, make her a better mom to Paige, and strengthen her faith in God, then God bless her. I'm not judging, but I do have an opinion: Every story has three sides; this was Ashley's. We haven't really heard Brian's, and then . . .there's the truth. The story was probably great therapy for Ashley, but I think this is her version. I read it; it was ok, but I'm convinced that Ashley and Brian knew each other and a lot more happened in that apartment than what she wrote in the book. I wish the best for her and Paige . .. and Brian. He's guilty of killing three people, but there are probably some other folks out here who should feel some guilt for what happened.

I wanted to read just what happened that night and some background info about her and Brian Nichols. She keeps stopping the action and feeding the reader stories of her husband's death, how hard it was being a drug addict, her religious beliefs, etc. Everytime the story started getting - dare I say, exciting - she would start going on and on about something in the past. Boring!I would have liked to hear more about Brian.

Those kinds of details do make it less of a fairy tale and less flattering towards the author, but Ashley Smith is still a heroic woman whose actions may have prevented more people from being killed by that man.

Sticking with a book for more than a page or two wasn't something I normally could do these days. But once I started reading it, looked at some of the pictures that are in the book also. I began to get close to the character, get drawn into her life. Once the situation turned bad you were going through everything with her to the very end. At one point I even went to my computer and looked up her interview on a famous news network and watched her talk about being taken hostage. There isn't anyway she could have come through it without God beside her each step of the way.

I have known Ashley Copeland Smith for most of her life, and I am very proud of her strength of character and courage in the face of definite evil. Yes, she has had a very difficult life, but her decision to have her aunt raise her daughter was not made lightly. Her aunt is a trusted family member, and someone that Ashley knew would take care of Paige until she got her life back in order. You don't see too much in the media about her aunt, but I can assure you that she is also an angel... guardian angel over Ashley and Paige. The faith that this family holds so dear is apparent in all that they do. Ashley, don't listen to all of the nay-sayers. You are a real gem, and I am proud to have known you over the years.

I read this book today and was so blessed and inspired by her faith even in her time of dark despair. Our entire family plans to read this book.

Our Lord is a passionate and kind God. He loves us all, so please give her a chance and love her like God does. Her life hasn't been too good and some of it at her own choosing, but it seems she is about to turn her life around.

After all, this story came out when there wasn't much \\"real\\" news going on, and was milked by the media for all it was worth. I was one of those who watched and read everything I could find, and I admired Ms. Smith. Not much changed with the publication of the book. If we had read between the lines just a tiny bit, we would have known she was not an angel, so that's not what I was looking for. I was looking for bravery and inspiration. I was not disappointed.THE BOOK IS WHAT IT IS! My only disappointment with Ashley Smith is the way she is pushing Rick Warren's book. Twice now I have seen her on television posing on the steps of what appears to be a government building holding Rick Warren's Purpose Driven Life.A book, any book, should stand on its own merits. Otherwise it's not worth your time."},{"Title":"Colt Engraving","review":"This book is a classic among Firearms Engravers, and it well should be. However, for most people the poor quality of the photographs, mainly black and white, are worse than smoke pulls and it takes a fair knowledge of engraving and techniques to be able to distinguish exactly what the patterns are and where they go. R. L. Wilson is to be commended on this historic compilation, but it is not a coffee table book as Steel Canvas could be, this is a book that belongs above your engraving bench or beside the bed of a serious engraver. For beginners, Steel Canvas and Winchester Engraving are better choices, the former having many color plates, and the latter having black and white photos of much higher quality. I also reviewed the Winchester book and believe now that much of what turned me off was the quality of the photos and not the lack of the model 94. Compared to the Colt Engraving Book, the Winchester book shines. A book for serious engravers or Colt collectors, not for the layman -- for it is not a pretty coffee table book, it is a book for guests to ooooh and ahhhhh over, it is a tool, to be studied and scrutinized by the engraver. And the photos are of poor enough quality that some need intense study to unravel their mystery."},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"Not Going Home Alone is the best example I have seen yet of the growing genre of Vietnam combat memoirs. Retired Marine Captain James J. Kirschke takes us through his tour in Vietnam with the 3d and 2nd Battalions, 5th Marines, sadly cut short by his grievous wounding in the An Hoa Valley. Kirschke goes beyond combat descriptions (although he provides plenty) and presents all the things that a platoon commander in combat has to think about and do. For anyone considering becoming a Marine or Army officer, especially as a grunt, this is a fine introduction to what one should be able to do. The book is very well-written; Kirschke does a great job bringing the Marines he served with alive for us, as well as conveying what Vietnam in the bush was like. Kirschke also provides a useful reminder that the Vietnam War and Vietnam veterans are not as portrayed by Oliver Stone and his ilk. With this book, Kirschke has given his comrades who died in Vietnam and since a wonderful memorial.Not Going Home Alone has a special resonance for me; like Kirschke I was a grunt lieutenant in the 3d Battalion, 5th Marines, although in more peaceful times (1981 through 1983). I cannot vouch personally for his Vietnam descriptions, but his descriptions of Camp Pendleton, Okinawa and the Philippines brought back a lot of memories. This is an outstanding book; here's hoping it finds a huge audience.P.S. to Hollywood: Not Going Home Alone would make a great movie, if you don't mess with it."},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"Pedestrian writing can ruin any subject, even the ready-made drama of war. Vietnam memoirs are no exception. But such is not the case in James Kirschke's account of fighting in some of the bloodiest zones of the war in 1966-67. With a colorful, engaging style that does not shy from personal revelation, Kirschke weaves a compelling narrative made genuine by its generosity of spirit and plausible by its even hand. Kirschke's experience as both an English professor and a writer gives him an advantage over the competition, true. But potent material like this still needs adept storytelling, and in Kirschke, a retired Marine captain, it finds a capable craftsman. Casual and passionate reader alike will be touched as Kirschke relates the critical and formative aspects of his service: training and bonding with his mortar platoon at Camp Pendleton, exhausting daily combat in the area just south of the DMZ -- commanding first his mortar platoon and then a rifle platoon -- and his final battle of the war, the injury that left him near death for many months. The reader will also appreciate that Kirschke has steered clear of the kind of cynical self-confession and cloying apologia that too often mars Vietnam memoirs. Not Going Home Alone is about the work of war and the love and sorrow encountered along the way."},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"Lt. James J. Kirschke demonstrated outstanding leadership skills stateside and in Vietnam. He loved his men, and they loved him. As an 81 mortars platoon commander, Kirschke drove his men to become the best of their kind in the USMC. The men he trained developed not only incredible proficiency and stamina, but also a deeply seated sense of pride in serving their country and the Corps. After Kirschke transfered to the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, he became the CO of a rifle platoon. At this juncture in the narrative, the action and tension in this finely written book heats up and never cools down. Kirschke was not a hell-raiser or macho warrior hyped up on testosterone. He was simply an excellent human being on whom God had generously bestowed such rich gifts as those of leadership ability, compassion, and sense of duty. It is incredible that Kirschke teaches literature in one of today's foremost universities, given the anti-white male and looney leftist fringe that rides herd over modern academia. When I put this book down, I thought of Kirschke the way Mark Antony thought of Brutus at the end of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: &quot;His life was gentle, and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world, this was a man.&quot; Thanks, Jim, for your unselfish service and for writing this book."},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who really wants to know what the &quot;Vietnam experience&quot; actually was or to learn about the true character of the men who lived it on a daily basis. It is a down the line account bereft of false heroics, histrionics, or embellishments written by an exceptional Marine small unit leader whose example could well be used as a learning text by anyone aspiring to become a charismatic pacesetter anywhere. Additionally, it is an eloquent portrayal of the human courage that often emerges only when put to the extreme test. Those who may have taken Philip Caputo or Oliver Stone to heart may be disappointed by the necessity of having to rethink their perceptions of the war in Vietnam and the men who served there. (Public Domain)"},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"James Kirschke describes from an introspective point of view the triumph, glories, and failures of a Marine 81 Mortar Platoon and a Marine Infantry Platoon in Vietnam. Kirschke entered Vietnam early in the war and was able to train with his 81 mortar platoon prior to deploying with the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. He describes his attempt to train and condition his platoon into the &quot;best 81 platoon in the Marine Corps.&quot; He also describes his growth into a leader of combat Marines. His love for his men and the Marine Corps is evident. Some of his leadership techniques were unconventional but judging from the testimonials of his men, highly effective.Kirschke gives a unique perspective of the early involvement in the Vietnam war. He talks frankly about mistakes that were made as well qualities that distinguished officers, NCO's, and enlisted Marines. His attempts to rehabilitate Marines who were disciplinary problems should be noted by other officers. The close relationship between enlisted Marines, Marine NCO's, and Marine Officers has always distinguished the Marine Corps from other services.Kirschke was horribly wounded after his transfer to the 2nd Battaion, 5th Marines. While at Clark Air Force Base, Kirschke received over 70 pints of blood. A lessor man would have welcomed death. Many did. However, Kirschke found comfort and strength from the letters of his men, whom he loved. He decided to give comfort to others in the ICU to sustain them through their suffering.Kirschke's triumph over death is not only uplifting, but should also be an inspiration to those who have suffered debilitating injuries or those of us who are not having &quot;a good day.&quot; If the reader does not have a tear in his eye after reading this book, he's a much stronger man than I."},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"1LT James J. Kirschke recounts the unceasing test of stamina and courage endured by Marines who served at the DMZ and An Hoa in Vietnam in 1966-1967. Unlike the cynical portrayals of reluctant warriors marking time until their return to the world and indifferent cruelty to the indiginous population, this book describes the Marines as having high morale under sparse and brutal conditions; employing vigilant and professional combat tactics in the field; and making all efforts to reduce suffering by the innocent local population. For 13 months, every step is measured taking into consideration a guerrilla ambush, an organized NVA assault, and the never-ending threat of land mines and booby traps. The author's writing style is brilliantly clear, with detailed facts and accounts of the people who served and the engagements that took place. The book comes to a shocking conclusion, and the reader comes away with a sense of inspiration, respect and gratitude."},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"I give it 4 stars because I never met any officer in Vietnam, or anywhere else, like Kirschke describes himself.

And that's the bottom-line."},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"I have read many, many first-hand accounts by Vietnam vets and this is my favorite.

I would have been proud to have served with Lieutnant Kirschke in Vietnam. We were there at the same time, but in different units. This book is the truth. This book is written by a man who walked the walk. This book should be required reading at the Naval Academy, at Marine Corps OCS, and the Basic School at Quantico. The success of an officer in the Corps depends on whether he accomplishes the mission and that his men respect him while doing it. Mister Kirschke not only did the job, but won the love and respect of his Marines. Semper Fidelis, sir!"},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"I've read a number of books based on soldier's experiences in Vietnam. Taking politics and cold war rhetoric out of the story you are left with the men on the ground.Marine patriotism abounds in this story and whatever your view on war, Vietnam, politics etc the overwhelming patriotism these men displayed is second to none. Their \\"get it done\\" attitude is untouchable as is their camaraderie.\\"Not Going home alone\\" comes from a marine law that states that dead marines do not make the journey home alone. A serving marine always accompanies the coffins. Again, the kinship of the brotherhood goes far beyond physical death.More than once I got a little teary as Kirschke tells his story. The conditions were often brutal, the missions endless and the demands put on the guys sometimes incomprehensible in their breadth.There are a lot of words on all the pages with few grammatical breaks. Somehow it can be viewed as a brain dump as if the author is somehow healing by spewing the words out of himself.I enjoyed the book but I had to put it down a little more often than I would have liked due to the structure.Each one of those who served over there has a story worthy of telling and, more importantly, worthy of honoring by reading.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"I have read literally hundreds of Vietnam non-fiction books and while I can certainly appreciate the sacrifice the author made in Vietnam, he touts himself and his accomplishments entirely too much in the book. He constantly writes about how HE trained his Marines; how HE saved the day; and how well HE accomplished this or that. Kirschke's self-appreciating and arrogant manner, combined with his nauseating praise and worship of nearly every officer senior to him caused me put the book down several times. The author clearly holds a great deal of contempt for Staff Noncommissioned Officers, describing in great detail how he verbally berated at least two Gunnery Sergeants. Any Gunnery Sergeant who would permit a young Lieutenant to jump up on him and tell him to shut up in front of the Marines probably isn't worth his salt, which is likely why the author got away with it. In the second instance, the author wonders if another Gunny ever developed any respect for him after he verbally assaulted him not once, but twice. Judging from the pompous tone of the book, I'd say it's not very likely that he ever did. Kirschke did however, speak highly of the Company First Sergeant - likely because he worked directly for the Company Commander (Kirschke's boss). Although the book is well-written, (no huge grammatical or content errors), it definitely ranks as one of the worst Vietnam books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Not Going Home Alone: A Marine's Story","review":"I loved this book, it tells a lot about the Marines in VietNam, another great book is one I read about a year ago called White Hot and Red.

He stepped on a mine and his legs were blown off.I think this is a realistic portrayal of war. Kirschke paid his dues to his country and then some. His portrayal of himself is somewhat of a concern. He keeps his platoon on extra exercises and patrols to toughen them up. He tells us that his platoon loves him, because he risks himself as much as his men. He must have been an exceptional officer in the Vietnam War. Perhaps he served at a time when the war was still young (1966-67) when this was the norm. Later accounts of the war show a more guarded officer group risking less in VC and NVA encounters.I have read many accounts of the war, and I think this is an average read, compared to the others. Since the author is a English Lit Professor, there are few issues with the text of the book-it flows well, and is well documented.

If only the likes of those misanthropic capitalists who mock and distort Bellamy were to dissapear, we'd have a much healthier planet.And by the way, what we saw in the former USSR or in China today is NOT what Bellamy had in mind; but itself a misantropic, power-based dictatorship-based government which was/is just as unhumanistic as the U.S. is now."},{"Title":"Harlem Globetrotters","review":"When discussions take place about the integration of major sports, the conversation almost always centers on Jackie Robinson and the Negro baseball leagues. Often lost is the role that the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team played in the movement to complete the integration of American society. Even more lost is the incredible talent of the people that played for the team, there has never been a better ball handler than dribbler extraordinaire Marques Haynes. In many ways, the Globetrotters are like professional wrestlers; in amidst the clowning and other antics, you overlook the incredible physical capability of the players.This book describes the history of the Globetrotters, from their barnstorming days in small towns where they played in every \\"arena\\" from a drained swimming pool to towns with a population of a few hundred. There were lean years where racial discrimination was omnipresent, it was not even possible for the men to get a hot meal, everything had to be takeout and generally from the back door. Hotel accommodations were often non-existent for the black players; they were sometimes forced to sleep on cots in private homes.Nevertheless, as was the case with the Negro baseball leagues, the talent came to dominate, as the Globetrotters regularly beat professional teams and teams of senior college all-stars. This caught the interest of professional basketball and soon the best black players were entering the NBA. While this was to the overall good, it weakened the talent pool available for the Globetrotters.All antics and clowning aside, the Harlem Globetrotters were part of a revolution in basketball, they helped the integration of major sports and demonstrated that flash and dazzle on the court could fill the seats. For years, the largest number of people to attend a basketball game was there to see the Globetrotters. This is a good story about an under appreciated aspect of sports history."},{"Title":"Harlem Globetrotters","review":"This is one of a number of books written about the Harlem Globetrotters basketball them. However, it came out in the early 1970's, so there's nothing about the near-bankruptcy of the Trotters in the 1990's, nor their rescue by former player Mannie Jackson (who has since sold the team). If you're looking for a general history of the team, this is not a bad one to pick up (and it's usually very affordable), but don't expect much in-depth analysis. George Vecsey is a decent writer, but this one doesn't rate as one of his best efforts. He gives the standard story of how the Trotters began and writes about how they grew and developed stars over the years, but it's not terribly deep.The best book on the team is \\"Spinning the Globe\\" by Ben Green, which is by far the most accurate history of the Globetrotters ever written.

Hot buried gold with hotter desert amid rampaging Apaches and deadly Seri Indians.This is a light-hearted romp concerning a large quantity of legendary Mexican gold (once Confederate gold actually) being moved to Mexico City via a mule train or 'conducta'. Though the United States law and the entire Mexican Army will be pursuing Bijah Catlow, he will attempt to steal the $2,000,000 dollars in gold. But a woman, a Mexican general, and passing through Seri Indian country alive (for the Seri use poison tipped arrows) are complications which have given Catlow much worry. Water will also be a problem with deposits as much as 40 to 60 miles apart, with many of them possibly dry this time of year. But Catlow figures that $2,000,000 dollars in stolen silver and gold are more than worth the risk.Catlow's life long acquaintance, 'never truly enemies and never truly friends', with Marshal Ben Cowan is another of those complications with which Catlow must deal. Thre is a lot of humor in this novel, more so than in many Louis L'Amour books, yet there is much danger and suspense also. The book is much better than the movie, starring Yul Bryner and Richard Crenna, which changed the story greatly and played it for too much humor.Re-reading CATLOW is always similiar to meeting up with an old friend, something I do yearly. It is another of the Louis L'Amour books that can hold a reader's returning attention, read after read.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Catlow","review":"Bijah Catlow and Ben Cowan grew up together; saved each others' life many times and even had a few good fights.

Catlow's life long friend Marshal Ben Cowan is another of those complications. There is alot of humor in this novel, but there is a danger and 'breathlessness' in it also. The book is much better than the movie, starring Yul Bryner and Richard Crenna, which played it too much for laughs.Re-reading CATLOW is always similiar to meeting an old friend.

Wiener attempts to explain Britain's general postwar economic decline by a pointing to a decline in the &quot;industrial spirit&quot; of English culture. This decline, he suggests, began in the nineteenth century, not long after the industrial revolution itself was in full swing. By examining literature, art, poetry, political statments, philosophy, social habits, and other cultural documents (even song and music), Wiener seeks to outline the decline of this industrial spirit over a 130-year period and thereby explain Britain's economic decline.In fact, what Wiener ends up tracing is not really a &quot;decline in an industrial spirit&quot;, but rather the *growth of an anti-industrial spirit*. This is not quite the same thing. It's one thing to note that many people in England were (and still are) critical of the ugliness, exploitativeness, and money-mindedness of modern industrial capitalism-- and that many of them came to feel a strong nostalgia for Old England, with it's rural, pre-industrial way of life. It's quite another to show that people actually became less interested in investing in industrial enterprises, in building factories, etc. To Wiener's credit, he does show that this anti-industrial spirit was *not* limited to working-class movements or romantic poets, but that it was actually shared by some bourgeois industrialists themselves-- at least to a certain degree. (I'm not 100% convinced, though, that the millionaire factory-owner who lives in a country estate to be away from the ugliness of the industrial cities, and who lets others direct the 'grubby' details of business management and financial investment can trulybe said to have embraced an 'anti-industrial spirit'). However, Weiner fails to show that any of this led to an actual decline in enthusiasm for-- or actual investment in-- industrial enterprises. Nor does he provide any evidence that this diffuse anti-industrial sentiment led to government policies or economic decisions by anyone that would stifled economic growth and led to an economic decline (which was, of course, the whole point of the book).When all's said and done, Wiener doesn't provide a compelling explanation of Britain's economic decline. I'm convinced that this anti-industrial sentiment is very real in England, and I'm willing to believe it could be a factor in explaining Britain's postwar decline-- but I just don't think Wiener makes the case here. That said, he does provide an excellent account of the growth of anti-industrial sentiment in English culture, and as such, this book is well worth reading as a work of pure cultural history."},{"Title":"English culture and the decline of the industrial spirit, 1850-1980","review":"Martin J. Wiener does an excellent job describing England's lack of committment to the industrial spirit and the very real economic impact such a philosophical malaise engendered.The author logically begins his thesis by pointing to 19th Century English cultural and political elites from across the political spectrum who decried the mechanical horrors of the Industrial Revolution. From the 'philosophical radical' JS Mill to the pragmatic Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (ironically, the son of an industrialist), Wiener displays a general consensus among the ruling and influential elites of England that industrial development is, essentially, not right for 'Little England.' Other Conservatives at the turn of the century, such as Lord E. Percy, felt that laissez-faire was best left with America as the U.S. 'was more favorably placed for her less noble experiment of unrestrained growth.'I disagree with previous Reader's (Silicon Valley) judgement that Wiener fails to provide 'provide any evidence that this diffuse anti-industrial sentiment led to government policies or economic decisions'. This is simply wrong. Chapter 6 (Images and Politics) provides a very real example of how the elites' disdain for industrial reform/innovation led to unfortunate legislative consequences: Joseph Chamberlain (Colonial Secretary of the Conservative Party) failed to pass much-needed tariff reform legislation (part of a sweeping economic program to re-energize England's fledgling industrial economy) because of ingrained political resistance to 'strenuous' economic resurgence. Further in the same chapter, Wiener points to policies for rural preservation and revivalism made by Conservatives in power. Such policies and, more importantly, deep-seeded mentalities hindered England's economic modernization as other industrial nations around her moved forward.Wiener does a great job illustrating how romantic notions of pastoral 'purity' have very real economic consequences when political leaders espouse to such views to the detriment of modernization. England's ultimate failure to fully embrace industrialism allowed other industrial nations (ie Germany, U.S., France), with no such qualms, to move forward to the top of the heap."},{"Title":"Campbell's Soup Collectibles from A to Z: A Price and Identification Guide","review":"The comprehensive Campbell's Soup collectors guide will help you identify the many products produced over the years, and estimate their value.

William Morrow & Co. published the work in 1971 in hardback. Bullins labels this as \\"a black love fable in four movements.\\" Bullins successfully weaves 12 characters who share housing in southern California. The lead character is Stevie Benson, a college student who develops a crush on his landlady Velma Best. Velma's husband O.D. is a former Vietnam vet who is now abusive and flits on & offstage with knives, liquor and derision. The men in the duplex repeatedly play cards, drink, smoke and joke. Marco Polo Henderson is Stevie's roommate and son of Montgomery Henderson who is reacquainting himself with his son whose mother raised him away from the dad. Tootsie Franklin is another of their buddies who seems none-too-bright but jovially joins the fray. Mamma & Pops are two aging (mid-40s) alcoholics who live in the building. While there is a lot of good-natured ribbing and put-downs, the play is a love story where Stevie falls hard for Velma and intervenes because her husband is abusive. This story would translate well onto today's stage, 37 years after first presented. Bullins' dialogue is peppery and literate; the action of the play moves swiftly, sometimes lurching forward suddenly.

He's simply the best at combining fully-fleshed characters, riveting character drama (his handling of family members in conflict sets the standard, imho) and great storytelling. This five-book series (the first 3 are included in this volume) is my favorite series by him, edging out Alvin Maker and both Ender series. Set millions of years in the future, it concerns a loose-knit extended family on the planet Harmony, called out from among their neighbors by the \\"Oversoul\\" to re-activate the remaining starships and journey back to Earth. Into this epic tale, Card weaves themes of faith, family, loyalty, trust, fidelity and the balance between the needs of the individual vs. society. Card is the only author ever to win both Hugo and Nebula awards back-to-back. This series proves that his talent isn't limited to the Enderverse."},{"Title":"Homecoming Harmony: The Memory of Earth, The Call of Earth, The Ships of Earth","review":"This is a science fiction trilogy in one volume, and while I liked the first book, by the end of the third I wanted to strangle the main characters for stupidity. I believe this is a retelling of a Biblical tale (the Book of Mormon?) because of the blatant and obvious religious parallelism in events.Book one is good, and it's all about the lesser son of a 'noble' house on a world controlled by an ancient computer in a regressed state of civilization. Main character Nafai has a sense of justice, and the society uses marriage contracts rather than marriage-for-life. The big deal is the Oversoul, and Nafai can 'hear' it. The computer needs repair, preferably from Earth, otherwise the protocols which stop humans from slaughtering each other will fail soon. His family is against him, but Nafai spends the book trying to do right by his society.Well I don't want to spoil anything, but book two is where is goes downhill. It's all about leaving the Basilica (city from book one), and the character Moozah makes no logical sense near the end.Book three is finally setting off for Earth, now the main character and his family are the 'chosen' people. Very biblical, if you like that.This is actually a five book series withEarthfall (Homecoming)andEarthborn (Homecoming)completing the series later, and in my opinion, it gets silly, basically abandoning the sci-fi and going straight into parable. I do not advise starting into this series unless you are a Mormon or really like religious fiction.While Orson Scott Card has won awards, he's also a religious man, and I guess this was his literary contribution to that ideal."},{"Title":"Shockwave 3D (Voices (New Riders))","review":"I might not be the greatest director user out there but i am very interested in the 3d area of director to bring my 3d models to life.

Toynbee's A Study of History","review":"Maurice Samuel (1895-1972), the great Romanian-born writer, translator and orator, migrated to England in 1900 and to the U.S. in 1914. He was the author of more than a dozen highly regarded books, although his name today has fallen almost completely off the radar.In this 268-page volume, he takes to task several volumes of the work of Arnold Toynbee, A Study of History, for its rampant misrepresentation of Jewish history and the Jewish people, from biblical times down to the modern conflict between the Arabs and the Jewish state of Israel.He begins with his 1939 assignment by the New York Post to go to Europe and find a ship carrying Jewish refugees from Hitler's Europe to international mandate Palestine.At the time, he notes sardonically, the western powers had \\"hung out a sign\\" to the peoples about to be engulfed by six years of terror: \\"Do not scream while the alligator is devouring you: it will only infuriate him unnecessarily.\\"And of all those peoples, he adds, \\"none was heard with more impatience and distaste...than the Jews.\\" He accepted the assignment, but arrived in Paris on the day that the Nazis signed a pact with Stalin, and his assignment was relegated to history's dustbin., not least because \\"the traffic in rescue was temporarily disrupted....\\"The Nazis invaded Poland on September 1, and Samuel returned to New York aboard a darkened ship, sailing incommunicado.While in London, Samuel came across the first six volumes of Toynbee's work at Bumpus' bookshop; he'd been hearing favorably of him since 1933, and purchased the set for what he knew would be a silent crossing. His work took Samuel \\"to a mountaintop,\\" and in a moment showed him \\"twenty-odd kingdoms, or rather Societies...\\" bit by bit their living and dead.\\"His universality was stupefying, the range of his references encyclopedic.\\" Samuel was not then arguing with facts as facts. That part came later.He suspected that, vis a vis the Jewish people, Toynbee's facts and history were quite inaccurate, and so he has proved in this little volume. \\"I challenge,\\" he wrote, \\"the account of certain contemporaneous events in the Jewish field\\" and stipulated as well \\"where he has omitted from the record material which he had at his disposal, and which in fact he helped to prepare,\\" so that the results are quite distorted and untrue.Here, Samuel applies the facts that he himself witnessed to Toynbee's analysis. He had trouble with the expressed disapproval of Jewish people, whom Toynbee lumped together with many other long-gone ancient civilizations as \\"two sets of fossilized relics of similar societies, now extinct.\\"Obviously, the Jewish people are not extinct, nor is their history dead, nor could a fossilized condition, as Samuel observed, be laid to the Buddhists of Ceylon, the Christians of Armenia or the Jains in India, among others.And so does Toynbee continuously refer to the Jewish people and the Parsees throughout his work. It dawned on Samuel that \\"the man was quite serious.\\" Yet he had not offered any evidence in the first place, and did not offer any each time he repeated the insults.\\"Whatever Professor Toynbee may mean\\" with regard to others, \\"he means that the Jewish people is spiritually and intellectually a fossil, an inert and petrified form devoid of living juices, a lifeless and unproductive...simulacrum of genuine peoplehood.\\"For further details of Toynbee's libels, read Samuel's book.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"The Professor and the Fossil: Some Observations on Arnold J. Toynbee's A Study of History","review":"Maurice Samuel was a Jewish nationalist who wrote this book as an angry objection to the many volumes Arnold Toynbee had written about Jewish History. His principal objections in the book are not Toynbee's work which he can find little valid fault with, but that Toynbee's conclusions do not fit into the canon of his nationalist interpretations of history.Samuel sees Jewish History as one great uninterrupted and unchanging story which would inevitably lead to the re-establishment of a Jewish state. That Jewish state would automatically come to live as the re-embodyment and continuation of the old Jewish state of pre-roman times. But as can be found in Irish/Polish/Ukranian/Armenian history, the restoration is never quite that simple.As Samuel was not a historian, his ability to make valid criticisms of Toynbee is limited to mostly emotional and political observations against his conclusions. He took great objection to Toynbee's comparasions of Jewish history to the histories of similar people. Comparing them to Indians, Ceylonese or Armenians could never be valid because of what he saw as the superior nature of Jewish History. But his argument fails. There isn't any particular reason that Jewish history can't be compared to Armenian history given that as physical nations both had been destroyed and submurged but had not faded out.Toynbee used the word fossil, but in reading his work it is clear that he meant fossil to mean a fossil of a physical nation-state. By using the world fossil, he was implying a state of suspension. He was not saying that a fossilized people could not come back (as Israel later did) and emerge as a nation-state again.Anyone who reads Toynbee will find a man seriously interested in his subject and his work. His work shows passion, not insult or disregard. It can only be taken as such by those who would read in words or insults where none exist. Toynbee, when he used the word fossil, did not imply a \\"people\\" fossilized, but a nation-state in a fossilzed condition. Peoples such as the poles or the Irish, were similarly fossilized as a nation when their countries disappeared from the map. But they still existed as a live people. Toynbee would never have said otherwise.The problem I have with Samuel's book is that he can only make his case through his own words and concepts inserted into Toynbee's. He doesn't make the case directly from Toynbee quotes, but rather makes it from his deductions about what Toynbee's motives were.Toynbee was a great scholar who deserves respect. Those who think otherwise should make a case based on reason and flaws in the work itself rather than as Samuel does based on emotion and reading words into texts that cannot be found."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Religion: A Critical Introduction","review":"i know that brian did not expect me to read the text when it was given to me, but a nine hour flight doesn't offer a great deal to do.

Over 300,000 Japanese lost their lives and many millions became homeless because of General Curtis LeMay's decision to go after the residential areas of Japan. Rather than try to precision bomb the factories that made munitions and aircraft engines, LeMay went after the residences because many were home based industrial enterprises. These small shops were destroyed affecting the large plants. In addition, workers who lost their homes also tended to go to work less ofter thereby destroying the morale of the Japanese worker.This destruction (although a dirty business) proved to the average Japanese the loss of the war and served the Americans.I think this was a balanced book. Edoin proves the military clique of Japan made the civilian work force an acceptable military target. It also shows how the American military went after a targets which caused thousands of civilian deaths. More people lost their lives in the fire bombing of Japanese cities than the deaths caused by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A thoughtful read."},{"Title":"The Night Tokyo Burned","review":"About 25 years ago, while flying back from Seattle to Oakland, I read the Boeing Company's semi-official history. When I got to the chapter where they illustrated the millions of tons of bombs dropped on the people of Japan, where they inumerate the hundreds of thousands of people who were murdered by those bombs, when they pile up the statistics of the numbers of buildings destroyed, when they add up all the square miles of Japan that was made into wasteland by their bombers, I simply broke down in tears.It wasn't the air war's impact that shocked me. I had been aware of it since childhood. What hit me was the callus inhuman gloating and the treatment of murder as an industrial statistic that sickened me. I was not naive. In fact, I was travelling around the West as the regional organizer of a revolutionary socialist movement. The Boeing book smacked me right in the face. The billionaires who run this country care not one wit for the lives of ordinary people, in Japan, in Vietnam, or in Seattle! If it serves their purpose to kill us off by the hundreds of thousands and millions, they will do it, and gloat over how well they can do it.Hoito Edoin puts the terror-bombing campaign against Japan's people in human terms. He speaks of real people: a 12 year old separated by the firestorm from his family, a mother who has her baby sucked out of her back harness by the firestorms, a doctor who has a few assistants to deal with hundreds of thousands of injured,a man who would like to wake up in the morning and see his city as he always has, a woman who fights her hair, her clothes, a group of terrified Tokyo citizens hiding in a ditch, praying out loud to keep themselves awake and alive, and people who have to climb over, fight their way through, or up out of piles of bodies. We stare these people in the face as the US Army Air Force bombers try to incinerate them and their cities. Yet, Edoin never over dramatizes. He never lectures. Restraint and accuracy keep his story on a human scale and prevent us from being overwhelmed by the carnage.The real facts are that in the history of bombing, particularly in the Second World War, the bombers had difficulty hitting any targets in a precision way. When the US tried to do that over Germany, the majority of US aircrew were killed. By 1942, the British gave up any pretense at precision bombing. They borrowed the tactics that made the German bombing of Coventry such a horror. They bombed to kill people and destroy cities through firebombing--creating huge fires whose convection became so strong that it was an explosive force itself. While the US made the pretense of precision bombing in Europe,it soon joined the British terror bombing efforts at places like Dresden and Hamburg and many smaller cities that suffered under firestorm raids.Curtis Le May, who many may remember as a war-criminal in Vietnam and a proponent of nuclear warfare, carried the same strategy to the air war against Japan in the raids described in this book. These raids were designed to kill people and destroy cities in Japan by burning them down. Whether any military targets happened to be involved was secondary. In fact, frustrated with Le May's indifference to crucial military targets, especially for the airwar, the US Navy brought in its aircraft carriers to carry on its own bombing campaign against Japanese military targets that Le May neglected.Le May's targets were the people and their homes, hospitals, schools, religious shrines, their parks and museums, their stores and places of pleasure. After the war, the strategic bombing survey by the US government and military, showed that given the effort and the hundreds of thousands of people murdered, these terror bombings in both Germany and Japan were relatively inefficient in the purposes of American militarism.Edoin is very clear about the criminal nature of the Japanese military and business dictatorship and their war, and about their basic indifference to the suffering Japanese people were undergoing. He mentions the atrocities Japan had carried out in China where its bombing of undefended Chinese cities shocked the world.However, the larger question is the inhumanity of the leaders of the American war machine who had no qualms at making millions of ordinary people, millions in Japan who had little or nothing to do with the war, the targets of their terrorism. Whether it was efficient or not, whether the Japanese war effort was limited or not, the terror bombings indicated tht the lives of Japanese working people, students, youth, children, seniors, meant nothing to Curtis Le May and the other leaders of the American war machine in the Pacific War just as the lives of the Vietnamese people meant nothing to the American war machine and Le May during the Vietnam war.And here we return to the value of this book.

Does any living person know what that means? It means a hands on, intimate relationship with mathematics.Well there's a lot of geometry and other math in the book, but I think an enthusiast will take a moment to understand, and be rewarded for the effort.Many design principles for engine, frame, suspension, etc are still valid today. It's odd to see current technology experimented with in the 1920s, 1940s, etc. It's a revelation to see WHY certain features exist.The motorcycle is an elegant machine partly because there is very little compromise for fashion. Every part, ideally, serves a practical function. Every part contributes to performance and safety.Irving brings these facts home with clear text, profuse illustrations and vast personal experience in working motorcycle design.Old motorcycles are lots of fun to look at, to ride, and to examine for their unique features. Modern sport bikes continue the engineering push with truly incredible materials and design features at very competitive prices. When you read this book, you will understand just how refined modern bikes can be. You will have a greater appreciation of your own motorcycle."},{"Title":"The Myth of the Good and Bad Nations","review":"Rene Worsmer's book THE MYTH OF THE GOOD NATIONS AND THE BAD NATIONS is a good introduction to practical political reality vs. wishful thinking and ideology. Wormser makes clear that the concepts of good nations and bad nations (good people vs. bad people) is a disasterous political lens that leads not only to unfavorable and unforseen political results but also to poltical, economic, and personal tragedy and human suffering.Wormser begins his study with a brief diplomatic and political history of Europe during the 19th century. Those naive historians who somehow imagine that Europe's diplimatic history especially after 1871 was one of peace and stability are easily refuted by the early sections of this book. There were serious political tensions in Eastern Europe which were kept under control by German and especially Otto von Bismarck's careful diplomacy while he was William I's Chancellor. Wormser is blunt in diagnosing the \\"small wars\\" in Europe after 1871 as well as European and U.S. wars and repeated military interventions which were continuous until 1914 when World War I erupted in Europe.Wormser undermines the childish thesis that World War I was the entirely the fault of the \\"Wicked Germans.\\" Those primary responsible for the eruption of World War were primarily the Russians and French with British support. For those who are interested in a more comprehensive view they should read Harry Elmer Barnes' THE GENESIS OF THE WAR and Charles Tansill's AMERICA GOES TO WAR. The latter two books give a well researched account of World War I. The book titled GERMANY NOT GUILTY by H.H. Cochran is an excellent summary of the immediate causes of World War I. Cochran gives \\"chapter-and-verse\\" details that not only were the Russians and French responsible for the diplimatic background to World War I, but they also were primarily response for the immediate causes that led to gunfire in 1914.Wormser's scathing denounciation of the Versailles Peace Conference (1919) is solid. Wormser relies on Joh Naynard Keynes' THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES in making a good historical case against the \\"victors\\" during this conference. One should note that Keynes carefully detailed German industrial prowess and geographic position in Central Europe. Keynes was clear that if the German economy collapsed, the economies of Eastern and Western Europeans would follow suit. Wormser should have exploited this historical thesis which would have further strengthened his book. Wormser was obviously aware of Keynes' THE ECONOMIC CONSQUENCES OF PEACE and gives Keynes high praise for this book.Wormser further gives readers and short but good summary of the Interwar Years (1919-1939). He introduces readers to the fact that the outbreak of World War II, similiary to the outbreak of World War I, was not entirely the fault of the \\"wicked Germans.\\" Wormser should have focused more on Eastern Europe. He deals with Soviet acts of war against the Finns in 1939 plus Soviet conquest of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. However, he should have dealt with Polish conquests in sections of Lithuania in March, 1938 and Teschen Province in Czechhoslovakia in September, 1938. He could have added that Polish military activity obviously alerted the Germans and the Soviets. He could have also dismissed the notion that the wicked Germans attacked the innocent Polish in September, 1939. One should note that the Soviets also invaded Poland simultanously in Septembver of 1939 via prior previous secret agreement with the Germans.Wormser deals briefly with the outbreak of World War II in Asia. He reveals to readers how Pres. D. Roosevelt (FDR)secretly planned war with the Japanese while preaching peace. One should note that FDR met with Winston Churchill at the Atlantic Conference in 1941 prior to U.S. entry into World War II and secretly planned to enter U.S. forces into that war without any member of the U.S House or Senate knowing of these illegal and unconstitutional maneuvers.Wormser begins his conslusion of the book by contrasting the pious platitudes of both FDR and Churchill with their underhanded and cruel manipulations which condemned the innocent civilians of the losers to needless suffering and tragedy. Wormser gives good details of the looting which permitted the allies to loot and steel especially from the Germans plus political divisions which were designed to ruin the Gemans politically and economically forever. Wormser reveals the stupidity of ruinning the Germans and Japanse in lieu of the emerging Cold War which worked favorably on behalf on Big Communism.The last chapter of the book was written with the background of the Cold War and the recent termination of the Korean War. Wormser obviously did not have the hindsight of the eventual end o the Cold War. His solutions were too costly and based on too much trust what he thought U.S. \\"allies\\" should do. What should be realized is that Big Communism ended because the leaders of Big Communism no longer had the \\"Yankee Imperialists\\" to hate once U.S. forces left Vietnam in 1975. Wormser should have perhaps realized that Big Communism's leaders lost the Cold War once peace broke out, and their reaons for economic failure and police state measures were no longer valid.In spite of minor criticisms, Wormser's book is worth reading. He could have added a bibliography which would have attracted further interest. However, this should discourage readers from reading this book. Wormser writes well, and his book is easy to comprhend. It is a good book to start examining the failures of the 20th century which were based in part on the myth of good nations and bad nations."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide for CPP Examination Preparation","review":"I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed in the book.

If all you're looking for are the places everyone else goes, then this is probably an OK book. It seems to only feature the places where the moneyed folks will go and none of the places that really make travel interesting. Their suggestions for dining and lodging were so limited they were worthless. I certainly didn't feel like I could plan a trip using this book. I got suckered in by the &quot;look inside&quot; feature on this and the Montana Handbook. Why they didn't put it on the Ultimate Montana book is puzzling. Probably because they wouldn't sell any of these other two books if people could really compare. If you want to see what all the other tourists see then this book is probably adequate. If you want to follow their recommendations for dining and lodging, better pack a lot of cash. I mean really, packing two of the largest states in the country into a pocketbook the size of a Grisham novel should tell you something. There are parts of the state they don't even cover.

His clientele consist mainly of society matrons who desire a younger look. Once in a while, Raymond takes on cases where the patient, wanted by law enforcement officials, need to disappear. As Raymond works on one of these individuals, someone kills his anesthesiologist, which forces the surgeon to disappear.Six years later in Pittsburgh, society matrons cluster around the Cutter Institute for Cosmetic Surgery. Stanley Stillwell goes to the clinic for extensive surgery in order to vanish. However, Stillwell sees another patient at the facility and simply goes berserker. He almost chokes Tory Welch to death. When Stillwell calms down, surgery is performed on him. However, he soon learns that Welch is an assistant DA. He kidnaps Tory and her boyfriend Dr. Jack Merlin, planning to kill both of them. However, before he can complete his ugly deeds, a masked intruder sticks an ice pick into his brain, killing him. Jack and Tory have solved homicides before and team up to try to uncover the truth.TRAGIC WAND is an exciting fast-paced mystery that will appeal to readers who enjoy subtle twists in their plots. The hero is a surgeon whose hobby is magic in which he explains the tricks. Tory is a superb partner and heroine in her own right. However, James Tucker's tale belongs to the story line in which sleight of hand leaves the audience wondering who are the puppets and who are the puppeteers?Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Tragic Wand (Jake Merlin Mysteries)","review":"This author continues to mature with each new book. Tragic Wand is even better than Tucker's two previous Merlin books. This whodunnit had me on the edge of my seat until the very last moment.

The best reason for sticking with Tucker is definitely Tragic Wand.This book is fast paced and smart, leaving the reader thinking they've solved the mystery time and time again, only to uncover some clue that twists your entire theory around.

I hope that there are more Merlin stories coming, because I want to see how the characters develop!"},{"Title":"Tragic Wand (Jake Merlin Mysteries)","review":"Number three in the series may have proven to be the charm, but one wonders what happened since then. Tragic Wand is the third in a series of medical mysteries and thrillers that have been written by James Tucker about Jack Merlin and his girlfriend Tory Welch. In this third volume, Mr. Tucker gets it right on almost all counts which is also a huge improvement over the first two volumes. Finally we can read a medical thriller that has the requisite mix of ingredients to make a fun read.In his previous two books, there was never a mystery about who the bad guys were and why they were doing what they were doing. In this book, you think there is no mystery as you get started, but you very quickly pick up on the fact that there is more going on under the surface. I thought it was great that I was not able to piece together the real storyline until the last eighty pages of the book. Also, the way some crimes were being committed were almost totally believable and the motives of the various characters were logical and made sense.Tragic Wand really delves into the issue of what happens when a plastic surgeon goes bad. It starts with a prologue in which a plastic surgeon in Florida does an operation on a gangster and then finds out that his colleague has been murdered. The implication being that since the doctor left the office too soon, the murderer was actually looking for the surgeon.Move time forward by six years and we meet a very successful plastic surgeon in Pittsburgh who operates on a shady character who seems to have a pathological need to maintain anonymity during his operation. Unfortunately, due to a scheduling error, Tory Welch is in the office when the criminal is there and he goes ballistic. Not only does he harm Tory, but he manages to go off full-cock and create all kinds of additional havoc. There are many twists to the story and I will not lay them all out here since that would give too much away.There is a lot of medical jargon in these novels and that is expected both because of the nature of the stories as well as the nature of the writer - he is a doctor who is practicing in the Pittsburgh area. In addition, this book excels in giving the flavor of the various Pittsburgh locales that are descried in the book. As someone who lives in Pittsburgh, it was easy for me to visualize the various scenes as they are very authentically rendered.The author does have a habit of naming his characters in a slightly goofy manner. The main character is Jack Merlin who is a surgeon and a magician (magician = Merlin, get it?). The plastic surgeon is Marshall Cutter; while the gun-wielding policeman is detective Deringer. Ouch. Another thing that I do not particularly like is that the assistant DA (Tory Welch) is always on the receiving end of most of the violence. Of course, Merlin and Welch continue to investigate what is going on in spite of and in ignorance of any police actions...I do regret though, that it seems as if Mr. Tucker has given up this series. The web site given in the book is non-operative and the date of publication of this book is seven years ago, and there are no other volumes. It's a shame that now that he finally got it right, Mr. Tucker has given up the writing ghost."},{"Title":"Tragic Wand (Jake Merlin Mysteries)","review":"When I picked up this book, I wasn't expecting much. The cover and title are goofy, and even the author's photo and bio make the book look like a third rate \\"cozy\\" mystery. But it isn't.The plot was gripping! The murder scenes and descriptions were so vivid and horrendous, I could barely keep reading (makes you want to cover your eyes like at a horror movie). The intensity kept building as the pages flew by. The author uses his medical knowledge well in building a believable murder mystery. Count me in as a new James Tucker fan. His entry into the genre of medical thrillers should be noted!"},{"Title":"Tragic Wand (Jake Merlin Mysteries)","review":"I happened upon this book and was surprised by how well-written it was for a practicing physician.

I also like the way Dr. Tucker puts a story together with murder, mayhem, magic and several interesting plot twists.I've interviewed Dr. Tucker and have found him kind, generous with his time, and truly devoted to his medical practice AND the avocation of writing.As always, I'll look forward to more Jack/Tory tales...they're always exciting and make for a page-turning read!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tragic Wand (Jake Merlin Mysteries)","review":"I guess James Tucker thinks the reading audience needs a little help keeping the characters straight.

Although the Nuremberg Trial wasn't the first attempt at judging war criminals (a surprise for me), it was the first who reached a successful final conclusion. Telford Taylor draws a frank, direct and complete analysis of the proceedings in which the defendants aren't the only point of focus.The performances of the judges, lawyers and even researchers are scrutinized under a microscope in order to give the reader a clear picture of the whole enterprise.The author also isn't shy of critics directed at his fellow Americans, as judge Francis Biddle and Justice Jackson in particular are on the receiving hand of some unpleasant but deserved observations.Telford has to merit to keep an honest, clear head.

The country that strikes first is the guilty party.A lot of time and effort went into making the case against Nazi Germany being the aggressor and therefore guilty of starting a war of aggression.The second big decision was that even soldiers who must follow orders were not totally free of guilt or responsibility. There are crimes that even in times of war that go beyond the scope of \\"following orders.\\" These crimes would forever now be labeled as \\"Crimes against Humanity\\" and even under orders or in consequence of your own life these actions should be denied or refused compliance.The fact that this book is also a memoir gives it a lightness and readability not found in other books dealing with such a serious subject matter.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:Mein Kampf - An Analysis of Book One"},{"Title":"The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir","review":"Telford Taylor is an optimist. He waited a while -- over 40 years -- to get a certain distance and perspective before writing up his experiences as a junior (later chief) prosecutor at the Nuremburg International Military Tribunal to try war crimes.He made it. Then he wrote more than 600 pages, which should have been a lot more than any but specialists would want to read on that subject at this date (1992, when this review was first published).But various terrible situations, especially in Yugoslavia, have made the subject of war crimes trials current again. (And, in 2006, still, with new venues, like Liberia, Rwanda, Sudan, Iraq, East Timor and, for some, the USA or Israel, under consideration.)People have floated the idea, usually hesitantly, that maybe the prospect of retribution would give the Serbs, Iraqis etc. pause.At a higher level, Taylor is an optimist because he believes the rule of law can be used to reduce the overall level of frightfulness in human disputes. He is not so naive an optimist as to believe the disputes themselves can be quelled.'The Anatomy of the Nuremburg Trials' is a handbook on how to go about using pieces of paper to control, or at least to retaliate against, ruthless, powerfully armed men of evil intent. The trials have been studied by historians, but Taylor offers a deeper look.He reveals some of the jockeying for position, the careerism and ambition of the players, especially the American team. He assesses the legal tactics, the high-flown sentiments and the low-down cynicism. Overall, he gives the effort good marks.The idea of war crimes trials was not new in 1945, but the effort after World War I had been futile. The World War II Allies, the United States, Britain, France and the USSR, had widely differing notions of what to do with the Nazi criminals. The eventual Nuremburg tribunal was largely the idea of New York lawyers in the Army, who created legal theories from 1944 on.The implementation of those theories takes up much of Taylor's book. For present purposes, the interest centers on the ideas of Murray Bernays. There were so many Germans implicated in murder, looting, slavery and other crimes that, in 1944, there seemed no way to process them all for justice.At Yalta, Stalin suggested shooting the top 50,000 Germans (roughly, everyone with the rank of colonel or equivalent and higher). This would have been justice, since none of these men was innocent. But Winston Churchill wouldn't go along. The usual story is that Churchill took Stalin seriously but turned him aside with a joke. Taylor thinks Stalin was joshing and that Churchill was the serious men. Both men were drunk.Bernays recommended finding certain organizations criminal, then processing the members for punishment. Mere membership would then include an assumption of guilt, and the accused would have to prove themselves innocent or coerced or in some other fashion unworthy of punishment.The organizations were monstrous enough -- the SS, German High Command, Gestapo etc. At the trial, some of the organizations were convicted, some acquitted.The Americans and Britons, unlike the Russians and the Germans, did not have the stomach to keep killing helpless people endlessly, no matter how much they deserved it, so in the end the members of the criminal organizations were mostly turned over to German courts, which set hundreds of thousands of brutal killers free, or slapped wrists.Taylor says he was always uneasy about the Bernays theory and was relieved when military authorities intervened to set up 'denazification' procedures that allowed the Nuremburg tribunal to mostly duck the issue.However, niceties about being innocent until proven guilty are exactly the problem with using war crimes measures to prevent, say, massacre of Bosnians. (Technically, today it would be necessary to use the rubric 'crimes against humanity,' since no one bothers to declare war formally any more. The distinction is of interest only to lawyers.)The big killers can't operate without the help of the little killers. But the little killers have no incentive to rebel against their masters as long as they believe they will be treated lightly if they lose the war. Therefore, to be credible, the threat of retribution must be made against all members of organizations -- the Bernays solution.This was, I had thought, the position of Taylor in his book 'Nuremburg and Vietnam,' which courageously said that there was sufficient evidence to incriminate Americans, including some in Washington, in war crimes in Vietnam. The only practical way you can do this is to prosecute all members of criminal groups; you will never find an order that says, 'Go commit genocide.' Even Hitler never (so far as anyone has found) put his Final Solution down on paper.But in 'Anatomy,' Taylor opposes the Bernays theory and says he has done so consistently.He does say that 'the laws of war do not apply only to the suspected criminals of vanquished nations. There is no moral or legal basis for immunizing victorious nations from scrutiny.' That is the optimistic viewpoint.ADDENDUM: I was wrong in 1992 to think that no one would ever put his name on a genocide order. The Iranians and Palestinians and Lebanese Hezbollah changed the old, European rules."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir","review":"The author was a member of the American Prosecution staff at the InternationalMilitary Tribunal that was held in Nuremberg in 1945-6 with the purpose of judgingmajor Nazi war criminals. The book, as the subtitle states, is a personal description of the trial,including its pre-history, that is, the negotiations between the Allies in the last part ofthe War that resulted in the decision of constituting the IMT and helding the trials (largelyan American idea) instead of some other methods of dealing with the emprisioned Nazi top leadership (suchas shooting them without trial, as Churchill defended, or prosecuting them in national courts). Theproblems and frictions encontered in drafting the Charter of the IMT, the Indictements, and the selectionof the defendants is covered in detail in the first fourth of the book. The remaining deals with thetrial itself. What makes this a very interesting book is that it not only describes the publicpart of the trial but also the backstage, and even some developments that would probably never been knownif the author had not been himself personaly involved in the works. Near the end of the trial the author wasmade Chief U.S. Prosecutor for the ensuing war crimes trials that took place in Nurember for thenext three years. It would have be interesting to read his account of those ones."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir","review":"Why? In a word, \\"objectivity\\".Was Jackson a failure? On the contrary. True, he stumbled in Goering's cross-examination. But the prosecution -- under Jackson -- had submitted an enormous amount of documents and witness' statements, implicated Goering deeply in the regime's worst crimes, which Goering could not refuted, even if Jackson hadn't bothered to cross-examine him. What's more, Jackson realized, far more than anybody else, that the trial is also a moral example to the world; thus he supports Jackson's calling of eyewitnesses to Nazi horrors despite the fact that technically (due to the existence in evidence of relevant documents) the witnesses were superfluous.Was Streicher the worst of the lot? Surprisingly, Taylor notes it is questionable whether Streicher, however disgusting \\"Der Sturmer\\" was, was actually guilty of any of the four counts in the indictment, let alone guilty enough to be hanged. He criticizes the tribunal's quick condemnation of Streicher to death, \\"as if they were stepping on a worm\\".Were the judges biased? No. Nobody was convicted merely because horrors were done by SOMEBODY; all defendants convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity (with the exception of Streicher) were closely connected to specific crimes. True, he thinks Streicher, Jodl and Syess-Inquart were too severely punished, while Speer and Funk escaped the gallows unfairly -- Speer by playing penitent, Funk by his weakness. But he notes that such disagreements are part of the very nature of a human judicial process, and in no way makes the trial a miscarriage of justice.Did the presence of the USSR make the trials \\"show trials\\"? No. He notes that whatever one thinks of the USSR, it had a right, as the country who suffered by far the most, to be in Nuremberg. But never have the Soviets managed to hide embarrassing facts about their own behavior from coming out (e.g., the Katin massacre or the secret agreement on the partition of Poland), nor had any defendant been convicted without at least two of the three other, non-Soviet (voting) judges agreeing. Had the Russians not been there, the verdicts might well have been the same.These and numerous other claims of \\"common wisdom\\" about the trials are exploded in this detailed, fascinating book. The feeling one gets is of a trial -- imperfect in some things -- that was as close as humanely possible to achieving its two main aims: be a moral light to the world, as well as being fair to the defendants."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir","review":"A very enjoyable read and enlightening in ways that a narrative history can't be...Mr. Taylor tells it like he saw it, especially about the key people involved!"},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"Paul Allen is a fascinating guy, and this is his only biography. So it is worth reading. This is a well written, though a bit repetitive, short book that won't take long to read. The book retells what he has done, but without a lot of perspective.Having finished the book, I have only partial answers to the two key questions:1. What kind of guy is he? This is an unauthorized biography, so the author never got to know Paul Allen. The book gives plenty of anecdotes that hint at what he is like. But I still don't have a sense of who he is.2. What has he accomplished? The book retells his life, but without perspective. It doesn't really attempt to answer the big question: If Paul Allen had simply kept his Microsoft shares, how would the technology revolution have been different? To what extent is he simply an observer, and to what extent is he a driving force?How accurate is the book? I knew Paul back in high school (haven't seen him since) and the description of those years is fine. I can't judge the accuracy of the rest of the book, but it bothers me that the author says Paul lived off his Microsoft dividends, when in fact Microsoft has never (until very recently) issued dividends. I wonder how many other details are wrong."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"I bought Accidental Zillionaire on impulse. I passed it on the end cap and thought it looked interesting. It was! Even though I live in the Seattle area and end up following Allen through the news he makes here, this was a terrific - and fair - look at the whole life of Paul Allen. The author did a great job getting the story straight and demystifying Allen. I suppose one of the things most famous people must tire of is inaccuracies about their lives. It seems as though the author did a good job of sticking with facts and not getting into too much rumor and innuendo that would have made this book a gossip work rather than a read that gives you insight into the life and times of Allen. I thought the book's take on the relationship between Allen and Gates was particularly interesting - especially how Allen has lived his post Microsoft life trying to get another success under his belt - one that would prove that MS wasn't just the vision and success of Gates, with Allen along for the ride. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great overview of Allen's life and work."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"A fast read. However, this book is more akin to a compendium of previously published magazine articles. Consequently, that makes this oeuvre a $27.95 term paper. After reading the book Paul Allen is not demystified in any way as the title purports. I would recommend that you do a net search on Mr. Allen. You will reach the same level of enlightenment while saving yourself a bundle. This book should not have been published as it is repetitive and uninformative."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"Laura Rich pierces the Allen veil to show the man and the business he has built. This book demystifies the highly private billionaire, Paul Allen, and gives you a first rate look at his life from his upbringing in Seattle as a fledging computer geek, to founding the world's largest software company.Rich touches on many unexplored angles about Allen's life from his quirky private nature, the roots of the passions that drive his investments; and the nature of his relationships to family, friends and colleagues.An overall great look at one of the richest men in America."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"I saw this book in the bookstore window and was curious. The onlything I knew about Paul Allen was that he and Bill Gates foundedMicrosoft. The book is a fascinating, insightful tale of a per-plexing multi-billionaire who struggles to grasp the brass ring,predict again the future of technology, and make it his own. Theauthor spotlights the reasons for Allen's myriad interests, aswell as, the conflicts between his self-perception as &quot;an ideaman&quot; and an inconsistent venture capitalist. I couldn't putthe book down. Its easy to read, carefully researched, highlyrecommended."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"It's hard not to envy Paul Allen. A son of Oklahomans who moved to Seattle, he went to a private school, met Bill Gates, helped start Microsoft and has had billions of dollars to play with almost ever since. OK, so when Microsoft first went public, he only had a hundred million or so to play with. He's been sued for sexual harassment, owns a big chunk of a hot movie studio and is still an ordinary slob. Allen and his family refused to cooperate with the author, so nothing is straight from the horse's mouth - at least not that horse. The author shows admirable self restraint for the first several chapters, but really pulls the lid off later in the book. Allen comes off looking like a junior level IT nerd who won the lottery, a weirdly fascinating, odd guy. The book is easy enough to read, though it relies mainly on secondary sources and press reports, and is repetitious, disjointed and inclined to skip important information, such as dates. But, if you want the gossipy side of the Microsoft story, We suggest this as your vacation reading."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"I bought this book because I have admired (in all ways) Paul Allen for a long time. I did not love the title, but wanted to find out more about him. My first thought was \\"Why does it have to be called The Accidental Zillionaire?\\" I knew that name came from an article in Wired magazine that I did not particularly care for. Accidental Zillionaire could be applied to anybody who made their fortune from the advent of PCs; Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Charles Simonyi, etc., all were in the right place at the right time, yet nobody makes them sound like their fortune was handed to them. Face it, Paul Allen's vision and genius brought Microsoft to life.My desire to learn more about Paul Allen was tempered by my feelings of regret for reading a book that he clearly wanted no part of. I wish he would have been involved, at least to make sure he wasn't being portrayed inaccurately. Ms. Rich claims she only wanted to tell his story, but I think she unfairly slammed him at every opportunity. Derisive comments about his appearance and clothing were not necessary--frumpy, unattractive, droopy middle, not looking like a billionaire; those phrases tell nothing about him, they only serve to insult. I can't help but wonder why those comments were necessary. I think he's a handsome man with the most amazing looking eyes, eyes I could just get lost in. Stupid Jerry Hall and Monica Seles; they were so lucky to have him in their lives. I doubt they appreciated him beyond his wallet.I don't know, maybe Laura Rich was offended because he would not cooperate with her and that affected the way she wanted to present him. I did enjoy the early parts of the book where she talked about his parents, their hard lives growing up in Oklahoma and their early years in Seattle, but after that it just seemed more like at attempt to drag him through the mud than to tell his story. I started out trying to get past the title and like the book, but I just couldn't."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"I think that Mr. Allen is one of the most mysterious men in the world. This somewhat explains. Wasn't great, wasn't horrible. I got thru it without a problem."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"I picked up this book at a garage sale recently. Although it is an unauthorized biography it gave me a good glimpse of Paul Allen's life. Fascinating just doesn't describe it. A worthy read into the journey of a man who has affected our existence."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"This seems to be an objective look at Paul Allen. In this book I found out that if it was not for Mr. Allan, Bill Gates would have moved Microsoft to somewhere south of the Golden Gate Bridge. Paul Allan gave Seattle a good deal on the whole. By the Space Needle he demonstrated the power of money. Great wealth can make some dreams come true. To balance this out Seattle got Microsoft, just on the other side of Lake Washington (not the Bay Area). Let's keep our fingers crossed that Paul Allen does prove he did not just stumble across the idea/vision that created Microsoft and comes up with another big idea. We could all benefit from it.I subtract one star, because all this information collected in one place in this book invades the privacy Mr. Allen seeks. More privacy could make the diffrence. After all he got his first big idea when the spot light was not on him yet.p"},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"This book would disappoint the technology maven, Microsoft fan, and gossip hunter alike. You could learn more about Allen by looking him up on Google. In fact, whole sections of the book appear to have been lifted from the few full-length magazine features that have centered on Allen. I could tell you more about Paul Allen than Ms. Rich can. I also happen to personally know someone who's mentioned in the book, somewhat maliciously- and she was never even contacted by Ms. Rich to either get or check facts. There are also inconsistencies throughout the book (probably because it was all lifted from different sources). It's just plain lazy journalism."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"I was excited about the topic, as there should be much to say about Paul Allen. Unfortunately, this book reads like little more than a compendium of other sources with the author's mildly informed barbs along the way. Ms. Rich seems to love to judge Mr. Allen's successes and failures, but you learn little about the man in the process. You're better off reading the Forbes or Fortune archives about the man. Furthermore, the book is poorly structured and redundant, giving you the same information multiple times. It reminded me of hastly done 7th grade book reports, where you repeated information just to make the minimum length of the report. Perhaps Ms. Rich was doing the same to reach the 200 page requirement for the book..."},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","review":"I was always interested in Paul Allen but didn't know much know much about him. This book is a great introduction and a great read, because it's sort of a fantasy -- what would you do if you accidentally made 20 billion bucks? It's like those lottery ads you see on the subway, \\"Hey, you never know.\\" Allen bought a basketball team, built a museum partly dedicated to Jimi Hendrix, a huge house, fixed up a Cinerama movie theater, invested in Hollywood. For a big oaf of a nonentity, Rich (great name! Wonder if it's real) manages to bring him alive (something he could use help with generally) and make him pretty interesting. And he's much less annoying than Bill Gates.

Though the author did write a great deal about his companies she neglected to include a major company in the Allen stable, Vulcan Producations, a movie production company. When Rich decided to probe into Allen's private life she did so again without regard to details. On page 145 she refers to Allen's age as 49 years old in 2002 then on page 149 as 52 years old in 2001.

So, when I say this book didn't do much - I mean it with all of my body, heart and soul! Time spent contemplating your belly button may be better spent. At least then you would be able to ascertain whether you needed to work those abs or cut those carbs.I had an inclination to believe that this book would be a bit of flop based on it's cover. Something about it - maybe the name of the book or the photo of Allen seemed to be saying to me - you already know what this book is all about - don't waste your time. But being one who thinks you can't always judge a book by it's cover or even a person by who their friends are - I read it anyway hoping that my gut would be wrong.After reading the book today while at a local bookstore waiting for a date, I was a bit saddened. I had thought the book would explain what made Paul Allen the man tick. Now today after reading this book I am more mystifyied not less.Allen has kept his veil of mystery about him like a lady of more glamourous times who stands in the dark corners of a party always looking out to the crowd w/knowing eyes with just a bare hint of a smile ever so slightly lifting the corners of her mouth all while saying little as she darts in and out of the shadows. Swiftly and surely - just giving one a tiny glimpse of her true colors or the illusion of such as she dances the night- as if drinking of the moments around and enjoying the flirt of the moment. And maybe that is just how it should be with mysterious ladies and with Paul Allen.The author of The Accidental Zillionare tries to rip Allen's underclothes off with the grace of low class porn film maker. In doing so she doesn't make him look bad - she only makes herself look so.But who am I - but an owl loving tree-hugging Washingtonian who drinks way too much Starbucks and still can't get her darn compter to work right."},{"Title":"My Life on the Rock : A Rebel Returns to His Faith","review":"The word &quot;revert&quot; has become a common name used by Catholics who return to their Catholic roots after having left them years before. Jeff Cavins is no different. He often uses this term to describe himself on his show LIFE ON THE ROCK. In his most recent enterpise, he tells the story of his return to the Catholic faith in book form in a very open and frank way. He takes his readers on a journey of discovery which begins with sincere questions about his faith. From there we join him as he becomes a Protestant pastor with several churches within several years. Along each step of the way, he begins to rediscover his childhood faith. As times goes by, Jeff disovers how the pieces of the puzzle of his life fit into his journey. He also discovers along the way that he is not alone in his journey.I have to say that MY LIFE ON THE ROCK is a book well worth reading by everyone. Catholics will appreciate it as a vehicle toward rediscovering the beauty of their faith. Protestants will appreciate it as a way to better understand their Catholic brothers and sisters. However, I feel that people who will best benefit from reading this book are those who are on a similar to Jeff's. These potential Catholic &quot;reverts&quot; will enjoy this particular book for it's dynamic way of letting them know that they are not alone. After all, we are all seeking the way to best live our own LIFE ON THE ROCK, no matter what our life happens to be. We all need to know we are not alone on our particular journey, no matter where that journey happens to lead us along the way."},{"Title":"My Life on the Rock : A Rebel Returns to His Faith","review":"Jeff's story is a case in point of why some serious Christians leave the Catholic Church, but also a case in point of why a lot of thinking ones later return. Jeff tells the story of his life in a very winsome fashion. He tells about the factors that led to him becoming an evangelical and then the frustrations (as well as the joys) that he found in the Protestant world. Scripture study and seeing the overall scope of scripture as well as reading Church history finally helped him turn his eyes homeward again (albeit reluctantly). The confirmation of this decision in an airport was very dramatic.This is a great book for evangelicals who are wondering why someone they care about has suddenly become Catholic, it's an even better book for friends who have left the Church for Protestantism, if they left because of involvement with the charismatic movement. It's not so good a book for those who left the Catholic Church because they didn't like it's moral teachings (but then I'm not sure what book to recommend to them). This is also a great book for those Protestants who have been reading the books of Robert Webber. Jeff read those too, as did I before I gave any thought to becoming Catholic. Webber is one step in the journey, Jeff points out what the next step is. Anyway, buy it, read it, give it to your friends."},{"Title":"My Life on the Rock : A Rebel Returns to His Faith","review":"I have some very dear friends, both of whom were raised Catholic, whom have fallen away from the faith. They have embraced the kind of Evangelical Protestantism Jeff Cavins describes in this book. Their journey is as much the journey Jeff explains in his compelling story.Cavins describes his early years of faith, how he fell in love with his wife, a Bible Christian, and his journey from Catholicism to Christian Bible College, to Evangelical preaching at an Open Door type of church, and then back to the Catholic faith.Along the way, it's a roller coaster ride as we witness Cavins' own struggles with his faith, and then an eventual realization of Christ's truth.I found his descriptions of always seeking to create a novel, livelier, music-filled Evangelical worship service lest he lose parishioners to another church as particularly interesting. Cavins' story is moving, personal, and at times humorous.I highly recommend this book to anyone that has a family member who has left the Catholic Church to embrace the rock-and-roll service held in a high school gymnasium."},{"Title":"My Life on the Rock : A Rebel Returns to His Faith","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it.

Says the sister: \\"Patsy, you don't become a nun because you've lost something, but because you've found something!\\" Jeff Cavins is another in a long line of recent converts to the Catholic Church. Like David Currie, Kristine Franklin, Marcus Grodi, Scott Hahn, Thomas Howard, Stephen Ray, and many others, Mr. Cavins has found, not some THING, but some ONE. Leaving the Church as a young man, Mr. Cavins became an independent Protestant pastor, falling in love with Sacred Scripture. Along the way, however, he found that he was inventing a church (82), feeding a \\"popularity machine\\" (86), inadequately liturgical (93, 99), ignorant of Christian roots (116), and struggling to deal with the powerful (91, 118). In the most cogent part of this sometimes moving memoir, Mr. Cavins explains how he discovered four corners of the theological puzzle: Scripture, Tradition, Sacramentality, and Authority (135-136). He simply had to return to the Catholic faith, for he had found there the full expression of some ONE, Christ the King. His accounts of the Church as a sacrament (109), the Real Presence in the Eucharist (122), the priesthood (125, 167), the \\"brothers\\" of the Lord (139), the papacy (144-145), and of Sacred Tradition (126-127) are concise and crisply reasoned. In fact, this book could be used in RCIA classes for converts--and should be. Mr. Cavins's accounts of his reconcilation with his father and his conversion process with his wife Emily are genuinely touching. In reading this memoir, one comes to respect Mr. Cavins's search for truth; but readers may also find here a moral certainty which, unless guarded against, may well spill over even into arrogance. The exuberance of converts is wonderful, but it must not be allowed to grow into spiritual conceit. Still, the book needed a closer editing: Mr. Cavins has trouble with HOWEVER (13, 107), splits infinitives (14, 103), misuses \\"you and me\\" (105), misplaces a modifier (115), confuses \\"impractical\\" with \\"impracticable\\" (158), and fails to understand that \\"someone\\" takes \\"he\\" or \\"she,\\" not \\"they\\" (212). These are quibbles at best, though, for the book is thoughtful, earnest, and impassioned. Mr. Cavins writes that, as he was about to enter the Church, he met one priest who denies the post-1958 Papacy and another who is intent upon the inclusive language of a Father-Mother God. The first priest is a sedevacantist, and the second is, well, silly. John Paul II is a true hero of the faith; referring to God as \\"Father,\\" or using \\"His\\" when we speak, say, of God's (His) mercy is hardly \\"sexist.\\" (See, e.g., Mt 24:36, Mk 14:36, Lk 24:49, Jn 14:6.) It is sad that fringe Catholics (193), and ignorant and apathetic Catholics (cf. Rev 3:16), or failed Catholics discourage converts. But the Catholic Church is, thanks be to God, a hospital for sinners and not a hotel for the saved."},{"Title":"My Life on the Rock : A Rebel Returns to His Faith","review":"Jeff's story is a concrete example for those people who , though they are not sure of what the future will be, yet always trusts the Lord and seek his ways.

I was not disappointed.I have quoted and used this book at length in trying to educate the teachers and other staff involved in my son's education. I showed or told them what she wrote and quoted her, which lent some authority to my assertions.She helped explain why my son is the way he is, in so many of his complexities. At last I understood why he reacts to things in such puzzling ways!There might be other books on gifted kids out there, but I'm not sure they could beat her patient, highly educated, helpful tone.Take notes as you go, there'll be a lot of things you'll want to find later to share with others interested in the same issues. Such as, one of the most important keys in finding an effective teacher for any student is the teacher's own self-image. Or, there IS a model of education that is shown to be effective for all levels of intelligence at once--the hands-on or whole topic curriculum (also called project-based). Or that the level of intelligence we now call gifted IS possible for all people to reach, if only they were raised in the \\"right\\" way--and that it is largely learned, not inherited. Or that teachers are a fairly poor identifier of the gifted kids; other kids are better at it!These are my recollections only--but just as a sample of the kinds of things she says.There's so much there you'll probably need to skip the parts that don't apply, or read more than once."},{"Title":"Growing Up Gifted: Developing the Potential of Children at Home and at School","review":"Last year I stumbled across an older edition of this book completely by accident while researching a paper on inclusion/mainstreaming of severely LD/BD/ED kids. My parents have hidden (or tried to hide) my giftedness from me since they found out when I was three. This book sent my head spinning, but I'm glad I found it. I devoured it in about a day, and it left me hungry for more. Growing Up Gifted is a great book for parents, teachers, counselors, and the gifted alike. I learned a lot about myself.

You need to read it carefully and critically.There are an overwhelming number of books on this subject that you probably won't read them all, and frankly the vast majority of them are just not worth reading.

The Native women found her another practiucal woman who was interested in recipes, sewing techniques and patterns, and how the day-to-day lives of families were lived.&quot;The majority of the informants were women, and they became interested in describing the former methods of preparing vegetable foods&quot; as well as uses for dyes, fibers, and medicines. Densmore got qwuite specific info (unlike most ethnobotanists) about such things as &quot;scraping the bark away from the root,&quot; how long it was to be driend, how uch water to steep it in (informants brought her their pails, to measure).On the more technical side, Densmore got something most of the ethnobots don't bother with: the native names. She took info gathering about as far as you can go without computers, ith cross-referenced tables. (I am computerizing this for native students now). For each plant, she got a specimen and had it IDed by a botanist. Many plants were also analyzed, but the techniques of that period do not provide vbery good phytochmeical info.For those not interested in these aspects, still this book gives a very thorough and interesting picture of Anishnab eg (lakelands wooland peoples) way of life, recording many tnings that still happen here today.Fancxes Densmore, a musicologist rather than an anthro, had a strong feeling for the people and the places. She writes &quot;In June the air is sweet with wild roses and in midsummer the fields are beautiful with red lillies, bluebells, and a marvelous variety of color. In autumn, the sumac flings its scarlet across the landscape, and in winter, there are miles of untrodden snow. The northern woodland is a beautiful country, and knowing it in all its changin seasons, one can not wonder at the poetry that is so inherent a part of Chippewa thought.&quot;This well expresses the spirit in which she approached her researches among Indian people, and it is quite a different attidue than male anthros (and scientific ethnobotanists) have. Yet this book is an outstanding example for its time, and up to the easy avilabity of computers to ordinary people, of scientific, as well as literary, work. A bargain at Dover's pric, even though there are mail order sources offering it $1 cheaper. Very highly recommended to anyone interested in real (rather than fantasy) Native traditional life.I don't hve time to write reviews of her other books (I have msot of them), but recommend them all very highly, not only the &quot;Chippewa&quot; (Ojibwe, Anishinaabeg) ones. She brought the same spirit to all of them, and learned and preserved many details of the beauty of native life at those times, things no one else in the white world was interested in then, and perhaps they still aren't."},{"Title":"How Indians Use Wild Plants for Food, Medicine and Crafts","review":"I learned alot from reading this book. It's fairly short, and has lots of interesting tidbits. Though I feel it should be renamed--it doesn't deal with most indian cultures, but rather the Chippewa Indians, as they are who Frances Densmore made an extensive study of. The title is a bit misleading. One thing I felt that would have improved the book would have been a bit more of a clear listing of the information in the book, but then again, it is rather dated material."},{"Title":"How Indians Use Wild Plants for Food, Medicine and Crafts","review":"I haven't read this book, but after reading the previous review from the other reviewer, it seems clear she highly recommends this book and thus made a mistake with her 1-star rating.

I hope that doesn't prevent non-romance readers from trying it. This is a THRILLER. It reminds me of some of my favorite Stephen King novels.The story really centers on two protagonists...Nettie, a former prostitute with a very sad background who has been turned into a beast, and Sally, our innocent young heroine, who rescues a wolf from a dumpster. The wolf later saves her life and in turn becomes even more of a companion to her.The complexities of every character, even minor ones, in this story are written brilliantly. The reader knows exactly how they fit together and why they behave and respond the way they do. There is enough gorey detail for any fan of the horror genre, yet not so much as to prevent others from enjoying it.Don't let the price keep you from trying this VERY well done piece of fiction. I can't believe Mr. Deyo hasn't written anything else yet. Perhaps when his contract runs out with this publisher, he will be able to market the book to a larger audience."},{"Title":"Moon Dancer","review":"As director of the Abacus Group Editorial Service, I can honestly say that Moon Dancer by Robert Deyo is the best book of its kind that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Moon Dancer","review":"I started reading this book after I put my children to bed and didn't get to bed until about 2 a.m. because I just couldn't put it down.

This unique work is full of inspiring design motifs and patterns from all over the world. Broad in scope, it presents ideas from works of art from pre-history through the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Mexico and Byzantium. It also demonstrates how one can draw on on and interpret the traditional art of diverse cultures in Africa, Australia, Japan, China and elsewhere.Although this book is geared to embroidery projects, it is extremely useful for other media, such as mosaic, quilting and fabric construction. Every time I browse through this book I get another idea for a new work of art or craft. Highly recommended. My only regret is getting to the last page. I wish it were longer."},{"Title":"Knitting for Two: 20 Simple Designs for Expectant and New Mommies and Babies","review":"After seeing the lacy bonnet online, I got this book from the library, but now I'm here to buy it. This book is full of beautiful projects for both mother and child. Honestly, there are twenty patterns in here, and I'd love to make ten of them; how often does a book come along like that?Some projects I plan on making are the lacy bonnet (actually, I've finished this one: very fast, very easy, and very impressive-looking), a simple summer tweed cardigan for babies, a beautiful kidsilk haze cardigan with embroidery for moms, a lacy ribbon-tie cardigan (also for moms), and a spectacular wrap sweater with embroidery for little girls.The patterns are for babies up to the age of about one year old, and some of them come in very small sizes (for premies). Although a couple of the mom patterns are obviously meant for pregnant women, most of them will fit non-pregnant women too (such as a soft long jacket, a zip-up hoodie that is meant to open over the tummy, and that kidsilk haze cardigan that stays open). After all, how many sweaters am we going to knit that can only be worn for a few months?What bugs me about the book? No schematics, so it is tricky to know the proper sizing. This is mainly why I gave the book four stars instead of five. She does provide measurements for chest, actual width, length, and sleeve length (for the mom sweaters, babies just get chest, length, and sleeve). Also, the pattern for the lacey bonnet calls for 2 balls of Rowan Wool cotton, but it took me less than one ball of that same yarn. Makes me wonder how far off the other estimates are.One other thing I do like, although this is minor, is that, even though this is a Rowan/Jaeger book, Knight only suggests those yarns. She will say, for example, \\"any medium-weight or dk yarn, such as Rowan Wool Cotton...\\" and often suggests a sweater would also look great in a wool, or easy-care cotton, or fancier silk. It just bugs me when books say they don't recommend yarn substitutions!I hope that helps!"},{"Title":"Knitting for Two: 20 Simple Designs for Expectant and New Mommies and Babies","review":"I think it should be a law in the world of knitting books that patterns have schematics or at least a non-artistic photo of the item. There are some beautiful and seemingly simple patterns in this book, but no schematics. Especially for something like the papoose pattern that appears to be simple, you don't even see a photo of the full finished product to get an idea of how it finishes. I'm a semi-experienced knitter, but I need a little visual help and that's what keeps me from giving this book a better rating."},{"Title":"Knitting for Two: 20 Simple Designs for Expectant and New Mommies and Babies","review":"I can't find a maternity sweater in this book that has bigger than a 38 inch chest. According to the standard size chart, that is a MEDIUM! If you wear larger than medium, you will have to alter the pattern significantly to fit. That is truly ridiculous-- the sizing should go up at least to XL, and preferably larger. The book ought to be called \\"Knitting for Two (As Long You Don't Weigh Over 98 Pounds)\\". If I am going to alter the pattern so much to fit me-- why bother? I might as well just design my own. And less experienced knitters who don't know how to size up will just be out of luck."},{"Title":"Knitting for Two: 20 Simple Designs for Expectant and New Mommies and Babies","review":"What is wrong with knitting designers today that they think that normal or even large size women don't want to knit and wear beautiful things when they're pregnant?The largest size in this beautifully photographed book is a 38\\" chest. I am so frustrated that even though the patterns are gorgeous I don't even WANT to fiddle around with trying to size them up -- I shouldn't have to!Not a single woman or baby of color? Boo!The patterns are absolutely stunning, I must say. I likely will take the time to size up the ones I like for me and the baby patterns are sweet and useful, things I would actually make for this little one I'm cooking now (due in October 07!). However, I did find it frustrating to not see whole photos of some of the items, especially blankets. That papoose is the sweetest thing ever, I'm sure... I could tell you for sure if I knew what the whole thing looks like!I wish knitting designers would look outside and see that women come in a variety of shapes, and make their books relative to real women.

The only thing to note is to not order both this title and baby bloom as they are the same book under a different title and cover-otherwise inside they are exactly the same book.This book has some very quick and easy little baby items which can be completed in just a few hours through to more complex designs. I have made 3 of the designs in lesss than a week. The sweater from pages 20-21 took less than an evenings tv to make and looks great. The chunky zip up jacket from pages 32-33 which was very fast and easy and will layer up over the sweater for extremely cold weather. The lacy bonnet from pages 92-93, because i just couldn't resist it( hopefully 1 of the mums from playgroup will have little girl) and I have started the chunky tweed cardigan from pages 61-63 although I am making it in wool instead of cotton. This is all in less than 1 week so they are certainly quick and easy projects although there are others which would take longer.

I had to alter the pattern because even though I made the biggest size, it was too small.. Like it didn't fit my 105 lb husband.. It is very easy to knit and looks nice but the size was tiny! Even the sleeves were 4 in too short and I'm only 5'9\\" so I can imagine the problems anyone taller than me had.

I had dreams of making beautiful little sweaters, and all of that.well, i got the book, and the book is very beautiful. some very lovely patterns. so far i have made two and a half (i'm in the middle of a project) projects out of the text and I am only mildly satisfied with the results.The first project I made was the pappoose. It's ok. but it turns out really to be nothing more than a bag to put the baby in. boxy, uncute, and boring as all heck to knit. i would never make it again or recommend it.in the interim i made one of the baby sweaters, because it took FOREVER to make the papoose. The sweater turned out alright. it knitted up faster than the papoose, but again, the directions were only ok in clarity, and the results only ok.i would recommend borrowing this book from the library or from a friend before buying it. I only use it because it's the only baby knitting book i have (though I hope to remedy that situation).and the idea that you could have made all of these beautiful little things by the time your bundle of joy appears is ridiculous. by the time you finish the gorgeous purple long sweater, i imagine that the wee one is probably already a month or two old, even if you started out knitting the project knitting pretty early in the pregnancy.

Amelia traveled all over the country interviewing physically challenged individuals and their care givers. In doing so, she composed an enlightening yet very touching collection of stories, all through the eye of her camera. Her choice of black and white photos added another dimension and increased the already dramatic content. I was very skeptical that photos could capture the anguish I sometimes feel or capture the love and concern my care givers provide but I am now a believer! Her artistic eye caught the underlying emotions and all while we quietly talked and laughed among ourselves.Many of Amelia's photographs portray some of the more difficult aspects of the disease, how many young people have learned to live with what is often a chronic illness. Her photographs also show how indiscriminate MS really is and how, like myself, you too could walk up one morning numb and tingling from head to toe. For me, the most healing aspect of the book was how others handled their emotional difficulties. Early on, I felt as if I was being punished for mishandling something in my past. I felt lonely and isolated due to my new differences. However, like many of the other biographies, I too have learned that 'attitude is everything' and that you alone are capable of taking the 'limits' out of limitations.The book's addition of the often forgotten care giver was an extremely refreshing aspect of her book. I always thank my husband for having made the decision to stay but so little credit is given to these unselfish individuals. It is easy to take others for granted until your welfare is suddenly out of your control.I gave Amelia a five star rating not because I was included in her book but because her photographs speak for themselves! Even if you are not faced with a chronic illness, the biographies will touch you with their uncensored frankness. Amelia walked in and out of my life but her pictures captured a fleeting glance, pose or emotion that explains to others the essence of that particular moment in time...Great work, Amelia!!!"},{"Title":"My Story","review":"Ameila Davis is a documentary photographer, diagnosed with MS in 1998.Though titled \\"My Story\\", this book is really \\"their stories\\". In this book, she uses her trained eye to illustrate 32 essays personally portraying the lives of men and women with Multiple Sclerosis.They range from 17 to 70, across a spectrum of ethnicities, genders, occupations, socio-economic backgrounds and family circumstances.Through her book, Amelia captures the unique approach each person has used to frame their chronic disease with, not only a positive attitude, but with a positive approach to life.She also includes the caregivers ... those frequently forgotten in the struggle with MS and all chronic disease.Her essays help others to see, through the stories of real people, the different possible treatments and therapies and the techniques for coping (such as exercise, yoga, creative activities and competitive sports).Her photographs capture the people behind these essays, putting a real face, a personal face, on what is often discussed in impersonal, clinical terms. You don't just read their story; you are drawn into a human connection with them.This is a book to buy and read. And it is also a book to buy and display, a coffee table book.Discussing MS with friends and family can be difficult. Chronic disease can create a \\"distance\\", a separation. This book can help to bridge that gap.As someone picks up this book to browse and becomes captured by the photographs, it can crack the door to an open conversation about MS, about what it means and about how lives continue after diagnosis."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"I happen to have MS and one of the problems of having a little understood illness is the distance it creates in one's personal relationships. Even with friends and family.I now have a copy of \\"My Story\\" on my coffee table and I'm truly amazed by the number of people who, because of the presence of the book, are finally able to speak and ask questions about MS . They glance through the book and suddenly a dialog window opens.The photos are superb, respectful and celebratory at the same time and every person's essay is different. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"Photographer-philanthropist Amelia Davis's thirty-two photo-interviewees suffer from the lifelong Mxyzptlkish disabilities caused by the nervous system degenerative disease, multiple sclerosis. If one line could capture the attitude of these sometimes frightened but always courageously hope-driven people, 46-year-old Phil and his caregiver girl friend, Kristen's, framed reminder would fill the net: \\"We can not direct the wind, but we can adjust our sails\\". In Davis's book of essays and photos, you visit with these neighbors of yours (you have about 350,000 of them), read their poignant stories and those of their families and caregivers--too brief vignettes inviting you into their adventurous and meaning-filled lives--see the beauty and passion in their faces through Davis's celestial eye, and discover how they create unique and marvelous quilts from the scraps life has given them. Despite sometimes heart-wrenching disabilities, these people find every day a good day, though some days better than others. Amelia Davis's book brims with life-lessons for everyone of us--the promise that we can turn our stumbling blocks, however they manifest, into stepping-stones. Read it for heart-care."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"I want to congratulate Amelia Davis on creating a book that is different from all of the other MS books. Her book reaches into the lives of people living with MS and shares some of the feelings that caregivers and friends experience as well.This is a wonderfully unique look at the amazing people who are challeged by this disease and how they live extraordinary lives in spite of it. Amelia's photography is a window into this world, her work is \\"present\\" and revealing of who people are."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"Davis reaches the inner soul of the reader--regardless of whether or not you have MS. Her photographs capture the essence of the folks who share their stories. I was touched and inspired by this book!"},{"Title":"My Story","review":"The format for this book is what makes it different for me from so many others. You get their important story, but you also get a more human view of them through the pictures which really do a great job of making thier story all the more real. I also think this view of how these people are living thier lives might help people get by some of the fear they might have which comes from not understanding this desise. Just like so many other ailments, you can learn to live your life with it, and the way these people do that is inspiring.... I recommend this for the portriats alone, but surely for the good it will also do it spreading awareness of this desise and the great people who deal with it daily."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"The wonderful photographs in this book explain many layers of the MSonion. MS is an equal opportunity disease, affecting people of all races,sexes and ages. The people who live with MS are challenged daily toaccomplish tasks that most people can take for granted.

The photographs and stories are well balanced and leavethe reader inspired."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"This is a beautiful book with very moving photographs supplemented by a text right out of the hearts and minds of those afflicted and their loved ones.

Ms. Davis is a gifted photographer and has done an exquisite job."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"The old adage that &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot; holds true for Amelia Davis's visual book &quot;My Story.&quot; Ms. Davis has a rare talent for helping us see into the heart of each of her subjects.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has MS, especially newly diagnosed individuals as this is a book of hope and courage.Thank you Ms. Davis for sharing your gift with us!"},{"Title":"My Story","review":"Ms. Davis' photos are amazing.

My Story: A Photographic Essay on Life with Multiple Sclerosis uses photographs along with short essays giving us a glimpse into the lives of 32 people living with MS. Contributors share the story of their life and how Multiple Sclerosis has changed them as well as the things they discovered that stay the same no matter what life throws at you. Photographs by Amelia Davis accompany each essay showing us the faces behind MS.For every essay written by a person with Multiple Sclerosis in this book there is a companion essay written by their caregiver. Behind every person with a chronic illness be it MS or something else there is always someone and often a lot of someones caring for those people. If not physically then mentally and emotionally. not for a second can the plight of the individuals with the illness be downplayed, but those surrounding and supporting those people must not be forgotten, My Story does a wonderful job of including these people while at the same time not taking away from the individuals they are caring for."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"I really did like this book. It is wonderfully done and I like how each chapter focuses on a different person & their loved ones. The pictures are fantastic and I really like the format of this book. I recommend it to young & old people alike."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"My Story: A Photographic Essay On Life With Multiple Sclerosis is comprised of a series of engaging essays and illustrative photographs by San Francisco-based photographer Amelia Davis on what it is like to live the medical condition of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease affecting about 350,000 Americans and whose origins are still speculative. What is portrayed are the lives of 32 men and women from seventeen to seventy, and of diverse ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds. Accompanying each informed and informative essay are commentaries provided by family members and friends that express their personal feelings and experiences of living with loved one having to deal with MS. Inspiring and at times quite moving, My Story is strongly recommended to the attention of anyone diagnosed with MS, and those who love them."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"I just read Amelia Davis' book &quot;My Story,&quot; and I thought it was wonderful. I was especially touched by the stories of the caregivers, and their children. As a caregiver for over 20 years for my husband who has MS, I could relate to the feelings of both the people with MS and their caregivers. Ms. Davis' book made me realize that feelings of apprehension, indecision, and fatigue are all part of caregiving. The courage and positive attitude of the person with MS give the reader and their caregivers the will to continue to support one and another in spite of the obtacles MS deals them. These are people who do things to improve the lives of others. People who motivate others by example. There were parts of the book that made me so happy, and other parts that literally brought me to tears. MS sure can cause havoc in the lives of so many, and it is amazing how resilient the people with MS really are in facing this disease. Through her black and white photography, Ms. Davis has written a beautiful book. A book that will leave all that read it with a different outlook about those living with MS, and want us all to support all efforts to conquer this disease, and forge on to find a cure. Thank you Ms. Davis for a Five star book on MS."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"I am actually 'in' Amelia's book and I know how hard she worked to make the public more aware of how devastasting Multiple Sclerosis really is for not only the person with the disease but for all the family members, friends and caregivers it touches. Amelia traveled all over the country and photographed people with MS and although she requested that the participants write their own biographies, her camera alone tells the whole story. Her choice of black &amp; white photos adds another dimension and increases the already dramatic content. I was very skeptical that photographs could capture the anguish I sometimes feel or the love and concern my caregivers provide but I was pleasantly surprised that she made me a believer! Her artistic eye caught the underlying emotion that was present and all while we quietly talked and laughed among ourselves.Many of Amelia's photographs of other people in the book portrays one of the most difficult aspects of the disease, how many young people must learn to live with a disability. Also, her photos indicate how indiscriminate MS really is and how without any notice, you could wake up one morning only to find you are numb from head to toe (a reality for me)! The most healing aspect of the book for me is seeing how others have dealt with similar circumstances and symptoms. It is very easy to feel as if you are being punished and are alone with a major illness. Reading her book, however, confirmed what I learned in my journey with MS, that although I miss my legs, not having them made me a better person. I appreciate what I HAVE a lot more...I gave Amelia five stars, not because I am in her book but because of what her photographs say. Amelia walked in and out of my life but her pictures captured, for me and many others, how people struggle but succeed in taking the 'limits' out of limitations."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"The wonderful photographs in this book explain many layers of the MS onion.

The photographs and stories are well balanced and leave the reader inspired."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"Amelia's book is a wonderful look at what it means to live with MS as a patient, partner, friend, or caretaker. It is insightful in that the reader has a chance to see beyond the person with MS and experience what their lives mean to others. The photographs are honest and revealing. This book is very different from other MS books, because it truly explores the broader spectrum of people effected by this illness through the use of photography and personal statements that speak volumes. I love this book."},{"Title":"My Story","review":"THis book is uplifting and inspiring. My mother and I have been reading it together and it is a good book for any age of any background.

Highly Recommended!!!"},{"Title":"The Mushroom Hunter's Field Guide","review":"This is a nice book to augment a collection, but is not complete. The set of guides written by Smith and his daughter (Weber) do not overlap. This means that you need this book and the edition for the south in order to look up mushrooms in the south. There are no mentions of spore print colors in the individual entries, which makes for a lot of thumbing back and forth between the specific entries and the genus descriptions"},{"Title":"The Mushroom Hunter's Field Guide","review":"I was glad I added this one to my collection and library. As others have pointed out, it certainly is not an all inclusive work by any means, but I did find the photography well done and the book to be helpful IF I use it in conjunction with other works. I cannot stress the \\"IF\\" enough. I photograph wild flowers as a hobby but cannot pass up a good shot of any mushrooms I come across in my wonderings. This is a good field guide to carry in the car and it usually gives me enough information to get a good start on identification after the photography work is done and I have time to properly research the photographed subject. I suspect the very, very serious collector or professional would need much more than is offered here, but for my purposes, it works just fine."},{"Title":"The Mushroom Hunter's Field Guide","review":"This book contains excellent color photos to mach the color tones and size characteristics of the mushrooms in the Midwest.

I was already a fan of meditation as a tool for improving brain symmetry and cognitive function, but this program took my practice to a new level. I have been using it with success for years. I recently gave away my first book and cd, and so had to replace it. I missed it terribly :-)The book covers a convoluted potpourri of subjects in a concise way that most anyone will understand. The cd is profoundly relaxing (as is common with audio programs that use this type of technology) and also provides extra benefits that simple meditation cds seem to miss. I highly recommend this product to all people who want to make the most of their minds - and their lives.Carisa[...]"},{"Title":"Super Brain Power: 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain","review":"I used to listen to this disk as a teenager and the first track IS extremely relaxing. I loved it back then. The \\"music\\" if I remember correctly has no melody but a vague atmospheric noise and something akin to wind chimes. Nonetheless it is very calming. I used it in daily meditations and I never grew tired of it. The second track is Mozart and nothing special. It fact I remember feeling annoyed when I feel asleep on the first track and let go of all of that tension, only to be bombarded into wakefulness by that \\"perky\\" Mozart.So I'd give the disk a 5 based solely on the relaxation factor of the first meditation. That being said, you should not believe any of the claims in the book. It's bunk. I tossed the book in the garbage years ago because the author of the text made false statements about how the meditation will somehow give you immense brainpower or cure all of your troubles. Of course there were anecdotes alleging \\"amazing\\" spiritual development or healing or whatever.The truth is that it will do no such thing. The disk is simply relaxing if you are into that sort of other worldly ambiance. Keep in mind if you look up the author's other books you'll see overreaching claims including a meditation program to think like a millionaire (no joke!)So ditch the scam by throwing away the book and keeping the disk. I've yet to find another meditation that works as well as this one. Hence the 3-star rating."},{"Title":"Super Brain Power: 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain","review":"It was said on the CD to do 4-5 sessions per week. I will be doing 5 per day.

Excellent use of motivational psychology and philosophy. The Super Intelligence track on the CD is useful as well for a relaxing sound bath, but make sure you set your CD player to repeat this track or you will be blasted from your bliss by the horrific Mozart Brain Boost track that follows, as it seems about a million times the volume and like a ton of dynamite going off under your pillow. All in all this book and CD is well worth the time and money as a stepping stone to greater things on your journey to higher consciousness."},{"Title":"Super Brain Power: 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain","review":"Around the middle of October, I purchased this book and began using the enclosed cd. As I have been meditating for several years, I found the concept appealing. I haven't been disappointed.The book is informative and explanatory. This is new ground and needs to be read and considered with an open mind. The same holds true with the enclosed cd. I have been using the super brain power cd and other cds developed by Mr. Spotts and my experience has been profound. Remember, the time frame has been approximately 2 1/2 months. During this short period of time I have experienced complete universal connectedness. Something years of meditation have not accomplished.The meditational part of the cd is excellent; the Mozart track is wonderful for background reading..particularly if you're studying or involved in something mentally challenging.To judge this work by one or two adverse reviews would be a disservice...certainly to Mr. Spotts but, also to all of the other people who would so benefit from this technology.Meditation is different for each and every person who practices it. Why should it be any different for a meditational cd?"},{"Title":"Super Brain Power: 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain","review":"If you buy one only self improvement book in your entire life, buy Super Brain Power! Using hard science, user testimonials, and his own personal experiences, Dane Spotts combines a compelling vision of human potential with a practical user's guide for achieving profound personal growth and higher states of consciousness. Included with the book is an audio CD containing two soundtracks plus an instruction session (performed by the author) describing how to use the CD.By itself, I found the book contains a tremendous amount of useful information and the \\"Mind Development Tools and Workshops\\" were easy to understand and simple to apply. The bibliography is extensive and the personal testimonials and CIA Purchase Order were amazing to say the least. The book is well organized and Mr. Spotts is obviously passionate about his subject. (The chapter on \\"The Way of The Mind Warrior\\" was truly inspiring.)The addition of the CD, however, dramatically enhances everything in the book. After I listen to the soundtracks, the words have more meaning. I am able to comprehend and process concepts more easily. My mind is clear while at the same time I feel a tremendous sense of peace and relaxed enjoyment. It is an amazing experience that I continue to recommend to everyone I know.What's next Mr. Spotts?"},{"Title":"Super Brain Power: 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain","review":"The soundtrack on this cd may affect your mental health. I've listen to it for 30 days as the author suggested and I experienced loss of memory, concentration and increased mental fog. And more: the book itself is a waste of time. The author claim to have created the light and sound machine during a vision he had years ago, when these devices were created back in 1950 by well know scientists. The author is very strange and I believe he has hidden intentions to achieve behind these soundtracks."},{"Title":"Super Brain Power: 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain","review":"Super Brain Power : 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain is an excellent invitation to the emerging world of binaural beat technology. Sound has been used for thousands of years as a medium for altering and focussing conscisouness. The last ten years has seen an explosion in the use of brain entrainment through the use of binaural beats.Spotts gives a concise and useful background to sound as a medium for consciousness focus. He focusses on the possibilites of harnessing our minds and expanding our capacities as human beings through the use of sound technology.His enthusiam is infectious; I would like to be a part of the world he envisions full of human beings with richer more joyful lives. His genuine interest in making the world a better place seems to be backed up by the attractive packaging of two CDs using his binaural beat technology along with the book--all for the price of the two CDs!I appreciated the suggestions for correctly using the sound products from Spotts' company. I've also read and enjoyed all of Robert Monroe's books from TMI (a pioneer in the binaural beat field.) Those books got me really excited about becoming truely conscious and truely joyful. I didn't gain any practical suggestions on using sound technology from them, however, like I did from this book.Do beware of setting yourself up for a fall by expecting your entire world to turn rosey just by listening to the CDs. These aren't drugs and they aren't unlimited bank accounts! They are something much more interesting and useful--a key to helping you become more awake, more alive. Do open yourself to the possibility of discovering more of the remarkable being you are. Buy the book, use the CDs."},{"Title":"Super Brain Power: 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain","review":"If you're considering buying this book, don't. Doing a quick web search of the author's name, I found the e-text of a complaint which the Federal Trade Commission brought against Dane Spotts for false advertising. Many of his other products, such as quick fat-burning pills and and quick mind enhancers, were in the complaint. Particularly of note is the complaint that his company has not, in the past, honored its 30 day money back guarantee. This book is a sham. I'm sorry but meditation is not something that can be perfected in some short arbitrary length of time such as 28 days. It can take years and years of practice and is a life-long pursuit and can be immensely rewarding. However, books such as Spotts' are little more than present day snake oil: dangerously false get-rich-quick schemes trying to capitalize on current fads and the general public's ignorance with no concern for product effectiveness or the buyer's safety and well-being. Dane Spotts needs to put out of business, as he obviously is a career charlatan. He has made his money playing upon people's insecurities and weaknesses. Don't let him do the same to you."},{"Title":"Super Brain Power: 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain","review":"This is a groundbreaking book. Not only is Dane Spotts a visionary and prophet but the included CD will help you achieve the ultimate meditative experience in as little as 28 minutes! Dane's philosophical insight is amazing and greatly adds to the experience you will get from the CD. I very highly recommend this book to everyone who desires a glimpse into their own psyche and find themselves asking the question, &quot;why am I here?&quot; The answer of course lies within you and this book will help you discover some very profound parts of yourself and the world you live in. If you have any doubts then this most definitely is the book for you because the experience will melt them away. Excellent read."},{"Title":"Super Brain Power: 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain","review":"This book was my first introduction to neuro-entrainment technology, and I was so pleased and impressed with the results that I've added many other of Dane Spotts' CDs to my collection and listen to them every single day.

It saved my life."},{"Title":"Super Brain Power: 28 Minutes to a Supercharged Brain","review":"When I bought Dane's Zygon machine long ago, I thought it couldn't get any better. It just did! Now, we don't need cumbersome light/sound machines, Superintelligence CDs go beyond what those devices were able to do. I'm eagerly awaiting more CDs with this superb technology. You have ro READ the book. You have to LISTEN to the CDs. If not, nothing much will happen. If so, gradual, beautiful changes come about in all aspects of life. Could it get any better? If it can, Dane Spotts will be the person to make it available to us, I suspect.I have had the book for six months, it is priceless to me.

I can remember sitting at my desk copying page-long passages onto looseleaf paper so that they would be all the more tangible--so that somehow I could seem to touch the essence of what Ford was writing. At the time, it truly felt that dramatic.I suppose that, in some capacity, that's the point of The Good Soldier--the crushing of souls through the subsitution of words for life. The subsitution of habitual action for passionate action.And in the end, it is the words, and Ford's phenomenal control over them, that register most powerfully--the machinations and manuverings of Dowell's brain move back and forth through time and space and levels of emotion. The confusion is piercing. The shell of his life is haunting.Yet Ford always knows just what confusion he is rendering...And in acheiving that balance he exhibits perfect literary grace.Chill-inducing literary grace."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"No sooner had I started reading Ford Madox Ford's \\"The Good Soldier\\" that it reminded me of one of my favorite novels ever: Graham Greene's \\"The End of the Affair\\". Not because the books are similar, but I think they bear much resemblance. Both novels are narrated by a character that is one of the protagonists of the love affair, and, in both cases, he is very sad and jealous.If \\"The end of the Affair\\" is a \\"diary of hate\\", \\"The Good Soldier\\" is \\"the saddest story [the narrator] ever heard\\", is what John Dowel tells in the beginning of the book. Set in a period from 1904 to 1913, the narrative tells the story of two couples -- one American and another one British --that meet in Germany and become friends. Some time later, Dowel discoveries that his wife had a love affair with his friend.This novel is considered a Pre-Modernist work, Ford wrote the book in 1914, immediate before the First World War started --however, the book has some modernists elements, like a break from the Edwardian and Victorian novels, more traditional novels that preceded it. Ford employs innovations: the plot is disjointed, non-chronological, and infused with reflective commentary from the narrator.The feeling we have is that we are unveiling the story at the same time of Dowel. He never seems to know more than we do. His tone of narrative is, above all, confuse and angry, but sometimes he is also very nave. But, at the end, what is left is the impression that he is/was a man seeking for the truth, for some console, and coming to terms with his wife betrayal.Although it is a novel that discusses the moral of the adultery, \\"The Good Soldier\\" is not a book that preaches any kind of moral. Sometimes, the major theme in this book is the difference between reality and appearance.Many consider \\"The Good Soldier\\" the best book of the pre-war period, mostly because of the issues it touched upon. By that time, the so-called polite society didn't use to mention subjects like adultery, betrayal and moral confusion. Today we may be tired of discussing these issues, but they still make an interesting book."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this novel years ago and it has stayed with me like a personal experience of my own. I still think of it as a sob stuck in one's breast - and yet I can say that I did not fully understand it. I think the &quot;Reader From Europe&quot; (below) has summed it up pretty well, however. I know I felt great compassion for &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; of whom the narrator speaks. To me the novel was aboutl his sexual suppression. I also found I hated his wife and his friends...they colluded in keeping him swaddled in moral &quot;responsibility&quot; to his so-called marriage. How touching and exquisite is this precious little book. I wonder why no one ever tried to make a film out of it."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It's like hearing a story from someone still workin' out the details, ya know? Something happened and so-and-so said or did what and all of the sudden . . . wait, let me think about this . . . okay--No! It went like this!--this is the start of this marvelous, tragic novel, certainly more elegent in language, but the innovative narrative style gives a similar emphasis on someone figuring out the past through relfection. It tells a consistantly mournful story, the doom not so much shadowing the action as we are given the details of the outcomes pretty early on. But the narrator's efforts at understanding interfere with a course of events and sometimes forces him to rearrange them to capture the ideas he's sudden had.This book has just about everything that I like: a unique perspective, a dark sense of humor, extraordinarily well-developed characters and an inescapable misery percolating the text throughout, keeping emotions on edge and perception fragile. It is a glorous masterpiece . . ."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Although formulaic in concept for early 20th century literature, this book's style separates itself from its peers.During pre World War I, we meet the British Edward and Leonora Ashburnham and American Florence and John Dowell. As though it was a Fitzgerald novel -- the American couple resides in luxury, in Europe, the woman is talkative but fragile, and there is something brewing among the comrades -- it is definately somethin different. Although the same plot could be used and written by Waugh, Forster or maybe Woolf, it definitely is not their novel.Unlike Waugh, unlike Fitzgerald or unlike all of the others, this book is light, very light, on dialogue. Instead, it is mostly a narrative by Mr. Dowell about the descent of his wife, of his best friend Edward and his love of life, Nancy Rufford.Because it is a recantation of events, there are passages which repeat what was just previously read, but somehow the style (disjointed in a manner which narrative story telling would have to be) works. Oh, and how it works majestically as it passes in and out of time and through and around events so that the picture is delivered to you like a focus of a camera lens. This is not a temporal chronological recitation of what happened. The author circles us in and out of what he calls \\"the Saddest Story. . . because there was no current to draw things along to a swift and inevitable end.\\" And in this sad story, \\"There is not even a villain in the story . . .\\" Reeling in and out of the sadness, it is an abstract-like collage, much like what his contemporary artists would depict with paint. This story surreally depicts Ashburnham's demise. And, the demise of those about him.True to its form, it starts sad and ends sadder. Split into four parts, three parts end with tragic deaths (two in suicide and one perceived to be a suicide) and one ends with the acknowledgment of a failed marriage. Do not expect even one laugh from this novel.I have not read anything by a living author which mirrors the style of this book. For that reason alone, I would recommend this novel. And, it is a classic - through and through.I would also recommend getting a copy of Knopf's Everyman's Library edition with the edifying and insightful introduction by Alan Judd and Max Saunders. Much of Ford's life resembles one of the characters. If you get the Knopf edition, you will know why, and a lot more."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"&quot;The Good Soldier&quot; is often said to be the best novel of Ford Madox Ford, although few other works of his are read. Published in 1915, this masterpiece is translated in many languages including Japanese. The Norton Series are well known for the strict and careful text critic, but that of this book is almost extraordinary! The footnotes under almost all the pages of the text (153 pp.), a note on the text (15 pp.), and MDATV (Manuscript Development and Textual Variants: 23 pp.)--which are described with dozens of arcane signs and symbols. What a mania! Also the criticism section amounts to 179 pages, devided into (1) contemporary review (2) on impressionism (3) biographical and critical commentary.As is well known, Ford is an English novelist and journalist of German origin, who is often included in the modernism literature of 1910s and 1920s with Joyce, Eliot, Pound, Wyndham Lewis, V. Woolf, etc. As far as this novel is concerned, the ambiguity of the narrative, which is similar to the incredibility of man's memory, is used effectively, the text distorted aesthetically. This is why this work is occassionally called a cubistic novel. By this technique vivid amoral relationships among the hero narrated and his wife and the narrator and his wife got abstract beauty. The ending is also impressive. I wish Fasbinder had adapted this novel to a film.There are various editions published--Penguin, Oxford, Everyman, Vintage etc--but this is arguably the definitive edition."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book for a class 30 years ago, forgot about it, and then saw it on a list of the top 100 novels of the 20th Century. This is a wonderfully constructed, thoughtfully written, and facinating story. Independent of the story and the issues of change and transformation thematically dominating the book; the style and prose are intriquing and creative. An easy read well worth the time to revisit or discover new."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I don't want to comment on Ford's novel; it's wonderful, and you should read it if you have any interest in modernist fiction, love gone horribly wrong, or ethical/marital/religious hypocrisy. But I do want to take a moment to comment on the horrible introduction by Jeffrey Meyers, who seems otherwise to be a good scholar. It is no more than a trot, a plot summary of little critical value that contains several minor misreadings of the novel. If you are reading this edition for pleasure, avoid the introduction; it will only spoil the plot, and it is of little use for anything beside that. If you are teaching, students may be tempted to rely upon the flawed trot provided as an introduction."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I think what most fascinated me about this book was how the story unfolded with all the flashbacks, flash forwards and digressions. I found my allegiance to the characters changing all the time, with the new information presented from the different characters points of view. Initially, I would be somewhat sympathetic with an individual's plight, only to hear something else and have it all shift. I could understand the disorientation of John Dowell very well, because I was going through some of it too.I think the main theme of the novel is the difference between appearances and reality. In the beginning the story is about these two couples who seem very simpatico and compatible. They see each other as being the \\"good people\\" with the best manners and dress, with appearances being the most important thing to them. They seem to just intuit where to sit and when to leave a gathering, without ever talking about it. They are very concerned with making a \\"good apearance\\". We later find out how miserable they really are, except for John Dowell. Dowell seems happy during this time because he is completely oblivious to how the three of them are deceiving him. That is why he is so shocked and disoriented when Lenora accidentally discloses to him that his wife was having an affair with Edward. Dowell thinks, \\"If for 9 years I have possessed a good apple that is rotten at the core and I discover its rotteness only after 9 years, isn't it true to say that for 9 years I possessed a goodly apple?\\" I think this is the sadness of the situation for him. He is now coming to terms with how he was deceived and how he wasn't able to see what was going on in front of him. It makes him doubt himself and what he knows to be true about people. In a broader sense, the novel makes the point of how we are all limited to our own perceptions of events and how we are all limited to our own slice of the pie of reality. I think many of us have experienced situations where we think we have a firm grasp on things, only to have someone tell us what they know and have experienced, and then the puzzle pieces fall into place for us and we see the broader truth of the situation.I read the Norton Critical Edition of this novel and I would recommend it for all the annotations it provided and historical context. In the Dedication to Stella Ford at the beginning, my copy had a footnote where the author wrote that \\"the story is a true story and because I had it from Edward Ashburnham himself and I could not write it til all the others were dead\\". The footnote stated that the origin of this novel was when Ford once stayed with a couple and their young ward. As in the novel, the husband and ward had fallen in love with one another. Eventually, the young ward was packed off on a world tour. Ford (like Dowell) accompanied the couple to the train station in a dog cart. On the way, the man and girl exchanged only dull pleasantries. Ford realized that he was there to function as a chaperone and to prevent any expression of passionate feelings. The girl then died in Brindisi and the man suffered a nervous collapse. Thereafter, the man toured the continent looking for a \\"cure\\".One thing I found that others have not really commented on is the sly humor in the novel. It is very subtle, but I believe it is there. One instance is when John Dowell is meeting with the aunts of Florence. I might have the details of this a bit wrong, but I think the aunts were talking about the American Revolution and asking John's opinions of George Washington. John answers that he is not really a Washington man, that he prefers General Braddock. The aunts really like this answer as they too support Braddock over Washington. Because of this, the aunts really like him and decide to try to warn him off becoming involved with Florence. I enjoyed the irony of having your future marital happiness turn on whether you are a Washington or Braddock man. Another ironic line in the novel was when someone says of Edward \\"It would have done him a great deal of good to have been killed (in action)\\". I think there also is humor, be it black humor, when Nancy shouts \\"Shuttlecocks\\" in sudden outbursts at the dinner table. It seems that this is the only word that she, in her state of madness, can say. Poor John Dowell, he really didn't fare too well in any of this, did he?"},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I wont attempt to give an artistic review, others have done a far better job than I could do...I just will say it was a very good read, sad, profound, and so well written, its so different then a mass market novel, one finds it hard to look at a book for sale in the drug store after reading The Good Soldier.This edition was flawless, and arrived sooner than expected.You'll truly find this a literary experience!"},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The author of this novel written in the first person, discovers behind the perfect outward appearances of two upper class families, lechery, squandering, assailed purity, violent emotional conflicts and infighting, cuckoldry.This is certainly not a new theme, but the originality here lays in the treatment: the first-person narrator tells the story as a calm and distant observer, although he is directly implicated in the venomous conflicts.He discovers and reveals the facts little by little to the reader and gives his comments on the motivations and actions of the different characters as a 'good soldier'.The confusion of sentiments is well rendered, but I found the main characters not so interesting. Out of date are also the religious motives: the impact of religion on the protagonists and the distinction between catholic and protestant characters.The outcome is particularly sentimental and melodramatic. The reaction of an older man on the loss of a young girl, as well as the rest of the young girl's life are highly improbable.There are better books on the same theme. To name a few classics: 'Dangerous Liaisons' by Choderlos de Laclos, 'Elective Affinities' by J.W. von Goethe or the more vulgar 'A Life' by Guy de Maupassant."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Well, maybe if your name is Hillary!

Well, it is certainly not the saddest story I have ever read. Usually, sad things happen to good, thinking people. It is beyond my understanding how this tepid book can have so good a reputation. No doubt, adultery and the passions that surround it can be a great subject to write a novel, but the problem here is that characters are at the same time plain and unsympathetic. The trick, in my opinion, is that they pass for profound people, when in fact they are void, useless and jobless persons. The florid language in which the book is written gives the impression of psychological depth, but the truth is these characters have not much to search for within their personalities. Edward Dowell, the narrator, is the typical cuckold, unaware that his hypocritical wife is sleeping with another man -his friend, to make it worse- under his nose. Fool. Florence Dowell is a typical hypocrite (funny, they all seemed to me to be the \\"typical\\" something, which may tell you how profound I found them), an emotional blackmailer. Her husband gives his life to her, devotes himself to take care of her illness, and she goes and sleeps with a friend. And she's not even sexy or wicked or nymphomaniac. She's just an unfaithful common woman. Pig. Leonora Ashburnham is at the same time proud, detestable, arrogant and fool. She devotes her life to mend the fences broken by her irresponsible, philandering husband, who spends all his money on other women and gambling. Leonora is always there for him. Dumb. And John, well, John Ashburnham... Lucky guy. Rich, seductive, idle, always generous to easy women, always losing money and depending on his wife to talk to creditors. Always with nothing to do but seduce other women, including friends' wives. Pathetic loser.The funny thing is, everybody knows what's going on but no one does anything about it, and later they all complain and are perplexed. Boring and despicable lives make, in this case, for a bad novel, representative of the worst traits of XX century literature. The ending is exhilarating by way of trying to be tragic and moving."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is written by an annoying, weak man. The formal innovations are vaguley interesting, but in any case do not rescue the work from its primary deficit: you must sit there for several hours with the voice of a neurotic chatty little wimp who reminds one of a certain kind of homosexual man streaming through your mind, mostly in the form of digressions and non-sequitors. This is neither entertaining nor enlightening, and since it's the product of design it is actually a little infuriating. I too listen with good faith to the academic hierarchy present and past for recommendations, and I had in my version the hitherto utterly reliable Frank Kermode as Introducer; but damn, this book - its characters, its plots, its language, its taxing convolusions - is just annoying. Its only virtue is that reading it might raise awareness that vaguely condescending moralistic little works like this about unheroic, petty, neurotic, sordid, idle, superficially cosmopolitan people are a mistake to begin with, and - since we all have only 70 or 80 years on earth and aren't all compulsive aesthetes - time would be better spent elsewhere. There is nothing of the hard Sophoclean light here."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a great novel, and I'm sad that I had not read it sooner. Ford shows his strange position in the history of literature: this novel has traces of Henry James and Joe Conrad (both who tutored Ford) but also has an innovative narration that makes it seem very modern and readable. It also has a tragic, haunting story powering the interesting style. It's a good read, and makes us wish Ford was known for more than inspiring and helping later writers such as Hemingway and Fitzgerald. Many reviewers find fault with the narrator, but I can't see how anyone can but help but feel sorry for this poor man. His tale is indeed worth hearing."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"\\"The Good Soldier\\" is a masterpiece of opacity. All first-person narrators are unreliable, but Dowell is a special case. He is so pathetic, so absolutely determined to stay deceived, so observant while always missing the most important things. But he has such a way with words that I'll listen for as long as he wants to talk, so that for a \\"modernist\\" novel \\"The Good Soldier\\" actually is quite a page-turner. If you have read piles of good old novels and think you've seen everything, I'll wager that \\"The Good Soldier\\" will still impress you. The more you like novels, the more you'll admire Ford's achievement.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"_The Good Soldier_ is narrated by an American, John Dowell, a supposedly close friend of Edward Ashburnham, an Englishman and the title character of the book. John is married to Florence and Edward to Leonora, a very beautiful and intelligent woman, who is forced into managing her husband's financial and business affairs. Edward, while being very attractive to women and good hearted, is a heavy drinker and a gambler as well.Leonora is supposedly in love with Edward, but is, by nature, very cold emotionally. Both couples, who met at a European spa, have known each other for 9 years. John, in the course of narrating this story, realizes how little he really knew the Ashburnhams. John learns that his garrulous wife, Florence had been having an affair with Edward. In fact Edward, being the passionate and sentimental man that he is has a number of short term affairs throughout the book. Edward's nature is obviously unsettling to Leonora, who believes that she will eventually get her errant husband back.One of the interesting things we and the naive John learn is how little in common he and Edward have with their respective wives. What we believe are strong marital bonds are really relationships with loads of flaws and cracks. Without revealing the details of the entangled relationships, I will just say that a number of deaths, suicides, and madness occur in the book. As mentioned there, this is an extremely sad and tragic tale. While I found reading _The Good Soldier_ a boring and trite read for about 60 pages or so (infidelity is as old as the hills) and even put the book down at first, I decided to take it up again and found that as I got to know the characters, I began to take them to heart.The poor narrator realizes how much he loves his friend, Edward, and even identifies with him. John admitted to himself that he was a pathetic man and did not have the courage to act out on his passions as did Edward. We also learn that passion and sentimentality (as well as his betrayal of his friend and his wife) was the source of Edward's great unhappiness.Mr. Ford includes in the novel's narrative discussions of the characters' religious beliefs and how that affects their personalities, views on marriage and divorce, and the way that affects their everyday lives. This is a very engaging book and should be enjoyed (if one can call \\"the saddest story I ever heard\\" that) by those who love to read books about human frailties."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The essense of this outstanding novel is its style and tone. The plot is simple, almost mundane, a story of betrayal and infidelity. But the narrator, John Dowell, tells his story uncertainly, wistfully, mixing exquisite, almost visual, detail with large swatches of ambiguity and irony. The telling of the story represents true creativity and art."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Ford Madox Ford's \\"The Good Soldier\\" isn't really worthy of some of the more recent adulation heaped on it. It is not one of the greatest novels in the English language. Ford's friend and colleague, Joseph Conrad, was turning out far superior novels during this same period of time. Ford's rediscovery and positive reassessment by a new generation speaks more to their own concerns with finding truth at a personal level in a time of turmoil and deceit than it does to any transcendental perfection inherent in the novel. The same people who have re-inflicted Henry James on us over the past 15 years are this book's biggest admirers. So, why do I give \\"The Good Soldier\\" four stars?Because it is a damned fine novel in its narrative dimensions and its psychological analysis of its characters. Told through the tattered memory of John Dowell, the story weaves back and forth across time and personal perspective. Its non-linearity is acknowledged up front by Dowell, who warns us that he intends to tell this saddest of stories to us as if we were sitting right next to him in a room, listening to him speak while the night wind moans and thrashes outside. In fact, Dowell so tangles up his narrative that, at one point, he has to backtrack and put the sequence of events back into chronological order to clear up the confusion he has caused for himself through his knotted recitation of what happened.The non-linearity of the story line should be a major clue to the reader of the main theme of this novel -- how we deceive even ourselves when it comes to our most private passions. Dowell is a Nabokovian delight, an untrustworthy narrator who can only be relied upon for the basic facts and not the emotional nuances that create or shape them. Reluctant at first to admit anything unseemly in he and his wife Florence's twelve-year friendship with Leonora and Edward Ashburnham, Dowell eventually begins to trip himself up and, seemingly unknowingly, reveal things that contradict his earlier depictions of what transpired between the Dowells and the Ashburnhams. Dowell is sticking his hand in a fire and, in the process, coming to terms with his inner turmoil and pain at the turn of events which leave him widowed and nursing an insane young woman he loves, as well as Edward Ashburnham dead by his own hand, Florence Dowell likewise and Leonora Ashburnham, married off to a dull, proper member of the English gentry.Ford's mastery of psychological detail and insight into his characters is astonishing. It also reinforces the untrustworthy nature of Dowell's role as narrator. We wonder how a man can be so keen an observer of human behavior, yet not understand until after his wife has committed suicide that she has cuckolded him throughout their marriage. Nevertheless, Dowell's ability to analyze the motives and behaviors of those around him is uncanny. By the end of the novel, it is obvious that Dowell has lied to us about his understanding of his own feelings and actions. He knows Ashburnham, a man he claims to love and admire without reservation, is about to slit his throat, but makes no effort to stop him.\\"The Good Soldier\\" is a well-told tale of deceit between lovers and between the self and the soul. It is set at a time when an old ethos was rotting from within due to its own contradictions. That same sense of tearing through the hypocrisy of conventional wisdom and expectations of what we should expect in the form of love from others is what makes this novel very relevant for our own troubled era."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I really loved this multi-layered, utterly engaging story of two couples at the beginning of the 20th century.They are rich, privileged and deeply unhappy.The best thing I've read in ages."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I had this book in paperback for many years, just downloaded the Kindle version a few days ago, and I am hooked by it once more! I am fascinated with the author's ability to manipulate time, to go back and forth and back again in the telling of the story, what the narrator thought was happening at the time, and what he found the truth to ultimately be. Ford is a master at this. He switches his time frames within a single paragraph! But he lays it all out clearly, the story of a man who allows himself to be deceived in everything. If you like this, I would also recommend Ford's novel trilogy, Parade's End."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I was in a bookstore and picked a copy of this novel up, and from the second I read what I later learned was a famous first sentence (and justifiably so)--\\"This is the saddest story I have ever heard\\"--I knew I had to read it. What is truly sad about the book is that the narrator has no conception of where the tragedy in the book lies. While he is articulate and seemingly insightful in his analysis of others, he remains blissfully unaware of his own enormously failings, both in morals and in character. It is indeed a very sad story, but the narrator leaves out the fact that he is quite possibly one of the most pathetic characters in all fiction.If one prefers one's narrators and ostensible heroes to be truly heroic and sympathetic, then this novel will not please. If one, however, can imagine enjoying a novel written with J. Alfred Prufrock as the narrator and central character, then one is in a position to appreciate THE GOOD SOLDIER.The novel is not a page-turner. If you read this novel quickly, you have read it wrongly. The beauty of the book is the exquisite prose, and should be read slowly, savoring each sentence and each sentiment. There is a dreamlike (one could say nightmarish) quality to the book, and one will most enjoy it by allowing oneself to become entranced by the atmospheres summoned up.If you are willing to take the novel on its own terms, with its unheroic and unadmirable characters, with its pathetic elements and situations, and its subtle psychological observations, then there will be few reading experiences that will match THE GOOD SOLDIER. One of the most remarkable novels of the past century. But if you only like novels where there is a definite hero and admirable characters, you probably wouldn't enjoy this very much."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"One of the greatest examples of the spoken-word novel, The Good Soldier succeeds where authors as great as Conrad have failed. Our narrator does not tell a straight, linear story. No. He forgets things, comes back to them later, revives a subject you thought dead and meaningless only to shed new light on it and make it important.Perhaps the greatest effect the book has is the after-taste. When reading the book, I found it slow and boring. Once I set it down, though, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I had to read it again. And once I began again, I found myself reading it slowly once more, though not from boredom, but rather because I wanted to savor it and take it all in.I encourage anyone who has begun this book only to find themselves tired of it rather quickly to stick with it. You'll be glad you did. You'll find yourself buying copies for friends to read, as I do. This book truly gets under your skin."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This novel broke new ground when it was written, something in these jaded days that is almost impossible to do. Ford created an unreliable narrator and also wrote about the complex inner workings of relationships, an area of darkness that will always be immune from full enlightenment. His characters also deceive themselves as well as significant others, and yet are always in pursuit of the perfect appearance. The subtlety with which Ford has woven this tapestry makes you think twice and then three times about who his people are and what they want. Unbridled lust also rides through the book, but is forever reigned in by double standards and self-torturing conscience. Although the book requires a patient reader so that it can bloom, its payoff stays with you, and its sharp observations and lack of sentiment make you realize what a brilliant piece of art it is. As such it is not subject to becoming dated or stale, a true test of its merit. I recommend it to anyone looking for a great work."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Don't get caught up in a reading that doesn't get beyond the most shallow interpretation of events and phrasing. This apparently casually written work is a masterpiece of finely thought out detail. While deconstruction can be pointless, taking irony at face value is just as futile.It seems like a book about Leonora and Edward Ashburnham as told by a naive and passive friend, John Dowell. In reality, it is the transformation of John Dowell as he makes sense of his world after shattering information. His entire sense of reality has been undermined by the knowledge that the past 13 years 6 months were established in lies.The structure of the novel is deceptively simple. His retelling of past events masks the fact that the action of telling the story occurs in the present. Dowell tells us he has been writing for 6 months, he goes away for 18 months, returns, and then finishes the last two chapters. The lack of a fixed time frame for the narrated histories of the major characters again blurs time. And then there is the fact that there are several layers of story. There is reality, which we can never know. There is what Dowell believed was reality, of which he gives some description. There are the stories from various points of view that Dowell was told and then digests and retells to us. Then there is the present action of Dowell's changing self. All of these except for the last, are filtered through Dowell's narration. The last is exposed through his narration. In this work we have one of the finest examples of the Impressionist style of writing, as well as the Modern.Dowell is a recovering innocent. His identification with Edward is not absurd or insane, but the yearning of an innocent and a romantic for a perceived ideal that has been destroyed by a world that cannot nourish or understand it.Of course, this is a simplistic and narrow description that doesn't even get into the pre-WWI aspect of the novel and the August 4 controversy. Suffice it to say that the book is incredibly rich and there are no wasted words. Read it, it is worth it."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Good Soldier is woefully underread, and it fully deserves its somewhat belatedly-restored status as a true classic of 20th c. English literature. Ford Madox Ford, a friend and collaborator of Joseph Conrad, lays out a deceptively simple, almost trite, plot, one which we first think we've heard a dozen times before. But the beauty of this book is in the telling. Ford's narrator is piecing together the events of the past decade as he tells the story, and as such he jumps back and forth over the course of the last ten years, offering glimpses of events yet to come, going back and re-telling accounts of events he's already shared (though always with a new twist and revelation). In essence, the narrator is \\"learning\\" the story along with the reader, and he never (if ever) truly \\"understands\\" what's happened till the very end. Ford shatters forever the old 19th c. English novel where good and evil are absolute polar opposites, where characters unfailingly embrace either one or the other pole, where decency and \\"good\\" almost always prevail in the end, and where characters are immediately transparent (take Dickens, for example: a paragraph or two and you know all you need to know about each and every character he introduces; whether they're \\"good\\" or \\"bad,\\" etc.) Ford uses the genre of the novel to create a work of literature where art mirrors real life. His characters are never what they seem at first meeting, events are fraught with deep hidden meanings that bubble beneath the surface, and there are three sides to every story. Beautifully written with moments of sparkling wit and levity, it is also an emotionally draining work that tackles love (versus what simply goes by the name) and propriety (versus what society says is proper). You'll want to flip back to the first chapter and re-read it from page one, knowing then what you know by book's end. A true masterpiece which I cannot recommend highly enough. This particular edition from Everymans Library is particularly handsome and well-bound, with insightful introductory essays by thoughtful critics (which, needless to say, should be read after the novel itself)."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This novel broke new ground when it was written, something in these jaded days that is almost impossible to do. Ford created an unreliable narrator and also wrote about the complex inner workings of relationships, an area of darkness that will always be immune from full enlightenment. His characters also deceive themselves as well as significant others, and yet are always in pursuit of the perfect appearance. The subtlety with which Ford has woven this tapestry makes you think twice and then three times about who his people are and what they want. Unbridled lust also rides through the book, but is forever reigned in by double standards and self-torturing conscience. Although the book requires a patient reader so that it can bloom, its payoff stays with you, and its sharp observations and lack of sentiment make you realize what a brilliant piece of art it is. As such it is not subject to becoming dated or stale, a true test of its merit. I recommend it to anyone looking for a great work."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Like another reviewer I too bought this book because it was on a list of the top 100 books of the twentieth century. But it sat on the shelf for a while because I didn't like the look of it from an instinctive perspective. Being from a different time and by an English author, I was intimidated. I thought I would have a hard time getting past the language of the book, and I thought I would be bored. I mean come on, how many times have we heard about an English restoration piece in which there is some deep and horrible scandal amongst the English well-to-do in the late nineteenth century, and it turns out pretty mundane by modern standards.But in The Good Soldier it isn't the scandalous behavior of the characters that makes this a fascinating read, it is the amazing narrative voice of John Dowell. Ford's accomplishment with The Good Soldier is not in the creation of an incredible story. The story to me seems more like garnish to the main attraction. What makes this a masterful work is Ford's creation of a storyteller. John Dowell as a storyteller is so complete and real. Oh I don't mean the details of his life or the veracity of his character or morals. It is John Dowell's voice that makes this book a classic.After reading different reviews and analysis of the book after I read it I noticed how many people seem concerned with the trustworthiness of Dowell's story. Personally I don't understand why it's important. If I were indeed sitting beside him in a country inn in front of a roaring hearth, trying to pass the night while the weather had its way with the night outside - a scene Dowell suggests and I found myself in quite easily while reading - my concern would be for the method and the gripping nature of his storytelling. I would not only accept, but also expect embellishments, exaggerations and one-sidedness. But of course unless he were a mad sea captain I would also expect him to admonish himself for doing these things and to seem sincere and to seem to consciously be making an effort to tell the whole story, even when it embarrassed himself. People have mentioned the way Dowell says that &quot;this is the saddest story I've ever heard&quot; and how it seems an odd thing to say if one is in the story and not hearing it. I however like to imagine him saying this in front of the aforementioned fire (after dinner when all the other guests have already turned in for the night) as a beginning to the story he's about to tell, placing himself in the roll of one of the characters (perhaps to make the story more interesting, and perhaps because it really did happen to him). Ford's magic is in making a man who tells a story in a book, exactly as you would expect him to tell you in person. You can't tell for sure what's true or not; when you've caught him in a lie and when he's just made a mistake because he's tired.The Good Soldier succeeds because a not very interesting man tells a not very interesting story in a truly real and interesting way."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Good Soldier has all the tension and fragility of aballoon filled with twice the amount of air it's supposedto hold.

Do yourself a favor and read it immediately!"},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I think this is the first novel I've ever read twice. It's an odd choice for that, as it's not my favorite. I read it in college at the recommendation of my creative writing professor, who thought it might be helpful in structuring a story on which I was working. And the structure, more than anything, is the most innovative part of the book. An example of literary impressionism, the narrator paints the story with small brush strokes, a scene here and there, out of order, from different perspectives. He examines each character individually, because it is more about the characters and their motivations than it is about the plot. It is left to the reader to put the pieces together--the narrator gives more of an impression than a complete picture.But THE GOOD SOLDIER is #30 on The Modern Library's top novels of the 20th century, which means that it must have more than just structure. I have to admit that, until I got to the very end, both times I read the book, I wondered what the allure was. The book's first sentence is \\"This is the saddest story I have ever heard.\\" But throughout, I kept getting the feeling that it was little more than a jumbled romantic melodrama. The characters are all flawed in ways that makes them real but not particularly likable. They are all extremely well off, which makes their dismal state even more frustrating--these people have everything--Why aren't they happy? But then in the end, somehow--and maybe it's just the last few pages that do it--I realize that these characters are great. Particularly Edward Ashburnham, the soldier of the book's title, is a very likable character. And we're almost willing to overlook his one vice--his womanizing--partly because he's such a sentimentalist but mostly because his wife is such a wretch, the only truly wicked character in the book.As for the plot, it's almost not worth detailing. As I said, it's more about the characters and how the plot is structured than the plot itself. There are five principle characters: Edward and Leonora Ashburnham, John and Florence Dowell, and Nancy Rufford. Two commit suicide, one goes crazy, and the other two suffer perhaps the worse fate of living completely plain, boring, lonely lives. In the end, it is a very sad story, if for no other reason than that most of it is so unnecessary--with the exception of Leornora, any of these people could have lived happy lives if it weren't for each other."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Ah! The travails of the rich... Give some young attractive people plenty of money, nothing useful to do, not even any children, plenty time for their idle fancies, and what do you get? Trouble. The Ashburnhams, Edward and Leonora, an upper-class English couple, and the Dowells, John and Florence, upper-class Americans, become friends at a health spa in Germany. All sorts of hanky-panky ensues that makes everybody miserable. This is a love story and a hate story, or rather \\"stories\\" because there are many intertwining threads. It is about the darkness and agony that can lie hidden beneath and behind seemingly ordinary well-ordered lives. It is also about the sinister effect that social conventions and even religion can have on ordinary lives. Mostly I think it is about the dangers of idleness and youth.The story is charmingly and fatuously told by John Dowell. John starts by saying this is the saddest story he's ever heard. And indeed it is sad. But it is also hilarious in places. John is a self-effacing man who claims to do nothing much in life and not to know very much. In his candid and nave way, however, he makes stunning remarks and actually is philosophically insightful while being quite amusing. Since he is a participant in the events, his account is not entirely objective, but yet has a deeper truth than a mere factual recounting.I say it is \\"Trollope on steroids\\" because the events and affairs seem so exaggerated and intense. But are they so out of the ordinary? I think of the recent exposures of the exploits of so many politicians and business leaders recently and then it does not seem so extreme. These things go on. Some of the emotions, restraints, and morals are a bit dated, but mostly they are universal and eternal, or at least as long as human life persists on this planet.The events recounted in this novel took place between about 1900 and 1912. The book was originally published in 1915. I found the thought of the impending doom of World War I looming over the characters in this novel. In a way, the world of the novel is peaceful and happy, although the characters make themselves miserable. Soon all that was to change so fundamentally and our cynical troubled era would be born. Another novel from the years just before The Great War is Howards End by E.M. Forster. Reading these two side by side or one after the other would give one a sense of \\"the calm before the storm.\\" I think they would complement each other nicely, if you are interested in that fabled age before the war to end all wars.I enjoyed reading The Good Soldier. It is a wonderful novel.

It is a book of its own time. Neverthelless, it does explore marriage and morality of \\"keeping up appearances\\". Although I do not find it personally to be the saddest story ever, some of the character descriptions and psychology of them is brilliantly explored in the last pages of the book. It is a great reflection of the times passed and endurances of many marriages caused by both internal and external struggles of people in them. It was a thrill to be transformed in the era of 150 years ago and see that complexities of marriage are not just issues of modern times. Marriages are made of complexities, no matter what time or era it involves."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"As Ford says, this is the saddest story. It is a wonderfully sad story about Edward, a sentamentalist, and his search for true love which never materializes.

The narrator's wife has a &quot;bad heart&quot; also and when the two couples meet in Europe they seem to form an ideal foursome. However, as the story unfolds, the narrator reveals that none of these people are who they seem to be on the surface.The writing is very witty &amp; the novel is structured almost like a mystery. But as with a number of other books on this list, it is hard to like any of the characters &amp;, therefore, hard to care what happens to them.GRADE: B-"},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It is understood that The Good Soldier is a piece of modernism. I have no problem with that. However, this book did not touch me. It's supposed to be &quot;the saddest story&quot; but the characters in it were so indifferent that I could not care enough about them to find the novel to be tragic.The story is about the wasteland of the 20th century when seemingly all of our human passions have been sapped by a general feeling of apathy and disinterest. Gone are the days of the heroic warrior who leaves his Spartan wife, hearing her whisper in his ear &quot;Return either with your shield or on it.&quot; Instead, we get a soap opera where all of man's sacred virtues have been trivialized. For instance, the chap in the book says &quot;If I could not have her, I felt that I must at least marry her.&quot; The book is filled with ironic little twists like that.Supposedly, Ford subscribed to the &quot;most perfect word for each sentence&quot; school that Gustav Flaubert was the master of. I don't see it. I found his analogies so absurd that they made me break out laughing when they were intended to make me sad. For instance, he compares a woman sticking out the trunk of a car to being eaten by an alligator. Sorry, but I don't find that very thoughtful.I am not going to say this is a bad book. It has received too much critical acclaim to be dismissed as such. Although I like Hemmingway, I did not like his The Sun Also Rises for much the same reason as I hated Ford's work. However, if you like a book where at least SOME action takes place (and by action I do NOT mean violence), I would not recommend this book. Nor would I admonish anyone who likes wonderful characterization &amp; personas to read it. As a testament to 20th century nihilism, however, I suppose it's worth someone's while."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I really wanted to like this book. It is quite good -- an intriguing story that pulls you in, with a nice conversational tone. However, I really didn't find it as masterful as the other reviews led me to expect. It seemed to me terribly overwrought, and a little unbelievable. Also, Ford doesn't seem that fond of the ladies, while he really worships not-that-bright, rich men. If you're thinking of reading it, I think you should, as it's a short and quick read. But if you find it a little much, don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The saddest story in the world it is not. Nor the most interesting, for that matter. For my money, the authors who came after Ford Madox Ford and who imitated or borrowed from himdid so much better than he himself. I suppose, then, that at least credit is due to him for having inspired better authors after him. Where would world literature be, for instance, without the likes of Graham Greene?The Good Soldier is not a bad novel, necessarily. It's actually quite good. But it simply isn't memorable. It's not one of those novels from which you could drop the name of the main character at a cocktail party of pseudo-intellectuals and have it be instantly recognizable. That is to say that Edward Ashburnham, the soldier to whom the title refers, is certainly no Heathcliff or Darcy or some such character from British literature whose fame is known and remembered by most anyone who stayed awake through their high school English classes. There is something about Ashburnham that is not fully engaged, or perhaps not fully drawn. He never seems to step forward to the front of the stage, but he doesn't exactly lurk beneath a shroud of mystery either. He just isn't all that interesting.The narrator, on the other hand, is quite interesting, and quite likeable. But we never get the sense that the book is really about him. He's an innocent bystander, a passive observer, a set of eyes that does its best to stay out of the way and not pass judgment. And because the novel is focused through him rather than on him, we are forced to engage with a set of characters with whom we would dread spending an evening, and whose names we would always have trouble recalling."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I had always heard good things about Ford Maddox Ford, but this was rather a disappoint.

It was difficult for me to stomach the portrayal of Americans. The book is thoroughly English in every respect, and I thought his writing of American characters betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of America. It's not that he's stereotyping Americans; it's more like he's never met one before. The story itself was riveting, but the narrative style, while it may be fascinating in a literary criticism class, was more of a liability than an asset to me as a reader. I also would have liked to develop my own empathy or distaste for these characters, but instead, I was continually reminded by the narrator how noble all these pathetic people were supposed to be.

Century novel, as set by , e.g., Balzac or Zola, where an all-seeing narrator tells everything there is to know about both plot & characters;instead we have a completely beffuddled narrator trying to make head or tail of the events he has lived, therefore losing his sense of \\"order\\" - of a well-ordered, black on white bourgeois universe - in the process. Of course, some pioneers had already taken this path before, such as the Brazilian novelist Machado de Assis, whose \\"Dom Casmurro\\" has certain similarities ( as also a prevading feeling of doubt and confusion) in plot with \\"The Good Soldier\\".

You then learn It may be that another character is really to blame for the behavior of the first, and so on. As soon as you think you know the characters, they are cast in a new light. At the end, you are not even sure you know the narrator, except that he is shallow and self-deceived.

Whichever, it is a magnificently constructed novel. A tale of adultery, yes, but far removed from today's soap operas and yet so very contemporary.

When it comes to telling a story, Ford does what his old buddy Conrad tried to do but never achieved..."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier is a story of two couple's intertwined love lives, focusing most heavily on the period 1904-1913 but going back into the 1890s. The novel has its place in the history of English literature for two main reasons.First, it's seen as a step away from the nineteenth-century comedic ending in which everyone gets what they deserve. As the narrator notes at the end, the characters do get what they deserve according to social norms, but obviously the narrator's sympathies are to the contrary.Second, the use of time-jumping cuts was innovative.Both of these are now quite common. Indeed, a happy ending almost condemns you to be seen as writing working class hackwork (e.g., romance novels, action-adventure science fiction). Any contemporary author worth their salt is likely to try writing a novel out of chronological order.What is more likely to stand out for readers are the book's faults.First, the narrator is, as you might have gathered from other reviews, something of a rambling fuddy-duddy. This is done reasonably well (though not on the level of Ishiguro's pitch perfect The Remains of the Day), and apparently Ford wrote at length elsewhere justifying his difficult narrator. But doing well when embodying a narrator who isn't really up to the task mainly serves to demonstrate that not every person is bursting with potential as a narrator of a novel.Other reviewers praise the novel's prose. While it does seem consistent with the narrator, it is hardly beautiful. There are some real groaners of paragraphs in here. I didn't mark them because it never occurred to me while reading that someone would praise the novel's style.Second, on a related point, the names are clumsy and distracting, though I guess this is what you should expect from someone who picks a pseudonym that puts himself in the position of saying, \`Hi, I'm Mr Ford Ford.' The names come across as Dickens rejects: Edward Ashburnham, Maisie Maiden, Reggie Hurlbird. It's hard not to look askance at these names. It also slows down your getting your bearings to have the two main female characters having names with so many overlapping letters (Lenora and Florence).Third, the medical side of the novel makes it hard to suspend disbelief. The \`heart', as both a symbol and body part, is a major theme of the work. One character is trapped on the Continent because a Channel crossing is supposed to be too daunting. (The ultimate explanation is unsatisfactory.) Another character who seems way too young to have a heart attack dies of heart failure under implausible conditions. (It feels like the coroner's report would read, \\"Murdered by author to advance the plot.\\")All of this said, in the end I did find myself engrossed the story. The characters find themselves in terrible positions. . . and then you're given the backstories and realize how much worse things are than they initially appear (which is saying a lot). The members of these two couples don't mean to, but they just shred each other in slow motion. The characterization, albeit done with some Catholic bashing, is quite rich. In particular, there's a brilliant passage in which the narrator describes another character's daily schedule in order to demonstrate how little time out of the day his sins actually took up and how he was in so many ways an outstanding moral person.In short, I was eventually won over by the novel but it's easy to see why people would find the story or its narrator too much."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book seemed like &quot;A Tale of Passivity&quot; or &quot;The Most Pathetic Story.&quot; Engagingly written, with tawdry doings progressively exposed by the wimpish narrator, the reader is drawn along to find out &quot;How low will they go?&quot; Well, they get about as lowdown as characters could be expected to get in early 20th century fiction. While something of a potboiler, this book does raise some interesting questions and views regarding male/female relationships, particularly where the characters veer between their urges to repress or to express their emotions. Only voracious Florence, under license from her &quot;weak&quot; heart, pursues her desires with relative abandon. The other three characters (four, if you count &quot;the girl&quot;) seem unable to do much of anything but follow along. They are either &quot;strongly weak&quot; or &quot;weakly strong&quot;, evoking little interest in their fates.There's just not enough oxygen left in the room for them to live when Florence is around. And yet, nothing gets better, in any real sense, after she's gone and the others could get on with their lives. The fact that they don't lays bare their fundamental emptiness. In every meaningful sense, Florence, whether alive or dead, is the driving force of the story. Indeed, the &quot;good soldier&quot; comes across as a vulnerable, sympathetic fellow, rather than as a lothario.I found some aspects of the book decidedly shallow, particularly the author's depictions of Americans (especially Henry James-style expatriates) and Anglo-Irish Roman Catholics. There were a few good digs but too much stereotyping and not enough understanding.Overall, an enjoyable read, but more in the way of a tastefully spun out melodrama than as trenchant psychological portraiture."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier (100 Grestest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"&quot;The Good Soldier&quot; is a book that you have to fight to get through.

Ford Maddox Ford (originally &quot;Hueffer&quot;) wrote varily and with much awareness when it comes to form. In what has come to be a typical post-modern element, the reader is taken on a rollercoasterride of scattered chronology. As he tells his stpry, the narrator, Dowell, seems to become slightly aware of the events along with the reader, whom he also often enrols in the story by confronting him directly - telling him that he has to make it up himself. I don\`t, personally, find much pleasure in the impressionistic style that the author makes use of. So I will not recommend the book to anyone seeking pure entertainment.

Van Dine was one of the leading practitioners of the American detective story, and who inspired Ellery Queen and C. Daly King to write. This book, dealing with a series of murders taking place at secluded houses along Riverside Drive, New York, is similar to Van Dine's earlier &quot;Greene Murder Case,&quot; in that the murders are committed to a pattern - in the former book, Grost's handbook on criminology; in &quot;Bishop,&quot; according to Mother Goose (the original title was &quot;The Mother Goose Murders,&quot; though Van Dine changed them, as he did not want his readers to believe that he was writing for children). Besides being one of the first of the nursery-rhyme murders (c.f. both Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen), the book is also ingenious and bizarre, both in the commission of the murders and the unmasking of the murderer. Some of the scenes, though, owe small ideas to H. C. Bailey, as in the &quot;Little Miss Muffet&quot; murder (c.f. &quot;The Violet Farm,&quot; &quot;The Little House,&quot; &quot;The Bird in the Cellar,&quot; etc.). People have claimed to view Philo Vance as an infuriating snob, but he is no worse in this respect than Dorothy L. Sayer's Peter Wimsey, and a great deal better - Van Dine, for one, did not think of Philo Vance as the ultimate lover. In short, plenty of detection, plenty of atmosphere (despite Van Dine's rules, contained in &quot;The Winter Murder Case&quot;), and a fascinating glimpse of old-fashioned New World."},{"Title":"The Bishop Murder Case: A Philo Vance Mystery (A Philo Vance Mystery)","review":"&quot;Cozy&quot; mysteries don't get much sillier than this, but it's probably the most entertaining of the Philo Vance novels in spite of the hokum. Ultimately, nearly all of the suspects are killed off, so figuring out whodunit isn't a major...uh, undertaking. But if you enjoy a good old-fashioned mystery, complete with bizarre (and not quite believable) goings-on, you'll probably like this one."},{"Title":"The Bishop Murder Case: A Philo Vance Mystery (A Philo Vance Mystery)","review":"The Bishop Murder case is the fourth novel by S. S. Van Dine (pseudonym of Willard Huntington Wright)featuring his detective Philo Vance. Philo Vance was much in the mode of British fictional detectives of the period such as Sayer's Lord Peter Wimsey who had made his appearance in 1926 inWhose Body?. The Philo Vance mysteries were wildly popular in the United States.Vance is a wealthy dilettante and aesthete who was portrayed as a dandy and bon vivant. The books were narrated by a fictional Van Dine who took the part of the Watson figure. His admiration for Vance was based on the fact that Vance excelled at any lofty, upper class thing he attempted. In short, Vance is a bit of an insufferable bore with a heavy smoking habit.However, there is an entertaining, campy quality about the stories and The Bishop Murder case is generally acknowledged as one of the better of the Vance stories. It is constructed around a number of Mother Goose rhymes where, for instance, a character named Christopher Robbin is found pierced by an arrow as in \\"Who Killed Cock Robin\\".Frankly, if you don't already have a soft spot for Vance or don't want to read one of the seminal works of the Mystery Genre then you might well find this book a bit heavy going. However, if you are prepared to suspend *a lot!* of disbelief and just going along for the campy ride then you might find yourself enjoying The Bishop Murder Case."},{"Title":"The Bishop Murder Case: A Philo Vance Mystery (A Philo Vance Mystery)","review":"The Bishop Murder book focuses around a series of murders that are connected to nursery rhymes in the house of a mathematics professor.

S.S. Van Dine, whose real name was Willard Hunting Wright, while writing mysteries, was also an art critic, and it shows in this book. The whole first chapter concerns Vance's view of the art world.This book plot, though, focuses around a series of murders that are connected to nursery rhymes in the house of a mathematics professor.

I look here before I look in The Joy of Cooking, or any of my other cookbooks.My poor old cookbook has packing tape on the spine to keep the spine in place. I use this book a lot, especially if I want to prepare a traditional food, such as Waffles.Another reviewer said that some of the recipes may not be that healthy, but I disagree. This cookbook was written before there were a lot of processed foods, when mostly everything was made from scratch, so it would probably be healthier in that respect.

Contained in this book are the old fashioned ways of cooking from the 40's and 50's - it's not always low fat, and it's not quick, it's pretty much everything you always wanted to know about food.

I had gotten the book from the local library, returned it and was left with a nice memory of the book. Now, a couple decades later I've found the book again and purchased it for my own. I am not sorry that I did. This book is a brilliant piece of work, where the life form are crystalline silicon based, as well as some silicon/carbon mixes. The humans have advanced so far that they use external suits to do everything for them, from just taking a stroll down the street, to swimming in the pool. Evan Orgell, our protagonist, is dropped on the planet to find out what has happened to the research team which was left there previously. He quickly finds that the life forms on this planet, while beautiful, can also be extremely dangerous. Over all, I am VERY happy to finally include this book in my personal library."},{"Title":"Sentenced to Prism","review":"Unlike most SF books where the properties of life are pretty much the same with a bunch of carbon based life-forms interacting with each other, this book features a world where the creatures are DIFFERENT.I hope this book gets reprinted in the near future.

The descriptions of the inhabitants of Prism shows Foster's fabulous imagination. I give it 4 stars for the wonderful descriptive qualities alone.

In Quozl, he dwelled on adolescence, Slipt, elderly complascence. Prizm explored fashion and human vanity, not to mention human superiority. He has an astounding vision and extremely flexible biological views. He has been one of my favorite writers since I read &quot;The man who used the Universe&quot; back in 1978.

Other than that, very little confusion.Rate of Development - FastGets into the thick of things pretty quick.The Story - GoodA new world has been discovered. A new world which is silicon based rather than carbon based. Most of the inhabitants seem crystalline in structure rather than organic.

Upon arrival, he discovers that this planet is very much more alive that you would think.My Suggestion - RecommendedThis book would make a great movie only for its visualizations. The author does a good job in describing the dangers and surroundings of the planet. He actually made me fearful of what lies out on its surface, unprotected by the survival suit (i.e. creatures that explode in needles, razor sharp crystalline grass, acid spitters, spheroid steamrollers that crush its prey)."},{"Title":"Sentenced to Prism","review":"Wow.

The encompassing descriptions of the planet Prism were unparalled. plot flow was something else which was another strong point to this book.

A mind expander."},{"Title":"Sentenced to Prism","review":"One of Foster's trademarks is to take a theme and make a world out of it (such as the forest world of Midworld or the sea world of Cachalot). Sentenced to Prism is Foster at his best--a world full of silicon-based lifeforms that live on solar power (along with nutrients from the soil and other creatures). A great adventure story along with the brilliantly conceived environment, a book you'll stay up late to finish."},{"Title":"Sentenced to Prism","review":"Don't be put off by the title, cover or jacket blurb: this novel is good fun. Alan Dean Foster's discription of the planet Prism and its inhabitants is quite out of the ordinary in science fiction.The hero is sent to a newly discovered planet where contact has been lost with an exploration party. He finds all but one of the explorers dead and sets out to find the one who has escaped into the wilds.On the way he runs afoul of crystalline life forms that are often as deadly as they are beautiful. He is saved by extremely unlikely-looking inhabitants who are both kindly and ingenious.The hero is supposed to be an overconfident sort who has a lot to learn, but he merely seems a bit fatuous. And the exposition in the second chapter is laborious. However, the premise does allow some moments of comedy, and the author has more success with the female explorer found near the end of the story.Foster develops two main ideas thoroughly: to depict an environment where the life forms are mostly silicon-based, and to create likeable \\"aliens\\" who turn the notion of \\"primitive\\" upside down.The action is a bit gory at times, but the context justifies and even redeems it. In both concept and style, Alan Dean Foster's \\"Sentenced to Prism\\" can take its place alongside Hal Clement's classic novels \\"Needle\\" and \\"Mission of Gravity."},{"Title":"Sentenced to Prism","review":"I love it when a writer creates a whole new world.

The end suggests a potential for the inhabitants of Prism to possibly show up in the Commonwealth in an upcoming novel, perhaps the next Flinx novel (just how long before we get to Flinx's past being told?). MidFlinx showed such possibility. As a hopeful writer myself, I am always inspired by Alan Dean Foster (my favorite author), and hope he someday brings the Commonwealth stories to a novel of incredible size-in fact challenge him to do so (Alan's novels are usually short but packed!!).

The lists of 1-chord, 2-chord, 3-chord, and 4-chord songs are useful for a beginner.

Also, Kellach is still so new to the world of wizardythat he only knows a few baby spells, nothing that could get him into any trouble.

Luckily for all three of them, they are out past curfew (atime when not a soul travel the Curston street if they want to see daylight) and wind up in frontof Curston's magistrate, Lexos, who lets them off with a warning.On the way to school the next morning, Kellach and Driskoll discover the body of the greatwizard Zendric. His body is there, but the Kellach notices that the globe he has been warnedagainst has disappeared. And inside the globe is Zendric's spirit. Kellach knows that if he, they,can find the globe in time that they can return Zendric's soul and thereby restore Curston's most-respected wizard.What follows is the adventure the threesome has as they begin their search. Like their heroes, theKnights of the Silver Dragon (an order long decimated during the Sundering of the Seal) thelittle band they overcome many obstacles, acting brave when they much rather be at homestudying in front of the fire. Along the way they travel outside the city into the ruins of the oldcity that meet with fortune hunters, enter the old city and climb into the Dungeons of Doomwhere they meet such creatures as an owlbear, goblins and the goblin-king and zombies.It's a rip-roaring tale that is sure to delight anyone who reads it. Secret of the Spiritkeeperreminded me a little of Harry Potter. And although I'm probably the only person on the planetwho doesn't like Harry, I did get a kick out of Kellach, Driskoll, and Moyra. They were morehuman and seemed more age appropriate.Secret of the Spiritkeeper is a self-contained novel that doesn't require a commitment to the otherthree novels in the series to enjoy this one. In fact, that's probably the biggest drawback of thisbook. There's no need to read further. On the other hand, it will be interesting to see if the littleband can reconstruct a real Knight of the Silver Dragon origination."},{"Title":"Secret of the Spiritkeeper (Dungeons and Dragons: Knights of the Silver Dragon, Book 1)","review":"Wizards of the Coast is best known as the makers of the enormously popular \\"Magic: The Gathering\\" collectible card game, \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" role-playing game, and their related lines of fiction and home to top fantasy authors R.A. Salvatore and Margaret Weis. In 2004, however, Wizards decided to move into the realm of juvenile and teen fiction with the announcement of their Mirrorstone imprint. For the first two series under the Mirrorstone banner, they decided to stick with two subjects that they know very well: Dragonlance and Dungeons & Dragons.Knights of the Silver Dragon is a Dungeons and Dragons series aimed at readers 8 - 12 years in age. The stories center upon the exploits of three young heroes in the town of Curston. Kellach, is a teenaged apprentice to the town's most powerful wizard, Zendric. Kellach's brother, Driskoll, is an adventurous 12 year old who dreams of becoming a great warrior like his father Torin, the captain of the Curston's town watch. The brothers are joined by their friend Moyra, a young female thief and daughter to one of Curston's most well known thieves, Breddo.In the first book, \\"Secret of the Spiritkeeper\\", Kellach is joined by Driskoll as he goes to Zendric's tower for his daily lesson in the art of wizardry. However when they approach the tower they find the door wide open, highly unusual for Zendric. When they enter, Kellach finds his mentor lying on the floor, apparently dead. The tower has been ransacked and it appears that Zendric was the victim of thieves but Kellach finds that the only item that is missing is a strange, glowing orb that Zendric kept upon his mantle. Soon, the boys father, Torin, shows up with several watchers to investigate and sends the boys home immediately. Kellach believes that the orb has something to do with Zendric's death and believes that he can be restored to life if they find it.After sneaking into the city prison to speak to Moyra's father, they find out that it was a half-orc street thug who stole the orb. They track him down but find that he has already sold the orb to a group of adventurers who have left town. They are headed to the Dungeons of Doom, whose denizens have troubled the people of Curston for many years and is the reason that people are not permitted to leave their homes after dark. Torin is furious with his boys when he finds out what they've been up to and forbids them to leave the house, but Kellach knows that they are Zendric's only hope, so they sneak out of house to save him. Now the three friends must enter the depths of those dangerous, trap-filled, underground passages, facing terrible creatures in order to find the magical orb that will hopefully restore Zendric to life.Reading \\"Secret of the Spiritkeeper\\" takes me back to the earliest days of when I first played Dungeons & Dragons back in the late 1970's. In fact the adventure that these three companions went on was not unlike many of the early, low-level adventures that thrilled my friends and me when we first discovered the game. The story has that strong feel of playing one of those old modules from the TSR days, with a mysterious town, threatened by monsters, and the always present underground dungeon that was the ultimate goal of players. The book closely follows the spirit and rules of the game as Kellach carries the various components in his robes to cast his spells, and Moyra stealthily uses her thievery skills to pick locks and find traps. It is a fantasy story, but one squarely set in the strong foundation of the Dungeons & Dragons universe.Author Matt Forbeck and the editors did a wonderful job of capturing the feel of the game in this well-plotted and action-oriented story. The three main characters are all well-developed and have the same motivations and fears that kids reading the story have, making them easy to identify with. The frosting on the cake is gorgeous cover and interior illustrations by Emily Fiegenshuh which have a distinct, although subtle, Japanese Anime influence to them. Again, Kudos to Wizards of the Coast for sticking to what they know kids are interested in today. Each of the books in the series check in right around 180 pages with short chapters that average 6 - 10 pages in length. This is very important as it's much more fulfilling to put a book down for the night at the end of a chapter rather than in the middle. Short chapters make it more motivating to read, especially for younger children.Kids love fantasy so it's no surprise that so many of the top-selling juvenile and teen books today are fantasy-oriented. They provide a sense of wonder, imagination and adventure. \\"Secret of the Spiritkeeper\\" is a wonderful start to what should be a thrilling series of adventures that will not only get kids interested in fantasy, but also the Dungeons & Dragons game as well. Those people at Wizards of the Coast are pretty clever."},{"Title":"Secret of the Spiritkeeper (Dungeons and Dragons: Knights of the Silver Dragon, Book 1)","review":"This was like the coolest book of all time!Its about these two brothers and there friendwhom go on A adventure to save there friend and travel through the dark scary dungons of doom.its very entertaning and theres not A lot of romance.Who ever draws the pictures on the cover is verytalented.I also reccomend w.i.t.c.h"},{"Title":"Secret of the Spiritkeeper (Dungeons and Dragons: Knights of the Silver Dragon, Book 1)","review":"This book I thought was a really adventouous and a great mystery.

It tells about the first of many adventures that they have. Kellach is a wizards apprentice . Driskoll wants a sword really bad. Moyra is a young thief who lives with her parents in a small rundown house. Kellach and Driskoll live in a big house because their dad is leader of thewatch. The watch is like the police. Kellach and Driskoll's mom was killed when the seal that connected their town to the dungeons of doom was broken. Tons and tons of demons and vicious wolves and goblins came through and killed tons of people including Kellach and Driskoll's mom. But if you want to find out more you will have to read the book.I think the author is trying to tell the reader that you should take risks and have fun adventures. I know that this is the message because they take tons of risks and vary dangerous tasks and adventures. Like when they go into the dungeons of doom they could just turn back and forget it but no they go ahead anyway and search for Zendric's soul. They know their task and they are going to stick to it.I like this book because it takes place in olden times when they used swords and because it has a little fantasy.

This is one of the best books that I have read in years, and I have been telling all of my friends and acquaintances about it.Ms. Winter has an amazing gift for pulling the reader into the story. The characters are so real that sometimes I think I am one of them. The situations are unique yet universal in that they reveal inner truths about human nature. The settings are described naturally within the stories with just the right amount of detail.Ms. Winter's style is somewhat similar to that of Raymond Carver, yet there is a strong undertone of optimism that is greatly lacking from Mr. Carver's work. I am always enchanted by her main characters, and I feel great empathy for them as I read their stories.I am in AWE of this book."},{"Title":"The Price You Pay: Stories","review":"I loved this book.

She evokes believable characters and authentic scenery -- especially the heat and dryness of the Southwest. Each story is deep and enveloping.

The bibliography is as valuable as the book. The reason Ian Taylor is able to cover such a wide range of subjects, in such depth, is the list of hundreds of qualified proffessionals, whose works he cites. I have yet to find a case of him embellishing the facts in the original documents to make his point.Unfortunately this is a common practice on both sides of the debate, but I have gone to many of the documents that he has cited and have invariably found him to err on the side of caution. There are many great books available on the subject, but if you can only fit two books about The Creation onto your shelf, make them the Bible and IN THE MINDS OF MEN."},{"Title":"In the Minds of Men: Darwin and the New World Order","review":"Used in a class I took on origins, this book is an excellent foundational book to present the creationist side of the evolution-creation debate. It outlines the history of thought relating to evolution starting before Darwin and continuing to present day with speculation on future implications. Intertwined with the history of evolution is a history of ideas which contridict evolution, and various scientific facts and discoveries along those lines. Some generally little known facts about deceptions and misrepresentations by various early evolutionists, and shifts in evolutionary thought since Darwin's time are also mentioned. Many of the typical evolutionary arguments are discussed in detail, including the origin and problem of the arguments.The book itself is very well organized, with a detailed table of contents which includes chapter titles and subheadings. Subheadings are in italics in the text, and chapter headings appear at the top of the right hand pages. Notes and a bibliography appear at the end, as well as a detailed index. Illustrations and poitraits appear throughout the book. I have found the organization of the book handy for looking up facts I have wanted to refresh my memory on.This book is well written and well organized. I highly recommend it for both evolutionists and creationists, as it will provide good reference material for those in either camp of the evolution-creation debate. Even those who find they disagree with the author's premise will find many points to ponder."},{"Title":"In the Minds of Men: Darwin and the New World Order","review":"This was truly a delight to read.

An excellent creationist apologetic that asks the right questions about history and humanity thereby setting the right course for the objective viewing of the subjects involved. I really enjoyed the depth and quantity of insightful information the author used to draw out his conclusions. He was addressing questions that not everyone would think to ask. Also, it had the feel of a historical expose with its bits and pieces so tightly knit together into a singular focus, defining the issue and arriving at the Truth."},{"Title":"In the Minds of Men: Darwin and the New World Order","review":"This book has a great breadth and depth of information.On the one hand it is fascinating to read the historical perspective on the Creation/evolution debate. On the other hand it goes into sufficient scientific detail on issues such as the age of the earth to give a layman's understanding of the issues.It is an unfortunate fact that the current scientific evolutionary bias means that much evidence is ignored or belittled. Though creationist in tone, this book seemed to me to present the facts in an open and unbiased way.Equiped with such knowledge, one is able to recognise the bias and shallowness of certain information from some pro-evolution sources, such as the talk.origins faq. (I actually looked at both sources for information about a particular dating method. Suffice to say that I won't return to the faq when looking for full and unbiased information.)I anticipate that I will be using this book as an important reference book in the years to come."},{"Title":"In the Minds of Men: Darwin and the New World Order","review":"This book is great for writing class papers on evidence supporting Creation and the weaknesses of evolutionism.

The main focus is on the beliefs and doctrines that societies have followed throughout history. And how the beliefs and doctrines of society have shifted with every few generations. Most of these shifts are a direct result of education systems of the time. If you want to reform a society you start with the elite graduate students. When you have a handful of followers your reforms can then be spread easily to the young children in the early stages of the educational system. And thus educate society with your beliefs and doctrines. \\"...Educational success is the result of regurgitating opinions and statements that conform to the doctrines of the system.\\" Every time there has been a shift in the beliefs and doctrines of the system there have been new theories proposed that challenge the old theories. These new theories have typically been proposed by respected men with a highly educated background, many were highly respected members of the scientific community of their day.Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744 - 1829) proposed a theory that is known as Lamarckism today. It states that traits acquired by the present generation are passed on immediately to the following generation. Lamarckism would seem to explain why the giraffe has a long neck and why birds that live around water have webbed feet. A creature's size would be dependant on the size of its environment. Another idea based on this theory was that a man exercised his brain, his cranial capacity and the mass of his brain would increase. In a few cases this would be proven correct, but in the cases of some of the brilliant minds of science brain mass and cranial capacity have been far below what the expected value was. The classic experiment conducted by August Weismann with white mice. Weismann cut the tails off of nine hundred one white mice in five sequential generations. Each generation was born with a perfectly normal tail. If Lamarck's theory were correct then it would be a very short time before all interbreeding within a population would produce a species that was virtually identical in skin color, hair color, height, etc. If this were true we wouldn't have a problem with racism.Georges Cuvier (1769 - 1832) is the founding father of the science of paleontology and the cornerstone for scientific development to the French. Cuvier's work ethic and his expertise in a vast array of fields made him and his theories overly respected by the French. As a result Cuvier's theory of creation withstood the theory of evolution, in France, for most of the nineteenth century. The accepted opinion of his day was that fossil remains were a direct result of the Genesis flood. But further examination of the fossil records showed that some species would appear to become extinct and then reemerge in later layers. Cuvier's interpretation of this was that there had to have a series of catastrophes rather than just one as the Bible suggests. This began to cause the faith of some to waiver.This was the first theory to propose that the earth was much older than six thousand years. It stated that there had been a series of great catastrophes each wiping out all but the remote corners of the earth, this way life would still be preserved and the earth repopulated. The last of these great catastrophes being the Genesis flood. This theory still supported special creation, but questioned the Biblical time frame of history.Charles Lyell (1797 - 1875) never openly criticized the church or the theological convictions of his day. But his interpretation of geological evidence raised a question of doubt on the Biblical account of the Genesis flood. Lyell's theory is know as Uniformitarianism. There are four basic components to this theory. The first, is that all of nature's laws are constant. Along with this is the assumption that God has never violated nature's laws. Second, the earth's geological features were caused by the same processes of nature that we see today, this would exclude the possibility of large scale catastrophes. Lyell's third assumption was that all geological changes are slow, gradual, and steady. This again leaves no room for large scale catastrophes. And the fourth, proposed that a species could gradually evolve from one to another species. He suggested that the fossil record represented a \\"grand cycle,\\" this would allow a species to become extinct and then later revolve. This theory would require that the earth be millions of years old, which for some is much easier to believe. Modern geological interpretation is founded upon Lyell's first two assumptions, the third has been modified, and the fourth has been disregarded and forgotten.Uniformitarianism was seen by many of the church as the thin leading edge of a large wedge that was designed and would be used to undermine the Christian faith. As a result of his publications Lyell took a great amount of criticism from the church. His theories would soften the blows of the church and prepare the minds of the people for Darwin's theories, which would be published a few years later.Although Charles Robert Darwin (1809 - 1882) is given complete credit for the theory of evolution, some accused him of stealing his ideas form one of his contemporaries, Alfred Russel Wallace(1823 - 1913). Wallace and Darwin worked independently on a theory that would support evolution. Wallace seemed to have had perpetually bad luck throughout his career and this time his luck would only get worse. After twenty years of study on the subject of natural selection Darwin published his first edition of The Origin Of The Species in 1859.However Darwin's moment of truth was on June 30, 1860 at the Oxford meeting of The British Association For The Advancement Of Science. Darwin's first edition of The Origin Of The Species was cleverly placed in the hands of those that were sympathetic to the cause both in the church and in offices of the state. The public had been promised access to this, the second edition. By this time Darwin's health was poor and it prevented him attending this meeting. So Darwin appointed one of his contemporaries to speak for him, Thomas Huxley. Huxley proved to have been an excellent choice, he would speak on Darwin's behalf many times yet to come. His main motivation for promoting the theory of evolution was his hatred toward the clergy because of the fact that at that time the clergy had a much higher status than a scientist could ever hope of attaining. Huxley was willing to overlook the fact that he disagreed with Darwin on a few points regarding the theory of evolution for the chance to battle with the church in a public arena.Darwin's theory of evolution states that life began by spontaneously generation. That is to say that life randomly generated itself from nonliving matter. And these initial life forms were continuously evolving into more complex life forms, each generation passing on its developments to the next generation. This sounds very similar to Lamarckism, although Darwin denounced it openly and it is generally considered to be a false theory, it is still with us even today.By 1900 Darwin's theory of natural selection was found to be lacking, mainly because there has been no evidence that one species can become another by the accumulating minute variations. Breeding experiments have shown time after time that the species barrier cannot be crossed permanently. This in mind there is no actual proof for the theory of evolution. That is to say the evolution process has never been duplicated in a laboratory or even witnessed in the real world. And if there is no scientific proof for the theory of evolution, then it a belief system accepted on faith, faith based upon alleged scientific facts. These alleged facts are based upon data skewed to fit precreated theories. You might say that sounds a lot like special creation. Special creation requires faith that God created everything man will ever encounter on earth and throughout the universe. The difference is that facts have been twisted to fit the theory of evolution. Rather than first collecting all of the facts, examining them closely, and then after much contemplation deriving a theory from the evidence presented. Many of these discoveries leave holes that evolution cannot explain, whereas a large scale catastrophe such as the Genesis flood could explain. When science encounters two opposing theories that try to explain an event that cannot be explained by the current established theories then the simpler theory is generally accepted, until it can be proven wrong.Since Darwin's Origin (1859) there has been a consistent trend to interpret all natural phenomena in such a way that it appears to provide supporting evidence to the theory of evolution. Some of these interpretations have been based on faulty observation, some on faulty reasoning, and still some on blatant fraud. At times when theories have been discredited within the scientific community, they have been maintained as fact for the general public. To abandon these discredited theories without replacement could put evolutionists in a very humbling position, they would be at risk of having to accept the account of creation. One of the major reasons that evolution is accepted is that people have a hard time accepting something they cannot explain, the miraculous. Miracles instill at least two great fears in people, the first, the fear of God arbitrarily interfering with the affairs of man, and second, the fear of accountability after death.History has shown that man has tried to create a theory to explain away any need for there to be a God. Yet there are still some, even in the respected scientific community, that still acknowledge that there is a God and that the earth and all of its inhabitants were created by this God. They still believe in special creation despite all of this allegedly obvious evidence that supports the theory of evolution. As one writer put it: \\"God made man upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes.\\"Humanism is basically recognizes the value of the individual and seeks to better the human condition. Secular humanism is the predominant world view today. It views mankind as an integral part of nature and denies any idea of a human soul. Humanistic values are set by whatever has value for man. Morals and ethics become dependent upon situations and the existence of God is denied. To sum up Humanism is to say that man is supreme above all things and that he must create his own life. With this in mind natural man replaces God and becomes the master of his own destiny.Humanistic views deny the existence of a supreme God and all forms of Judeo-Christian religion. Since there is no God the Judeo-Christian principals that form the basis for our legal system could not have been God given. Therefore these laws can be changed to fit whatever any situation without the fear of divine retribution. This type of practice is the root of situation ethics. Humanists say that the reason that man appears to be bad is because, these \\"God given\\" laws have been imposed on mankind throughout history.The final objective of humanists is to implement a one world government, a new world order, with the elite humanists in control. One of the key elements in the concept of a one world government is the \\"unification in the things of the mind.\\" Humanistic views and principals have already been established so the next step is to introduce them into the school systems. And the elementary grades are where the minds of children will be the most receptive. Thus making \\"maximum progress in minimum time.\\" Humanists have seen to it that all Judeo-Christian religious values have been removed form the public school system, and have replaced them with the religious views and principals of humanism. This is a prime example of situation ethics. Preying upon the separation of church and state clause in or country's constitution.The only way church and state can truly be separated is if all forms of religion are introduced through the school system. If all forms of monotheistic religion are removed from the school system, there will still be atheism. In short all of the facts and theories should be presented objectively, and then let people chose for themselves which is the most believable.The author notes the reason for this book is to present facts andinformation to ordinary people. Not information that has been filteredby the humanists, but information that is presented in a objectiveformat. The book is very well documented, with twenty six pages offootnotes and nineteen pages references used by the author as a sourceof data for this book.Google - UN Agenda 21"},{"Title":"In the Minds of Men: Darwin and the New World Order","review":"This book is a must for anyone who wants to think seriously about the issue of origins.

Well written, more book than I imagined. An outstanding job of picking out inconsistencies and omissions from evolutionary science. Taylor raises many questions on the scientific data for evolution without being arrogant.Ian discusses the early philosophical influences and later scientists who paved the way and laid the seed for Darwinian evolution. Is \\"evolution the cause of the ills of the world, and the secular humanism that so dominates our culture? Is the church bringing in this thought into their doctrines?He claims Christianity and monotheism actually spur scientific thought. During the dark ages there was a loss of science. We had to rediscover the future. \\"How can astute scientists be so easily deceived\\", along with deceiving so many? \\"Scientists too are subject to the normal human failings.\\" \\"To think rationally and fairly is a simplistic myth.\\" There is a short biography on Darwin. The voyage on the \\"Beagle\\" helped transform him from creationist to evolutionist. There are many problems with evolution, which Taylor makes clear. \\"This will be defined by who sees the pseudo science for what it is.\\" Is this the murder of God?Evolution is a theory based on time and chance. The evolution proponents are willing to make discoveries fit this premise. Many are proven false as once truths. Some have still persisted for over a hundred years. Catastrophe can be the only explanation for the fossils. The fossil indexing to geological age is based on circular reasoning, not science. We will see variations in kind (species) but there are limits. The author goes in depth on carbon dating. Some still use radio metric dating. He explains dating is problematic and inconsistent. It is based on a rate of decay that has been constant.

She tells how to act and not act in foreign lands so as not to show rudeness toward the local customs. \\"As life at work becomes increasingly pressured, everyone needs to know more about improving interpersonal relations.\\"In Sunday's local paper, there was an article \\"Do clothes still make the man -- or woman?\\" in which a former chief deputy clerk in the District Court gives accounts of how the judges treated jury members and defendants who were not properly dressed according to his wishes. Ties were required as was dress wear instead of just being clean and properly groomed. He bases his account on the 'Andy Griffith show' which still plays on local television, and used Amy Vanderbilt's 1972 \\"Guide to Gracious Living\\" about how to greet people on the street. Well, he is an older man, granted, but he does not follow his own advice. I saw him coming out of the History Center on the main street of town, when he acknowledged he knew me, he turned and walked around the block so as not to have to converse with me. He critized the way people dress today in public and asks, \\"Whatever happened to class?\\" According to this volume, which is a bit outdated but not as much as the Vanderbilt guide he used, a woman should dress according to her profession.\\"You should dress professional\\" if they want to receive the admiration of the public they are purportedly representing. A man should never wear frayed shirt collars and cuffs. Her advice: \\"Know who you are\\" and dress accordingly. In the Northeast, you must never wear white shoes and accessories after Labor Day, but that doesn't apply to the South. A good rule for both sexes is \\"Never dress in clothes that are too tight; they make a thin person look gaunt and a large person twice as heavy.\\"When traveling abroad, remember that \\"white is the symbol of mourning in the Far East\\" so don't wear white and, when facing the possibility of having to remove your shoes in certain places, be sure you have brought some socks. \\"Loud colors are too conspicuous\\" unless, of course, you are in Hawaii or some exotic travel destination where others favor the bright designs. \\"Leave your flashy, loud-colored clothing at home.\\"When at a foreign meeting, \\"never hold a negotiation or any kind of important business meeting ... without supplying a good interpreter\\" and using the expertise of such. The current U.S. president Bush needed one in China recently when he said several inappropriate things and acted silly when he should have been at least pretending to be civilized, as the spokesman for this country.

As others have noted it may go beyond the needs of 90% of the high achievers. However, her coverage of the basics is through and very readable.Sadly we went through several generations where manners were seen as a sign of mindless conformance rather than the foundational courtsies and respect which make life more meaningful and rewarding.Part of the problem is that most people do not know both the importance of good manners and the essentials. In a business world increasingly diverse it is even more important.I have also recommended the book to undergraduate students leaving the more casual west for some of the more elite east coast schools. While on campus behavior will often follow the script of Animal House, a different set of expectations may hold if they visit their friend's families in the east.Most MBA students leave school deeply in debt, there's no use digging a deeper hole due to a lack of knowledge."},{"Title":"Letitia Baldrige's New Complete Guide to Executive Manners","review":"I will admit to not reading the updated version.

It's basically an introduction to the adobe creative suite, rather than a 'bible'. I have to say, I find it rather ineffective, trying to learn all these things at once, and the basic theme of the book, 'interconnectivity' is simple enough that you really don't need a book.I'm also a bit bothered by how much they seem to want to sell the idea of the adobe creative suite. There is no mention of other tools available in places where they admit adobe's products have shortcomings.Also, the paper is poor quality (what did I expect for the price?!).That said, if you're looking for a generalist, get your feet wet kind of hand-holding book, this could be a good one to buy, the examples are clear and easy to follow."},{"Title":"Adobe Creative Suite Bible","review":"This book is an overview of some of the most complicated software on the market. Photoshop alone deserves a book this large. There's no way the authors could hope to do much more than skim the surface of each of these powerful programs, so they focus on how they work together. As far as that goes, they're moderately successful. However, like Adobe Systems, they focus on a tiny segment of the market: graphics designers. They provide useful workflow ideas to independent graphics designers and to graphics studios. But those are hardly the only people who shell out nearly $1000 for Creative Suite. To read this book, one would think that nobody bought this suite in order to produce a book, technical manual, catalog, or anything else longer than a brochure or magazine. If you're looking for a way to get InDesign to behave like a grown-up publishing platform, get a book dedicated to InDesign and cross your fingers.InDesign, as of CS 1, is still not in a class with Quark and Frame. Its major competitive edge over these workhorses of technical publishing is a) ease of integration with the other members of the \\"suite\\", which Padova, et al cover fairly well, and b) ease of use in importing MS Word files. But it still falls short in quintessential tasks such as heading numbering, list numbering, indexing and cross-referencing. However, if your document can live without these elements, InDesign's integration with deployment tools such as Acrobat and GoLive is extremely useful.In short, consider carefully what you plan to produce before you shell out nearly fifty bucks for this book. If you're creating a book longer than, say fifty pages, with illustrations, tables of contents, numbered paragraphs, or an index, spend your money on a book devoted to InDesign. If all you need is a quick overview, refresher course, or an idea of how all these powerful programs work together, this book would be a good buy."},{"Title":"The Stolen Child: Aspects of Autism and Asperger Syndrome","review":"This title of this book is offensive, and the premises set forth in the beginning, reiterating old stereotypes about \\"changelings,\\" \\"stolen children,\\" fairy tales and poetry, leads one to think that the contents are prejudiced and out-of date. In fact, I checked, and the citations are mostly from the 1990s and earlier. Much has been written since then debunking the \\"theory of mind\\" theory, showing that Autistic children (and adults) are *not* without empathy, that echolalia and repetition serve functional purposes. The \\"devastating inner disability\\" rhetoric is what *promotes* bullying and mistreatment, not only on the playground but at the hands of parents, educators, and other well-intentioned but misinformed people. This sort of language in a book that is purporting to HELP people is misinformation with a bit of a maudlin bent-\\"for the world's more full of weeping than he can understand.\\" from the WB Yeats epigraph sets the tone for the 5 introductory pages I can see in this review, filled with every imaginable stereotype of autism. The observable behaviors that Autistics display are treated dismissively and mostly referenced as inconvenient for people around them, magnifying the behavior, speculating about what each behavior could mean and always dramatizing it in the most negative light possible. I suggest, after reading this book, that readers look farther afield and consider some of the writings by Autistic adults. Autistic children grow up to be Autistic adults, so it would behoove parents reading this to learn as much as possible from actual Autistic people. I also recommend, if later chapters in the book lose the high-drama tone, posting some of them here so that potential buyers can find out whether the entire book is written in this vein.

As you can see from the rating I've given it, The Wine Lover Cooks With Wine is a winner.In his earlier book, the Wine Lover's Cookbook (which I also like a lot), the author's premise was that you had a special bottle of wine and wanted to make a dish that would complement it. This one is similar, in that wine is an inextricable part of the meal. Primarily it's an ingredient, though each recipe also has two what-to-drink recommendations to accompany it, which may not be the same as the wine used in cooking. (For instance, the Asian eggplant salad, which I'm apt to make as \\"what to take to the Fourth of July BBQ,\\" suggests serving either sake or riesling.)I think the author was stretching his definitions in a few places, because some recipes use only a little wine; that is, don't expect that you'll neccesarily be pouring 2 cups of expensive stuff into your dinner.However, the \\"about wine\\" portion of this book isn't the key ingredient, so to speak. It's about cooking, and this is a REALLY nice cookbook. Some of the recipes sound fancy, as though you'd be likely to find them in the kind of white-tablecloth restaurant where the waiters speak in hushed tones and begin by asking, \\"Would you like sparkling or still water with your meal?\\"However, most of the recipes are, if not dead easy, simple enough for you to make on a weeknight for the family, and delicious enough for them to say \\"Wow!\\" For example, I made \\"Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Spicy Orange-Port Reduction,\\" served with his recommendation of cinnamon-scented couscous. (But not the wine, which happened to be Zinfandel or Merlot; as it turns out, I've made most of the recipes at lunchtime, when I have to go back to work afterwards. Darnit.) This is essentially a \\"marinate and then brown the meat, create a pan sauce, and reduce\\" recipe. You've done that plenty of times, but with less interesting liquids.Best of all, this is an inexpensive cookbook; at least half the recipes have useful and attractive photos, too, which are rather inspiring."},{"Title":"The Wine Lover Cooks with Wine: Great Recipes for the Essential Ingredient","review":"Wine/food lover Goldstein offers yet another excellent collection of wine recipes, this time though emphasizing wine as ingredient, even the likes of mirin, marasala, et al.It is the perfect marinade, braising liquid, deglazer, etc. Wine has thus become the essential ingredient, and this book has the recipes to prove.With each recipe there is wine to drink with selection as well as alternative, many times not the wine ingredient used. Most every recipe has its own wonderful full color photo, sometimes two. There is even delightful side dishes and desserts as well.This is sophisticated, creative and balanced for max flavor: Pork Chops Stuffed with Stilton, Currants and Pistachios with Port Sauce; Monkfish Tagine; Goat Cheese and Roasted Garlic Timbales; Maytag Blue Cheese Polenta Cylinders; Spiced Berry Martinis with Pinot Noir Syrup and Star Anise Ice Cream.Beautiful volume to give or use."},{"Title":"The Wine Lover Cooks with Wine: Great Recipes for the Essential Ingredient","review":"Organized by technique - Sauces, Steaming, Marinating, Braising - Goldstein's (\\"The Wine Lover's Cookbook) colorful book encourages wine lovers to jump from the glass into the pan with Seared Peppercorn and Spice Crusted Rib-Eye, Portuguese Steamed Clams with Sausage, Asian Eggplant Salad, Grilled Quail in Red Onion Escabeche, Monkfish Tagine and Drunken Chocolate Cake with Port.The classics are here too: Coq au Vin, Onion Soup, Braised Beef short Ribs, Port-Poached Pears, and the blend of modern international dishes and homey classics strikes a charmingly sophisticated note.

The family has never been to a waitress based restaurant where a person serves the meal. Not long after that William knows he has obtained the American dream as he relocates to Oregon as a middle class worker.However, Joey also realizes that leaving impoverished Fresno did not remove the stereotype label of Latino gang member. While Joey performs at his new school in the role of punk hood, William struggles with the darker side of the American dream that he finds lacks substance. Already known for his temper though he always controlled his fists, his anger may break his family apart if he does not learn to control his growing wrath.This is an intriguing character study that takes an extremely dark look at the impact of the American dream on one?s roots. The story line is driven by the five Molinas as readers get a close look at each of them and through them aspects of the Mexican-American culture. Daniel Chacon paints a deep tale that makes the case that assimilation is not all that it seems.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"and the shadows took him: A Novel","review":"Wow! A creative blend of reality, tragedy, and comedy generated from changes in one's physical, cultural, and social location. Chacon shows how Chicanos change from minor personalities in a Chicano-rich location to mini-celebrities in a Chicano-poor location based on concocted and unconfronted information from all members of society. What we are culturally can be greatly influenced by our immediate society. A Chicano in Fresno, California may become \\"more\\" Chicano or \\"less\\" Chicano in Medford, Oregon depending on others' perceptions or one's reinvented personhood.Chacon is particularly brilliant in showing how \\"success\\" in the individual and the family creates paths and desires that benefit, harm, or significantly restructure the individual and family. A small but significant aspect of \\"success\\" centers on having a command of language for the group one desires or needs to fit into-this combined with a general wit for language makes one powerful.Like the characters in \\"And the Shadows Took Him,\\" I grew up in Fresno when it was the murder capital for years. Coming from Fresno and being a person of color was a two-edged sword, ascribing me with either favorable or unfavorable value based on whom I was interacting with and my location. Fresno was so violent for a period of time that a friend I was visiting gave me a tour of Oakland late into the night, assuring me that it was OK because \\"This isn't Fresno.\\" Chacon deftly incorporates such experiences into his Chicano characters but with the added twist of a lengthy stay, a stay in which the characters not only gain unfamiliar power but also lose familiar power when inserted into a predominantly white community.Chacon also bravely confronts how such changes both amplify and reveal problems within a Chicano family. Previously \\"acceptable\\" violence in the family, set within new social constraints and freedoms, are transformed into unacceptable forms or more revealing forms. A move to a new domain changes one into something else that one may or may not like.A prominent feature of \\"And the Shadows Took Him\\" is Chacon's ambushing witticisms that draw craftily from the narrative. The witticisms were signposts reminding me that I had remembered and organized much more of the novel than I realized. I found myself either commenting or laughing aloud at the coffee shop and bookstore despite my efforts to read silently. This subtle feature reveals Chacon's mastery and forethought.I was left with a pleasant experience of generating additional pages in my mind beyond the final word of the final chapter, like being satiated from dinner but with room to ponder possible desserts."},{"Title":"and the shadows took him: A Novel","review":"\\"and the shadows took him\\" by Daniel Chacon is a wonderful novel. A bit of J.D. Salinger, a touch of Saroyan, a taste of Gary Soto, but all Chacon. His characters are true. His prose is clean and sure. A novel that can be enjoyed by all cultures.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"and the shadows took him: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed reading Daniel Chacon's \\"and the shadows took him.\\" What struck me most about the novel was how well Chacon weaves in the humanity of his characters (their pains, hungers, wants) within the narrative. The family in the novel feels so real to me-- and there's a kind of aching to the Molina family that makes me attach to them, that makes me want things for them as I would want for myself.And so much in this novel is funny: the horseradished dinner scene, the acting cows, etc. But what really strikes me is that behind even the funniest ones (the method actor going \\"Moo. Moo. Moo.\\",),behind the carefully woven wit, there's still always a seriousness, even in subtlety. In that seriousness, we see Joey Molina as well... a real boy... not just as a symbol for a culture or for a kind of person, but a real person fraught with both immense flaws and immense possibilities-- his desires are real, and so is he.When I read a book, I have to admit, one of the things I want is for the writing to allow me to be completely immersed in that \\"little world made cunningly,\\" as John Donne would say. And \\"and the shadows took him\\" is not only crafted cunningly, but with love. I say this because despite the violences, despite the ability of the characters to fall upon their own flaws so great that as we read it our knuckles whiten, gripping the book and turning it page after page, and on the edge of our seats, still, it's always evident that Chacon lets his characters be who they really are. And not what he as an author wants them to be, or a more directive reader wants, or what the genre wants.I like that. I like it a lot, because the Molinas in this novel are not simply characters to me, but human beings, with real human flaws. Because I've read this book, they're like friends now, or family-- their lives so well told that they've unfolded, breathless in the landscape.Chacon allows this through a lot of craft, where the interplay between humor and... danger, the threatening aspects of culture, of growing up, of subculture... make the novel's little world, its landscape, whole.I really really recommend this book. It's light and funny if you're looking for entertainment, but it's also got that necessary truth to it that I know I look for in everything I'm reading. It's the kind of book that I will read again, and again, and again, because I know that every time I choose to enter that landscape, it will be real, whole, and have something important to say-- each time.I plan on ordering his other book, Chicano Chicanery today. I can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"and the shadows took him: A Novel","review":"I read a lot of novels. Many are good reads. Some, of course, are really bad, even horrible. I'm sure you readers know this, too. Then there are truly fulfilling novels like \\"and the shadows took him,\\" by Daniel Chacon. This novel is not only a great story, but written extremely well. Chacon is a master at his craft. You, readers, will not be disappointed.If you are like me, the title, \\"shadows,\\" will be the first thing that will capture your attention before you open the novel. Chacon's use of shadow and light in his descriptions, how it works and plays with mood and tension within the novel, will assure you that the author has complete control. I would love to ruin the end of this novel, to give you the most powerful example of this control over image, the author's use of shadows, but I will be fair and only tell you that the novel leads to an amazing ending--a final image that I promise will stay with you well after you set the book down.The story follows the Molinas, a family that finds itself, suddenly, as middle class, moving to the predominately white town of Medford, Oregon, away from their lower income neighborhood in Fresno. Here we meet William, the father and subject of most of the tension in the novel; Joey, the youngest son and main character; Rachel, the beautiful mother; Veronica, the daughter and oldest child; and Billy, the oldest son. I love the way these characters are completely distinct from each other. Well after you read this novel, even if you forget the characters names, you will certainly remember the image of each of these characters.I can't say enough good things about \\"and the shadows took him.\\" Read it."},{"Title":"and the shadows took him: A Novel","review":"What else can be said that hasn't already been expressed by these other great reviewers before me?

I was especially dissapointed because I really liked Chacon's first book, Chicano Chicanery. In fact I liked the short story collection so much that when And the Shadows Took Him came out I bought a copy right away and enthusiastically began reading. Unfortunately, however, I was only able to get about half way through before being overcome by boredom. I put the book aside, and am just finishing it now-- two years later! In my opinion, the plot is convoluted and the prose flat; there just wasn't much to hold my attention. I think Chacon really hit the sophmore slump with this one. Hopefully he'll be able to recapture the old Chicano Chicanery magic in his next work."},{"Title":"and the shadows took him: A Novel","review":"Daniel Chacon's new novel is good.

In the beginning, the boy's teacher insists that he get to know the mentally retarded boy he has been mocking (along with everyone else in town, including the parents). You would think, therefore, that Kin Platt is making the statement with the book that we should try to overcome prejudicial fears of people who are different, but the ending of the book undermines this idea completely. Seemingly BECAUSE he befriended the mentally retarded boy, the protagonist loses his mind, giving readers the idea that the entire bigoted village was correct in shunning the boy, because apparently mental retardation is contagious! I'm sure Kin Platt meant to argue that infuriation at intolerance drove the protagonist mad, but in my youthful mind, the argument ended on a strange note of paranoiac warning: \\"beware, and avoid those who are different than yourself: what they are is contagious!\\""},{"Title":"Hey Dummy","review":"I thought this book was interesting because it gives you all the things that you want to read about. You get mystery, suspence, action , and some parts that are funny. Then again it also is very odd at times. Overall I recomend this book to others."},{"Title":"Hey Dummy","review":"I thought this was one lousy book as a child and I think it is one lousy book as an adult. I can save you folks a little time right now by warning you in advance of what you will come into.The main character is a boy who baits a severely retarded peer. He calls the boy &quot;Dummy&quot; and uses him as a subject of an English composition. His teacher naturally calls him on his cruelty and insists that he get to know the boy he calls Dummy. Comstock, the protagonist does and in so doing learns that that boy has a truckload of problems -- an autistic sister, a mother who works for crumbs in a bakery and no other adult or back up to be found.Comstock has horrible parents. They compare him to the ghost of his dead brother, crab at him when he accepts his $2.00 allowance instead of demanding more (what a weird parental wish) and constantly hound and belittle him and his sister, Susie. Susie is the only character one can like. She accepts everyone including the boy called Dummy. Her stupid parents think the boy is dangerous and forbid her or Comstock to have any further contact with them. The mother mocks the boy and tells Susie he is bad. Susie laughs at the sheer madness of anyone thinking that boy is dangerous. The stupid mother slaps her and turns on Comstock, saying, &quot;By rights, mister, I should have given that one to you.&quot; That mother belonged in the wastebasket.The end was simply unfinished business.

It's well illustrated with character designs, partial storyboard reproductions -- overall it's a very slickly designed book. What you shouldn't expect is a very in-depth look at the production of the series OR extensive interviews with the production team of Batman Beyond (BB).This book is far more reminiscent of Aeon Flux: The Herodotus File more than anything else with brief character bios and a synopsis of the entire first season episodes (13 of 'em) of Batman Beyond.Even if you don't like the overall direction of the Batman Beyond stories, you have to admit the character designs are very well done.This book, in my opinion is about three-and-a-half stars (although Amazon doesn't do half-stars) and a worthy addition to the collection of Batfreaks and animation fans."},{"Title":"Batman Beyond Files","review":"This book seems to be a BATMAN ANIMATED for a younger audience. It's a useful collection of things related to the first season of BATMAN BEYOND but not as rich as ANIMATED. There are some model sheets, some background paintings, some storyboards, some scenes from the episodes, and a couple of pages from the DC comics, but these things are used only as design elements, not presented as information in themselves. But don't get me wrong. It still has useful descriptions of the Batsuit's capabilities, illustrations of the main characters (including the villains, though Blight, for some reason, gets short shrift), and synopses of the episodes. Personally, I would have preferred more model sheets and some synopses from the second season.

He starts with the face of God (what God looks like), divine providence (God's care for our lives), then what God sees and wills (God's control of everything) and goes into other facets of our relationship with God, always writing with clarity, holiness, and profundity and always taking us back to the very simple truths about the nature of God and man. It is a beautiful beautiful book. The part describing God's face is one of the most beautiful I have come across in religious writing. Guardini is very very deep, but not at all frightening. I highly recommend this book. He is an excellent guide into the mysteries of faith."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"This was an excellent read and balanced the doubts and beliefs of Catholicism and Communism.

A road trip full of adventure, philosophical and spiritual debate and unexpected friendships ensues when a newly promoted Monsignor leaves his small town parish in the company of the ex-Mayor who is a committed follower of Marx and Lenin. This is an engaging and cleverly conceived odd couple pairing in the hands of a master. Entertaining and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"\\"Monsignor Quixote,\\" (1982), is a 250 page, novella length, yet powerful late work by the widely admired British author Graham Greene. It is gentle, charming, life-affirming, and very Catholic. It surely makes an odd contrast with the novel written immediately before, DR FISCHER OF GENEVA that is bitter, cynical, and angry.The title character, an aging priest in the small Spanish town of El Toboso, on the main road to Valencia, persists in claiming descent from Don Quixote, protagonist of the Spanish author Miguel Cervantes' famous influential 16th century fiction of the same name (DON QUIXOTE). But Father Quixote's fascist-leaning bishop (the notorious 20th century fascist dictator, Francisco Franco is dead, but his followers still crowd Spain), finds that to be only one of Quixote's character traits that the bishop strongly dislikes. Even so, as a result of the fact that an Italian monsignor has been wandering around Spain, and Quixote has been unfailingly helpful, courteous and hospitable to him, the church hierarchy in Rome has made Quixote a monsignor (a higher rank in the church), without seeking Quixote's bishop's input or approval. The bishop is furious. So Quixote decides to take a time-out before taking up his new duties. He saddles up his ancient car that he calls Rocinante, after Quixote's horse, and loads up the back seat with the local \\"honest Manchegan wine.\\" In a plot clearly meant to echo Cervantes's DON QUIXOTE, the priest sets out on his journey, accompanied by the Communist ex-mayor of the town, who has just been defeated at the polls. The priest calls the ex-mayor Sancho, after the squire Sancho Panza, who accompanied Don Quixote on his famous journey. (Both men bear Spanish surnames considered to be quite similar to those of their earlier fictional counterparts.) Their journey takes them around the back roads of Spain, where they are continually harassed by the local Guardia Civil--the police--who also, apparently, still follow the late Spanish dictator, the fascist Franco.In these pages, the author continues his quest to explore moral and theological dilemmas through psychologically astute character studies and exciting drama on an international stage. Like most of Greene's prodigious output, I believe 56% or so, and many source novels and stories done more than once, this novel was filmed, under the same name,Monsignor Quixote [Region 2] as an all-star production, giving us Sir Alec Guinness, Leo McKern, Ian Richardson, Graham Crowden, and Maurice Denham.Graham Greene (1904-1991) was one of the most illustrious British writers of the 20th century. He enjoyed a very long life, most of the century, and a very long, prolific writing career, during which he gave us THE POWER AND THE GLORY, THE END OF THE AFFAIR, and OUR MAN IN HAVANA, among many others. The author's books were very well-written, highly literate; much praised by the critics, and enjoyed a wide readership; they were frequently best sellers. The writer was also one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption, as this book surely does. Greene, who also worked as a screenwriter, always created a tight thriller, in a lean, realistic style that boasted almost cinematic visuals. If you'd like just a little \\"tapas\\" (taste) of the man's work, you can't go wrong here."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"A book I read before I read Cervantes' original, yet still appreciated greatly. The images are vivid, and the people are somehow funny and beautiful and profound at the same time. Graham Greene certainly is one of the best writers I have ever experienced"},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"I was surprised to read all the adulatory reviews ofthis book and the great length reviewers went toin analyzing this mediocre work.I don't feel it merits the analysis nor praise.Greene was 80 when he wrote this and authors needto retire by this age.The story is about a priest and a communist mayor who are depicted as modern day analogues of Don Quixote sharing the same names as the original Cervantes' novel's characters even their car is named Rocinante the same as Don Quixote's horse. Through them Greene tries to explore catholicism and communism-things apparently near and dear to his heart.The story mainly lets off a lot of steam about the abuses of the Franco era of Spain--. This 200 page story covering such monumental topics is basically an empty suit--a sad ending to Greene's works.The aura and quality of the story reminded me of the Obama's cabinet officer who said her most admired people were Mao and Mother Teresa--this book too isa bit of a name dropping exercise--Des Cartes etc...One example of a non starter idea. The priest Monsignor Quixote is said to have never experienced a single carnal idea in his life..?? Greene has lost at 80 what it takes to spin a good insightful yarn.Being Greene there are still some gems and insights but they are very few and far between.In general I avoid late works by really talented authors...Travels With Charlie (Steinbeck) is another unreadable work. Oddly enough Steinbeck also names his truck Rocinante....the intellectual pretense of knowing Cervantes must be very powerful."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"This is my first Greene book and I liked it so much I'm now going to read all of his works. This delightful tale tells of the travels of a newly minted Monsignor Quixote and his Sancho Panza, the Communist former mayor of a small town. Through their wanderings the pair discuss important life and faith issues. I agree with another reviewer's observation that the book seems to be an argument between Greene and himself. Not only am I going to read more Greene, but I have just bought Cervantes' Don Quixote, which I had never read. This is a highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"Although I'm a big fan of almost all Greene's work, this is definitely one of his more accessible pieces. The tone is light and easy to read (and the book is not that long), even as it maintains thoughtful discussions throughout. It mirrors Don Quixote's absurdist tone, although it remains a distinctly Greene work with its intensely personal and conflicted feelings on Catholicism. A definite must for Greene fans, highly recommended for Quixote fans, and a good read for anyone wanting a quick, entertaining, yet thoughtful read."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"I found Monsignor Quixote to be a uniquely pleasant experience in a dark-humor fashion. The mixture of Spain after the rebellion, a communist and a priest provided a very interesting means of comparison of the similarities of communist and catholic politics of controlling the individual with the realities of the people who had to live with them. I found the priest's description of the Trinity to be one of the best yet - logical and understandable."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"In \\"Monsignor Quixote\\" Graham Greene is at his best yet again regaling us with his infectious humor. The book compares favorably to Greene's other entertainments like \\"Travels with My Aunt\\" and one of my favorite short stories \\"A Shocking Accident,\\" (Read it. You'll be glad you did). Father Quixote, a bumbling priest, and Sancho Panza, a former communist mayor of the village, are the protagonists in this comical tale that takes place in 1960s Spain. Following father Quixote's hospitality for a high-ranking Italian bishop and an assortment of amusing events, he's promoted to the title of monsignor to the utter surprise of his local bishop who considers him an idiot. To purchase purple socks and bib, insignia of a monsignor, father Quixote and Sancho head to Madrid on the priest's car named Rocinante after the steed in \\"Don Quixote.\\" On the trip they bring along plenty of food and wine to abet their conversation. Father Quixote is a humble man who is oblivious to temptation, mistakes a condom for a balloon, has never seen a porno and is surprised to know he's staying in a brothel. His only excess is considering himself a descendant of Don Quixote. If one's familiar with Cervantes' masterpiece one would notice the parallels in the book's plot. Unlike traditional Catholic priests, father Quixote is beset by doubts about faith, love, temptation and forgiveness that often test his faith. I rate \\"Monsignor\\" higher than \\"Travels\\" which was a romp with \\"Our Man in Havana\\" a distant third. Read the first 30 pages.

And I do mean, divine. It's hard to find the words to praise Greene enough. His novels are so well executed, so elegantly written, so touching and so unexpectedly changing. They read easily, are very accessible. This book references DON QUIXOTE by Miguel de Cervantes, so I was doubly engaged here, as I had just read it. This book is about a priest, Father Quixote, who lives in El Toboso, Spain. Through a happenstance act of kindness to a man in power in the Catholic Church in Rome, Father Quixote is made a Monsignor, much to his bishop's dismay. His bishop has never liked Father Quixote. Due to his &quot;promotion&quot; Father Quixote has some time to take for himself, and leaves El Toboso with the town's former mayor, who has lost his re-election bid, whose last name is Panza, just like the famous Don Quixote's squire, Sancho, so Father Quixote calls his friend Sancho. Like the first and second sally in Cervantes, Monsignor Quixote and Sancho go forth in the world and have adventures. What I found wonderful about this book was the discussion between these two men about Communism and religion. They trade books and references, and argue principles lightly and engagingly. What is true about both men as Greene writes them is that they are loving people. Sancho is more cynical, but he is kind and is genuinely friends with Monsignor Quixote, and the monsignor, for his part, is truly loving, naive and true. The end of the book is a surprising and stunningly beautiful apotheosis of the ideas expressed within. This is one of my favorite works by Greene, and reminded me in some ways of the life-changing END OF THE AFFAIR. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"If I had to choose just one Graham Greene book to take to a desert island then this would be it.

This book is beuatifully written and deeply touching. I think it is Greene's most underrated novel."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"This is one of Greene's stories about faith. Monsignor Quixote is a priest in a small Spanish village, promoted to monsignor after a visit by a traveling bishop. The bishop also sends Quixote out from his small village, on a journey paralleling that of his namesake. Quixote is accompanied by the village's communist ex-mayor, known as Sancho. And of course, they travel in Quixote's car, Rocinante.Much of the story is a dialogue between Quixote and Sancho, exploring on one side Quixote's faith in catholicism and on the other Sancho's in communism. Greene himself had converted to catholicism and later become interested in communism, but may have been disillusioned by both by the time of this book (1982). The dialogue between Quixote and Sancho is Green's own dialogue with himself about faith. What Quixote gets, and what sets him, in quixotic-fashion, against the catholic officials, is that faith destroys itself when it becomes certainty. Certainty is mechanical, deterministic, without challenge. Faith is constantly challenged, constantly tempted, requiring active belief to maintain. As he says, \\"How can I pray to resist evil when I am not even tempted? There is no virtue in such a prayer.\\"Quixote tries to convey his insight to Sancho as their conversation and their adventures unfold. Sancho of course responds that a communist must act; he can never remain suspended between belief and doubt. You must act with certainty, regardless of doubts. In the end Sancho and Quixote have found their common ground -- Quixote reads the Communist Manifesto and finds it surprisingly conformable in some ways to his faith, and Sancho recalls his catholic youth, and even, at the end of the story, accepts a kind of communion from Quixote, maybe a communion in ideals.Quixote's journey ends in an ambiguous self-destruction, similar to Cervantes' Quixote. He appears, to the catholic officials, to have lost his mind, but, to himself, he is practicing the ideals of Christianity, what he has learned by reading and reflecting on his books, just as Cervantes' Quixote read and reflected on books of chivalry."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"Some consider this GG's last Catholic novel. This is irrelevant. It is a story of brotherly love and faith vs.reality. Father Quixote, a descendant of Cervantes's confused hero, lives in El Toboso, far from La Mancha. He repairs the car of a visiting Italian priest, oiling and greasing his hands to save the Italian from the embarrassment of simply having run out of gas. Grateful, back in Rome, the Italian convinces the Pope to make Quixote a Monsignor. But a Monsignor needs purple sox, so off go Quixote and his friend Sancho, the Communist ex-mayor of El Taboso in Quixote's 20-year-old decrepit car, Rosinante,. Along the route, the friends stop often to debate Christ vs. Marx and drink numerous bottles off Madigan wine. But Quixote hides, then blesses a small-time robber, attracting the attention of the Guardia Civil. The liason between the Catholic Church and the computerized Gardia permeates much of the novel. Once in Madrid, Sancho takes Quixote to a pornographic movie. Quixote laughs at the amorous scenes, but later wonders if he understands reality. Eventually arrested, Quixote is returned to El Toboso, where he is disliked by his successor, Father Herrera, the bishop, and the archbishop. Rescued by Sancho, the friends set out to find some place of refuge in post-Franco Spain. They go to Galicia and a Trappist Monastery. In a nearby village a festival is being held, and a bunch of nouveau riche Mexicans vie for the honor of carrying Our Lady. But Quixote is incensed that the statue is covered with paper, onto which high-peseta notes, dollar bills, etc. have been pinned. He rips off the paper, tossing the money into the crowd. Quixote is now guilty of another crime, Disrupting a Procession. The Guardia shows up and shoots Quixote, who, now delusional, blesses Sancho. After the death of his beloved friend, Sancho crosses the Duoro River into Portugal."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"As someone says on the cover of my edition, the dialogue between the Catholic priest and the Marxist mayor is really Greene talking to Greene. The wonderful Mr. Greene. Rather left leaning in his time and a converted Catholic, one might expect a little propaganda on the subject. But no, Mr. Greene has the honesty, and the intellectual insight, to describe both the strengths and the flaws of these two religions. And of course their common link: a strict, overpowering, bureaucracy. For Father Herrera and the Bishop are not unlike thousands of other aparatchiks, hungry for power and blindly following the faith.On the other hand the Monsignor and the Mayor are a bit faithless, allowing for, in some cases thankful for, the existence of doubt. They are tolerant. And it is this tolerance that brings them together and allows their friendship to blossom. Tolerance....and a good deal of wine. In the end, of course, the bureaucrats win and both the Mayor and the Monsignor must escape.This is one of Mr. Greene's lighter novels, lighter even than &quot;Travels with my Aunt&quot;. The characters are relaxed, the scenes are picturesque and slow, and there is enough nice dry humor you make you laugh out loud. It's the Greene equivalent of Champagne, light, pleasant and mildly intoxicating. This compared to his other novels which are straight vodka. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"A small-town priest (Toboso, where Don Quixote's beloved comes from) meets an Italian bishop, who promotes him to the degree of Monsignor. Before assuming his new responsibilities, he and the Marxist ex-mayor of Toboso, &quot;Sancho&quot; decide to take the car and travel around Spain. As they go along, they have several adventures and discuss about their respective views on religion and life. Although it is not a pretentious or &quot;profound&quot; novel, it touches the subjects of tolerance and, above all, the possibility of people being friends even if they have disagreements on their basic views of the world and the humankind. Or, if not friends, at least people can coexist peacefully. It really surprised me how much this book reminds me of another fine literary work -in my view, superior to this one- which constantly and funnily elaborates on this same subject: &quot;The world of Don Camillo&quot;, by Giovanni Guareschi. This one is about a small village in post-war Italy, where Don Camillo, the local priest, and Pepone, the communist mayor, interact through the years. I have reviewed it for Amazon.com, and I think the basic conclusion if similar to that of Monsignor Quixote. Summarizing, this novel by Graham Greene is really good, not so much for the &quot;literature&quot; it has, but for the meaning and significance of its subject. It is a pity that few people read it. Moreover, it is yet another proof that Cervantes' masterpiece is and will remain alive, with good writers going over and over to its central characters, structure and theme."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"Graham Greene is simply fantastic. This is a novel I waited a long time to read. I actually read Cervantes' &quot;Don Quixote&quot; first, in the very edition Greene cites, J.M. Cohen's translation in the Penguin Classics, so that I could pay adequate respect to Greene, and the spirit of his work.Persecuted by self-doubt at being promoted to the clerical rank of monsignor, Father Quixote, a parish priest of El Toboso, and 'Sancho' Zancas, the former mayor of the town, go for a holiday before undertaking the next phase of their lives. In a novel concerned with trying to differentiate between fact and fiction, certainty and doubt, the two must leave the shelter of comfortable, structured belief and challenge each other's resolve, as well as gauge the world's response to those beliefs. Over the course of their adventures, they drink bottle upon bottle of wine and talk about their lives and their belief systems, Catholicism and Marxism, respectively.In &quot;Monsignor Quixote&quot;, Greene does a marvelous job creating complex, realistic, and emotionally involving characters. His Quixote and Sancho are indeed what one might expect if Cervantes' characters had descendants living in the mid-20th century. The novel, like that of Cervantes, achieves its brilliance through dialogue, with little attention to physical descriptions, aside from what is absolutely necessary to form an image.I do not recall the last time so short a work (it is barely over 200 pages) gave me such cause to laugh, weep, and think so deeply. Though Greene's tone may favour Catholic sentiment, it is far from orthodox, and fit for a literate and thoughtful audience. My only problem with the novel upon finishing it was that it was not much, much longer."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"Listening to Monsignor Quixote, (unabridged on audio casette) I found myself instantly transported into the company of these remarkable characters. Green is a master of both dialogue and symbolism. This is the best G. Green work I have yet experienced."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"Disclosure: the following review originally featured at my Catholic website and comes from a Catholic perspective.For centuries now, our world has been increasingly filled by purely humanistic culture. And the majority of what we regard as great literature turns on very worldly themes. In the novels of Jane Austen or E. M. Forster for instance, we do not have profound explorations of Divine Grace in our lives, nor matters of the Faith.But from late 1930's till the 1950's, a notable exception to this trend could be found in the Catholic novels by one of the great literary figures of the last century: Graham Greene.Monsignor Quixote is a much, much later novel. Some traditional Catholics might question my approbation of this work. For after the early great Catholic novels, Greene appeared to lose his faith. This late novel is quite different then, and contains what could appear superficially, as little but sarcastic liberal jibes against the Faith.I have also heard it remarked that with his loss of faith, the power of Greene's novels diminished. Now I will not deny that compared toThe Power and the Glory (Penguin Classics), Monsignor Quixote is lacking. Yet The Power and the Glory is the most important and mighty novel this writer has ever read.Compared to the towering insight and depths of pathos of that tour de-force, much (if not all!) of Monsignor Quixote is like a gentle, comedic stroll.But how much do such comparisons matter?Must Shakespeare produce a Hamlet every time he steps up to the bat?For if Monsignor Quixote is not on the same niveau as The Power and the Glory - it is also very far from lacking merit.It is perhaps unfortunate then, that Monsignor Quixote invites comparison to the earlier masterpiece - for it contains certain muted echoes of that book. There the leading characters are an alcoholic Mexican priest hunted for his life by a Communist officer bent on eradicating all the priests. Here the setting is immediate post-Franco Spain and the protagonists are an unlikely Monsignor and a Communist Mayor who are also being hunted.What results is a series of misadventures - comic, tragic and studded with gems. The Monsignor emerges with a piercing, genuine sweetness that perhaps only a great novelist like Greene could render. (With lesser talents, the result could easily have been cloying.) But here we find real human beauty in an inept yet noble priest enamoured of Saint Francis de Sales and Saint Therese de Lisieux. The Communist of course, is devoted to Marx and Lenin, though like most Spaniards, he had once been a practising Catholic ...The two of course represent the different sides of the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War and the Spanish dedication and passion for these very different ideals may surprise. At least, my experience of the Anglo -American sphere, is that we British and Americans are often not used to meeting serious proponents of either such Catholicism or Communism ...I will not deny that there are sarcastic \\"Communist\\" and liberal passages here that dismay me. I warn those who are faithful that there is material here, which may offend what they know to be true in their hearts. Still those like myself can gain understanding and insight into a very different world - which is no bad thing.Some might even see in this late novel a rejection of Faith - but I do not think so. In fact, I think there is evidence here, that Greene may be slowly recovering his earlier faith - albeit in a tortured way which, filled as it is with doubt and paradox, is perhaps all-the-more heroic.Faith - the real meaning of that word is indeed key to this book. And on this theme, there is a JEWEL so precious here that it merits quoting in full. In the novel, the Monsignor becomes deeply disturbed by a nightmare:\\"Sleep continued to escape him, while the terrible dream of his siesta stayed with him like a cheap tune in the head.He had dreamt that Christ had been saved from the Cross by the legion of angels to which on an earlier occasion the Devil had told Him that he could appeal.So there was no final agony, no heavy stone which had to be rolled away, no discovery of an empty tomb. Father Quixote stood there watching on Golgotha as Christ stepped down from the Cross triumphant and acclaimed.The Roman soldiers, even the centurion, knelt in His honor, and the people of Jerusalem poured up the hill to worship Him. The disciples clustered happily around. His mother smiled through her tears of joy.There was no ambiguity, no room for doubt and no room for faith at all. The whole world knew with certainty that Christ was the Son of God.It was only a dream . . . but nonetheless Father Quixote had felt on waking the chill of despair felt by a man who realizes suddenly that he has taken up a profession which is of use to no one, who must continue to live in a kind of Saharan desert without doubt or faith, where everyone is certain that the same belief is true.He had found himself whispering: God save me from such a belief.\\"Then, there is a mysterious, haunting and paradoxical ending. A reviewer should not reveal too much and Greene has left it so ambiguous, as to elude any certain interpretation. But perhaps I may be permitted to offer my own hermeneutic: Greene seems to be saying that the Marxist atheist has received his first Sacrament in thirty years. And after this, he no longer has the \\"freedom\\" of complete disbelief.He has been transformed by Grace via the Sacrament and after decades, Graham Greene is writing - once again - about the Power of the Catholic Mystery ...*****This for me is the final, most definitive joy in Monsignor Quixote - and I am tempted to end my review on that note.But some final remarks: If you are a native Anglophone like myself, dear Reader, your world will likely have been dominated by Anglo-American literature, films and so forth. Greene was English, true. But he gravitated to Catholic cultures. Much of his literary life was spent in France. And he came to know Spain very well through significant travel and profound friendship there.Thus in this English book, we have an acute observation of a very different cultural-matrix than many of us know. It is a world where people have vastly different aspirations to that of the capitalism which has dominated the Anglo-American sphere, particularly in recent decades.In this world you will not meet many people obsessed with fashion, gadgets, prosperity-consciousness, keeping ahead of the Jones' or being a winner and not a loser. But you will encounter characters whose lives are dedicated to the \\"Workers of the World United in the Party\\" as well as people agonised about the Church.In short here is a world of Spain circa 1980, yet very foreign to the increasingly Anglo-Americanised world of 2010. It is a world in which all kinds of ordinary people take either Catholicism or Marxism very seriously - and in this novel meet in strange and surprising ways.I write these lines as an American living in Madrid. Travel has allowed me to break through some of my cultural inheritance and I am blessed indeed. Not all have the same Providential destiny as myself - but many I think could benefit from such a sharp observer as Graham Greene in looking beyond the horizons of their culture.For this reason alone, I would recommend Monsignor Quixote. And in these days of the Internet and Wikipedia, one can, if ones wishes, easily take this novel, look up the cultural references which may not be familiar and enter into a very different universe ...I consider myself very fortunate to have come to know firsthand this precious universe - at least a little. The livingness of Spanish Catholicism moves me very deeply and I have been given vital insights difficult to find elsewhere. Such is my own destiny and may not be yours, dear Reader. But if this world should speak to you, you could do much worse than let Graham Greene be your guide for a short while ..."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"A beautiful & charming little book about friendship & faith... a priest and a socialist take a road trip with a case of wine.

His companion is the Communist former Mayor of their small Spanish town, and their conversations and roadside picnics are comments on a Spain that was lost under Franco, impossible to restore under communists, but perhaps recoverable with the Catholic Church militant and incarnate.

In this book, Greene brings up all kinds of interesting ideas, whilst maintaining a sense of humour. Unlike a lot of other books that deal with issues like religion, this isn't at all heavy-going, owing to the engaging style of writing."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"This is one of the funniest and cleverest novels I have ever read. It is also one of the deepest. Behind the clever adaptation of the Don Quixote story to a context in post-Franco Spain there is a dance of ideas, much as Shaw's plays are a dance of ideas, and the questions dealt with are the biggest and most fundamental that we all have to deal with.An innocent and un-intellectual Catholic priest sets out on a holiday with a communist politician, and their discussions, always friendly and courteous and greatly assisted by wine, centre on their respective faiths. The communist faith is much the more straightforward - the ex-mayor, defeated at a recent election, finds the general outlook of Marx congenial, he finds that doubt shackles freedom of action, and that's about as far as his introspection goes. Catholicism is about bigger issues altogether, such as do we go to heaven or to hell for all eternity, and the concepts involved, for someone who really thinks about them honestly, are sufficient to unseat anyone's mind. There is no real alternative to thinking about them, so in the interests of peace of mind what people do is to think about them not honestly but either ingenuously or disingenuously. Graham Greene, like Muriel Spark, was a convert to Catholicism, and like Dame Muriel his treatment of it in his writing is wry and ironic. What he really \`believed' is not quite clear and I'm sure not meant to be. Indeed he even casts some doubt around the question of what \`belief' actually consists of, and rightly so in my own view. At one point Father Quixote admits that a certain doctrine is one that he believes out of obedience, an admirable attitude for traditionalist believers whether Catholic or communist - you believe x because you're supposed to believe it and you'll be in trouble if you don't. Greene quite obviously sees that Catholic doctrine evolved as a book of rules to keep people under control. What started as religious and ethical teaching developed rapidly into thought-enforcement and thought-policing, but the matter goes even deeper - behind it all there is supposed to be a God whose word the ecclesiastical power-structure dispenses, and this God is not, like Marx, someone who certainly exists but only a hypothesis. How much further Greene wishes us to pursue this line of thought I'm not clear, but for me two considerations follow - firstly what is supposed to be God's word is actually a human construct foisted on the hypothetical God, something that to me seems outright blasphemy; and in the second place we have a clearer idea these days what the Creator has created, and such a Creator is not likely to bear much resemblance to Jehovah in the scriptures having to assert his authority against Baal, Dagon etc at intervals. Indeed if there is one crumb of comfort in the contemplation of such a Creator it's likely to be that he will take little or no notice of our insolence in presuming to speak for his intentions.Towards the end of the book Greene says something to the effect that in the absence of certain knowledge one goes for the next best thing. For him this is \`faith', for me it's probability, as best I can assess that. Greene is able, as I am not, to find a sense of \`believing' that takes in the soul as well as the mind. When I say that I believe something I mean that it seems to me true or probable, and considerations that bring me spiritual comfort are unrelated to belief in this sense entirely. Greene seems not to go so far, but I venture to think that he's nearer to my way of seeing things than to \`faith' in the conventional sense. What is completely unmistakable is the irony with which he observes the way that the devout have of finding support in the scriptures and in philosophy built on them for convenient viewpoints and courses of action.The book is not so much about the rival ideas, nor even so much about what people do with these as about what the ideas do with people who for some reason adhere to them, as if the ideas had taken on a higher life of their own, dominating and controlling the very people who create them and without whom they could never exist. This may indeed be what we call divine in them. What is divine in a more earthly sense about this book is the humour and ingenuity of it all. It is a simple story as well as a battle of ideas, and a touching one too, with emotion and human affection finally dominant over the intellectual side. A delightful book, a beautiful book and I would even say a great book."},{"Title":"Monsignor Quixote","review":"\\"Monsignor Quixote\\" was published in 1982. It's author Graham Greene (104-1991) the distinguished author of such classics as \\"The Power and the Glory: \\"The Comedians\\"; \\"Our Man in Havana\\"; \\"The Honorary Consul\\"; \\"Travels With My Aunt\\";\\"This Gun for Hire\\"; \\"The Quiet American\\"; as well as several other novels, short stories, film scripts (\\"The Third Man'); reviews and travel literature. \\"Monsignor Quixote\\" is a paen to the joys an consolations of religion and friendship. It is a short novel of only 194 pages in the Penguin Edition (containing an excellent introduction by John Auchard) but does what literature should do; it makes us think and feel as we contemplate the enigma of life in the modern age.Plot Synopsis: Old priest Quixote is the local priest of the sleepy Spanish village of El Tabasco not far from Madrid. Even though Cervantes masterpiece \\"Don Quixote\\" is fiction the good priest believes he is descended from the famous Don of legend.He has named his old jalopy \\"Rocinante\\" and calls the ex-mayor of the village \\"Sancho: in honor of Quixote''s querelous and practical sidekick of the same name. A bishop confers a monsignorship on Quixote after enjoying an excellent meal in the windmill tilter's home. Quixote and Sancho set off for Madrid to buy purple socks befitting the priest's new standing as a monsigner. Along the way they encounter many adventures mirroring the picaresque style of Cervantes. Among their adventures arespending a night in a brother; watching a sexually charged film and helping a robber escape the long arm of the law. The two friends become fugitives from the law. Quixote's bishop and a new priest in his parish consider him to be a fatuous madman.The novel ends in a monastery as the two men seek shelter from the law.What makes this novel so good? Undoubtedly, the spirited dialogue over religon and society between an avowed Communists and a devoted Christian makes for good reading. Both the friends experience doubts about their respective belif and moral systmes.They decide tha loving friendship is what makes life worth living in a universe which seems, at times, indifferent to humanity.The book is a delight and is unforgettable. As a Presbyterian minister who has served several years in small parishes I can empathize with the life of Quixote. He is many ways a Christ figure who loves and suffers for his friends and strangers who need his help. A gem of a novel by a great novelit in the winter of his discontent (it may be read as a dialogue betweeen doubt and faith in the Roman Catholic Greene's own mind).

In the not-too-distant past, extensive travel from Dallas was parctical and convenient on the speedy and majestic interurban cars of the Texas Electric Railway. The Texas Electric had a mystique all its own. Perhaps this was because in fabled Texas, but it also fascinate because of its sheer length.On the eve of World War II, most of the 'typical' interurbans had succumed to the competition of the bus which turned out to be surrogate for the automobile. Imagine, if you will, the wonderment of an interurban line extant in 1946 which ran all the way from Denison to Waco by way of Dallas!\\"This book \\"includes examples of virtually all kinds of electric railway operations. Its beginnings were in the streetcar lines of Denison and Sherman. Later, there was a variety of streetcar operations ranging from a single-car system in McKinney to a rather large system in Waco -- with many others in between.Then, there were the interurban cars. In the early days, there were impressive limiteds with classic parlor cars manned with porters. There were interburban locals, typical interurban express trains and locomotives hauling interline freight trains -- the latter probably the savior of the line, at least until 1948.\\"This is \\"the complete story\\" with \\"additional chapters on the neighboring Northern Texas Traction, which ran from Dallas to Fort Worth and south to Cleburne and on the ill-fated Texas Interurban which hade lines to both Terrell and Denton.

They will need to learn new management strategies based on ideas about human resources that may never have occurred to them before. They will have to abandon the old corporate paradigms and accept the fact that business today is a whole new kind of ball game. And above all, they will have to find means to bring the work force as individuals, as human beings, back to the center of corporate strategy-because corporate survival in this chaotic, ever-changing, new business world of ours is going to rely crucially on the commitment, enthusiasm, talent, and creative contributions of every single employee from top to bottom of the organization&quot; (from the Introduction).In this context, throughout the book Carol Kinsey Goman examines these seven steps in detail, and summarizes them and their basic principles as following:1. Examine changing realities* Communicate to employees the forces of change affecting markets, competition, and their jobs.* Acknowledge the changes in needs and values of the work force.2. Adopt the new business paradigm* Identify the changing paradigm for science and organizations.* Exploit instability as the opportunity for positive transformation.3. Develop a change-adept work force* Expand employees' skills to help them thrive on change instead of fearing it.* Develop management practices that promote change-adeptness throughout the organization.4. Lead discontinuous change* Be prepared not just to manage but to lead transformation.* Build emotional literacy in yourself and in your work force.5. Develop the core of leadership* Become the change you want to see in others: Lead by example.* Transform yourself from manager to leader.6. Renegotiate the compact between employers and employees* Recognize the powerful potential of shared commitment.* Move from paternalizm to partnership.7. Liberate work force potential* Eliminate obstacles to creative collaboration.* Rely on human potential as central to your corporate strategy.Finally, she writes that &quot;With one exception, success in today's global economy boils down to the single, universally recognized issue of getting more for less. The exception is human resources. The potential of an organization lies within each individual and within the connections between individuals. Human labor is no longer a disposable commodity. It is a unique creative resource for the future of the organization. You can trim production costs, speed up communications, reduce delivery times, cut corners on marketing and promotion...But you can't switch workers off and expect to come out ahead. If you give people less, they give less back. If you treat them like underlings, they behave like underlings. Offer them more, on the other hand, and they'll repay you with interest. I'm not talking about money now. I'm talking about liberating untapped potential, about energizing employees and engaging their enthusiasm.&quot;Highly recommended."},{"Title":"\\"This Isn't the Company I Joined\\": Seven Steps to Energizing a Restructured Work Force","review":"Literally peppered with case histories, this book is practical.

Also some of the websites in the book did not work (which Hamlett could not have had any control of).

Though aimed at high school students, she treats every aspect of the screenwriting process with the same s&eacute;rieux one would use for a book aimed at the adult market. Indeed, it covers all the same topics (finding ideas, writing dialogue, structure, character, formatting etc.).Differences are noticeable in the tone of the examples used, which are a bit more fanciful than usual, and in the exercises in each chapter, which are really designed for the classroom. As such, the book is probably even more valuable to teachers of a beginning screenwriting class for young adults than for the teen screenwriter himself.The advice is good, with an interesting take on structure. There is a lot of information on getting an agent (perhaps a tad too optimistic here), as well as interviews with industry professionals to conclude each chapter (and the ageism issue gets referred to a lot, strangely enough). For those who remain cynical about the whole thing: the one 14-year-old writer interviewed here prefers Rashomon and Citizen Kane.

Thos upporting the political economy approach (and its variations, i.e. State focused studies) such as James Waterbury, Roger Owens or Nazih Ayubi to mention some and those preferring a more cultural approach based on modernization theory typified by Bernard Lewis. This book edited by Mark Tessler aims to draw from the various approaches to establish a balanced view which combines the more scientific 'methods' of describing the Middle East through social science with the historical and local specificity of area studies. Tessler's aim is to sgow that neother approach works well in isolation and that, indeed, a combination of these two provides the most effective framework to the study of the Middle East. The one discipline adding the necessary context to the other's discipline.The book features a collection of essays by noted scholars such as Lisa Anderson, Clement Henry and August Richard Norton (among others) which are invaluable to the specialist as well as those who have had less exposure to the debate.

Many were expecting something resembling a predictable literary auto-biography, though, with the authors notorious history and reputation, should have been prepared for what they got instead. This is a fascinating book about and by the man many called genius, the author of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\", \\"The Glass Menagerie\\", \\"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof\\", \\"Sweet Bird Of Youth\\", \\"Night Of The Iguana\\", etc..., and the events in his life that help one better understand just how autobiographical many of his works were. From his upbringing by a tyrannical, indifferent father, who was disappointed in his \\"sissy\\" son, his overbearing mother, and his relationship with his lifelong, deepest love, his sister Rose, whose tragic mental illness and lobotomy froze her in time, and perhaps was the most important factor in his troubled life and his creative genius. He was all too human, in his relationships and insecurities. He exposes himself, warts and all, at once being an extremely sensitive, caring human being, who at other times in his life, could turn into an irrational, paranoid, abusive chore to be around. Substance abuse certainly played a major part in his progressive personal and professional demise, and he is brutally honest about that also. He is also unapologetic about the many promiscuous periods of his life, the bluntness of his recounting of sexual escapades usually so humorously told, that it defuses what could have been just vulgar bad taste, to some. His 14 year love relationship with Frank Merlo, who died of cancer in the early 1960's, was, aside from Rose, the most important relationship of his life. Though he and Merlo were estranged towards the end of Merlos life, then had a reconciliation just prior to his death, Tennessee was to never recover from the loss. He also tells about the beginning of his career, and certain pivitol moments in his professional life when, before fame and praise came, it was doubtful that the poor, struggling writer might ever find success. There are also wonderful first hand insights into his contact with the likes of Brando, Anna Magnani, Capote, to name a few. But, admittedly, this book is more about the man than the career. He readily concedes that he is not about to bore himself and some readers to death with chronological descriptions about the fruition of each play. As he says here: \\"The plays, what about them? If this was a book only about my plays, it would be a very short book. The plays speak for themselves\\". In fact, there is nothing chronological about this book. It was published about ten years before his tragic death, a period in his life that , after a brilliant career with successive hits, was marked by professional failure, the progression of which was publicly recorded by ,what many perceived to be, unusually aggressive critics who were intent on destroying him personally. If you're looking for a standard auto-bio of a literary career, you may be disappointed. But you also may enjoy, as I did, this wonderfully touching and often humourous book by a sad, troubled, brilliant human being, who battled with his demons his whole life, trying to give a voice to the lonely, the outcast, the misunderstood...the \\"gentle people\\", as he referred to them. We are all contradictory, perhaps those the Gods touch with genius more so than others. It's the totality of a life that matters, and the total sum of his life was that he tried his damndest to be a GOOD MAN. An honest man. And, he also created some of the most brilliant works, with some of the most memorable characters, speaking some of the most beautiful words, in the history of theater. Don't judge dear Tennessee too harshly."},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"If you are looking for a well organized overview of TW's life and career, look somewhere else. For someone truly interested in Tennessee Williams, I would suggest first reading a biography of him, and if you are still interested, read this to find out what made this man tick, what made this man get out of bed each day and write, and what a (....) guy he was. This is a nitty-gritty, confessional look inward at the personal aspects and thoughts of the life of a very talented writer.I am sure what shocked his public when it was published in 1975 was his frank description of his love life and sexual affairs. For Ernest Hemingway it was okay to describe his love life because he was straight, but for a gay man it was (and still largely is) expected to be kept discreetly sub-rosa. But Tennessee was not ashamed of his nature and not ashamed of his life and in that way this memoir (and his life itself) is an act of cultural defiance. It pours out in a fairly disjointed stream of recollections. To be honest, it reads like a rough-draft that needs a lot of editing and filling in. But all-in-all, the inherent drama, passion and thirst for life itself jump out of the page and carry one through to the end and you can't help but be touched by his humanity and his passion and his drive to express himself through his art."},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"I think \\"badges of honor\\" (from a previous review) misses the mark. \\"Badges of dis-honor\\" would be closer to the truth. I think Williams' extremely destructive drug abuse and alcoholism are obvious escape hatches - escapes from his inner deamons, his possible self-loathing, and certainly an attempt to reconcile the loneliness that each artist has to contend with. The same isolation and deamons that Williams faced nearly destroyed Michelangelo - and they did kill Virginia Woolf, Francis Bacon, and Oscar Wilde. I still think \\"Iguana\\" and \\"Streetcar\\" are among the finest literature in the American canon, while \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\" is among the most compelling psychological (if not philosophical) horror stories ever written. In fact, it's worthy of Poe. Tennessee Williams can be difficult and disturbing, because he NEVER lies to us. Every one of his works renders him defenseless - and by extension our defenses are stipped bare as well. Only the greatest authors, artists, and poets are able to do this. No thoughtful person is quite the same after delving into the work of Tennessee Williams. I think that's an awesome power to possess - and William's never abuses it. Instead, he saved the abuse for himself. I'm still coming to terms with this."},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"If you like memoirs, written by great writers about themselves, you'll love this one.I was born in 1970, this was written not long after--my sense of being is way different than this guy. He wrote this himself in his later years, meanders here and there, but more in the end. Charming all the way thru.I'd heard that maybe this was a little racy, but again--only in the beginning. And even then, not nearly what you see when you tune into any television station. Really, just a glimpse into what gay men of his era went through (a good glimpse).When I realized what gold I had in my hands I slowed way down with this one--he writes in a way that makes you want to savor. It's a whole different time, you hafta listen.Thank you older gay men, you paved the way."},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"While my daughter was performing in Glass Menagerie, I picked up a copy of Tennessee Williams's Memoirs hoping to learn how much of his sister Rose was portrayed in Laura. That was soon answered by his comment that \\"Laura of Menagerie was like Miss Rose only in her inescapable 'difference,' which that old female bobcat Amanda would not believe existed.\\" The most lasting impression from this hurly-burly book is the tenderness, almost reverence, of his feeling for Rose. Even his redoubtable mother is treated with gently barbed irony.Yes, there is an incredible amount of sex (seven times in one night? A man with a serious heart condition?) but the tenderness comes through more and more until you just want to take care of this troubled guy, who poignantly remarks that while he often announced he was about to fall down, hardly anyone ever caught him.Revealing, sometimes scathing portraits of theater people and others enliven the book; his loving account of Anna Magnani for example is a delight. Hemingway, he writes, \\"struck me as a gentleman who seemed to have a very touchingly shy quality about him.\\"Eccentric and informal in style, honest and probing for still deeper truths about his life and work, Memoirs leaves me with the sense that I have actually met and come to care for a rare human being."},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"Tennessee WilliamsMemoirsNew Directions, Paperback, [2006].8vo. xix+274 pp. Foreword by TW [xv-xix].

Illustrated with 144 photographs.First published by Doubleday, 1975.First published in paperback by New Directions, 2006.ContentsIntroduction by John WatersForeword by Tennessee WilliamsMemoirsAfterword by Allean HaleList of IllustrationsIndex=================================================&#8203;This book comes together with an impressive amount of notoriety. For once, it is justified.To put the matter shortly and bluntly, these memoirs may be recommended only to die-hard fans of Tennessee Williams. There is precious little in them about the man and the artist that is worth knowing. His plays, essays and short stories are infinitely more revealing in every aspect. Please note also that both the book and the following \\"review\\" are not recommended for minors due to their highly explicit sexual content. That settled, let's have a look inside - and outside - the book.To begin with, Memoirs is of certain historical significance. It is the only non-fiction book Tennessee wrote during his life with the intention of publication. There is, of course, the volume with his collected essays, Where I Live, first published in 1978, but these were written over a period of more than 30 years (and were not collected in book form by the author). Since Tennessee's death in 1983, a number of similar books have appeared - interviews, notebooks, two volumes with letters - but none of them has the authority of the memoirs. Unfortunately, this is no guarantee for value.The major problem with the book is what outraged the critics, if not the public, when it was first published. As one critic, the author of the Afterword in this edition, wrote at the time: \\"Now comes Tennessee Williams's Memoirs, and if he has not exactly opened his heart, he has opened his fly.\\" Even when, by a kind of exception, sex is not the main topic, Tennessee deals almost exclusively with facts. Trivial or not, incidents or accidents, but facts all the same. These are so much less revealing than thoughts, feelings, ideas. To Tennessee's credit, he makes no bones about that and actually warns us as early as the Foreword:In the course of the book I will talk a great deal about love and much of the talk will be about carnal as well as spiritual love. I have had, for a man so nearly destroyed so often, a remarkably fortunate life which has contained a great many moments of joy, both pure and impure.That Tennessee has opened his fly is most true, and you are welcome to have a look inside. I am not going to play the prude and claim that I didn't enjoy his naughty stories. I sure did. They are vastly entertaining. The \\"love-bug\\" seems to have bitten Tennessee quite so often, starting from his teens and never really stopping. It's true that in his later years - and also, thankfully, in the second half of the book - the intensity is somewhat diminished, but even in his sixties he seems to have been nearly insatiable. So here is the first question in our \\"Naughty Quiz about Tennessee\\":How many sexual relationships with women did Tennessee Williams have?a) 0b) 1c) 2d) 4Tough, is it? There's no way of knowing the right answer to this earth-shaking question if you haven't read Memoirs. Let me tell you that the correct answer is b). She was \\"a genuine nympho\\", disguised here under the code name \\"Sally\\", and you will get a magnificently detailed description of Tom's first orgasm with her. It was a stormy and passionate romance. But it finally ended. Tom - for this was long before he became Tennessee - tried to date other girls but it didn't work. His only earlier intimate relationship with a girl, one with the lovely name of Hazel, was hopelessly platonic. It never came further than her \\"delicious shoulders\\", Tom's putting his hand around them and - \\"I \\"came\\" in my white flannels\\". Too bad.So he switched to boys and then there was no stopping, let alone turning back. The reader is not spared anything from Tennessee' stupendous promiscuity: countless one-night stands, or rather one-night lays, with sailors, hustlers, acquaintances, whoever; some of these were extended to many nights but this didn't change their ephemeral nature. If you have any questions whatsoever about \\"crabs\\" and \\"clap\\", when \\"to contemplate no intimacy beyond the tactile\\" and when to avoid penetration, how to \\"worship the little god\\" on the beach and other similar issues, Tennessee Williams, a Professor Emeritus of Sexology, will enlighten you with his penetrating observations rooted in vast experience and extensive research.I must also say I am duly impressed with Tennessee's astonishing virility. I find it hard to believe that he [*Amazon censoreship*] some guy seven times for one night. So, indeed, does he, but since he did note it in his diary, it must have happened. Small wonder that at one place the author should write something like this:\\"Is it possible to be a dirty old man in your middle thirties? I seem to be giving that impression.\\"To Tennessee's credit, it should be noted that, with very few coarse exceptions, all this sex stuff is stylishly and amusingly written. Certainly I don't - Heaven forbid! - have any moral objections against it. All the same, it is completely irrelevant and eminently forgettable. The author appears to have recognised this:\\"I think it is only in the case of Brecht that a man's politics, if the man is an artist, are of particular importance in his work; his degrees of talent and humanity are what count. I also feel that an artist's sexual predilections or deviations are not usually pertinent to the value of his work. Of interest, certainly. Only a homosexual could have written Remembrance of Things Past.\\"Quite true. While reading Memoirs, I often had to put the book down and ask the obvious question. If Tennessee had so much sex, when on earth did he find the time to write so many plays and stories? The moral is pretty obvious. The role of sex is exaggerated out of any proportion.Among so much naughty trivia, all of it monumentally unimportant, it is very hard to draw any relevant conclusions about Tennessee's personality. Somewhat more revealing are the accounts, again extensive, of his long-term relationships. These were much more than sex, of course, but they probably shared the same major causes - loneliness, insecurity, vanity - as the one-night adventures. And they are great fun, of course. One of these lovers, disguised as Santo, was indeed nearly a saint. He was in the delightful habit of getting drunk and trying to run Tennessee over with his own Pontiac.A great deal of space is dedicated to what was by far the longest romance in Tennessee's life, his relationship with Frank Merlo, a Sicilian known also as \\"the Little Horse\\". Well, I have to say that, in my appallingly personal opinion, \\"Frankie\\" (there is a full-page photo of him) is far less handsome than most horses, but that's just me. Anyway, Tennessee and \\"the Horse\\" were together for some 14 years. Indifference and infidelities finally proved too much and they broke. Shortly afterwards Frankie, though still only 40, died of cancer. This is one of the most poignant passages in the book.Even if we assume that sex and sexuality - homo-, hetero-, bi-, whatever you like - is of paramount importance for a writer's work, the least I should like to know are the details of the act itself. Especially in the case of homosexuality in former times (in this case 1940s to 1960s), I would be curious to know how public a secret it was. On this topic Tennessee is curiously silent. There is, I think, only one place where he briefly alludes to the problem. It seems that many people invited the dramatist to parties only on the condition that Frankie would not accompany him. The legendary Jack Warner made the mistake to have them both. \\"What do you do, young man?\\", asked the Great Man. Frankie replied in loud and clear voice: \\"I sleep with Mr. Williams.\\" The Little Horse did have balls!So Tennessee's homosexuality, including his unbelievable promiscuity, must have been a public secret long before Memoirs was first published. Did he have problems with prejudice in this respect? In the theatre circles or out of them? Did this colour the critical response to his plays? Or the attitude of the audience? Tennessee mentions nothing about any of these questions.Even when he thankfully leaves the sexual matters aside, Tennessee continues to deal with little else but gossip. The best that can be said is that he is perfectly honest with his readers. I, for one, completely agree that the lack of discussion of his plays is not among the book's faults.\\"Of course, I could devote this whole book to a discussion of the art of drama, but wouldn't that be a bore?\\"\\"It would bore me to extinction, I'm afraid, and it would be a very, very short book, about three sentences to the page with extremely wide margins. The plays speak for themselves.\\"Well, no, Tennessee, it wouldn't be a bore at all. But yes, you have already done it in your essays. And you are right: the plays do speak for themselves. What they say, that's for the reader to decide personally. And what is obscure in them, Tennessee could not clarify because I don't think he ever was deliberately obscure.There is, in fact, a great deal about his plays in the book, at least about many of the most important ones. But it is almost exclusively trivia about stage productions: casting, rehearsals, reception, things like that. Very occasionally, he does say something less painfully prosaic, but, again, it's nothing you can't read in his essays, and better written at that. When he says that his life story is more important than his career, and that's why he writes mostly about the former in this book, Tennessee is completely wrong. Neither his career nor his life is of any importance. What really matters in his oeuvre. And this is so personal and intimate as to make any autobiographical writing valueless.In his essays, especially in \\"The Timeless World of a Play\\", Tennessee has written very perceptively about the elusive aims of drama, or indeed art in general. The arrest of time and the stripping of all triviality until the essence of our existence, the core of truth, if any, is revealed: this is what art should aspire to. Memoirs does precisely the opposite. It obscures the truth by dressing it in the stinking garments of small talk. We have more than enough of that around us. Surely there is no need to fill books with it.Most of what you can learn about Tennessee here is sheer trivia. For instance, that The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone (1961) with Vivien Leigh was \\"a poem\\" and his favourite among all movies based on his work, or that The Unsatisfactory Supper is among his favourite one-act plays. Among the more touching moments is a wonderful tribute to Vivien who once gave a party to which she invited Frankie. It was, as it turned out, his last time out.\\"Vivien centered the whole dinner party around him with an intuitive sympathy that will always endear her memory to me. She did it without seeming to do it... Having known madness, she knew how it was to be drawing close to death.\\"Tennessee describes vividly his \\"stoned age\\", most of the 1960s, when vast amounts of drugs and drink kept him perpetually stoned or drunk, often both. He finally ended in a psychiatric hospital - \\"Queen's Division of Friggins' Violent Ward\\" (he claims he didn't make up the name) - a harrowing place par excellence. But it's difficult to say what were the reasons for this nearly fatal degradation and the radical change in his writing, although at least one cause - the break-up with Frankie and his death - cannot be doubted. At one place Tennessee even claims that he has been been doing most of his writing under the influence of drugs ever since 1955...Tennessee met many famous people during his life but his accounts of them are, for the most part, embarrassingly superficial. Ernest Hemingway and Lenny Bernstein are especially dismal examples; surely they must have said or done something more interesting than what Tennessee reports. He raves about Anna Magnani, how marvellously unconventional and honest she was, but his description of the typical day they spent together in Rome sounds awfully conventional. The story how Marlon Brando was sent by Kazan, did a fabulous reading and turned out to be the perfect Stanley Kowalski is vastly riveting (for the record, they didn't have sex, Marlon slept on the floor), but all Tennessee says about him as an actor is that he was \\"outstanding\\" and \\"better than Olivier\\". The former is obvious, the latter is nonsense - not because Olivier is better than Brando, but because such comparisons are plain stupid.It is indeed seldom that one stumbles on something thought-provoking. One fascinating example is Tennessee's casual remark that he had a \\"funny heart\\" that seemed to \\"thrive on punishment\\". He referred to a physical condition here - one of his many health problems - but one is perhaps allowed to mischievously extend the observation to his mental \\"heart\\" as well. It's only in the last few pages, reflecting on old age and death, that Tennessee finally demonstrates the stirring writing he is capable of. Again, however, there is nothing here you can't read in his essays. This includes his foolish hunger for flattery and almost childish vanity as well as his innate pride and dignity. As far as his outlook is concerned, the memoirs give only a very fragmented and incomplete idea.In a way, the best about this book is the wealth of photographs. There really are 144 of them, but that's because some pages have six or even eight cramped on them. As a result, some photos are little more than blurred visions, but even they usually are of more than passing interest. The choice itself is telling. You won't find a single moment of Tennessee with his father. You will find many with his grandfather, whom he adored, or with his mother, whom he didn't adore but was still very fond of. And there are many photos of his sister, Rose, whom Tennessee all but worshiped - even when she was convinced that she was the Queen of England.The captions were obviously written by Tennessee, too. Many of them are gems. A photo of his grandfather with a pelican: \\"His failing eyesight - or his infinite benevolence - made him regard them as beautiful birds.\\" A lovely photo of Tennessee smiling happily: \\"Drunk and delighted.\\" Under a still from Suddenly Last Summer: \\"bad film that was very profitable\\". And so on.Some photos are more revealing than any words could possible be. Nothing that I have read demonstrates Tennessee's great inner sadness better than one photo taken \\"at a fiesta in Valencia, Spain, fifteen or twenty years ago.\\" In the background gay - in the old-fashioned sense of the word! - festive lights can be discerned. But there's Tennessee in the foreground, not even a hint of smile on his face and a really inexpressible melancholy in his eyes. It's a shattering photograph.Similarly affecting is one very intimate moment with Claire Bloom, \\"exhausted in her dressing room after [a 1974] opening of Streetcar in London.\\" Is this the same Claire Bloom who played Lady Anne against Laurence Olivier's Richard III some twenty years earlier? It must be the same woman, even though the haggard looks and the large, dark and tragic eyes bear little resemblance to the frail creature in the Shakespearean tragedy. Those eyes, and the body language, convey the tragedy of both Blanche and Tennessee with rare eloquence.(Incidentally, Luchino Visconti did call the playwright \\"Blanche\\": a very perceptive nickname indeed. A great photo of them both during the preparation of the Roman production of Streetcar.)On a more physical level, there are some photos which are startlingly candid about Tennessee's \\"stoned age\\". My personal favourite is one with Buffo, his bulldog, who is obviously in a much better possession of his wits. Several other shots show Tennessee, usually at crowded parties but sometimes alone with his typewriter, with that trademark expression on his face which suggests that he is either stoned or drunk - probably both. Riveting photographs.Among the many stills from movies and theatre productions there are some tantalising items. Camino Real with the young Al Pacino as Kilroy? Now that's quite amazing! Even more so is to see Barbara del Geddes, best known as Miss Ellie Ewing from the soap opera Dallas, as the original Maggie from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof on Broadway. Unfortunately, many of these photos are too miniature to allow much appreciation.Last but not least, it saddens me to report that my favourite photo of Tennessee Williams is not reprinted here. What's worse, I can't even find it on the Web. The only place I've seen it was during the fascinating documentaries on the bonus disc in the special edition of Streetcar on DVD. Probably taken circa 1950, it shows Tennessee leisurely sitting on a chair, cigarette holder in his hand, mischievous twinkle in his eyes. It's a terrific photo. It should have been on the cover instead of this indifferent portrait from the early 1940s.New Directions have been Tennessee's main publisher since the late 1940s. They have tried to justify their historical importance - with various success - by including an interesting introduction and a very indifferent afterword.John Waters is memorably described on the back cover as \\"director, screenwriter, and raconteur of kitsch and camp\\". I have never seen any of his movies, but their titles are memorable: \\"Pink Flamingos\\", \\"Female Trouble\\", \\"Polyester\\", \\"Cry Baby\\", \\"Serial Mom\\", \\"Cecil B. Demented\\", \\"A Dirty Shame\\". So, indeed, is the title of his own memoirs: Shock Value. Mr Waters' introduction is a charmingly naughty piece called \\"Mr. Williams Saved My Life\\". Here are two amusing passages:\\"Tennessee Williams saved my life. As a twelve-year-old boy in suburban Baltimore, I would look up his name in the card catalogue at the library and it would read \\"see Librarian\\". I wanted these \\"see Librarian\\" books - and I wanted them now - but in the late 1950s (and sadly even today), there was no way that a warped adolescent like myself could get his hands on one. But I soon figured out that the \\"see Librarian\\" books were on a special shelf behind the counter. So when the kindly librarian was helping the \\"normal\\" kids with their book reports, I snuck behind the checkout desk and stole the first book I ever wanted to possess on my own. One Arm read the forbidden cover, a short story collection by Tennessee Williams that I later found out had been only available in an expensive limited edition, sold under the counter in \\"special\\" bookshops before New Directions released the hardback version in 1954.\\"[By the way, at one place Tennessee does mention these stealthy editions of his short stories. This fits well with their nature, far more explicit than anything in his plays. Yet, if Mr Waters is to be believed, accessible editions were published as early as the middle 1950s.]\\"Years later, Tennessee Williams saved my life again. The first time I went to a gay bar I was seventeen years old. It was called The Hut and it was in Washington, DC. Some referred to it as The Chicken Hut, and it was filled with early 1960s gay men in fluffy sweaters who cruised each other by calling table-to-table on phones provided by the bar. \\"I may be queer but I ain't this,\\" I remember thinking. Still reading everything Tennessee Williams wrote, I knew he would understand my dilemma. Tennessee never seemed \\"gayly correct\\" even then, and sexual ambiguity and confusion were always made appealing and exciting in his work.\\"Cute fellow, this John Waters, isn't he?In contrast, the Afterword by the eminent TW scholar Allean Hale, apart from its opening paragraph which quotes the gripping sentence about the heart and the fly I mentioned in the beginning, is short and worthless. It's titled \\"Few Notes and Corrections\\" and it performs the exceptionally important task of putting straight some wrong years and identifying several people whom Tennessee preferred to disguise at the time. Not really worth reading.Is the book on the whole worth reading? Yes, certainly, provided that you are fan of Tennessee Williams and don't expect anything more than light entertainment. If you hope to find anything as fine as his plays, essays or short stories, you probably hope in vain. Of course it's great fun to read how \\"things went gaily\\" in those days. But as a spiritual self-portrait of the author, I am afraid the book is almost entirely false. Unless we assume that the rest of his voluminous writings is complete sham."},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"There's no question that Tennessee Williams was perhaps the best playwright of the 20th century. If not the best, he certainly had no competition for the spot.I tend not to believe everything one writes about oneself. This book is no exception. On the other hand, we see a good deal of vulnerability in Williams in the book and few people want others to see them as vulnerable. Williams rambles from one decade to another --- apparently flipping through his diaries and journals and following memory as it happened. And he writes far more about his sex life then necessary. The fact that he picks up young boys on street corners and has sex with them rather dims the esteem in which the reader may hold Williams. Not the fact he's gay but the fact he has so many sexual encounters with young people. Unfortunately, this is not uncommon. But it's not necessary for someone of his genius to tell the reader all about it.I'd rather read about the way he writes, his plays and the people he meets who matter to his career. There is some of this in the book but the sex is the main theme.Williams was a tormented soul. He was also a hypochondriac. He calls his heart condition a bad heart. In truth it was a very common heart ailment that at one time was called Soldier's Heart and is not called mitro valve prolapse. He calls his sessions of skipped heartbeats \\"heart attacks\\", which they certainly were not.But, despite the flaws, the writing --- as one might expect --- is excellent. It's funny in places. He paints lovely pictures of his experiences and the places he saw, the people he met, the experiences he had, and the way he suffered.He was a delicate soul. He was fearful. But with all his misery, he was a truly great writer and storyteller. Writing was his whole world and no matter how he felt or where he was, he wrote. His work was what mattered most to him.-- Susanna K. Hutcheson"},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"Tennessee Williams \\"Memoirs\\" are a feast for people who love theater gossip.

Great fun and useful for the Williams Centennial Fest I'm leading in Albuquerque. (This book is hard to order from the publisher, but Amazon sent it promptly and in good shape.) pkb"},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"This is an outpouring of rambling self pity that reads in parts as though Williams is sitting in front of a tape recorder after consuming a gallon or so of mint juleps (or whatever writers from the American South drink) and rabbiting on about whatever occurs to him at that moment.It consists of hundreds of disjointed anecdotes, observations, moans and asides and leaves the impression that Williams was a self-indulgent whiner.There is no sense of joi de vivre during the happy periods, that is if he was ever happy unless under the influence of drugs and alcohol. There is plenty of bitterness and bile.He knew lots of artists and actors, such as Gore Vidal, Truman Capote, Paul Bowles, Paul Newman and Marlon Brando, but these are mere blurs in Williams' ramblings.It cannot remotely be compared with Vidal's entertaining and witty memoirs \\"Palimpsest\\" which portray Williams in a sympathetic light.Perhaps the best way to get into this book is to accompany it with a bottle of something and go with the flow. Otherwise, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"I,ve always tought that Tenessee Williams was a sad person, like his caracters but,to my surprise his memoirs are written with such a sense of humour!

Norman is assigned to a government project that involves himself and a special team of scientists that he has assembled. They go to the bottom of the ocean to investigate a strange spacecraft that has been there for three centuries. Upon further investigation, the team discovers that the craft was from Earth and contains an alien object, a sphere. One of the team members, Harry actually enters the sphere. After he leaves the sphere, the science team begins communication with what they think is the sphere itself. Strange things begin to happen, unusual animals and even a giant squid appear and then disappear. But things take a turn for the worse, when these 3manifestations of the sphere2 begin to kill off the crew. For instance, a giant squid killed off a mathematician, Ted, after he aroused the creature1s interest. The creatures then damage their base, and the crew is almost forced to abandon it. Norman Johnson then finds out that he has been lied to by his colleague, Beth, when he finds out that she has also been inside the sphere. Upon finding this out, Norman enters the sphere and learns not only about life, but the human mind as well. Eventually he finds out that the sphere grants incredible power to anyone who enters it. The book is very technical and extremely detailed. Crichton explains mathematical expressions, theoretical physics, and zoology throughout the book. It is not difficult to understand, however. He gives a biographical background of all of the main characters, with detailed descriptions. From Harry1s childhood in the ghetto, to Norman's career, all are explained in depth. Crichton1s eye for detail is very apparent, and one can see this on every page. There is even a detailed description of the effects on the human body of breathing helium for weeks.

Read the book and avoid the movie....that's the only way you can appreciate this story."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"God, I loved the first three quarters of this book. I couldn't put it down... it was so interesting to me. The alien entity that called itself Jerry, and talked in a child-like fashion, sent chills down my spine. I couldn't wait for complete resolution. Unfortunately, this resolution NEVER comes. The ending of this book is the biggest disappointment. Actually, the last quarter of Sphere is where it begins to fall apart. Nothing is explained. Crichton creates an incredible set up... and then completely drops the reader with nothing. Frustrating, because there were SO many intriguing possibilities."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I would have given the book a higher rating if not for the ending. I just wasn't happy about the &quot;We're not ready for this power so let's get rid of it&quot; way they left things, although I'm not convinced Beth really got rid of her powers. I was very impressed by how close the Movie stuck to the book, but the book explains things more clearly and there were a couple of major differences, i.e. the movie had Norman go into sphere right after Harry, whereas in the book Norman went in last. i would recommend Sphere to any Sci-Fi enthusiast."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I was recently surprised to find this novel on one of my shelves; I saw the movie adaptation of the novel recently but did not remember owning the actual book. The movie was full of promise but ultimately disappointing, so I was pretty curious to see how good a read the actual novel was. Sphere is my first Michael Crichton novel, and I have to say I was quite impressed with Crichton's prowess. There are some logical flaws and inconsistencies in the plot, but Crichton is an incredibly gifted storyteller; I eagerly breezed through this novel in short order. While it is heavy on dialogue, the story touches on a number of aspects of the human personality while mixing in some profound if problematic science fiction in the process. This is a fast-paced thriller that definitely registers impressively on the suspense meter, particularly during the climactic late chapters. While the ending is something of a letdown, the story leading up to it is gripping and fascinating, and important clues and plot points are presented with much more subtlety and effectiveness than what you will find in the movie adaptation.The novel is built around an incredible discovery; in the middle of the South Pacific, lying all but buried on the bottom of the ocean, rests a spacecraft of unknown origin. Psychologist Norman Johnson, the author of a secret government paper on Recommendations for the Human Contact Team to Interact with Unknown Life Forms (a less than serious paper he wrote primarily for the money) is called to the site, where he is informed that he will be part of a team of scientists sent to study the mysterious craft. Alongside him are an irascible Navy project commander, a brilliant, young astrophysicist/planetary geologist, a complicated female zoologist/biochemist, and a noted mathematician/logician. This unlikely team of deep ocean explorers soon find themselves in an artificial habitat resting alongside the location of the mysterious ship. Their exploration of the site yields more questions than answers, as the ship turns out to be an American spaceship from the future. The truly enigmatic discovery onboard, though, is a giant sphere of unknown composition. As the story unfolds, the team of explorers finds themselves effectively stranded on the ocean floor for a period of some days, and strange and frightening things begin to happen after one scientist somehow enters the sphere. The scientists find themselves in communication with a supposedly alien entity who calls himself Jerry; whoever and whatever Jerry is, he seems to have the power to manifest remarkable physical creations and changes in reality. The habitat and the team inside it soon comes under attack by such dangerous creatures as giant squid and killer jellyfish, but the problems eventually internalize themselves inside the group dynamic, a group that is shrinking in size as time goes by. The mysterious Sphere imparts an amazing power to those who enter it, a power that such individuals may not even be consciously aware of wielding. Ultimately, the last remnants of the research team begin pointing fingers at one another and take steps to insure their own individual survival in the face of an unquantifiable threat, making this novel a gripping psychological thriller based in a fascinating science fiction environment.Once the team arrives in the underwater habitat, nonstop action ensues. One emergency after another challenges the crew, and the group dynamic of the team ebbs and flows along with each jarring crisis. Along the way, we see ever more clearly into the minds and ways of thinking of our main characters, and a significant amount of ideas are expressed concerning the human condition. Crichton provides for no obligatory rest areas along the way, as he takes the reader for an incredible ride that had me turning pages hand over fist in anticipation of what was to come. Some of the science is questionable, but Crichton surely makes it all sound more than plausible. The only real problem with the novel is a logical breakdown of sorts in the concluding chapters. Still, the desperate attempts of the remaining explorers to survive, when they cannot even trust one another, make for a riveting reading experience. Sphere is by no means a perfect novel, but I found it captivating and basically addictive up until the somewhat disappointing ending. The movie adaptation takes significant liberties with the original story, so I would urge you not to let the movie's failings prevent you from immersing yourself in this eminently readable novel."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"You've got to give it to Michael Crichton: he writes one heck of a page-turner. Open one of his books with the idea that you'll just read a chapter or two before bedtime and you'll suddenly be bleary-eyed at three in the morning. And although this particular title, which is somewhat less well known than such Crichton novels as THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN and JURASSIC PARK, it still packs a bestseller wallop.The premise is classic Crichton. In his younger days, psychologist Norman Johnson was approached by the United States government to write a report on the psychological impact of an encounter with extra-terrestrials--and now, on the basis of his rather flippant recommendations, he finds himself en route to a possible UFO crash sight on the floor of the Pacific ocean. Once established with his colleges in an underwater habitat, the government team encounters a mysterious space craft that contains a still-more mysterious sphere, and those who come into contact with it undergo an unexpected change.The writing is crisp and clean, the hard science is handled quite skillfully, and Crichton plays out his story at a breathless pace: yes, a page-turner if ever there was one. Still, it is worth noting that SPHERE displays Crichton's weaknesses as clearly as it does his strengths. Strictly speaking, Crichton hasn't had an original concept in some thirty years, and just as he rehashed his screenplay for WESTWORLD into the novel JURASSIC PARK, so does he rehash THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN into SPHERE. The novel also contains both the foundational sexism and ambiguous conclusion so typical of Crichton's work.Ultimately, SPHERE is popcorn: we've all had it before and you can't make a truly satisfying meal of it. But it is tremendously enjoyable all the same, and where is SPHERE is concerned... well, you'll eat every kernel in the bowl.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Intriguing as always, exciting from the first page, strong for the first 2/3rds and less \\"editorializing\\" than usual, but it's just not as good as his higher concept novels. But it's still very enjoyable all the way through, and as always makes you think. It feels a little dated now, but I re-read it last week and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Sphere should definitely be a part of any Crichton fan's library. Skip the movie, though. Here, the science is less \\"convincing\\" than in Jurrassic Park (which is mostly convincing, but stretched) and Prey (which is better writing and fun, but not convincing). But that doesn't matter, because Crichton can write an adventure like few others (as long as character isn't important--character's here take backseat to concept and science). Pace, as always is good. More a rollicking adventure than \\"something to think about\\" (typical of later novels) and quite enjoyable on that level. It's the kind of novel you'll tear through in a weekend at most. And that's a good thing."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"If you are a sci-fi fan this is a must read book. Sphere starts out with a so called alien &quot;crash&quot; in the Pacific Ocean. The most odd scientists are called in and are told to keep quiet about what they are about to see. They are astonished at what they find, because nobody can figure out what this huge sphere is. None of the scientists know how to explain it until one scientist goes inside. Unexplainable phenomena start happening to all of them. All of their lives are in danger but will they come out alive? This is the only sci-fi book that I have ever enjoyed maybe that is because of crichton's phenominal writing stlye. This qoute helps the reader get involved into the book and make them want to keep reading. &quot;A thousand feet beneathe the ocean surface in the middle of the pacific, something has been discovered. Its origin, its structure, its malevolent energy are baffling. But whatever it is, it can each your mind. It knows your worst fears. And now it's starting to make those fears come true.&quot; I thought that the begining was very slow and boaring, but after they got off the helicopter the story took off and I never put it down after that. The characters were well developed, and you knew what kind of scientist they were and how they would contribute to the discovery to the sphere. Thoughtout the story I could tell what was going on. Crichton used great imagery, especially when discribing what it was like inside the sphere. It felt like you were there with the scientists. The symbolism in this story was great, the sphere symbolized technology. It shows that technology if not known how to use can be very dangerous. This is represented by what happens to them. The stories theme is very similar, saying that not all technology is good. The drawbacks of this book would have to be the lack of development of technical terms used thoughout the story. Most people know what a black whole is but for those who don't Crichton needs to tell us what it is. There are many other scientific and math terms that I didn't understand."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read this book this summer and I think it is his best to this day. A team of scientists set out to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to examine a spaceship that crashed to the bottom three hundred years ago. There is the calm and wise Norman Johnson, the attractive and determined Beth Halperin, the brilliant and befuddling Harry Adams, and the smart yet annoying Ted Fielding, all under the command of Harold Barnes, a Captain in the U.S. Navy. They quickly gain access and discover the ship operational, and they discover a metallic sphere. But when they are cut off in a storm, they must discover the power of the sphere and confront its great powers. lest everyone get killed. I was genuinely sad when it ended. This book is Crichton's best and it is the best I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books. If you are looking for a white-knuckle ride to terror on the bottom of the ocean, this book is your ticket, and this review is your boarding call. Buy it today, because I guarantee you, you will want to re-read this one. Even if you aren't a fan of Crichton, pick this book up today and start reading. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I was enthralled by this book from the very beginning. Imagine, scientists discover an ancient spaceship at the bottom of the ocean only to discover it's true origin is a little closer to home.I have loved every Chrichton novel and this one was no different, at first. The story was tense, thrilling and the very last chapter killed the entire book for me. I won't give it away but the conclusion felt like a huge rip-off. I know I wasn't the only one who felt this way."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"In \\"Sphere\\", a team of brilliant scientists are taken to a deep sea lab, miles below the waves, to investigate a mysterious object that turns out to be a spacecraft. Rather than extraterrestrial, the ship appears to be the product of an advanced human civilization of the future (and the grave of several of those futuristic humans). How the craft came to bend the rules of time is only one tidbit left to the debate of the scientists. The team hasn't enough time to decode the mystery of the spacecraft before they find an even deeper mystery in its hold - a large spherical object clearly of non-human origin. Its purpose unknown, but possibly holding the essence of the intelligence that created it, the sphere soon makes its presence felt far beyond the spaceship. Returning to their lab, but unable to return to the surface immediately, the team finds the lab surrounded by mysterious mutations of undersea life. A larger, though invisible creature makes appearances on the sonar screens. Then the team begins receiving messages from an unknown entity...called Harry. Friendly at first, Harry becomes cranky, then malicious.This was actually a great book. Though it's not entirely original (trap a bunch of eggheads in some remote place where they've got to fill each other's heads with technobabble and psychogibberish) for a Crichton novel, there are variations on his general theme - a strong central character, and a supporting cast. Rather than try and get these guys to work with each other, we soon suspect that at least one of them is working with the sphere. The mystery of the sphere itself remains suitably mysterious and, by necessity, we are spared the indignity of having some character solve the mystery for us simply by telling us what it all means. I'm no fan of Crichton's writing, but I enjoyed \\"Sphere\\"."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book doesn't fail to deliver the thrilling suspense that you would expect from a Crichton. This winding tail of suspense and mystery keeps you guessing until the finale. Norman Johnson, a psychologist, is called to inspect an &quot;airplane&quot; crash in the middle of the south pacific. Little does he know the airplane that he has been sent to inspect is not an airplane at all. It is a spacecraft. A spacecraft that has lain there for 300 hundred years. THe coral covered spacecraft has a secret that was never meant to be discovered, a sphere of &quot;alien&quot; origin. When the sphere never fails to intrigue the personnel of the &quot;top secret&quot; crash site, all hell breaks loose.This thriller is a mix of three books. It has the psychology from &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; a setting of &quot;20,000 leagues under the Sea,&quot; and it has the suspense that Crichton marinates all of his books in. Crichton never ceases to amaze and astonish with his mix of science fiction and action. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Crichton, or any science fiction book. I have read &quot;Eaters of the Dead,&quot; &quot;THe Andromeda Strain,&quot; &quot;Timeline,&quot; and &quot;Sphere.&quot; &quot;Sphere,&quot; I think, is the best.

It's filled with mystery and suspense from beginning to end as it follows a group of people who are sent to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and have to live in these specially designed compartments as they research a spacecraft that has been sitting on the ocean floor for many centuries. In it is a black sphere, which puzzles everyone as they spend the rest of the story trying to understand its purpose while also trying to survive these strange but dangerous events that occur more and more frequently as the plot progresses.Crichton does a great job structuring an entirely unpredictable novel, filling it with so many surprises, twists and turns, and some interesting characters as well. You never really have a clue what's going to happen next, and the story keeps you guessing until the very last sentence. All the questions and mysterious elements in the plot are answered and gradually woven together by the end, and it leaves the reader with a feeling that the story might not be \\"entirely\\" finished (you can tell Crichton did that intentionally to keep the readers wondering what, if anything, might happen next). \\"Sphere\\" is a flawless and perfectly executed novel. It's a great page-turner, and is possibly the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"It is usually hit or miss with a Crichton novel. This one falls somewhere in between. The story is intriguing but suffers from some gaps of logic. SciFi is great but to make it plausible, the author has to make it possible for you to relate to the people in the story line. In \\"Sphere\\" it is rare when one of the characters acts as you would expect you might act in a similar circumstance. At least this wasn't written deliberately like a screenplay as was \\"Prey\\" which was, I believe, a transparent attempt to force a movie out of the book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is one of the best Sci-Fi books I have ever read.

It was pretty scary, the first time around. But a few years later, I reread it. Since I knew the ending, the main action scenes no longer scared me, and I ended up picking out all the faulty parts of the book. Crichton seems to have a bad habit of stereotyping his characters to the point of annoying his audience - Ted is the ambitious astrophysicist who fails poorly at being well-rounded (though he tries), Harry is the know-it-all black mathematician who predicts doom (if you've read Jurassic Park and Lost World, it sounds familiar and gets rapidly old), Beth is the feminist on constant PMS, and Barnes is the angry boss who lacks foresight. Their behavior gets really predictable, even if you allow that they are under a lot of pressure (no pun intended).

Whereas Crichton's other novels deal with technology and the caution humans should have with its ramifications, \\"Sphere\\" ventures deeper, into the power of the human subconscious. I should have, after reading of Crichton's adventures with alternative medicine in \\"Travels,\\" expected something of this sort to crop up eventually. Given that it probes more psychic (\\"deeper\\"?) questions than the other books, the plot and setting are much more restricted. However, the explanation of \\"Sphere\\"'s phenomena is much less satisfying than those of Crichton's other books, and overall I found \\"Sphere\\" much less satisfying."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"By far the best stay-up-late novel by Crichton.

The novel is set in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in an underwater lab. A mysterious ship is discovered, with gadgets and equipment far into the future. A team of elite scientists are sent to the lab to discover more about this strange ship. Soon, Norman Johnson, lead psychology scientist is standing next to the space ship, only to discover that the ship is not from another planet, but from the future. But as soon as they venture deeper into the ship, more and more strange things are starting to happen. Animals that would normally be crushed by the water pressure start appearing; a hurricane strikes, trapping all of the scientists in the water. And suddenly, even without any power the computer starts receiving messages from an unknown source. Norman thinks its proof of an alien, but no one believes him. Soon a giant squid that can understand what they say starts attacking the lab. It destroys most of the lab and most of the crew and scientists. With limited food supply, Norman travels into the space ship in search for food, but instead he finds an alien object, a perfect sphere. Knowing that he may be the first to be in contact, Norman enters the sphere. Only to be confronted by his own unconscious mind. He gets the power to change things with his imagination. As he tries to change everything that has happened to the lab, the remaining two scientists show a nasty surprise. Both of them have been to the sphere, so all three's power contradict each other. Finally, when Norman and another survivor team up to destroy the lab and set sail back to the surface. Although the story gets really confusing, the book is a terrific read. And should definitely be read by all Crichton fans."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Like others who have written reviews about Sphere, I could NOT put it down. I had to read the other half in one day before I even started my school work. Sphere, of course, is about a group of men and women from different backgrounds selected by the Navy to go down to the depths of the Pacific in order to investigate a very large spacecraft..... possibly of alien origin.Down there however, Crichton turns the novel into a thrilling mind game with a surprise in the last 20-30 pages. Norman and the others must not only discover the purpose of this craft and any technology in it, but must also discover it before time runs out in the habitat and on themselves as well.

Michael Crichton has a gift for starting a novel in such a way, that you can't put it down. However, he has an equal gift for losing his steam and completely blowing an ending. Sphere is a prime example. This book should come with a warning: DO NOT READ THE LAST 20 PAGES.

I have to say that while Michael Crichton has written some great (and not so great) novels, this one is my favorite. Admittedly I am slightly biased (with good reason, I think) because it has a special place in my thoughts above all of the other fiction I have read. This is the novel that really opened my eyes to reading. It was one of the first \\"grown up novels\\" that I ever read back in 7th grade, and ever since Sphere I have read insatiably. For me, no book had ever combined so many exciting scientific ideas with such burgeoning action, suspense, and artistry. As I read it now I still relive those feelings and have yet to find a novel that can top it.Crichton isn't known for his flowing prose or incredible dialogue, but what he does well (maybe the best) is he combines scientific themes with a very readable and engaging plot, and this creates incredibly appealing and imaginative novels. If Crichton is the best at this type of novel, Sphere is Crichton's best at doing what he does best! The science makes it compelling, and the story line is absolutely engulfing. What sets Sphere a part from other novels though is its excellent plot twists. Until the end, questions such as \\"what is the alien?\\", \\"how will the characters deal with it and each other?\\" leave the reader frantically flipping through the pages. These will get answered by an outstanding plot twist which never disappoints. In contrast to many novels that contain plot twists but ultimately fail to satisfyingly wrap up the story, Sphere delivers. I would impel anyone who wants to read any science fiction, or wants to read some Crichton: start with Sphere, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The writing in this book was really good.

Not because he could take such a task seriously. The last thing he expected, years later, was to find himself applying his study's conclusions in real life. But here he is, nevertheless. On his way to a habitat beneath the Pacific Ocean, with a team he hand picked - just long enough ago so that its members aren't exactly the same people they were when he selected them. The habitat has been set up for easy access to a sphere that's been lying on the ocean's floor for 300 years.No 53-year-old in average (less than optimum) physical health belongs where the Navy has decided Norman Johnson should go. He realizes that as he and the rest of the first contact team, of which he is a member rather than the leader, explore the ancient spaceship. When a storm forces the Navy to withdraw surface support, stranding the team, Norman finds out exactly how right he was in some of his theorizing. He also finds out how wrong he was.Sphere is Crichton at his best. The ensemble cast of this novel rings true as the plot sweeps them from crisis to crisis, through twist after twist.

The team Norman recommended for just such an occasion has already been assembled and he's been included. But what they all find is more powerful and dangerous than anyone imagined.I found the story slow-moving and almost dull until it got near the end. Yes, the end was pretty exciting, but this just wasn't a thrilling page-turner like some of Crichton's books. The idea was very interesting but the book just didn't have the momentum to keep it exciting.

Sphere is one of those books that you cannot put down; there is not one dull part in this novel. Crichton writes so descriptively that the situation could be real. I found so many mysteries and questions in this book, and when they were resolved, the solutions blew my mind away.Sphere is filled with action, suspense, and mystery and fills my imagination even now. Anyone who reads this book will definitely enjoy it, and will keep wanting more."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I apologise to the reader and to Sir William Shakespeare for leaving that irresistable typo in the title bar. By the time I got to the section of Crighton's novel where the remaining characters began to realize that their subconcious was the enemy and the alien sphere was the facilitator, the words &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; bubbled up. This great Sci Fi movie was based on the same theme--that man, exploring the unknown for more power, will find himself too imperfect to handle power, if he gets too much. &quot;The Tempest,&quot; by Shakespeare, first explored this theme, perhaps based on his experience with potentates that obtained more power than they could properly use.The plots of all three stories follow the same basic plan, with more than coincidental similarities between the characters of each, though in Crichton's novel the secondary explorers come upon the primary discoverers of the &quot;power&quot; after they have all killed themselves with it. The characters experience,in the body of each story, a discovery phase in which they come to realize that they have absorbed the power and that their own conscious (Shakespeare) and unconscious (Forbidden Planet screenplay and Crichton) lusts and dreads are wreaking havoc by &quot;materializing,&quot; &quot;manifesting,&quot; themselves through the power. (Shakespeare didn't have the benefit of Freud so he was limited to exposing the unintended consequences unleashed by Prospero's conscious use of the magic he discovered on a distant island.)All three stories end with the survivors judging man too immature for the power they have experienced. Each set of survivors decides to deny the rest of us access to this power and commits the appropriate destructive act at the end.Both Shakespeare and &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; are required reading/viewing. Crichton, I found exciting, initially--the opening of &quot;Sphere&quot; was novel, and portended a great follow-through--but the book settled into an all-to-familiar Hollywood thriller plot-line. I found the novel a bit too self-serious, and the way the author managed to have the &quot;power&quot; kept out of humanity's hands seemed, to me, a cute but unsatisfying contrivance.Two other works come to mind: &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and Vonnegut's &quot;Dead Eye Dick.&quot; The plots are not close, but the themes seem similar to the above. I would appreciate other reader's views, greatly."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"...this book should come with a warning label. It has more addictive qualities than popcorn! If you allow yourself five pages of this book you are soon sinking into the depths of the ocean, trying to discover the new force that is reaking havoc within the minds of the inhabitants. A visitor from some other place (at first known simply as &quot;Jerry&quot;) makes contact with the characters and suggest's at first that he is child-like and a sort of &quot;Get along with everybody&quot; kind of personality. He makes contact via their computer consoles from what they believe comes from a newly discovered orb that had been hidden in the depths...But soon after Jerry unknowingly uses a power so strong that people start dying. In forceful and almost completely unpredictable ways, they are destroyed, perhaps by something not so foreign as expected. Could this power be coming from...their own selves. Or, is there indeed a being of supreme unwitting power that harmlessly enjoys his new visitors in deadly and fatal ways? Read the book. It's still a pleasure after 3 reads. HI HELLO I AM FINE - MY NAME IS JERRY - I WILL KILL YOU NOW.

Besides utterly improbable characters, the ending is a total disappointment. I can't believe I stuck with it all the (ugh) way to the end."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I loved the movie &quot;Sphere&quot;. BUT..and I say BUT...the book is way more intense, graphic, and frightening. Let me give you a good, lip-licking glimpse into Michael Crichton's underwater suspense. Norman Johnson once wrote a &quot;What-If&quot; report for the President of the US. He was a psychologist who dealt with survivor guilt and plane-crash sites, helping victims to &quot;move on&quot;. His &quot;What-If&quot; report was commissioned as a step-by-step process the government should follow if we ever encountered alien life-forms. Norman wrote the report, and included a list of people he felt were qualified to be part of a &quot;team&quot; to confront any would-be aliens. Years go by....Norman gets a phone call and is told he is needed at a plane-crash site. His is flown out to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean...and what do you know! All the people he once listed in his &quot;What-If&quot; report are THERE with him!..on an ocean liner..awaiting classified information. They are eventually told about a &quot;fin&quot; protruding from the ocean floor..it is actually just part of a spacecraft embedded below the surface. Weird thing is, it's been there for probably thousands of years (according to coral growth on it) but appears to be something futuristic. Norman, and his team go down to look at it and eventually make there way inside the craft. His &quot;What-If&quot; team ( that doesn't seem so what-if anymore) includes himself, Beth Halpern, a zoologist; Harry Adams, a gifted mathematician; and Ted Feilding, a geologist. Together they live in an underwater habitat, running tests, and calculating what the ship really is , or more importantly, WHEN or WHERE it's from. Eventually the team enters the ship and discover it's secrets...including a luminous, evading &quot;sphere&quot;. Those who interact with the sphere develop &quot;powers&quot;. After contemplating and studying the sphere, STRANGE things begin to happen...mysteries and monsters that can only be explored by reading this book. Come on..I can't give it away!....But I promise you will be clinging to whatever chair you sit in to read this book! It is so well written...not a single sentence or character is wasted. I do suggest following the book with the movie, but keep in mind, the movie leaves out many weird and frightening aspects of the book! So read the book first, and rent the movie after-It's got an all-star cast. I'll just leave you with one last hint...Crichton knows how to tap into the power of the mind!!! Beware of your subconscious. :)"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I vividly remember when I read Sphere that I thought it would play better as a movie; and if people think the movie is a bit meandering and weird, the book is certainly the same. Crichton gives us three partial stories for the price of one, but unfortunately none of them ever seem to click.The book opens with an extremely promising, thought-provoking concept that is too quickly and unfortunately abandoned: Beneath the modern-day ocean a ship thought to be alien, sunken for three hundred years, turns out to be American-built, having apparently traveled through time to get there. There's no sign of any crew, and the flight recorder only gives them a hint to how the ship got there. It's a great story at that point, but there Crichton decides to deal with the one oddity found aboard: The sphere.Without getting too much into the specifics, it's enough to say that the second two partial stories don't do the first one justice. We get a bit of mystery over what's inside the sphere, and what (if anything) might be trying to communicate and how. Then follows a tale of paranoia as the characters each have different suspicions about what's going on, and none of them can be sure whether they can even trust themselves. It all ends on an unsatisfying note, having accomplished little or nothing.It seems clear that there was no set theme to Sphere, and as a result the story fragmented under stress. It started out so promising, but the really juicy and fascinating questions were never answered. To me the mystery of the ship and its origins and history was far more intriguing than the mystery of the alien sphere, yet the former was sacrificed to bring on the rest of the story. Having read some real classics, I don't count this among them; Sphere was a novel without direction or purpose, that seemed more like a bad echo of Forbidden Planet than an original work. In some ways it's an interesting read, but I wouldn't rank it too highly on the reading list."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I thought JURASSIC PARK was the best book I ever read... than I stumbled across SPHERE! It's a tale about a group of experts from various fields coming together to investigate something that might be alien. Of course what they discover is even MORE alien- themselves! What they find is a key to the human brain, what it can do, where it can lead us, and just how dangerous it can be if we unite it with other intellectual centers in our bodies, phisical and emotional. It's the smartest book I've ever read, topped off with too-die-for charictors, amazing action, and monsters only the human mind can be responsible for in this chaos we call our world. It is ours- and, as they learn, its ours to shape and form however we desire. We see a white male, a female, and a black man reacting to each other, hostile to each other, and trying to survive together... from themselves! Everywhere they go they're confronted with newer problems, dead ends, and impossible goals. But don't get me wrong. Anyone with half a brain can enjoy this fast-paced tale. Wether you're a fan of Extraterrestrials, ocean creatures, the human mind, ESP, or a little heart-stopping action, SPHERE is the book for you, providing all that with fear and more! And the ending is superb. Another great part about this is that it's NOT open to any sequils, because sequils tend to ruin good stories like these. It is a self-contained story. It's too bad we didn't see anything happen between the white man and woman, though. That would have put the story over the top! So SPHERE is one I'm highly recommending. What a great book. It's better than a slice of cheese- take it from a mouse."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is Micheal Crichton in his finest form. Enriched by Crichton's medical background and technical knowledge, Sphere keeps you believing even through the most inplausible plot twists.

I never read books twice, but this one was so good, I had to!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was a great book to read and you will find yourself doing it over and over again.

Even though theres some scientific mistakes in it! A funny, suspenceful book worth buying. Congrats, Mike ;-)!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book was great. It was like it sucked you into it. Great for a normal Crichton reader and awesome for any reader. It is just different, and in a good way. A sci-fi thriller that you can't put done.

Great for all readers alike, and a must for a sci-fi freak."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I sort of doubted sphere would be different, like all other crichton books; lots of science, and way to complicated.

This time Crichton takes the age-old science fiction formula--a spaceship crashed to earth--only this time its at the bottom of the sea. And if you're talking surprises and original twists to the oldest of formulas, that barely scratches the surface of the treasures waiting in this book. Norman Johnson is a brilliant hero, and the rest of the cast are equally likeable. Scary, thrilling, and in some parts knee-slappingly hilarious (the scene where the scientists bicker like children outside the space ship's door is one that will stay in my memory forever), this has the perfect blend of everything needed for a successful and enjoyable Crichton bestseller. Perhaps not just as original as his other undisputable classics (&quot;Airframe&quot; and &quot;The Lost World&quot;), but still miles ahead of the much-acclaimed &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot;. Like one reviewer has said, this is 'typical Crichton'--which is more than good enough for me."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"When I started this book I would read about fifty pages and put it down, but then one day, when I was about half way through, I read for about two hours until I finished it.

After I finished I was still thinking about it and who caused which things to happen (if you read it you know what I'm talking about). I've never read a book that cause me to think so much. It was really great. It had action like Jurassic park and scientific stuff like Andromeda Strain. Anyway read it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"marvelous!

It comfused me in the way that it was taking you to different places and it seemed to go on and on. But then when I read it over again to see why I could not understand it I began to understand it. The book had a colorful meaning and was beautifully written. Most of the time I could not put the book down. I just had to read it. When I finished the book it seemed to just end. I think that Micheal should right another book called Sphere 2: Discovered again. it should be in the far future when they learn what really was down there.

I just love this book and the efforts he put into it.Besides a wonderful storyline, the character development and the imagery were excellent. This book is a must read short and simple. Again, by no means does the movie give this book justice. I found myself never wanting to put this book down, and wished it could have gone on for 1000 pages.Enjoyable for both Crichton fans and those new to his work."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"One only has to read through the the sheer amount of time and effort that went into this book to realsie that Crichton has created a novel that really leaves the reader desperately grasping for a definitive answer to the end of the book. Because, you see, the whole purpose of this novel is to question. Ask oneself what are our TRUE fears? By the conclusion of this epic adventure I do not think that even Crichton knows the answer. And why should he? He is only really setting the agenda for deep and intense discussion.The way in which the book is formated, you gain a feeling of order and stability. I mean look at it, nicely ordered sections, roughly around the same size. But, within this regimented set-up, there lies the probing uncertainty of the human mind. Like most of his novels, technological detail is reasonably paramount. And this indeed aids the reader to have a greater understanding of exactly what they are attempting to contemplate.But, Michael Crichton leaves what are his usual surroundings and explores an area that can never quite be defined. As already mentioned, he delves into psychology, which subsequently engulfs all the characters and drags the reader helplessly along with it.This novel shows that Crichton is an extremely versatile writer. Not merely sticking to what he does best (mainly adventures) but showing that he can cover a large spectrum of issues that all of us can relate to in one way or the other.Fantastic read! Buy it, read it, and then re-read it!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This Book is the coolest.

I'm sure who ever reads this book will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Once again the Admirable Crichton produces a scientific thriller (not that that is all he can write ~ see &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; for something completely different). Likable characters, put into a stressful situation not of their own causing, let's see what happens. This time the cause is a vehicle, later shown to be carrying a sphere of alien manufacture from the other side of a black hole. The sphere has some interesting effects, including, apparently, an alien entity waiting to be released. Oh, and all this is at the bottom of the ocean ~ a thousand feet down in the Pacific, to be exact ~ not the ideal location for a stressful situation to deteriorate. As just about always with Crichton, he has produced a highly readable, well plotted novel. The characters are distinct enough that we can tell them apart, and they are not so sympathetic that we mourn as they die. There are, as usual, a few questionable moments, both in the plotting ~ are we seriously to believe that our fiftythree year old protagonist can make his way, without a suit, out of one hatch, around the living environment, back in through another, on one breath of air, in the dark and cold (a thousand feet under, don't forget) ~ and in the science ~ how is the huge vehicle (a half mile long) expected to have travelled through a black hole without tidal forces tearing it apart? For that matter, how can the scientists be certain of the ship's origin? Without trying to give too much away, the only source of that information is a two digit figure which is automatically extrapolated into a precise year. Foolishness ~ hasn't Crichton noticed that &quot;43&quot; could mean &quot;1243&quot;, &quot;1943&quot;, &quot;2043&quot;, or &quot;3043&quot;? But let me not be argumentative (there are a few other points i could raise); the book is strong, readable, complete ~ for what it is. Just don't rely on Crichton for a scientific education."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I have recently read Sphere by Michael Crichton. I found this book to be filled with adventure and intrigue. It follows a very intelligent psychologist, Norman Johnson. He is sent to what he thinks is a plane crash site. He normally goes to them to help the families cope with the loss of loved ones. He thought it was just a routine job and that he would be home shortly, he was wrong. The government called him in to research an underwater spacecraft with a team of experienced scientists. He set up the team and went underwater into a habitat to study the craft. He gets more and more involved as the team enters the craft. The suspense starts to build up when they enter the ship and terrible things happen to the crew. As they venture further into the craft they find a shiny silver ball about the size of a large merchant ship. They enter the ship and that's when everything goes wrong. The sphere seems to be able to look into their minds and know what they are thinking. It will carry out the task that that person is thinking about. As the story develops more, each team member gets scared for their lives and starts to distrust one another. The sphere begins to carry out terrible tasks and many team members lose their sense of sanity. Norman has to take complete control of the team and make sure that the rest stays sane and in a working manner. As the sphere gets more and more violent, the team has to make a choice between leaving and forgetting about a scientific breakthrough or continue on with their important investigation."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"In the middle of the ocean a spacecraft was found, a team of scientists were all brought down 1,000 feet under water to find out where this thing came from and why it is here.

At first, looking at the books design(atleast with the three copies I have) you wonder, what could possibly be within the spiral of numbers, and why would a man be standing like a shadow facing the spherical oblivion. As soon as you start reading, you can not put it down unless you haven't an imagination. Even if your mind allows a possible picture from the words of this book, you'll be hooked. It plays like a movie - indepth looks at possible psyche's in the given situation without flaunting too many, or too little detail. Once you realize what your up against in the book, from page one, you will become a viewing character that silently watches the displays around you. If you are claustrophobic I do not recommend reading this book. Also if you cannot hold you breath for atleast the length of several pages, don't dare touch it.

He could have written text books. This story is a good way to learn some science while reading a real page-turner. I would have liked to learn more about the vanished crew of the ship. Couldn't they have left videos? And the oceanic life forms that mysteriously appear and vanish. Have they been conjured up by someone's mind? My chief complaint is that Norman, the psychologist complains about all scientists, as though they go around inventing means of destruction. What about the pure scientists who are interested in how the world works and, generally, disinterested in what other people choose to do with their discoveries? Norman would have them sit around watching TV instead of doing science. Never mind that without \\"science\\" we wouldn't have TV. Again, this is a page turner and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"In Sphere, Michael Crichton tells the story of a group of civilians and military personnel who are sent to a base one thousand feet under the waters of the Pacific Ocean to investigate a spaceship that crash-landed there over three hundred years before. Nothing prepared them for what they discover inside.Sphere is a perfect example of Crichton's ability to put the \\"thriller\\" into \\"techno-thriller\\". While there is the ever-present danger of physical violence and bodily harm, there is also a more subtle yet equally dastardly threat lurking underneath - the possibility of losing one's sanity. While, the pace has been, accurately enough, described as cinematic, the narration often pauses to discuss both the scientific and philosophical implications of the surrounding action. The musings on extra-terrestrial life and advanced technology do a good job of highlighting the limits of human perception and imagination. However, I don't find this to be one of Crichton's strongest works. I felt that even though Crichton is a great storyteller, there was a missing element in Sphere - and some of the action felt like it was an endless string of calamities intended to exhaust both the characters and the readers. Of course, herein lies one of the successes of the book - how well it conveys the desperation and exasperation of being trapped in such a small secluded place with dangers unknown. By the end of the novel, it feels like Crichton has taken an exceptionally well-crafted idea that is left underutilized and leaves the reader hoping for more."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I would describe myself as a person who doesn't read much yet I read 'Sphere' strait through.

I've heard from friends over the years that as far as first-contact stories go, this one is right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey. All due respect to Mr. Crichton, but I found this story far from achieving that sort of excellence. Of course the setting of Sphere doesn't lend itself to the same grandeur of scope found in Clark's work.

I have seen the movies which most probably fall short of his vision for the page. I remember watching Sphere and remember thinking that it was ok but the book was great. It was hard to put it down. He has an ability to keep you guessing, complex stories that are interesting and educational. What I like most of all was amount of academic information he gives to the reader about explaining what is happening. Some writers will apply certain ideas to develop their stories but lack the amount of knowledge to make it believable. Michael Crichton has both the knowledge and ability to put it into a story and not turn a novel into a textbook. He does lack some development of character which is made up in the story. Now I know why most of all his books have become major motion pictures. I am now reading Timeline and have a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is my favorite book. This book was the first book of Michel Crichton I ever read and ever since his books have been he best. Like all his books you read a great adventure, while having it backed up by true facts. Therefor making it a realistic story, making it the more thrilling and scary. Read it even if you dont like Sci-fi. I didn't and i still dont, i ony like his. There is knowone better. No book better. Oh yeah, I have read it 3 times and working on my forth."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is magnificint, a real page turner. I was too young when I watched the movie to remember much of it. However, I can't imagine how it could even begin to compare with the book. A big salute to Michael Crichton. I am definitly excited about reading more of his books.* A note to other readers and movie goers: It is NOT a big coninsidence that his excellent books become classic movies."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"You won't be able to put down this book. Keeps you reading and guessing until the very end."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book will grab ones attention from the beginning and is very difficult to put down. The only thing keeping this book from being a five star book is that it somewhat lacks in character development. The storyline is excellent as each page makes one wonder what will happen next. Overall a very good and fun book to read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book, which is much better than the movie by the way, is probably my favorite book. It takes place on the ocean floor a thousand feet down.The navy has discovered a spacecraft at the bottom of the sea, and sends a team to explore it. The main character, Norman, is a psychologist asked to join them to evaluate their behavior under the high stress environment. The team quickly discover that the spacecraft is of American origin, but from the future. They also discover that while it was in space, it picked up something and brought it home.The book is filled with excellent descriptions of undersea life and the hardware that is used to be able to explore the vast depths of the worlds oceans. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I remember the first time I read this novel, the further into it I went, the more excited I became and the harder it was to stop reading and turn out the night lamp. It's not easy nowadays to find that in a novel. All the reviewers say, &quot;It'll keep you up all night!&quot; but they rarely keep you up at all. This book is incredible, and incredibly fun. It delivers exactly what it promises, packed full of smile-inducing images and appropriate, quick writing. If you're looking for a good sci-fi novel, underwater story, or both, then look right here. You'll be glad you did. And try with all your might to forget that this was ever turned into a film...."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere has to be one of the best books ever. This book was my first BIG book ever. I wasnt really sure what it was about but soon I found out what it was about.I liked how Mychael Crichton made the story seem so real. It actually seemed that the ship was actually real. There wasnt to much action until the end which was great.The characters in the story were perfect. He couldnt of found any better chracters for this book.I think that if you ever get a chance to read this book to read it. If your going to read this book pay really good attention. This book is perfect for any age reader. I like the way Michael Critchton writes his books.I'd give this book a 10. This book had about everything in it like action, mystery, some love, and etc.."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Micheal Crihton scores big with this one. It is a non stop action suspense novel. You literally cannot put it down. I read it in about 3 days. It's even possible to read this in 1 because the action is that absorbing. Don't judge the book by the movie, which was unbelievably terrible. You literally feel the terror of the terror of the characters in this book. Michael Chriton's imagination shines through and his writing style keeps you intrigued from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I have enjoyed reading Crichton's books, and Sphere is the best. Combining interesting theory and thoughtful prose, he has written an original work of art."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book was very good. It had a lot of action in it and I liked it a lot. There was a lot of techinical stuff in it but it is real easy to understand if you like reading Crichton."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is my personal favorite. This book kept me up all night. It kept me on the edge of my seat and gave me chills at some point. I love everything he writes, but this one is the best of them all."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The movie was pathetic, I hope a swift recovery of the careers of all the fine actors lost in unplayable roles. The book was less stupid, but no less boring. You really have to worship Chrichton to get through it. It's one of his most techno-babble filled works, with precious little action. Still, he describes everything very well, especially the Jellyfish attack on Edmunds. Ending is less unimaginative than that of the movie, but still....come on. I recommend &quot;The Terminal Man&quot; or &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; instead. The movie may have lost more money than some people make in a lifetime, and it WAS based on this book. If you've seen the movie, read it so you can understand what was going on. Other than that, I see no real reason to torture yourself reading &quot;Sphere.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"this book sucked me in and kept me reading feverishly...exciting,mysterious,suspenseful.....a must read"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"this book sucked me in and kept me reading feverishly...exciting,mysterious,suspenseful.....a must read"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere was an action-packed thriller that is good for almost anyone. It is about a team of scientists that go to the bottom of the ocean to check out a 300+ year old spaceship and there are many thrilling compications. I thought the book was great."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton's book, Sphere, is an exciting thriller about a spaceship that is discovered on the bottom of the ocean floor. The setting is in the South Pacific. A group of scientists are sent down to the ship to find out more about it and where it came from. The results are very surprising as they find out the ship is over three hundred years old. They also find an amazing sphere that could not have been made by any humans. The scientists try to open it without success, or so they think. What happens next is a variety of strange events leading to misfortune and disaster. Is the sphere responsible? Does someone or something live on the ship? Who or what is transmitting messages onto the scientists' computers? All these questions can be answered by reading this book. I had a difficult time putting the book down. It kept me turning the pages, looking for what was going to happen next. I think this book is good for older readers. Sometimes it is hard to understand what is happening, but overall I thought this was a very well written book. It is a great book if you have read other titles by Crichton, such as The Andromeda Strain or The Terminal Man."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"A great book for readers of all ages. This book will keep you reading for many hours at a time. Save a rainy Saturday, find a comfortable chair and get ready to have fun reading."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is the first Michael Chrichton book I've read and judjing from how much I loved it, I can tell that it won't be the last. It started slow, but once I got past the first fifty pages I coudn't put it down. Each time you think you've got everything figured out Chrichton tosses another twist in the plot. The story reminded me a lot of Jules Verne or H.G. Wells. I didn't see the movie but after having read some of these reviews I'm glad I didn't. This is a great book and if you like scifi I definately recommend it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is unbeleivable, it keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to read more and more, I have read many books but this one is on the tope of my list, I would definately recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book that is interesting, and that has a great plot!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I've never been a fast reader, but after the first 20 pages, which I read in a few months, it took a week to read the next 80, but after that I read the next couple hundred pages in one sitting. After the first few chapters (which I've since found more interesting on more recent read-throughs of the book), the pace picks up and it's impossible to put down. Perhaps Michael Crichton's best book of all time. All in all, a wonderful and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is Crichton's second best novel. The Surface, the first part of this book, is the only flaw. It is boring but after that, the story gets rolling, and you can't put it down. Harry was my favorite character. Nothing like the movie. Crichton at the top of his game!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is the book at the top of Crichton's excellence line graph if he had one. Almost all of his books have always been packed with action but this one has the most. I think this was when Mike realized that he needed more action and less science (Andromeda Strain)."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere has an excellent plot and very good charcters. It kept me on the edge of my seat the hole time! When you think you know whats going on, everything changes! If you did'nt read it yet, I highly recomend it!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I began reading this book in St. Louis and ended up finishing on my way back from Hawaii. This riveting book can keep you up all night, filled with an assortment of characters which help contribute to the wonderful scientific plot which encourages mankind to explore himself. SPHERE has got astrophysics, psychology, marine-biology, and almost every other subject you'd like to know morea about. It plays more like a movie (Which makes up for the actual movie) with descriptive cinematic scenes and dialogue. God bless Mike."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Micheal Crichton is undoubtely one of the most compelling and intelligent authors of our time. And Sphere is the truth to that statement. Crichton's Sphere is captivating, and quick. The novel never leaves room for boredom, but instead room for anticipation and expectation. Crichton opens many different avenues to diffrent thoughts and ideas formulated by the reader, and the reader fills obligated to satisfy their judgement by completing the novel. Sphere has a constant forward pull that excites and compells the majority of those who read his works. Personally, I believe that this is one of his best. I also recommend Disclosure, and the Andromeda Strain."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is gripping at the start! I think that the idea that Crichton proposes is one of emense proportions. I read the book in a day, and I am an extremely slow reader! Don't read the book in the dark or late at night because it can get a little creepy! This is my favorite book of all time!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"There is no compare, Crighton is a brilliant writer, he can reach into the mind and bring out the trama within."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Though I'm already partial to his books, I can't begin to explain how enjoyable SPHERE was. If you've seen the movie, forget it, it doesn't even begin to touch the complexity and intelligence of the novel. SPHERE is one of the few novels I've ever re-read, and I've done so 4 or 5 times now. This is the first novel I've ever come across that brought concepts I'd studied in university physics and astronomy classes, and presented them in a way that was both fun and entertaining, not to mention understandable.That said, it was still one HELL OF A FUN RIDE! Do yourself a favour and pick it up, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. The suspense, and depth with which Chrichton wrote it is astounding. He really knows what he's talking about, and he's not just making up crap like most sci-fi authors."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read this book before the movie and was very dissapointed with the latter. The book is much, much better, and stands as one of the best works of fiction I've ever read. Not only for the vivid imagery and tense plot, but for the frightening dramatization of the inspiring, yet unnerving saga of the powerful human mind."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is one of the best sci-fi books I have read! It is sweet when the monsters attack. This book takes place in an underwater habitat on the bottom of the ocean floor. Anyone can enjoy this book- I was 11 when I first read it! A fantastic thiller for everyone!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Skip the movie. Read the book. The book is far more enjoyable"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I liked this book quite a bit. The mix of science fiction and mededine got my adrenaline flowing. I actually started to get scared for the people on the ship. It was amazingThere was one thing of the book that I did not like. Many of the words in the book were very complicated,for example, scientific words. This made some parts in the book very hard to understand.I recomend this book very highly to people who love suspense and danger and the fear of the book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is very hard to comprehend and then it begans to take a wild turn in things that nobody would want to know about if any thing would happen. This book seems to be very confusing in the begining and then it finally we the people get the point he is trying to make.Don't read this book unless you want to take along time doing so. Have a good peachtree day."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Exciting. Makes you think. Much better than the movie"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I'm only 12 and loved your book.I picked it up and could not put it down.It took me one day(actually 5 hours)to read your book.I was just so interested I kept on reading!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read!!! I encourage all who are interested, to read this book, you'll love it! I think that it was much better than the movie! Usually movies are more descpritive than books, but in this case the book is more descrpitive than the movie. I really loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Any Crichton fan who has not read this book is not a trueCrichton fan. This is his best book ever (except the ending...). BUYIT. You never really understand what the sphere really is, but that adds to the fun of the book. I suggest you disregard any negative comments about this book and get it NOW!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"M.C. demonstrates further (as if necessary!) the breadth of his imaginationin this story of undersea explorers who find more than they bargain for.Their discovery bends the very nature of reality.

This book, with it's unique blend of science fiction in a contemporary setting, keeps you flipping through the pages.I was, like many other readers, disappointed by the ending, however. This right there with &quot;The Firm&quot; for flat, uninspiring endings, in my opinion.Nevertheless, very much worth the read!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I've read em' all and this is Crichton's best.

I hopethe movie rules as much as the book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"If you are looking for non stop action as well as a scientificlearning expirience , you must consider this book . This is , in myopinion , Michael Crichton's greatest novel . It is captivating , mind challenging , and actually puts you in the novel as you try to unravel the mystery and predict what happens next . This book will catch your attention and involvement . It is an addiction and it will be hard to put down . If I could have only one book to recomend to a reader , this would definetly be it ."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book was probably Crichton's 2nd best novel. 1st beingJurassic Park. This book was a great adventure just like JP but mostparts seemed a little far-fetched. Which is kind of weird because if you walked up to someone and said Dinosaurs have been brought back to life, and then said The NAVY has found a spacecraft from the future, you would most likely believe the space-craft story. But with science Crichton has made you believe in Dino-rebirth more. The whole idea of creatures being made just because people have a dark side is a litte stupid. This book was great but comparing JP to it is like comparing King Kong to a fly."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"A MUST read for Chrichton fans. I don't know why people hatethe end of this book, I thought it was great! The supense is VERYCAPTIVATING! I found myself not able to put this book down. And neither will you!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I couldn't put it down. Crichton has done a remakable book that should be in every home in America."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Even though I have nothing against the movie based on this book, I think that no movie can do this book justice. Crichton is at his best here, developing a story that gets you involved from page 1 and doesn't let go. Just when you thought the story was interesting already, Crichton adds something new to get you involved even more. Plus, he builds suspense like no other author I've ever read can. The characters are utterly believable and interesting. Plus, just for the heck of it, he throws in an enigmatic ending that can cause heated debate among Sphere fans. I've figured it out, have you? Anyway, this is quite possibly the best book I have ever read and proves that Crichton is the best in his field."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Having read &quot;Sphere&quot; many years ago, I picked it up again to refresh my memory before seeing the movie based upon it. It was as I remembered it. An average Michael Crichton thriller. The characters were a bit stiff and one dimensional and the ending had a rushed feel to it. Above all the book left to many questions hanging. 1: Where did the ship/sphere really come from? With the powers it exhibited, it seemed likely that it created the image of an American ship from the future based upon expectations the discoverers had. I have no doubt had theobject been discovered by Russians or Japanese military it would have looked like it came from their future or another species. 2: Did the charaters lose the power, and did they really have it or was the sphere reading their mids and creating what they wanted?"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I couldn't put this one down. This book wastes no time, immediately drawing you into this fantastically unique and imaginative story. It pulls you in and doesn't let go until the last page. I read it all in one night! Oh, yeah, go see the movie if you read the book and like it. If you like the book, you'll like the movie."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Details is what I think is the most important part of the novel. SPHERE has enough detail to make you feel like your under the ocean with &quot;Norman&quot;, &quot;Beth&quot;, and &quot;Harry&quot; If you seen the movie, you need to read the book, because there more of the details about whats going on. SPHERE is one of few of Master Crichton novels I wish had another part (Rising Sun, Congo, Discloser are my other ones) to keep the fun and trill alive."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is one of the best books I have ever read. It is very original and very interesting. The book is exciting from start to finish. I found it impossible to put down. Although the ending was sort of a disapointment, the beginning and middle of the book more than makes up for it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I began reading the book yesterday and by the end of the night it was done, which is something I hardly ever do. I just couldn't put the book down. It kept me yearning for the next page."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"SPHERE is the best thriller novel since Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE. (THE SHAPE is also availabe on Amazon.com, or you can order it direct from the publisher for $14 + $2 shipping. Make check or money order to CJF. Send it to CJF, 1211 Starboard Way, Corona del Mar, CA 92625-1321. The reason I recommend buying it from the publisher, is they'll have the author autograph the book if you request it.) Anyway, SPHERE is almost as good as THE SHAPE, and that is a high recommendation!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere was a very good book, it reminded me of Ringworld. Though the book has poor character development and the characters are shallow, the premeis is good and makes for an erie sc-fi. Crichton should be strictly an idea man, his writing is bad, sometimes bordering upon terrible. For all of thoes who doubt me read &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;. After I read that waste of paper I was so disgusted that I almost threw-up right on the book. I wanted to get back the time I wasted reading it. &quot;Andromedia Strain&quot; wasn't much better. When he writes his books he sets the place, time period, and level of technology, and then blasts holes in them all. The only reason Crichton's books become best sellers is that his premis blinds readers to the implausibility, and they don't realise the holes until the end, if ever. He probably has powerful friends or relatives that owe him favors."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I am in love with the book, I have been for the past 4 years. Now that I have the movie to compare to I can say without a doubt that THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ENDING! It fits in perfectly with the disorted drama that encompasses the rest of the book and in now way brings down the rest of the book. I will defend this book, it's ending, and even the movie that didn't do justice to it outside the charecters."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I usually don't read Michael Crichton, but I saw this book on the bestseller shelf and, wanting a good read that would while away my New Year's holiday, picked it up. I can definitely see how much better this story will be as a movie, as the characters seem to cry out for an actor's interpretation to make me want to care about them. I was disappointed by how all the technobabble was wasted in favor of direct action. Still, the suspense is worthwhile and I feel I had paid a good price for the time I spent reading the book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is the most amazing book I have ever read. It goes from a Sci Fi novel, to a mystery who done it type in away. I am not going to spoil the ending to just keep your Imagination open and expect the unexpected!!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Okay, so I haven't read very many books before but this one was just one of the most awesome books. I didn't think it was the best since the reading was reletively easy though the plot kicked. Buy this book, trust me, you'll love it! Definite page turner."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The Book Was Great Until The End. It was a page turner, even at the end. I gave it a 9 because of the ending, but still good."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Its been a long time since I read this, but I thought it was pretty neat, except for one thing. How could someone go inside a sphere with a couple billion Christmas tree lights inside, and come out a virtual god. What's going on!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"While this was a really good book, I think it will make an even better movie. There are very few movies that are better than the books, but I think this will be an exception. The ending is astounding, and I can just see Samuel L.Jackson as Harry, and Sharon Stone as Beth, and Dustin Hoffman as Norman. Even Caroline Goodall and Rip Torn (Barnes of course.) Anyone agree..or have any suggestions for the movie?"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"it was very technical and real story. perhaps the best he has ever written. it kept me turning the pages. he used amazing characterization. it was vey thought provoking. it make you want to see if you have the same powers."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Crichton uses the sphere to perfectly describe each of the characters. The idea of the book will have you asking many questions of yourself, wondering if you may have the same &quot;powers&quot; as those people involved with the sphere. A great read, for all readers alike. -s.e."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The description was very detailed. I personally think that this is Crichton's best."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is definetly one of the best books ever. Michael Crichton takes you to the brink of suspense and never lets go. You'll never know what's next. The story of a salvage operation of a ship under water that appears to be many years old. Once inside they find a large sphere that can...........read and find out."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is one of the few novels is really couldn't put down before finishing it. Crichton succeeds in the first half of the story in building a powerful sense of mystery integrated in an admirably well-documented scientific and technical background. This background justified making the spaceship an american ship from the future as the only logical possibility. At this point, you can only expect the explanation to the mystery that is the sphere they find inside to be something extraordinarily imaginative, as the author dropped hints at what the possibilities are (I liked the idea of beings from a more than 4 dimensions world; how would they have interacted with our world? Our the possibility of time and space reversing roles.) Unfortunately, the author's imagination seems to suffer a breakdown in the second half of the book. Making the sphere a modern equivalent of the good old Aladdin's lamp, a device allowing one's to make anything one's wishes come true, was an easy and disastrous way out. Anyone who has ever tried writing knows there is no better way to kill the plausibility of your story than giving infinite powers to your characters (near the end, when Dr Goodman acquires these powers himself, why don't he uses them to get back home instantly and solve everything as if nothing happened instead of doing it the old, painstaking but more interesting way? And at the end, why don't the survivors use these same powers to resurrect their dead companions?) So after closing this book, we are left feeling a bit disappointed. It would be interesting to pick up this story from the middle and try to write a more imaginative conclusion."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I just couldn't finish this book!! It was so boring, I gave up on it after about 50 pages or so."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The ending of this book was so weak and unimaginative that it ruined the entire novel. It is as if Michael Crichton worte a great story and slapped the ending together as an afterthought. It has to be one of the worst books I have read and it all has to do with the &quot;Let's pretend nothing happened and it will all go away&quot; ending. After reading the novel I have lost all respect for Michael Crichton as an author. All his stories seem to have &quot;zero-impact&quot; endings. After all is said and done the worlds in which his novels take place are no different on the last page as they were on page one. This includes Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, that lame movie Demi Moore was in, and Sphere."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Cardboard characters purporting to be geniuses in their fields talk textbook drivel while acting like spoiled adolescents. This book makes me never want to read Crichton again. I read Disclosure and quite enjoyed it, but Sphere is preposterous. Not the ideas in it, which concern a spaceship found at the bottom of the ocean, time travel, and the nature of reality. No, all that I could digest. But the poor writing and thin characterizations were almost more than I could bear. Read the Dune series for a rich, complex and involved sci-fi adventure. Crichton is a lightweight and will be forgotten after his career is over and the publishers aren't pushing his cheap writing on us."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I have read little by Crichton. But whatever it was, it made me not enjoy his type of Science Fiction. Two of the few things that I did read were &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Sphere&quot;. Both, I thought, hopelessly losing their slowly developing content before me. &quot;Sphere&quot;, however, was an exception, for it was just a non-exaggeratingly empty roll of toilet paper with unwise words and a constant morphing of a worsening story. The story seemed promising and exalted me even when I looked at the appearingly deep-in-meaning cover. I must say that I was constantly saying to myself: &quot;What a good book this is!&quot; all the way till the four fifths mark. That's where things got so lousy that I even considered quitting on the book, something which I rarely do. To tell the truth, I couldn't believe what pure adulteration of a good initial plot my eyes were witnessing. I finished it, but with much regret and with four days of wasted night-life."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The philosophy of this book was well summed up by another review below. The Freudian Id that was present in other books has simply beeen replaced by Jung's famous shadow archetype. Of course we all know that creative artists love Carl Jung, and perhaps I'm being a bit shallow here and not letting myself be caught up in it enough, as someone reading a CREATIVE work should be. But if you've ever studied psychology and philosophy I think you'll probably be disappointed because you know too much already, and things will not be as dazzling as you hoped it would be.Freud said that knowledge really can ruin the sense of wonder and discovery, and it's kind of true here. But it's only 371 pages for the paperback edition. Unlike a Clancy Novel, there isn't any long backstory you have to read, and generally it's easy to become captivated by just the premise itself and the science. Better yet you really do not have to listen to these reviews if you do not want to. I loved both the Andromeda Strain and Sphere back when I read them in 7th grade, and I believe that is because I didn't have any expectations at all. Hype is really killer here. The movie, the fanfare, the &quot;dazzling reviews&quot;--they can really ruin any possibly enjoyment you might have of it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"If you're into space, excitement, and unbelievable things, you'll love Sphere by Michael Crichton. It has amazing ideas in it that will blow your mind away. Sphere has amazing mathematics that you will defineitely understand. It has great vocabulary, and descibes every moment so that you feel you're right there in the ocean with them.Sphere is about a trip one thousand feet down below the South Pacific Ocean. Why? Because there is a a three hundred year old spaceship resting on the ocean floor. A team of scientists are sent down to investigate on Navy orders. This spaceship is a mile long and is undamaged from the crash in the ocean. What the team finds is beyond their imaginations. Things that haven't even been invented yet! But the spaceship is three hundred years old!Inside the spaceship there is a grooved, metallic shere. The sphere is thirty feet in diameteer. It's not all metal, there's something inside it. Then all of a sudden, the computer inside their habitat starts giving many sets of numbers at different times. Harry (the mathematician and logician) and Ted (the astrophysicist and planetary geologist) start trying to figure the pattern out immediately. Finally, Harry finds it. By finding it, they can communicate with and alien that is probably either inside the sphere or inside the spaceship.The alien's name is Jerry. Norman (the psychologist) finds that Jerry is not only powerful, but also emotional. So what happens if Jerry gets mad? While Ted, Harry, Beth, Norman, and Barnes (the captain) are there, Edmunds (the camerawoman)dies because of some kind of poisonous jellyfish. In her place, Levy (the cook) has to do Edmund's job. She takes the tapes to the submarine, and dies on the way back. Does this have anything to do with the sphere? Maybe Jerry? Read the book to find out. I guarantee, it won't be a waste of your time."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends? I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading. I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book. But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end. That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel. This is \\"deus ex machina\\" in its finest form. This is unexcusable in my opinion. I just don't get it. I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages. I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book. This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"With so many good books written, don't bother with this one. Weak plot, page filling words and obvious situations with an obvious ending leaves this book as very ho-hum. Michael must have been under pressure from the publisher to pump this out. Read Timeline or Jurassic Park instead."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I was really enjoyed this book as my first book from Michael Crichton. It is well written, action packed, the story is really believeable with a good amount of scientific background info why the things are happening and why the characters can/cant't do what they want. The psychological part is also understandable. Of course the book is not equivalent with the movie version, if you have seen it already you will be familiar with the high level story but the book is always more.Four star is because the middle of the book was a bit boring, it was hard to continue the reading, but the ending was quite thrilling again. It's simply a must have if you like scifi thrillers.I had purchased the kindle edition, it is a five star quality ebook, formatting is good, it is justified, the non-text parts (codes, binary parts, etc) are well formatted, it is easy to read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This novel was wonderful! Full of twists and surprises. Michael Crichton couldn't write a boring novel if ho slife depended on it; The book was extremely interesting and very enlightening."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Like I said with Prey and Jurassic Park this book is very good, but also very graphic. If they do a remake of the Sphere movie (which currently garners a 12% &#34;rotten&#34; rating on Rotten Tomatoes) then I hope it is as good as this book (hopefully it won't be rated R or X or NC-17 or something.) :]"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Awesome book, I hate doing reviews but Amazon forces me. I wish I could just rate books like I used to."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is one of the books that hooked me on Crichton when I was a teenager - enough SF mixed with thriller elements to keep the pages turning, and also enough elements that make you think. Should be on everyone's reading list."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"one of his best books. (Some spoilers in my review) My only complains were that the beginning was a bit predictable (I was able to predict everything that was going to happen, knowing how the science would play apart: time machine, etc). However, by the middle, things were changing drastically and the book became unpredictable. Very exciting and very worth the read. Learn about oceans, potential aliens, and psychology."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"It's very easy to 'get to know' the main character and to see how he sees everyone around him. It's the right level of history, description, and opinion. The details of the book make it easy to BE there. I found the story engrossing, just the right level of confusing, and once I dug in I didn't stop until I had to. The ending it nicely tied together and leaves me with that little bit of \\"hmmmm, I wonder...\\" Great book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is an underrated classic by michael crichton, and if you are a fan of his writing, you should buy this book right away if u have'nt already!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book is a 21st century sci-fi materpiece! It is more than just a page turner. I have read it over many times since first reading it, and will continue doing so - as it packed full of action, adventure, and everything in it is part of the story, or to provide more adventurous entertainment for the reader."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"about 15 years ago I picked this book up and it set a bar for me. A well written suspenseful science fiction novel"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is probably the best book I have ever read. I could not seem to ever put it down, and I went out and rented the video as soon as I finished it. So many plot twists and suspense will keep you away from other work, and keep your head in this book. I urge anyone who reads this to buy this book, you'll be very happy with it"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere written by Michael Crichton is a book that will engage you and will not let go. This is the sixth novel written by Crichton and it is intense and the narrative and storytelling suspenseful with nonstop action.Sphere is about a spaceship found in the South Pacific and a team of American scientists that are sent to investigate this astonishing discovery. The resultant story is what really brings the book to your imagination. Crichton has written a most ingenious tale as the team goes through phenomenal dimensions through a roller coaster of emotions and images.This is truly one of Michael Crichton's best, as he is at the top of his form. This book takes right off and will keep you engaged till the end. Be prepared... your imagination is in for a wild ride."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton's novels are always entertaining, and I enjoy reading them, including \\"Sphere\\". But I find it ironic that amazon.com's own review of \\"Sphere\\" compares Crichton to H. G. Wells as a writer of science fiction explaining scientific ideas clearly to the lay public. \\"Sphere\\" has a gussied-up version of the plot of the H. G. Wells short story \\"The Man Who Could Work Miracles\\", published roughly 100 years ago. Even the final plot twist that evades a seemingly hopeless situation is the same. I don't believe for a moment that Crichton engaged in conscious plagiarism when writing \\"Sphere\\"; either the coincidence of plots is just that, or perhaps Critchton read the H. G. Wells short story as a kid (as I did), and the basic plot twist stuck somewhere back in his subconscious. So, this is not a criticism of \\"Sphere\\"; just an amused comment."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is definatly this author's best work. This psycological thriller keeps you guessing throughout the entire book. Once you think they're safe, Crichton tighten's the noose and gives an unexpected plot twist."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book is about a group of scientists who get called to investigate a spaceship crash at the bottom of the ocean. They find an alien sphere inside the hanger. I can't tell you much more or it will ruin the story for you.This is a really great book with odd twists and turns that will keep you guessing to the last page. I didn't do my homework because of this book. It will keep you up until the wee hours of the morning.I give \\"Sphere\\" five stars, and I recommend it to everyone who likes a good thriller."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I love all of Crichton's books but Sphere is by far the best. This page turner will leave you wondering what's going to happen until the very last page. I Rates this book five stars but it really needs ten stars (Jerry is a winner)."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Talk about a page turner! I started it about 5 o'clock one evening and was up until about 4 a.m. finishing it. Very good book, very good author."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This particular Crichton did have its moments. Worth a read if not already done. But it also seemed to be lacking. Enjoy it but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Crichotn did an awsome job with this book. He put a nice mixture of action and adventure in this book.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I'm an avid reader; not only of Crichton, but of other authors as well. I've read more than a thousand books todate, but never have I enjoyed an estatic thriller such as Sphere. It is the best and surely my All-Time-Favourite. I LOVED IT!!! I've read the book 11 times, not because I don't understand it, but because of the chills it provides everytime that I enter the fourth section: The Power. I've recommended this book to all of my friends, even the ones who hate reading. The ones who have, cannot stop commending the doings of the book. Awesome, the best Crichton, the best Sci-Fi and my BEST book EVER!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is an intense novel about the minds of people and what they can think of. I have recommended this book to 4 people. All of them had to finish the book before they put it down. Anybody who likes suspense will love this book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is one of the best ever written by Michael Crichton, but I think this book lacked a little. It has no definate plot. We understand why they are down there, what they found, and what happened after that, but each of the characters has so many theories, that everything is lost and we have no idea which is real or which one is the right one to believe. The plot was secure and interesting, but so many things were crammed into it. A mix of mathematics, biology, and psychology can work, but I thought there was too much there. And the process of picking off the humans one by one until there are only the main characters left? Please. The characters died in a sad and dumb way. All in all, It was okay as a novel, but it lacked when applied to the minds of the readers. It just seemed too easy. Everything seemed to fit into place exactly, to the point where you lose all sense of what was happening."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"One of Crichton's best! Indeed worth making a movie about! You should enjoy this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book is a good book but it gets to be a litle boring in the middle and the end isent exactly a big thriller. Its plot is fairly complicated so dont read it if your not at least on a 12 grade reading level. It is also graphic and contains swaring."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was not one of my more favorite Crichton books. There was acctually to much detail in this novel. Although the action was intense in some parts of the book. Over all I would have to say tha I did not enjoy it that much."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is typical Crichton, involving lots of very interesting scientific jargon that does not in the least takes away from the story but actually complements it. Although the ending is disappointing in some ways, it is only so because the rest of the book is a heart-stopping masterpiece."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I saw the movie, and was so interested that I wanted to see if the book was any good. The book ended up following the plot-line of the movie so closely that the extremely interesting topic was covered up by the knowlege of what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Not an unentertaining book but the worst Crichton novel that I have read. I mean come on, the psychologist is the sane one? Like that's believable."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was probably the best book that I have read to date. I loved the way Mr. Crichton described the ocean bottom, and how quickly panic swept over the entire crew. What else can I say about this book, but that it was simply fastinating, and captivating"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I loved Sphere, I've read it four times in the last two years. I am a huge Michael Crichton fan, I have read practically all of his books. He is by far my favorite author. I love anything Michael Crichton writes. But, Sphere is a favorite amoung favorites! This is by far the best book i've ever read! It deserves more than just a measly 5 stars! But, five stars is all they'll alow it. You have to read this book! YOU HAVE TO!!! Trust me, you won't regret it. I guarentee it. Just read Sphere, and be amazed."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I love this book! It's my favorite book, and I think it's the most exciting book in the World!! I recomend it to all sci-fi readers. But if you want to read this book, I think you should read it before seeing the movie. The book is so much better, and I think you'll like it better because the movie won't spoil the excitement and bewilderment of the book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I have read this book so many times. I absolutly love it. The movie is nothing compared to it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Chrichton's writing is superb! Even though the first part of the novel, The Surface, is boring, after that there are no flaws. Crichton writes with a suspense style that keeps you flipping the pages so fast, you don't realize what's gonna happen next! Truly a good ending as well. I still am desisding if this is his best book. I loved The Andromeda Strain, and I loved Sphere. They are just two of the many Crichton books I have read. It's close, there both excellent novels. Go read them now!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Great plot - I love the &quot;Dark Human Psyche&quot; element. The ending was interesting, one that left the door wide open to the psychological nightmare Crichton released; will the sphere ever return? Will humanity encounter again? I guess we'll never know..."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere was by far the best book I have ever read. I saw the movie when it came out, and thought, This is great. Then I read the book, and I couldn't believe how bad the movie was compared to it! And I really liked the movie so you can imagine how good the book is. So I finished the book, and now I'm going to buy it =) For all of you sci-fiers that haven't read it, I suggest you do because IMHO it is one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"After reading this book, you will be more conscious of yourself, your surroundings, and how precious your life is. You might even understand the role of humans on earth, what makes us different... Just when you think the characters can't get into any more trouble, Crichton takes their desperate situation and smashes it to pieces. It is amazing. Sometimes it gets a bit on the technical side, so if you don't like to read about a lot of scientific information, this book might bore you a bit, yet for those who are interested in the sciences, Crichton manages to take the most advanced perplexing concepts and explain them to the reader with extremely suave. The ending is superb, and I must advise any one who likes science to pick it up today!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is from the movie &quot;Sphere&quot; and is written by Michael Crichton. In my point of view, I recommend that you read the book THEN watch the movie because I think that the book is better than the movie. The book comes more to the details than the movie itself. The book and the movie are not the same. Some of the parts in the book are different than that of the movie."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is from the movie &quot;Sphere&quot; and is written by Michael Crichton.

I am 14 years old, and I loved it. Anybody at any age would adore this book. It is a fast-paced, and it is very interesting. Sphere is action-packed, and it has a lot of suspense in it. I couldn't put it down. In fact, I read it all in one night because I loved it so much! Everybody should read this book. I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone. There is no other one like it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"A fan of Crichton's previous books, I didn't like this one very much. It was very predictable. The annoyance of some of the characters i.e. Harry, Ted and Beth really got to me after a while. I was wishing that Beth and Harry would die so that they could shut up. I guess I was wrong. Thank God Ted the most annoying character was killed. But come on a squid attacking the habitat?? It's trite and boring. Also the ending 'Let's just forget about everything and everything will be ok!' What a joke, it only shows society's mentality of thinking that they can solve their problems by magic. The only good thing about this book is that some of the discussions between the characters gives a lot of insight on human nature."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is a very well writen book. It keeps the reader turning the pages chapter after chapter. The stunning realizum of his nicely chosen words adds a vast world of description and detail. I have also read Congo, Jarassic Park, Andromeda Strain, The Great Train Robery, and The Lost World. I recomend all of them to Chrichton fans. Sphere is by far the most interesting and gripping yet. The last 30 pages are very suspensful."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Anymore, I have grown more convincingly aware that H.G. Wells has infact been reincarnated in the form of Michael Critchon and the results are phenomonal! Critchon writes so many hits that it's hard for me to choose a favorite, yet SPHERE remains at the very top of my list alongside THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, JURASSIC PARK and other fabulous works by authors like Stephen King, John Grisham, Dean R. Koontz, and Terry Brooks. If you haven't read SPHERE yet you have no clue what wonderfully contagious, thought provoking writing you're missing!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is one of the best books I've ever read. The story was really good and it had few but cool action scenes. It was sure a lot better than the movie."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is a wonderful book, which really makes you think... one of the authur's best and most fasanating. A lot of people didn't like the ending, but I found it to be quite sufficient. Certainly a page turner. Does have some negatives. The crew are hard to get... they're supposed to be professionals, but at times they act like absolutle babies. Heavy dialogue and a couple of draggy parts in the book which slows it down a bit at times too. Overall though, a great, enjoyable read. You should get the same message from it I did; AN IMAGINATION IS A POWERFUL THING!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"THIS IS ONE OF HIS BEST BOOKS I'VE READ. VERY CREATIVE AND NEVER BORING. COULD NOT STOP TURNING THE PAGES. INTENSE, HORRIFYING, AND INTELLIGENT. WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER IT."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book made my imagination see things I would have never thought of. It capered all of my minds creativity and brout it smashing into me as a succesion of pictures and images. The plot was so well written at first I thought Jerry was a monster. I would have never guessed what was inside the Sphere, but when I found out I was amazed."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Starts interesting, but progressively loses strength. Terrible ending"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"What a great book, The human mind is a very powerfull thing, and Michael portraid that very well, a great read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Read it! Read it! Read it! I couldn't put it down. I read the book in about 8 houres. It starts interesting and it gets better and better with every page. It's like a good horror, action and thriller movie."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and could not let go. I've been waiting for the movie evere since... Now that I've seen it, I can't wait to read the book again. A must read and a must see."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Crichton's Best Yet."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is tied with Crichton's &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot;. It is incredible and you will never put it down, a little dramatic in some parts, but that's how Crichton is, and the suspense makes up for it. I have read 2 Crichton's: &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and &quot;Sphere&quot;- both excellent. Also, watch the movie. As usual it is not as good as the book. It skips a lot of parts and &quot;cheeses&quot; it up a bit, but it's overall pretty interesting. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"It's a great action yarn but it leaves you cold in the end. The movie clips on TV shows a fanged snake creature but in the book ther was no such thing. The book leads you up to one helava climax like in Steven King's novels but just like Steven, the book leaves you holding a wet towel."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is so good, that after checking it out at the library and reading it, I went and bought it, and read it again! The action, characters, and plot is all top-notch. I recommend this book to anyone, even those people who dont care for sci-fi should rush out to buy this book. The movie, on the other hand, leaves alot to be wanted."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I've read all of Crichton's books except for The Great Train Robbery. This is by far Crichton's best book yet. Not as high concept as Jurassic Park, but more readable than JP."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Although the movie was very good, I believe that, as always, the book was better."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I am only 11 and already obbsessed with his books ive read each one except for eaters of the dead which i am in the process of reading.Sphere is a must read!!It is a page turner having you guess at every page!It gives you complete visual images &amp; nonstop action it should come with popcorn!It is as if you are living the book , the suspense is unreal!The last pages are what they should be.The book is a definite page turner with lightning fast action.THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Read this book in two days.That's right, two days, even though I have school and the swim team and the book is 300 pages long.Why did I read it in two days? I couldn't stop thinking about it!The only thing that was shaky about it was the ending, but before Crichton makes the mistake of the bad ending the suspense is already over and it's all wrapped up in a tight little package.With ribbons.A must read!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is the first Chrichton book that I have read, so I can't compare it to other books, but this is definetly one of the best books I've read yet. I may only be 13, but I couldn't put it down. It takes alien books to a whole new level. I like the fact the everthing doesn't work out perfect. A lot of books get boring because you can always predict what will happen. In my opinion, a good book is one the surprises you throughout the book, and this definitly does that. It's full of surprising twists and turns, and I just hope that the rest of his books are as good as this one was. The only flaw, in my opinion, was the personality of the psychologist, it wasn't a very intresting person to have as the main charecter, and he (Chichton), didn't make you feel as if you were the charecter as other authors sometimes do. Other than that, it was a great book. I hope the rest are as good, or I'm in for a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was such a great book. I started it in the morning, and was done by the time I went to sleep. I could not put it down. I've been highly recommending it since then. My favorite character was Harry Adams. He was such a cool guy. This would be a great movie, if done right."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Once I started reading this book, it was hard for me to put it down. It was slow at the begginning like most of Crichton's books, but once it started...I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"It was great. Can't stop reading onceyou started. Suspenceful and chilling!!! one of Crichtons best!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"A space-ship from the future? An unexplored region of a space-ship? What is it? It's a great book. The ability to manifest your thoughts and fears with ease by some unknown alien force is creative, suspenseful, and down-right brilliant! Definately Crichton's best as he describes every thought of every character and making no person anymore innocent than the next. Each character is dynamic and different in many ways. The ending is nothing for Crichton to be proud of however, and perhaps would have been better with a hanging ending allowing the reader to decipher what would happen to the rest of the world with these manifestations. I hope the ending wasn't brought to such an abrupt halt because Crichton was too afraid to make a book any longer than 400 pages. If he were to be more descriptive and maybe added more thought and imagination to the ending, then it would have been worth reading an extra hundred pages or so. This is not the case, however, and the ending is the reason that I gave the book a nine."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"A three-hundred-year-old-spaceship at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Sounds interesting enough, right? Well, listen to this. The 'life form' controlling the Sphere inside the spaceship is nothing more than a scientist's 'manifestation' as Crichton calls it. The Sphere is a supposed liason between imagination and reality, creating whatever the person inside it imagines. I give Michael Crichton great credit as an author. (I've read seven of his books.) But he was obviously hurting for a plot when he wrote, (or perhaps 'manifested') Sphere. The story does not flow along smoothly, and the end is big disappointment. If you love Michael Crichton's works, but you haven't read Sphere, I advise you not to. The ending, which wraps up in the final ten pages, is a waste of the other 350 pages."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is magnificent. The events that occur are mesmerizing as the humans communicate with the sphere. The idea of an entity living in the depths of the Pacific Ocean for 300 years is fascinating. The sphere manipulates the humans thoughts to confuse them about time and recent events. This book is much better than any of Crichton's novels and will forever be a favorite of mine. The only bad part was the ending, which seemed to not have been pre-planned and finished in a rush, but how could you judge the dazzling 350 page story by a 7 page ending."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"What else can i say about this fine story about two central points, extraterrestrial contact and psychology or maybe psycho first?. I don't know but i must say that the ending was so simple that don't deserve any more comments."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I stayed up all night reading. The book leaves you in such suspense, it's scary. How could such creativity be put in one book. Crichton has written one of the best books ever. It makes you think about what could happen to us in the future. What will we find if we explore other galaxcies? 15,000 thumbs up."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere was fantastic. Although only my second M.C novel, I thought that Crichton did an outstanding job of luring the reader into a suspense filled journey of the unknown. I found myself continuously trying not to &quot;cheat&quot; and see what that Sphere thing really is. The ending was just like the plot...DEEP!! If you don't have an open mind, don't even go there. You'll probably find something in the book that didn't compute. However, if you like &quot;deep,&quot; sci-fi, suspenseful Crichton, you'd better not sleep on this one because when Hollywood gets a hold of it, they'll ruin it for sure...Just like JP, Lost World, and Congo."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I was skeptical about the plot at first, but this proved to be one of the best books I have read in a long, long time. Crichton's multiple plot turns really add a lot of interest. Not only is the main plot intriguing, but the conflicts between the scientists themselves help to carry the story along and tie everything together. I recommend you pick this book up right away!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book keeps you hooked till you finish.

Take the time to read it, it's worth five dollars"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton is a Rationalist, an Intellectual (&quot;crossword puzzler&quot;), and this is why his science-heavy books do not convert so well to film media. If Crichton were a movie director (and he was), then his actors would speak his screenplay text verbatum, and sound rather rigid as they recited their &quot;book report&quot; before the &quot;class&quot;. An intuitive-type movie director, on the other hand, would allow his actors the freedom to improvise the lines, like for instance Frances Coppola with Brando in &quot;Apocylpse&quot;. Michael Crichton was probably at a cocktail party in the early 80's and someone convinced him he was &quot;too rational&quot;, &quot;too scientific&quot; and not intuitive enough, like, for instance, a poet. So Crichton said, &quot;I'll show you. I'll write a poetry book. I'll write...Sphere.&quot; I just finished reading &quot;Sphere&quot; two nights ago, and was disapointed with it. The book was too &quot;wishy-washy&quot;, and too vague (expecially when describing the actual &quot;Sphere&quot; thing. I mean, it was &quot;filled with foam, and little white starstars were blinking, and I floated, but don't remember too much&quot; was the pat description of the characters. And then the computers name which was &quot;Jerry&quot; but changed from &quot;Harry&quot; and Beth thought it was &quot;Gerry&quot; and Beth and Harry were evil because they could not handle getting in touch with their &quot;shadow side&quot;, and then a huge shrimp kept attacking the ship, but they knew when it was coming to get them cause it &quot;glowed green&quot;, and the little shrimp at first had no &quot;stomachs&quot; but then they did! I think Crichton's &quot;Sphere&quot; is just a rehash of the classic &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;. These characters journeyed through hell to find the secret of power, only to realize the power in life comes from &quot;within us&quot;, from &quot;imagination&quot;...blah...blah...blah. I think the more a person describes &quot;Sphere&quot; as being &quot;a work of genius&quot;, the more of a dim-wit that person is...Rick Wittkop"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Chrichton spins a tale of aliens, time travel, Euphoria, Psycho - Telekinesis, and techno babble. A strange ship is found in the ocean and contains a large sphere. Giant squids and God - like powers eventually lead to the destruction of most of the explorers investigating the ship. Soon to be a major motion picture"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read this book a couple years ago and thought it had a goodstory until the ending. Being so creative, Mr. Crichton could havemade the ending more believable and plausable."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is by far one of the best books I have ever read. It is definitely Michael Crichton's best book. Not only is it his best plot ever, but it is the strongest and most vivid storytelling he has used in his long and illustrious writing career. I liked it so much that when I was done, I forced my mother and father to read it as well, and they also loved it. By all means, read this book"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Great book! If you like suspense, twists and turns, theoriesand a premise that makes you think without being too overly stuffy orscientific, and page-turing (long into the night!) sci-fi/adventures-read this book! I started this on my lunch hour and didn't realize until it was too late that I was 45 min. over my lunchtime. I read this book 2 years ago and it sticks with me to this day as one of my top 15-maybe top 10-books."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"THIS IS ONE OF MC'S BEST PIECE OF WORK. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOKTO ANYONE. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"One of Crichton's masterpieaces... After I've read this book, Iread almost all Crichton's books! Crichton is a great writer, whoknows tp keep you tensed 'till the end of the novell. I recommend this book for any SCIFI fan, who likes the scintific style."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"An astonishing sleep-smasher that no one can get a sleepwith it unfinished... Should not be read by anyone suffersfrom insomnia."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is about the thing I like most. Science Fiction.I love this story because of it's twists and it's ability to keepthe reader's attention. I don't know how to describe it but allI can say is that it is very descriptive and mysterious. I thinkMicheal Chricton has one of the best imaginations in the world"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"While all of Crichton's other books seem to get sliced and trashedby the movie moguls (including the author himself), &quot;Sphere&quot; maintains a plot too complicatedto be limited to the 2 hour attention span of the movie-going public.Just when you think you've figured out where the story is going,Crichton spins the plot around so that you feel you've started allover again. I've read all of Crichton's books, I don't alwaysagree with how Crichton ends his novels. This one, however, managesto do a little better in wrapping things up. I think it's a mustread for those who enjoy Crichton's style. Defintely the best inthe Crichton section."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Unlike many authors of \\"page-turning, non-stop action, thrilling, etc\\" books, Michael Crichton let's the reader understand the novel's characters and their personalities.This book was simply amazing, the only problem is i'm not very patient and the first ten pages of the book i read about a year ago and decided it was a boring book. Then earlier this week after reading State Of Fear, i needed more crichton, so i picked this up again. i finished it in two sittings. i was GLUED to this book.I think this is crichtons best book, but i've only read: Prey, State of Fear, Rising Sun, and Spherethe movie i saw a few years ago and i remember it being cool... i dunno"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"One of the few instances where the movie is only a fraction better than the book. This was my first attempt at reading Michael Crichton and I was utterly disappointed. Sphere, the movie, was certainly not a financial success, but it is interesting that any studio would pick this up for option. A book should supplement the theatrical version, fill in any holes that may exist, and be as exciting, if not more so, than what was filmed. Sphere achieves none of this. Once I was through, I watched the movie again...kept the movie and threw the book in the recycle bin. I haven't given up on Michael Crichton yet, but this one was definitely not the one to read first for any lasting impression."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is a great book for all sci-fi lovers like me. The concept of **** (I did that as to not give away the good parts of the book) is truly fascinating to me. If you are interested in UFOs, then this is a book for you. Anyone who hasn't read this book should read it, for the people who have already read it, READ IT AGAIN!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton is one of the best writers of our time. This book is a perfect example of this. If you're into science fiction you will like this for sure. This book is much better than the movie. It mixes a lot of technological science fiction with suspense in a well balanced way. If you're a fan of Michael Crichton and haven't read this book. Please do. You will not regret it. It's a must buy."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I found Sphere to be pleasantly diverting for a few days, but I guess I'm spoiled by reading novels of late that are actual &quot;literature&quot;. Crichton's writing here just doesn't make the cut. His characters are cardboard (even though he tries to give some a PC twist, like the black mathematician), his prose is utilitarian, terse and vocabulary limited (e.g., he used the word &quot;uneasy&quot; twice in two pages to describe one character who was lying and one who had a stomach ache), and much of his &quot;science&quot; is hokey (I say that as a scientist). On the plus side, he does know how to concoct a clever, suspenseful story and reel out just enough of it at a time to keep you turning the pages. My advice if you like sci-fi adventure: your time is better spent reading real writers like Asimov, Verne, Wells, Bradbury, Heinlein and many others."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The technology represented in this story is facsinating. The plot is interesting. The story, though just ain't neither. This book's major flaw is that it lacked oomph to pull the reader through to the end. I finished reading it because I felt I owed it to the seven bucks or so that I spent on it. So if you're familiar with his other books, you will be disappointed by this one."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Pathetic. Just like the book"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Absolutely fabilous! The best novel ever to be written. Michael Crichton has now really done it. The plot is more than fascinating. You just can't leave the book alone, you have to know what's going to happen on the next page. If you haven't read this novel, order it now! You don't know what you're missing."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is one of my favorite books out there. I have read most of M.C.'s books and I also recommend: &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; &quot;Congo&quot; &quot;Rising Sun&quot;"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere was a good book with interesting concepts, but I have to say it was not one of Crichton's best. I'm looking forward to the movie version to see how similar they are. I got the feeling that this book was written specifically to be made into a movie, that's why it seems to be missing something."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"SPHERE is one of my favorite books. Lets all face it, the movie was not good at all. So you may have no interest in reading the book. Well first of all the books are always better than the movies and this one is a hundred times better. READ THIS BOOK if you are into Crichton. If you are not then read it anyway. Also, the book has a GREAT ending!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was a the best book I have ever read! I could not put it down, I actually read for three hours straight! I loved every last part. It is scary,yet smart. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is a great book. The reason I gave it a nine was because of the somewhat quick ending. The suspense was great. It is definately a page-turner. I couldn't put it down. The description is good. The characters are interesting. At some parts it's a little strange, but all the better."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I thought that it was a good book, that had plenty of action and good detail. It was one of the more interesting book that I hace read, because all of its complications were exciting and unpredictable. It kept me thingking the whole time I was reading. I thought the climax was a little disappointing and that it could have been more exciting, but I felt this because the whole book kept me on the egde of my seat so much that the climax seemed anticlimatic."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I could NOT put the book down, and that turned out to be disappointing because Crichton doesn't GO anywhere with his fantastic setup. The book should have gone another 200 pages at least. Problems were solved so quickly and easily, and I really didn't like that.Frankly, I don't see how anyone can rate this book a 10. If they do think it is the best book they've ever read, then obviously they haven't read much! They assume that since Crichton has written so many novels that get turned into movies, he is by definition a &quot;great writer&quot; in today's society. These people simply accept the one-dimensional characters, unanswered questions, and all too easily solved problems presented in this book as &quot;fabulous fiction.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is the best book of all time. I don't understand all the people that say the ending was bad. NOTHING about this book (especially Jerry the &quot;child king&quot;) was less than TERRIFIC!!! I dont see why moore people haven't read it. This is definatly Crichton's best work."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Toataly awesome his best to date. Some people may say the ending makes them loose respect for Crichton its not true. HELLO they need to ask themselves what would the ending be like if they wrote it and they were at the part Where Harry, Beth, and Norman are in the decompresion chamber thinkin what to say to everyone. I still have full respect for Crichton. Dont listen to those other coments. READ IT THE FIRST CHANCE YOU GET!!!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Well, after reading JP I though I was in for another treat... I got the book and when I started reading it had the fast paced story I expected from MC. One of my favorite parts of the book delt with the underwater space ship. It was the most interesting part of the book in my opinion, but was the least explained part of the book. I didnt really get into the characters much, not very personal people. The character Jerry did get my attention, I enjoyed his puzzles and his slow suspensful way of talking to the eager scientists... Like most others I found the ending very BAD but I did read it about three times so I give it some credit.I would have liked it much more if the shp had been explored more!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Out of all of Michael Crichton's novels, Sphere is at the top. The heart pounding details turn it into a picture book, then turns to a reality! From page 1 on you'll become hooked with this novel and soon forget you are not deep within the heart of the Pacific. The begining is a little slow, but the action begins quickly. I did stumble on a few confusing parts but soon caught up with the action. Suprisingly, the movie was only rated PG-13. If it had been made directly off the novel, it would have probably been rated R. Better then Jurassic Park, Sphere brings you deep down into the action. If you have not read Sphere, you are missing one hec of a ride! -Scott S. (Knockout333@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Although I haven't read this in a while, I did remember that it was wonderful and it scared me to death!! Definitely rates as one of the best books MC has written! He is a genius! Reccomendation: Read this book alone in a dark house during a storm with only one light on. It works!You feel like you're gonna get attacked!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I usaully get board of most books i read. But this si the first book ever that i read none stop from the begging to the end. To bad the movie to this was terrible!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I finished this book during a 13-hour flight from Chicaga to Tokyo. Frankly, this book didn't impress me very much at the beginning, but halfway through, I was hooked! The first part is a little boring, but from second part, it slowly builds up tension, and reaches climax and I was very impressed by Mr.Crichton's thorough knowledge of zoology and astronomy, and the descriptions of the fictional spaceship is plausible and imaginative.Unlike many others, I like the ending of the book. I think this book would have been a mediocre sci-fi novel if Mr.Crichton had conceived some alien creature in the sphere."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book was definitely a page-turner. I wouldn't say that I couldn't put it down but I read every chance I got. This book is easy-to-understand and scary. It was the first book I had ever read that was over 300 pages and I wasn't dissapointed."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is an awesome book about an underwatter discovery.

Words can not describe the psychological depths I was plunged into while and after I read this book. I was unable to sleep at night during the duration of reading this splendid novel. I'm going to say this... this book had great heart-warming characters, unrelenting suspense and action and all of the warning signs of an all-nighter. I loved this book...PERIOD."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book was mind capturing. I couldn't stop reading it. It made a knew definition for fear!

I for one find it hard to believe that we could find a way to send something that big back three hundred ( 300 ) years to ourselvs without any type of operating manuel to tell us how to get it started.Also I find that this book was a good way to spend reading on a Friday evening after I came home from work and finished my homework"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael has done it again.

I thought all the characters were well developed, and much research was put into the writing of this book. The only reason why I'm giving it four stars(instead of five) is because I was disappointed with the ending. I was hoping for some violent creature or an alien to be what was stalking them, it's actually their gay imagination.
