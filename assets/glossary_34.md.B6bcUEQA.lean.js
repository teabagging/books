Lewis books, told as a parable of a grey world with grey people who meet their former colleagues and loved ones in a bus trip to the edge of heaven. Here Lewis combines his vivid imagination and brilliant writing with timeless theological questions. My favorite scene is the last one that has remained with me for many years: the picture of sin as a lizard sitting on one's shoulder, with its tail wrapped around its victim's neck, whispering with greater and lesser intensity depending on how aware one is of its presence. My description doesn't begin to capture the wonderful mythical quality of this book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Good quality edition. The hardcover looks great in my library. And the story is life changing- a must read for all CS Lewis fans and Christians!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This approach to the afterlife - although Lewis makes it clear that this is designed as fiction, not an exploration of what the afterlife may actually be - is a highly thoughtful way to introduce our difficulty as men and women to release the natural world and all of it's trappings for the spiritual world. Each person the main character observes or interacts with experiences a different challenge, many of which I see in myself, my family and my peers. Lewis gently reveals how broken we all are, but that it's a simple choice - a choice we each can make - to be healed."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis a conservative Christian put together the most intuitive metaphor as to what a loving God has for us after death"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"this is an unbelievably good book by CS Lewis he has a great insight into the human and spiritual mind as well, I highly recomend this book to anyone looking for answers about themselves."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"When you encounter a writer and a work that provokes thought to the degree that CS Lewis does you read and then you re-read!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Great book...It is fiction but written like nonfiction in the sense that you will still learn from it a great deal...will give you a new perspective of heaven and of God.

It is refined, and well written. Read this work."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"After Screwtape, this is my favorite work from Lewis (and it is a close call). The book is short, but I read slow (especially something as weighty as Lewis). I could not put this book down until I finished it.NOTE: Lewis himself made it clear that this book is not about the mechanics of the afterlife. It is about the cancerous nature of sin and how it interferes with out relationship to the Most High. If this entire story were taken literally then there would be discrepencies between it and scriptures concerning the attitudes of the damned souls, the nature of Hell/purgatory and the call to salvation. I suppose I should explain:1) Most of the visitors from Hell refuse heaven and can not enjoy it because they are unwilling to repent of their sins. Jesus tells a story of a soul in Hell that yearned for just a drop of water (relief) from heaven. Souls in Hell will yearn for heaven and despise Hell.2) Purgatory is not an idea found in Holy Scripture, and Lewis is dodgy about where the visitors are from. That aside, there are no visitors from Hell to even the outter realms of Heaven. It is true that Satan visits God's thrown room and raises accusations against us, but he has not yet been thrown into \\"the pit\\". He is called the \\"Prince of this World\\".3) Salvation is an act of faith. Old Testement Believers had faith a Savior would come. New Testement believers have faith he came (and will return). Once you die you meet him. That's not faith. It's sight. To quote the famous hymn, \\"if you terry till your burried you will never come at all\\".Those are not the point of the book. And the points it makes about sin and human nature are excellent!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book is based on the claim that there is a heaven and a hell and that each of us will ultimately arrive at one of them and live there for all eternity. The picture Lewis paints of each of these places is not what any of us would expect. With his extraordinarily rare brilliance that mystifies his readers, Lewis takes this opportunity to look at the reasons why certain individuals would choose hell over heaven or vice-versa and has us take a look at them.He does this by presenting characters which we all seem to know very well. We have either met people like this and have grappled with their logic or lack of it; or, we might find ourselves to be very much like the people he describes. Nevertheless, they all have a story--one with which we can easily identify. The stories take us along life's paths and we are shown how they lead to the greatness of heaven and those who enter there, or the nothingness of hell and those who enter there.I read this for the second time as an audiobook. I thought it was even better. Why? Well, I took the reviewer, Christopher Theophilus's advice and checked the AudioFile review of the Blackstone audiobook, which states, \\"Robert Whitfield's disciplined and well-modulated voice has an appealingly confident quality. Whether or not one agrees with Lewis's arguments, it is a joy to hear writing so eloquent.\\" That's as well as I can say it. It is eloquent--so much so that you can hardly understand that he is taking you through his thought process but not doing your thinking for you. He subtlety, but surely, gets you the reader to think about his subject and how it applies to your own life.Whether you are a C. S. Lewis fan or not, if you have not read this: get it! You will not be sorry."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I really did not have any idea what I was getting into when I opened my Kindle to this story. What I found was an inspirational story that leads one to reevaluate their life and that of what is most important to them.This is a very fast read and at only 146 pages it is also very short leading the reader longing for more. Lewis uses his infamous fable abilities to transform our vision of Heaven and Hell by a simple bus ride and visitors from our past. For better or for worse we have to accept the Gift that has been given to us and we have to do this on His terms not ours."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A short fantasy about various souls being sorted out after death. He specifically says he's not trying to describe what he thinks happens immediately after you die, but instead gives you examples of other people's troubles and how they make choices (even those choices made by people who think it's an option to not make a choice) about their afterlife; don't try to make theological sense out of it. He's instead trying to show you that the choice is yours to make now, before you die. You don't have to, and shouldn't, wait for purgatory (if you happen to believe in purgatory). It's definitely worth reading, especially since the investment in time isn't that great (under 200 pages)."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I listened to this book on cd by Lewis quite some time ago. I have read several of his works. The Screwtape Letters, excellent book, was, however, difficult to digest. I found that I had to take that one on in bites to get the full benefits of its insights. This book, however, was something I could just wrap my mind around and indulge my imagination with. Rather than read the book I tried the cd's on a whim and was not disappointed. The narration is so well done. Lewis is such a gifted writer and minister of the Word of God. He presents it in a way that is understandable and engaging in this particular piece.Anyone could benefit from the lessons taught. It is essentially a battle between good and evil no matter how you spin it. As individuals we face a choice in every moment as to which side we are going to pick. The latter is made out to be so appealing...an addiction that plagues your thoughts and actions, clinging on for dear life. The Great Divorce plots out a course to free yourself of that wolf in sheep's clothing and be free to experience something so much greater.Give it a try. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis tells an enjoyable abstract story that refutes the belief that heaven and hell are metaphors for our own state of mind. Through the eyes of his protagonist we observe many animated characters struggling to escape the miniscule and horrifying worlds they have created for themselves in eternity. By their amusing and yet extremely self absorbed behaviour, we come to understand that hell really is a state of mind, while heaven is, in fact, \\"reality itself\\". Lewis also deftly answers some common beginner questions like \\"Why does God let the people in hell suffer?\\" and \\"How can you be happy in heaven if your loved ones are in hell?\\" etc. This is a good book for anyone wanting to understand the Christian outlook on afterlife. It is also a clever satire that exposes some of the repulsively absurd aspects of widely accepted and respected behaviour within this life. You might see some aspect of yourself reflected in one of these characters, and whether you are Christian or not, it will hopefully shake you a little, even while you enjoy laughing at the foolishness of all the rest. ;)"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"First: This is not about divorce, it's about Heaven and Hell.Second: This is not about Heaven and Hell, it's about people.It's a stunning device for drawing back the curtain on the human heart and looking at the real weirdness that we go through. It's about what makes good people great or what makes them aweful. It's brilliant and well written.The audio CD is also very well-read and easy to listen to. There's plenty of variety in voice and tone.

Those accompanying him all have their own reasons for going, but many decide to actually go back. The 'Ghosts' try to get heaven without the love of God in their hearts. This book is a great fanciful story about the choices people make that affect their place in eternity.Lewis does an excellent job at showing the many different vices mankind holds onto that can keep them out of heaven: lust, dominion, religion, education, material gain, love of people, etc. If you are willing to have an honest look at yourself, even you who are saved can read this book and find yourself in the Ghosts. Are you willing to change for eternity?One word of caution: There are characters that use some language.

It's full of powerful dream-like imagery and I found myself having to read a number of pages twice in that -- it is just so -- intense. Imagery, beyond the best imagery of Pink Floyd, Alice in Wonderland, or miles and miles of melting clocks.Imagery of life and...time. Lewis has us look at our lives -- through the lens of time -- but from an eternal position.The characters in the book are so pathetic and yet so familiar to my life -- which is unsettling.It's a powerful book and I think Lewis' storytelling (opposed to preaching / teaching) is enormously enlightening when the topic is spiritually heavy. I remember thinking this (the storytelling aspect) may have been why Christ used parables to teach."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"In The Great Divorce the narrator takes a bus trip to Heaven. He travels with people with a variety of beliefs. When he arrives he realizes he is insubstantial; he, like the other passengers, is a Ghost. They are met by inhabitants of Heaven - Spirits, or Solids - who come to this pickup point to guide them in the new land. The passengers have the opportunity to go back, or to become more substantial here, if they make the rest of the difficult journey. The passengers confront those matters that have gotten in their way to God. This may be refusing to forgive someone, loving someone more than God, or self-pity to the point of denial that the joy of Heaven could exist, or a refusal to take part in it. In every situation, it is the person's choice.The story is another spiritual journey, a common subject to Lewis, as is shown in Pilgrim's Regress and The Chronicles of Narnia. Like Pilgrim's Regress, this story takes after Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. For example, the journey, once arrived in Heaven, is to a mountain. The Great Divorce differs from Regress in its conversational tone and address of everyday living. Regress addresses philosophies; Divorce addresses common beliefs and behaviors, in a way that Screwtape Letters does. The former work is more academic than the latter."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I read this gem of a book on a lark. But it drew me in and kept my attention from beginning to end.

It's a 'get out of hell free' ticket to heaven where you will meet some incredible people and be exposed to some 'outside the box' thinking."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is an enlightening novel. I began the book thinking it would be something like Dante. However, after the first thirty or forty pages I could tell it was different, but only near the end did I realize how different it was from Dante. The difference stems from the difference in their viewpoints of hell. I believe that Lewis sees hell as a separation from God while Dante sees hell as a place of torment for nonbelievers. Lewis, therefore, deals with reasons why some people will be separated from God. The narrator in the novel overhears conversations between people from hell visiting with souls from Heaven. The Great Divorce attempts to show why \\"good\\" people may end up in hell. The people the narrator overhears are not the stereotypical \\"bad\\" people who we \\"know\\" are going to hell. He attempts to show the pride, bitterness, or sin of the \\"good\\" people who most assume do not deserve hell. I enjoyed this novel. A common objection to the Christian Faith: Why a loving God would send good people to hell. Lewis attempts to show why. I recommend buying this novel, and I have already given my copy to a friend."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"With clear moral and spiritual insight, Lewis delves into what keeps man from God. Using a mythical bus trip from Hell to Heaven, he shows what humans have to sacrifice on the way to Heaven. While, some say Lewis is a bit cold in this book, I disagree. Lewis merely shows that even the best virtuals can be twisted into vices. Like men who kill innocents in the name of God, or the stalker who terroizes the one he &quot;loves&quot;. The major problem is that like the Screwtape Letters it is more piercing than we would like, but just as piercing as we need."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If you don't care for C.S. Lewis, you will not care for this book. On the other hand, if you like C.S. Lewis (and appreciate what he was up to) you may thoroughly enjoy, even love, this book. I say \\"may\\" because an honest reading of this short allegory can reveal a great deal about the author's soul and view of the moral universe and something about the reader's own soul and views as well. In other words, it can entertain or disturb or both. It will, in any case, provoke a great deal of thought for any reader who bothers to think at all.I read The Great Divorce many, many years ago and could never forget it; some of its images and episodes were and remain indelible. By some quirk or inspiration, I recently suggested using it for an adult Sunday School class of folks who love good, mental exercise, good literature, etc. and thus got back into it - big time. In preparing ten lessons on the book, I rediscovered why I loved it in the first place but then I also discovered a myriad of rich nuggets and not a few whole veins that I had completely blitzed by in the earlier reading. This second time I found it to be absolutely magnificent and have gone from being a CS Lewis fan to a serious and devoted student of the whole \\"mythopoeic\\" approach that he (along with many others, including now, most famously, JK Rowling) have championed.You don't have to be well read or a Christian or an intellectual or a theologian or a Bible scholar or even a full grown adult to truly enjoy - or be really bothered by - this book. The premise, after all, is that not everyone would enjoy a holiday in the Valley of the Shadow of Life (post-mortem or otherwise), much less a few hours with C.S. Lewis himself. (It does help things, however, to have a good imagination and sense of humor.)Like scripture, like great poetry, like any of those guys in my title (all of whom are embedded in the text and context of this book), this book and everything else I've read by Lewis is worth reading ...and worth reading (including reeading) carefully and soulfully."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A gray man, in a gray city waits with other gray people for a gray bus. This is the opening of C.S. Lewis' THE GREAT DIVORCE, Lewis' allegory on Heaven and Hell. This isn't the Hell of Dante or Revelations, filled with fire and brimstone; this is a Hell that is the complete and total absence of God. This is a Hell that is of one's own making, the only options are to totally embrace God's love or continue to hold on to those earthly wants and desires that we all possess and remain trapped. According to Lewis, these choices are mutually exclusive; this is not a \\"cafeteria\\" relationship where one can pick and choose.Arriving at a place midway between Heaven and Hell the travelers meet various guides that have come to help move them closer to God and Heaven. Lewis creates a series of dialogues between the travelers and guides to address the questions many have regarding earthly matters and be shown how utterly insignificant they are. Choices are then made to continue to move towards God or turn back to the grayness.In his other works, Lewis has explored this vision of God, a God who is not indifferent to us but One that expects, at the very least, we make the effort to accept Him and receive the fulfillment that can only be found in His embrace. THE GREAT DIVORCE is a fine work; easily read and very clear in its presentation; this is a book to be read by any age that's ready to explore the relationship of God and man, Heaven and Hell."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"&quot;There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \`They will be done,' and those to whom God says \`They will be done'.&quot;This is a quote from this little volume, and effectively sums up the entire book in that one sentence. THE GREAT DIVORCE, like Lewis's TILL WE HAVE FACES, is his song of songs, his great achievement. Tolkien's was LORD OF THE RINGS, Adams' WATERSHIP DOWN, Sinclair Lewis' MAIN STREET. These novels are generally regarded as their major works. This little book, published in a little periodical called The Guardian, is one such book. (It was this periodical that Lewis's classic book THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS also appeared). Sadly, SCREWTAPE, though excellent in and of itself, is often given much more credit than this, which is a deeper work (and to those who know THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS, know what a feat that is).Perhaps one reason that this work is such an excellent little volume is its length of gestation: it was concieved in 1931 and written in 1944. Insipred by a sermon found in Jeremy Taylor's WORKS, suggested such a premise as to think, or take, the absuridity of damned souls getting a real refreshment from hell. Also another source was the fourth centru Latin poet named Prudentius Aurelius Clemens (his contribution can be found in &quot;Hymn for the Lighting of the Lamp). Assuredly, one of the reasons that it took so long to be written (the first known written account is a diary entry by his brother Warnen on Paril 15, 1932) is he had not had it visualized. In terms of inspiration his fiction arose from &quot;seeing pictures&quot; in his mind. (Example: One of his images he received when he was about 16, and it was a faun with parcels in one hand and an umbrella in the other, standing in a wintery, snow laden forest).Much of this short little novel has a direct comparison or parellel to Dante's DIVINE COMEDY. Just like Beatrice to Dante, so also was George MacDonald to C. S. Lewis. MacDonald was almost a Universalist. He believed most of the world populace would submit and enter into joy, and know God's love. A lot of this would occur after death. According to Sayer, Lewis did not believe this, but thought it was a possibility (much my view on purgatory). What Lewis had to do was to rectify this belief with the others of purgatory, hell, heaven, predestination, damnation, etc. How he did so was a stroke of genius: he made hell and purgatory the same place. To those who would leave and give up a vice, it was only purgatory; but to those who were determined to keep their wickedness, instead of entering into joy, were damned. To enter into Heaven, the only prerequiste was to give up a vice. That was all. Some lust, some apostasty, some selfishness and false love (the mother Pam for her son Michael). Just like Dante, Lewis has an Apostate Anglican bishop in there.One of the things that he has done most brillantly is the potrayal of the Platonic belief that the essence of something is more real than the thing itself. Virture is more real that the vitrue that is practiced. Everything in God is much more real and tangible than hell, and Lewis does this marvelously. A device he borrowed from a writer whose name was unknown to him, Lewis made everything very, very real, and the damned men and women were but ghosts in that heavenly place. Each had an accompaning Spirit, one who has surrendered to God. In that place, the ones saved are real and can bend the grass and walk and swim, but always traveling further up and further in (to borrow a Narnian phrase, although it equally applies here). To aid the damned, the real, the saved, must go back and forsake their journey for a time, to aid those that will.One of the grandest scenes is toward the very last, in which a lady named Sarah is seen. In this, another of his master's ideals is expressed. Sarah Smith is no great woman by earth's standards, but she is so close to God, everyone she meets she changes for the better. God wants to use you, not only for his own intimate purposes, but for you also to update and bring the quality of the life for others around you to a much better place. Her whole train of follows is transformed by her love, because she allows God to work through her, and submitted to her; in turn, she transforms others, because she is a yielded vessel. Macdonald states of her &quot;There's joy enough in the little finger of a great saint such as yonder lady to waken all the dead things of the universe into life&quot;. Likewise, because of Lewis being yielded to God, this book has a similar effect (as, perhaps, all of his books do -- I cannot say all because I have not read all).Ultimately, the entire point of this beautiful little book is that there could be no damnation without free choice. God made us to fellowship with us, not to damn us to hell. We are to enter into joy - but because we live in a fallen world, we might choose to hang onto some vice instead of entering into joy. Joy, that grand and beautiful intimacy with the Lord, real satisfying water that will forever quench your thirst, that is what C. S. Lewis is about. Let us not choose to stay in Hell. But one must understand this - Lewis is not advocating there is such a thing as bus rides to hell. The novel is, of course, but a dream. It is no way an examination of what lies after we die, although it does give thought to MacDonald's view on Universalism, though Lewis did not hold that view himself. Enter into joy, dear child, and meet Christ."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The perfect blend of logic, common-sense, and insight, the Great Divorce is typical CS Lewis. It is a masterpiece of Christian thinking, even by Lewis's standards, and ranks among his best in my opinion. This short work of fiction seeks to explain why some people go to heaven and others go to hell. Lewis's thesis is essentially this: those who are in heaven are there because they want to be, and those who are in hell are there because they want to be there, too. In other words, Divine judgment does not send individuals screaming down to hell--in fact, they go there themselves.Lewis's guide in the story, who just happens to be George MacDonald, tells him that most people have the attitude best expressed by Milton in Paradise Lost: \\"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.\\" According to Lewis, it is pride and selfishness that keep people from wanting to go to heaven. In the story, a number of \\"ghosts\\" are brought to the outskirts of heaven by bus, yet almost none of them wants to actually enter heaven when given the chance. They all have some reason why heaven isn't good enough, why they shouldn't go there. In other words, they willfully go back to hell.Of course, this story rocks the traditional views of the separation of the good and the evil, but Lewis presents his thesis in such an applicable story that it makes one stop and think. Why would a selfish, self-centered person want to be in heaven, anyway? What would they do? In Lewis's mind, there is no \`marriage' between heaven and hell, because the two (and those who occupy them) want to keep as much distance between them as possible. Hence the title.As I said, I think this is one of Lewis's best. It definitely got me thinking. This is a great book, suitable for young adults and adults alike, that will certainly expand your mind on how we choose to live in our own personal heaven or hell."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"We who still live on Earth will probably never see another C.S. Lewis. The man was in a category all by himself. Most writers live to write ONE great work...Lewis wrote many including the Narnia Chronicles (NOT just for children!), The Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity and many, many others. The Great Divorce is my second favorite Lewis work, just (barely) behind Till We Have Faces. Lewis introduces the work by citing Blake's concept of the marriage of heaven and hell, then writing about their divorce. Many of the details of the book have been cited by other reviewers, so I will only add that the book is a wonderful, thoughtful portrait of the human condition from the mind of a brilliant thinker. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The blurb of the edition that I grew up with says, &quot;Few know that from Hell one can can take a day excursion by bus to the outskirts of Heaven. The author finds himself, in this fantasy, taking such a trip....&quot; with interesting results. Hell itself is interesting--despite a previous reviewer's comments, Lewis's vision of Hell is not quite the traditional one. Lewis in the book, once in Heaven, becomes more or less a bystander, watching angels meet the others who have taken the trip from Hell and trying to convince them to give up, again in the words of the blurb, &quot;their most precious sins,&quot; those things they insist on keeping even at the cost of eternal joy. Twerpy as that seems, it becomes all too believable as encounter after encounter takes place. These are superb. There is the Tragedian, who uses 'his manly, bullying tone--the one for bringing women to their senses;' the chattering woman; the man in the grip of lust, a little lizard--'I promise I won't do it anymore. I'll give you nice dreams, sweet and fresh and almost innocent. You might say, quite innocent...;' the Big Man; and (best of all!) the Apostate Bishop, with his theory about Jesus, who was 'a comparatively young man when he died. He would have outgrown some of his views, you know, if he'd lived. I shall point out how this deepens the significance of the Crucifixion...&quot;(point out, I should say, to his theology study group in Hell). The descriptions are fantastic, the comments on target; even if the reader doesn't agree with Lewis's views in general, he or she will recognize human nature in the characters, drawn with a very steady and sure hand."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis explains things about heaven, hell and the like in the form of a novella in this book. It uses great imagery and symbols to grasp spiritual and deeper concepts. The material itself makes you think about what Lewis is saying, what you believe and what the Bible teaches. It is worth buying and reading over and over."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I decided to pick up The Great Divorce after a 15-year hiatus when I saw a play based on this work. The play was splendid, so I decided to reread this short but power-packed book. Based on the decisions made by the characters who made the bus trip to a place between heaven and hell, I decided that not much has changed since Lewis' day (or since I last read this). Some very insightful comments are made, and I found myself challenged in several ways. Lewis has a way of putting things that, though complex, he makes sound almost simple. I appreciate his insights and hope that I can apply some of the lessons into the last half of my life. I'm grateful to people like Lewis when they are able to have such an impact in the way I think. Definitely one of my top five Lewis favorites."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is a fascinating, entertaining, short read about a group of travellers who take a bus excursion from hell into a place where they are given a chance to go into heaven. Surprisingly, they actually seem to prefer hell. This is not a book about what heaven is like or what hell is like. It's about people like us, and our choices, and how they affect our lives as eternal beings.Reading the dialogue as heavenly beings try to convince them to come to heaven, I found myself trying to keep track of who was the \\"right\\" person and who was \\"wrong\\", because the way the hell-people were talking was just the same way I talk! Of course, they seemed so stupid to me because I was on the heaven side of the book. But it reminded me of a quote from the movie The Truman Show (paraphrased): \\"I think what bothers you is that Truman prefers his cell.\\"These people lived in hell (and that description is interesting too) and they would rather go back there than swallow the pride that had made them reject God in the first place. One of Lewis' easier reads, for people who find him difficult to follow."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This week in class we read The Great Divorce. It's a great book and if you haven't read it... just... go read it.The book is about a bus that goes from hell to heaven. People from hell can get on the bus and go to heaven where people are waiting to greet them and convince them to let go of their sins and follow them to the mountains. The people who come from hell, however, are like ghosts against the landscape of heaven which is very hard. It is more real (hello, Plato!). Anyway, the narrator is met by George MacDonald, the Christian writer whose writing helped to convert/inspire C.S. Lewis.The thing about C.S. Lewis' view of hell is that it is essentially a hell of your own choosing. He takes human freedom so seriously that God's grace can ultimately do nothing about it.The interesting thing, which can be seen in other works by Lewis, is that all of the sins that keep people from hell are the deep sins that take a person over. Each person is very consumed by themselves. My personal favorite character is the Episcopal theologian who is so obsessed with the questioning and the prestige that he can get from coming up with new questions and theories that he forgets that the questioning should lead to answers.Interestingly, the one person who made it from hell to heaven was the person who had the sin of lust. The thing that I found interesting about all that is that if you looked at the media or even just what the Church focuses on, you would think that lust is the WORST SIN POSSIBLE. But, it is not all consuming like some of the other sins and, as I said, ultimately the person with the sin of lust is the only person who makes it to heaven.This is one of my personal C.S. Lewis favorites, the other being \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". If you like Lewis, you'll love these and if you haven't read anything by him, \\"The Great Divorce is a perfect place to start."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":". . .people send themselves there.Every moral choice one makes moves one either closer to God or farther away from Him. Finally, if one moves far enough away, one will be so far off that one cannot move back, and will have forgotten that it is possible, and will have forgotten that it is desirable.Yet God is always ready to give a person a chance to return to Him, and will help someone who really wants to be helped. But He will not force anyone. He has limited His omnipotence in this way as a sign of His love for us. (Remember that 1960s saying, \\"If you love something, set it free. If it comes back it will be yours forever.\\"?)Lewis has played with this concept fictionally in this work. Those who are in the edges of Hell--not so far away that they have lost all memory of God and the chance to return--are given a chance to come back to Him. But they must renounce everything that has come between them and Him--pride, envy, malice, greed, whatever. This is harder than it sounds. As sometimes a surgeon must cut off a limb to save a life, just as chemotherapy may be almost worse than cancer, so the renunciation of what keeps us away from God may be painful, but necessary.Of course, by stressing human free will, Lewis gives short shrift to divine soveregnty, as another reviewer remarks. But Lewis is not attempting a complete exposition of Christian doctrine here."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Though I've read many of C.S. Lewis' books multiple times, I just finished this one for the first time. How did I never read it sooner?The Great Divorce takes readers on a bus ride through an \\"imaginative supposal\\" (as Lewis put it) of the afterlife. The narrator travels from the grey city -- described later as either Purgatory or Hell, depending on where one ends up -- to the foothills of Heaven. Along the way, citizens of Heaven plead with those from Grey Town to turn away from the petty things that they cling to, and embrace the better, more Real life offered in the high country.The title of the book is an allusion to William Blake's \\"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\\". Lewis intends to show that one can only obtain eternal life and enter Heaven by completely divorcing oneself from all the attachments to things that we love more than God. Sometimes the things we hold on to are obviously sinful: lust, gambling, pride, etc. But sometimes -- perhaps even most of the time -- the things which keep people from coming to Christ are those things which seem like good things: love of one's children or country, for instance. It is as Tim Keller wrote in his recent book Counterfeit Gods: \\"Sin isn't only doing bad things, it is more fundamentally making good things into ultimate things. Sin is building your life and meaning on anything, even a very good thing, more than on God.\\"Many have criticized Lewis for his use of the term \\"Purgatory\\" to describe the state of those who are not in Heaven, but are being offered the chance to get there. Is this proof that he affirmed the Roman Catholic dogma of Purgatory?I don't think so. First of all, what is described in this book is certainly not a description of \\"Purgatory\\" that would please a Catholic. Whatever Lewis means by the word \\"Purgatory\\", it is certainly not the traditional Catholic understanding.Instead, I believe Lewis was using \\"Purgatory\\" as a literary device, meant to depict that our time here on Earth is the period during which we have the opportunity to purge the sin from our lives, divorcing ourselves from Hell and betrothing ourselves to Christ. For those who are being sanctified and made more like Christ, this world will become more and more like Heaven. For those who reject Christ's offer of salvation, life becomes Hell on Earth. In this way, what we make of our lives we will carry with us into eternity.In any event, this is a great novel, and worthy of your consideration."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If you have been introduced to the work of CS Lewis byMere Christianity,The Screwtape Letters: With Screwtape Proposes a ToastorThe Chronicles of Narnia, give yourself the delight of discovering his amazing other works--especially this gem THE GREAT DIVORCE. It might just change your life as it did mine. I first read this ideal book club selection 16 years ago while I was in seminary and this brief, 128 page book has flooded my mind ever since. Upon New Years 2010 I decided to read it again. To my amazement, the two characters I had thought the book centered around were only on THREE pages of the book. Clearly these characters (a ghost with an annoying red lizard on his shoulder whom he hated but tolerated because he wasn't ready to give it up) struck a cord in my life at that time. Lewis introduces this book as a fictional tale of the afterlife, purgatory if you will. We begin at a bus stop at dusk in a gray town of ghosts (who don't know they're ghosts). The adventure goes on from there as the ghosts go on a field trip where they are really going to meet spirits of friends gone before them who encourage them to walk away from their well guarded misery and choose joy in Heaven. Each ghost is told it is their choice to remain in hell, yet what we encounter is ghost after ghost who sadly chooses to hold onto their anger, bitterness, pride, envy, pity, grudges, celebrity, and bickering rather than give it all up for the gift of heaven right in front of their eyes. As you read the pages you will see glimpses of many people you know and yes, even of yourself....perhaps that is why for 16 years I remembered the book as being about these two little characters who only took up 3 pages--it must have reminded me of annoying things I've been holding on to rather than laying them down before God. It's an easy, quick read, unlike Lewis' MERE CHRISTIANITY, and yet you'll ponder it long after."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"It is understandably difficult to offer an accurate depiction of any existence beyond that which humans experience on a daily basis. Fortunately for the reader of this text, Mr. Lewis claims to do no such thing. Yes, within this work the main character finds himself in Heaven, as well as Hell; however, it is this reviewer's opinion that the descriptions of these places are far from that which the work is intended to convey. Rather, it is that which this character observes and comes to understand while in these places that carries the weight of the message.In his typical, albeit masterful, fashion, Mr. Lewis presents the reality of decisions made by every individual. In this case, such decisions expand beyond the temporal and into the realm of the eternal. Within this work, the point is clearly made that indecision is a decision in itself and that the decision to decide or not to decide must be made just as any other seemingly harmless decision if ultimate good is to be attained; perhaps in the form of a Heavenly existence. That is, there must be a complete and total surrender to good which can continuously lead to greater good, as opposed to evil or lingering indecisiveness which, while detrimental actions, behaviors, and/or perceptions can be rectified, can never transform into good simply by pressing onward.Mr. Lewis vividly illustrates many of the snares which may disallow an attainment of that which is, ultimately, happiness through the means of intriguing character interactions and dialog incorporated within an extremely enjoyable and readable storyline. While Heaven and Hell might be little more than an abstract thought to many, if not most; Mr. Lewis has, yet again, applied a brilliant mind to difficult concepts in such a way that the message is made readily accessible to anyone that is fortunate enough to acquire a copy of this text. The message, however, could be easily missed, misunderstood, or lost by those that do not believe in the eternal consequences of decisions. Nonetheless, this is a must read for those that do subscribe to this belief and may prove to be, at least, thought provoking for those that do not."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This little book is a total joy to read. I know that the author makes it very clear that one should not suppose that he is factually presenting details of the afterlife, yet, in the end he has created a most satisfying image of a plausible afterlife. As for the title, he is referring to the poet-mystic William Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell. He points out that this is a synthesis that can never be, for to do so would compromise the absolute Goodness of Heaven, thereby making a Hell of both. Perhaps there can one day be a marriage of Heaven and Earth (thereby showing both to really have been Heaven all along), but never of Heaven and Hell.I loved the imagery of Hell being very much like a never-ending city on Earth where it is always twilight and eternal night always on the verge. Yet, it is not a crowded city for people keep moving apart because they cannot stand each other's presence. That's just it. People dwell in Hell by their own choice. It is the obsessions that separate them from God and the highest reality that keep them from leaving. It is even shown that such higher impulses as love and pity, if unhealthily indulged in for their own sake and for nothing higher or transcendent, can keep you in Hell. Yet, this Hell is also Purgatory for those who workout their obsessions. In fact, there is a regular bus service to Heaven for fieldtrips that serve just that purpose (I always suspected that the omnibus originated in Hades.)As for Heaven, it is perpetually just the moment before dawn and eternal day. The idea that Heaven is actually more substantial than Hell, or Earth, is reasonable, since it is after all the more Real of the two being closer to the Creator. Indeed, the visitors from Hell appear as pale and insubstantial deformed ghosts who find the adamantine hardness and density of the higher plane physically painful (even walking upon the grass.) The residents of the realm however are radiant spirits who do everything that they can to point out the mistakes and illusions that the ghostly visitors still cling to- and which are the only thing keeping them from traveling higher up and farther in to the one true goal. The most detailed and believable of these tutelary spirits is Lewis' own spriritual mentor, George Macdonald."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis had a knack of titling his works with either extreme modesty or with seemingly unrelated terms. This is the case with \\"The Great Divorce,\\" which sounds like a romance novel, but is meant to reveal the separate nature of the two realms of Heaven and Hell, yet speaks very little to the actual content of the work.The short fictional piece is a fantastic journey through, what at first could be taken as any dreary British town, complete with gray architecture and quarreling citizens. Until the point when the bus on which these citizens are riding is lifted off the ground, the reader may take the setting to be home. The setting is definitely not home, but the personalities are the same. The characters throughout are used as a way to illustrate good and bad behavior and that which would get you in to the grand and beautiful Heaven or leave you in the small, pointless, and gray Hell.Lewis is entertaining and thoughtful and once again comes up with brilliant points about human nature and the moral law, including Christianity (though this is but a subtle underlying theme). One interesting point Lewis makes that people will relate to is that given the clear choice between going to Heaven or Hell based on their beliefs, people will insist on maintaining their irrational beliefs and actually choose a pointless and brutal, yet familiar, Hell.This is a great one-day read and part of a collection of Lewis' work that cannot be overestimated."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book became an instant favorite with me because of Lewis' amazing originality and thought-provoking ideas. Though many of the scenarios are, by his own admission, not truly his views of heaven and hell, they remain excellent and creative ways of causing the reader to evaluate other ideas and concepts. Lewis' creativity shines through in this little book more than any of his other books."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Clives Staples Lewis was born in Belfast in 1898 and died on Nov. 22, 1963. In between those two dates of beginning and ending Lewis wrote immortal works such as \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" and other fantasies as well as several Christian apologetic works including \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" and \\"The Aboliton of Man.\\"This book is a short tour through the regions of hell and heaven as Lewis hops a supernatural taxi to the lands beyondmortality.The work is a tour de force as Lewis meets several hellishindividuals who have become ghosts and dwell in the nether regions due to their sinfulness and refusal to repent.The journey to heaven is a joy ride as Lewis insists the Christian life is one of joyful faith.If you have not read Lewis or are seeking an intellectual who believed Christ then Lewis is the man for you! Like Aslan in the Chronicles of Narnia he roared out his belief !A classic of the Christian apologetic tradition."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The book, the Great Divorce, by C.S. Lewis, is nothing shy of amazing! Lewis' style, and use of language allures, and captures the reader, taking them right into the heart of this book. I was definitely intrigued by the title, and then completely captivated by the content! Once you start reading, you'll never wanna stop. The Great Divorce should definitely be considered one of Lewis' greatest works. Lewis parallels the great debate, and internal struggle that man(persons) have in relation to God. This book will really drive you to think about God, and if God exists, and God's awesomeness. Give it a read, I'm sure you'll agree."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The wonderful thing about C.S. Lewis was that he put an amazing amount of thought into his faith. He understood better than most that becoming a Christian meant constantly trying to understand more, to examine both one's self and one's relationship to God. His penetrating intellegence towards Christianity is something that is often lacking in religion, and every time I read Lewis I learn something new, both about myself and my faith. Lewis is a true master. Another author who I'd highly recomend to anyone who enjoys Lewis, one who explores the Christian faith as brilliantly as Lewis, is Brian Caldwell. His novel, We All Fall Down is breathtaking. I'd put him on a par with Lewis, both for writing ability and theological brilliance. His novel is one of the few Christian masterpieces. Both Lewis and Caldwell should be read by those who have discovered God and want to explore that faith as deeply as possible, and perhaps more importantly, by those who have not."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I simply love reading anything written by C.S. Lewis. It is like curling up in front of a fireplace with a blanket.The Great Divorce is a thoughtful story about a bus load of residents from hell who travel to the outskirts of heaven and meet a group of residents from heaven who try to reason with them and convince them to come back to heaven with them. Lewis' narrative is quite heartbreaking in places, and it is thought-provoking and poignant throughout.Read this short book along with Mere Christianity for a good introduction to Lewis' writings. The essays in Mere Christianity on the Christian faith were an integral part of my coming to faith in Christ."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S.

This book has some of the best dialogue and concepts regarding heaven and hell and the human condition you will find anywhere. If you read only one book by CS Lewis, this is the one"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"In some ways one could compare \\"The Great Divorce\\" to Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" Both are allegories speaking to the consequences of earth choices. Or more properly, the consequence, singular. Or even more properly, the eternal consequence of life's one major earthly choice.As the title indicates, Lewis sees a great divorce, or a great divide between all people of all time: there are those who choose for Christ and there are those who choose against Christ. The title also highlights the relationality of our choice: we either choose to accept the marriage proposal of Christ our Worthy Groom, or we choose to divorce ourselves from the final Marriage Super of the Lamb.Choice made, Lewis, as only he could do, takes us on a bus ride to heaven and hell illustrating the types of choices we make, the moral peril our choices place us in, and the end result of a life time of choices that confirm us either in good or evil.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" \\"Soul Physicians\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is a delightful work of fiction. Lewis is unparalleled in his ability to intertwine spiritual truths with the human psyche. As also shown in The Screwtape Letters, Lewis has unusually keen insight into human behavior and this behavior manifests itself in spiritual dynamics. There are portraits both tragic and comic in this book that, taken as isolated examples, soberly illustrate how petty grievances, grumbling, and the need to control others reveal eternal separation from God. This is consistent with Lewis's notion in The Screwtape Letters that cards can just as easily lead someone to hell as murder. These are cautionary tales that focus on the common foibles of humans - and this, as much as a strength, is also its weakness. Theologically, it tends to too greatly emphasize the free will and sovereignty of humans rather than God. God appears as one who stands by, waiting and hoping that each will give up the petty sins that separate them from eternal joy. This image directly contradicts the God of the Sciptures, whose eternal decrees are not dependant on the actions of the created to carry them out. He is the Potter and we are the clay - a concept clearly set forth in Scripture. In short, it is a wonderful parable and should be read by all thinking Christians, but those same thinking Christians should understand the difference between good literature and good theology."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"In this brilliant work of fiction, C.S. Lewis brings amazing clarity and light to universal truths that we can all identify with, but few of us ever fully grasp. I have gained a whole new perspective on a question that has, thus far, plagued my Christian walk: \\"Why is it that something that is so clear and painfully obvious to a Christian, is so extremely difficult to convince to an unbeliever?\\". As plainly as Truth stares us in the face, it's difficult to comprehend why others so easilly overlook it, while vituperating us \\"brain-washed\\" Christians. After reading this book, I am finally beginning to better understand the paradox. The truth is that, on some level, everyone sees the Truth. Many are just unwilling to let go of what they have come to embrace in this world. The meaning they have been able to build for themselves, and control on their terms, has become more presious to them than the Truth, and more desirable than true Joy. If their chosen lives were taken away from them, they would be miserable with Truth. One line from the story sums it all up. It comes directly after the most oft quoted phrase from the book (\\"...Thy will be done.\\"): \\"All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell.\\". This is NOT to say that Evangelism should stop. By no means! We just need to learn when it's time to stop and move on to another. We can't make the choice for them. We are called to sow. Only God can tend the soil...OUTSTANDING book!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Although this book doesn't get the notice that the Narnia series or Mere Christianity receive, I find myself going back to it time and time again when looking for illustrations on the difference between here and the afterlife. His descriptions of Heaven and Hell just seem so logical and right. Not in their exactness but in the difference of them from life right now. My favorite scenes are those where he describes Heaven as being more substantial and weighty while at the same time painful for those who are not a part of it. Lewis is able to get across the Love of God while maintaining the seriousness and awe that are so often associated with God in the Bible, but which seem to be lacking in the writings of our time. Great read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This was a pretty good and deep book. I would have liked Lewis to keep going in his description and be more like a Dante's Divine Comedy. However, you can see why he stops where he does. His characters are well thought of and you can see the great illustrations he gets from his cast of characters. I found myself a bit confused at times with what was going on so this will definately need to get a second reading. Overall I enjoyed the book and Lewis' character and humor shine through even here.

However, I came away with a definite appreciation for this man's work. Have you ever found yourself wading through pages filled with words you can barely pronounce let alone understand without seeking out a dictionary? I have and that typically does not make for an easy read, let alone enjoyable. Such is not the case with \\"The Great Divorce\\". Lewis uses language common to us all and still communicates a compelling story.Not compelling in the sense that you must conform or be outcast, rather, the kind of compelling that makes you think, where indeed, you feel to compel yourself into self-analysis. The conclusions are yours to be drawn, the meaning is yours to find, and the outcome will be yours to determine.This lends to the enjoyable experience of it all. I did not come away with quite the knock-you-down, action-packed, drama-soaked, dog-and-pony-show that we are accustomed to these days.

And yes, it IS a choice, and each soul makes his or her own choice.In this allegory, told without the capital letters of The Pilgrim's Regress that C. S. Lewis wrote as a modern answer to The Pilgrim's Progress, a number of souls get on a celestial bus that takes them from a dreary Hell to an all but unbearable Heaven. It is too bright, too solid, too Real - and too impartial for their self-absorption to endure. One by one, most of them choose their small, self-important construct of Hell instead of the terrible beauty of Heaven. But not all go back. A few find that Heaven has been their true home all along.This is a wonderful, eye-opening, soul-expanding story, and C.S. Lewis wrote it in such a straightforward style that just about any one of any age can read it and understand it. I kept thinking to myself, \\"But I know someone just like that!\\" or \\"That's just how I feel!\\" or \\"That's exactly what I think!\\"There is so much more than just the Narnia books by C.S.

I listened to it on an 8-hour road trip with pause from time to time to discuss the material with my trip mate. The content of \\"the Great Divorce\\" is about \\"repentance of sins\\", but the tone is personal and animated. It is good for believers as well as agnostic audience to further understand the idea of love, sins, and heaven and hell."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"CS Lewis always produces insightful works.

This production has an editorial review from AudioFile Magazine.I do not know if these two audio readings of \\"The Great Divorce\\" are one and the same, or are two separate editions, but both are recorded by the same reader, Robert Whitfield (I suspect the latter is the case, based on past experience with other such audio editions which are separate productions made at different times by different publishers, but both using the same reader).My conclusion: although the HarperAudio 2003 edition is probably a different one from the Blackstone Audio edition of 2000, nevertheless, if you want to get an approximate idea of the quality of the HarperAudio reading, check the AudioFile review of the Blackstone edition, which is pretty positive in tone...so I expect Robert Whitfield's reading for HarperAudio is just about as good.Note: I have not heard either of these recordings of \\"The Great Divorce\\" yet, but years ago I did read the book and enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis explains things about heaven, hell and the like in the form of a novella in this book. It uses great imagery and symbols to grasp spiritual and deeper concepts. The material itself makes you think about what Lewis is saying, what you believe and what the Bible teaches. It is worth buying and reading over and over."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Admittedly, I have a certain degree of difficulty decoding C.S. Lewis's brand of science fiction/Christian fiction. It is not so much that I can not appreciate his writing as that I have trouble picturing the fantastic concepts that Lewis paints. This being said, I was able to take quite a lot from this book.In \\"The Great Divorce\\", the narrator dreams he has taken a bus ride that allows him a visit to eternity. Visiting both heaven and hell, Lewis paints a picture that in some ways reminds me of the movie \\"What Dreams May Come\\". Beneath the imagery is a morality play in which people's choices have consequences. Some people make choices that put them in a position that causes harm to their soul which can be healed if they are made to see their fault. The most famous line of the book epitomizes the concept: \\"thy will be done\\" or \\"Thy will be done\\".Readers need not accept the imagery created in this book to appreciate the messages. Choices have consequences for our soul. The correct choices decrease the burden on our soul and allow us the opportunity of eternal life in paradise."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis' \\"The Great Divorce\\" may be the most unusual book you will ever read. Beyond allegory, beyond fantasy, this look at the nature of Heaven, Hell, and the denizens of both has radically altered the view of what happens after we die in the lives of more people than any book you will encounter.Lewis provides an utterly original view of the afterlife through the mechanism of a bus trip from Hell to Heaven. The portrayals of the vast, nearly-empty city in Hell and a Heaven more real and solid than our reality are so profound that many will find their thoughts on the two places forever altered.Also included is an examination of the question that has haunted many: \\"How can a loving God send people to Hell?\\" Lewis brilliantly answers this in a way that is completely satisfying to even the most demanding inquirer. You'll have to read the book to see.There are so many gems in \\"The Great Divorce\\" that any further discussion would spoil the book. But suffice it to say, this work of fiction may be the greatest ever written for provoking long and enjoyable discussions with others. As a worthy diversion from more heady small group studies, it is without peer."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"You always hear about people talking about life-changing books. Perhaps I greeted this with a certain degree of incredulity. Surely they were referring to books they simply liked, or maybe even loved?That was before I happened upon this book. It was recommended to me by a minister and director of a youth organization where I volunteered several years ago. And it isn't until now that I completed it. But I can finally say that I have encountered a book that has truly sparked cause for me to take a look back on my life.Lewis takes the reader on a bus ride from hell to heaven, or rather the Valley of the Shadow of Heaven. In heaven we see that all who took the bus ride are merely Ghosts here: ethereal figures. They are greeted by Spirits, people of light and substance who have accepted God as their ultimate Love. The Ghosts are given the choice to continue on to Heaven, or take the bus back to Hell. The path to Heaven won't be without pain, as the Ghosts must give up the earthly vices they have made their God.Lewis' talent is in depicting so well the nature of humans. Don't expect to see the Ghosts' vices being anything so simple as hate for someone. Rather in one instance it is a mother's love for her son that keeps her from choosing Heaven, a love that blinds her from the ultimate love of God. I see so much of myself in these &quot;Ghosts&quot;, and Lewis paints a very compassionate picture of the &quot;damned&quot; (they need not be if they choose not to be). Lewis' book in a sense almost helps you to step outside yourself and look with less clouded vision on the person you are. It is for this reason this has become my favorite work."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This brilliant little piece of literature takes only an hour or two to read, but will foster a lifetime of contemplation and thought concerning heaven and hell. What if God gave people in hell (which, in the novel, is a gray, drab, lonely place) a second chance at heaven? Would they take it, or would they desperately hang on to their miserable lives, which is a hell in itself? Lewis, in his &quot;dream&quot;, sees a procession of people who are given that chance and, sadly, hardly any take it. That illustrates what I've always believed about hell: God doesn't send you there, you basically send yourself by rejecting His free gift of salvation. To those &quot;ghosts&quot; in hell, heaven is actually a scary place, at least at first. Most don't want to go any further past the &quot;hard part&quot; to the glories that reside up the &quot;mountain&quot;. Some may get a little tripped up by the rather unorthodox theological implications, but don't let that hinder you. Just enjoy the ride, and let it speak deeply to your spirit."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"THE GREAT DIVORCE is remarkable for being a book by C. S.

While MERE CHRISTIANITY is an apology for traditional Christianity, THE PROBLEM OF PAIN an attempt to deal with problems in theodicy, and THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS a help for analyzing psychological dimensions of temptation, THE GREAT DIVORCE can best be described as speculative theology. This is not the only place where Lewis allows himself to speculate on matters theological. For instance, he elsewhere suggests that pets and other animals who have interacted with humans will go to heaven, while wild animals will not, because these animals have gained a personality through human contact. In this work, Lewis speculates about the nature of the afterlife.Inevitably, Lewis's work will unfairly be compared to Dante, who like Lewis is granted a visit to the afterlife. It is unfair because Dante's DIVINE COMEDY is without debate one or the two or three greatest masterpieces in the history of world literature. THE GREAT DIVORCE is not even one of Lewis's best works. Still, as long as one does not force Lewis's work to compare favorably to Dante's work, the comparison is not uninstructive. Like Dante, Lewis finds a guide. While Dante is shown through Hell and Purgatory by Virgil and through heaven by Beatrice, Lewis's guide is the Scottish theologian and fantasy writer George MacDonald. This is not inappropriate for a couple of reasons. What Lewis is suggesting about heaven and hell in THE GREAT DIVORCE is not precisely orthodox, and MacDonald himself, while devoutly religious, was somewhat heterodox in his advocacy of universalism, i.e., the belief that all humans will be redeemed, and not only Christian believers.In THE GREAT DIVORCE Lewis tries to take a midpoint between universalism and a traditional belief in eternal damnation in hell of unbelievers. Lewis is hardly the first to attempt this. Origen, the brilliant if eccentric father of the early church, among other things toyed with the idea that being sent to hell might not be a permanent state. Lewis attempts to preserve the notion of the punishment of sins, but shifts the agent of that punishment from God to the individual involved. Basically, people place themselves in hell and prevent themselves from ascending to heaven. All one need do is surrender one's will to God, and cease insisting on one's own conception of things. In a sense, the primary thing an individual can do to receive grace, even in the next world, is to humble oneself.The great negative to Lewis's view is that it doesn't correspond terribly well with either the views of the New Testament or to traditional Church teaching. The great advantage is that it absolves God of any complicity in sending people to hell. A host of factors will determine whether one will find one or either of these views desirable. Like George MacDonald, I tend to be quite orthodox on most Christian doctrines, but somewhat heterodox on the issue of the damnation of the unsaved. I personally am quite drawn to Lewis's views on the afterlife, and while I concede that they don't mesh well with the Bible's teachings on hell, I believe they mesh well with the Bible's teachings on the loving nature of God. It solves some key issues at the heart of theodicy, or to paraphrase Milton, it justifies the ways of God to men.Regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with Lewis, this marvelous book raises some important theological questions. It also complicates the normal picture of Lewis as a staunch defender of traditionalism. We find in it that Lewis was also a bit of a theological rebel."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This little book is a total joy to read. I know that the author makes it very clear that one should not suppose that he is factually presenting details of the afterlife, yet, in the end he has created a most satisfying image of a plausible afterlife. As for the title, he is referring to the poet-mystic William Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell. He points out that this is a synthesis that can never be, for to do so would compromise the absolute Goodness of Heaven, thereby making a Hell of both. Perhaps there can one day be a marriage of Heaven and Earth (thereby showing both to really have been Heaven all along), but never of Heaven and Hell.I loved the imagery of Hell being very much like a never-ending city on Earth where it is always twilight and eternal night always on the verge. Yet, it is not a crowded city for people keep moving apart because they cannot stand each other's presence. That's just it. People dwell in Hell by their own choice. It is the obsessions that separate them from God and the highest Reality that keep them from leaving. It is even shown that such higher impulses as love and pity, if unhealthily indulged in for their own sake and for nothing higher or transcendent, can keep you in Hell. Yet, this Hell is also Purgatory for those who workout their obsessions. In fact, there is a regular bus service to Heaven for fieldtrips that serve just that purpose (I always suspected that the omnibus originated in Hades.)As for Heaven, it is perpetually just the moment before dawn and eternal day. The idea that Heaven is actually more substantial than Hell, or Earth, is reasonable, since it is after all the more Real of the two being closer to the Creator. Indeed, the visitors from Hell appear as pale and insubstantial deformed ghosts who find the adamantine hardness and density of the higher plane physically painful (even walking upon the grass.) The residents of the realm however are radiant spirits who do everything that they can to point out the mistakes and illusions that the ghostly visitors still cling to- and which are the only thing keeping them from traveling higher up and farther in to the one true goal. The most detailed and believable of these tutelary spirits is Lewis' own spriritual mentor, George Macdonald."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book is a psychological masterpiece. The dialogues are pure genius. Lewis' skeptical biographer, A. N. Wilson, acknowledging his wit, thought Lewis' parodies cruel. But is it cruel to warn of the corruption of the soul, in a way that might lead to healing? We may see the characters described here in the &quot;real world&quot; around us. Lewis is hoping, of course, that we will recognize some shadow of ourselves, and recognize our need of God's help in attaining freedom.Lewis warns in the preface that his purpose is not to promote speculation about the nature of heaven and hell. Still, the book is very thought-provoking on that count as well. This book might be helpful to someone who is trying to reconcile the love of God with the Christian doctrine of hell, as it was to M. Scott Peck, for example.A few days ago I saw an interview of a great character actress who, when asked what she would like to hear God say when she arrived at the gate of heaven, replied, &quot;Everybody in.&quot; The audience applauded loudly. Lewis, noting the remark of Milton's devil that it is &quot;better to reign in hell than serve in heaven,&quot; in effect poses the question, &quot;What if not everybody wants in?&quot; Or as Jesus put it, what if, when the invitation to the wedding of the Lamb arrives at our door, we are busy with livestock and real estate transactions, and we decide to stay home?"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"As Lewis says in his introduction, there are a couple of ways of looking at our journey through life. The first is a circle from which we all stat on the perimeter and wind up in the center. The other view, which Lewis and I hold, is that of a road with forks in it every mile or so and we are forced to choose between the two paths. In the first view we all end up in the same place while in the later view we may end up in different places, depending on our choices. If one of those places is hell, it raises the question of how a loving God could allow some to go to hell. This book is the best answer to that paradox that I have read. In short, Lewes shows that those who go to hell do so of their own free choice, but more interestingly he uses various characters to show the type of person who chooses hell over haven and why they chose hell."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The theologian who would rather lead a theological discussion in hell than experience heaven?The poet who is always slighted, never appreciated?The man who is too proud to accept any \\"bleeding charity\\" and must have his \\"rights\\"?The artist who would rather fight for his style of art than stay and take in true beauty?The materialist (entrepeneur?) who would rather try to take a bit of heaven back to hell for a proffit than enjoy the real thing?The cynic who believes everything is a sham?The grumbler who has finally become a grumble?

It demonstrates that nothing fit for one can be taken into the other and that you MUST \\"sell all that you have and follow Me.\\"I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis' imagination runs wild in this book. He sees the reality of Hell as a place where people choose to go, and Heaven as another possible choice. Through encounters with several spirits and help from his teacher, George MacDonald, Lewis learns how different attitudes toward God affect eternity.To use an image from the book, I've always found this book useful as a lens to see things more clearly."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I already liked C.S. Lewis, but had never read this book before now. It is about life and death, physical and spiritual, as well as our choices regarding God, good and evil. Being a rather small book, this surprised me. It is written somewhat, in a story format. Still, it makes one think very hard, and in ways one may not normally think. Lewis reminds us once again that life is more than meets the eye, and that our choices in this life count not only for this life, but the hereafter. I still like C.S. Lewis, even more so now. I appreciate how his writings cause me to think on the important things in life, regardless if I may agree with him or not. Heaven and hell are discussed, and more than once I was taken aback at how he looks at humanity, and man's problems, etc. A must read, only make sure you read it all the way through to the end, as well as read the preface."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This must be the singal greatest work I have ever read, and definatly cements C.S. Lewis' place in twentieth century literature. The book is an amazing examination of religion, what makes us human, philosophy, and so much more. It provides an unparralelled picture of how we should live. An excelent, even life changing read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Upon finishing a 2nd reading of this book, I don't know where to begin. It takes some time to get a reasonable hold of the world and methodology Lewis is employing, but once you do, the book is fascinating. In keeping with custom, Lewis is tremendously skilled here in discussing an idea indirectly, either through metaphor, fiction, etc. While this book is enjoyable to read, it's deadly serious, and one must pay close attention to every detail. The images, actions, and dialogues are dripping with import, and one would be hard pressed not to see at least of bit of himself in the characters. Lewis' thesis of heaven/hell being extensions or thresholds of earth is just brilliant. While I'm not sure if I agree with every facet of Lewis' tale, I cannot deny how penetrating this work is. From the perspective of eternity, we are forced to examine our notions our love, loyalty, joy, goodness, morality, and life itself. This is yet another of Lewis' works that alternately leaves you chuckling to yourself (as he sheds light on the absurd manner in which we often live our lives), and then sitting back, looking up, dropping your pencil, and then thinking - often disturbed - about the implications of what he suggests. [Speaking of pencils, I would recommend reading this with one.] I cannot overstate that although this book is \\"nice to read\\", the topic is of chilling importance, as our very lives and souls hang in the balance."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. It says in imagery and dialogue what I wish I could in a sermon. It shows the fundamental divorce between those that know God and those that don't. Those who have in the final analysis given up their selfishness indeed become \\"solid\\" people who are able to \\"journey into the mountains\\" for eternity, transformed and glorious. Those that retain their selfishness stay entrapped in an smokish, empty hell due to their own obstinacy and refusal to come to the truth.In response to another reviewer, CS Lewis absolutely smokes William Blake when it comes to representing Christianity. Blake simply conjures up his own religion in his book \\"Marriage of Heaven and Hell.\\" For example, he dialogues with the Biblical prophets Isaiah and Ezekial, and makes them say things that are simply heretical.CS Lewis' objective, on the other hand, was not simply to make up a fantasy based on his own shoddy metaphysics and obscure philosophies, but was, in response to Blake, to illuminate orthodox theology in an imaginative way, hoping to lead people to truth.Blake's writings are dangerous if you aren't familiar with Christian teachings, and I would discourage anyone looking for God to look at William Blake. They amount to not much more than the primacy and fulfillment of the natural self, whereas Lewis (and in fact the Christian premise) turns on the ultimate denial of self, in order to find the reality of the kingdom of heaven.I would encourage everyone to read The Great Divorce by CS Lewis as a visionary book. Though fiction, it gives us some helpful pictures to think about what in fact may be going on in eternity."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Cold, gray, you might get a chill just reading this book. CS Lewis uses a clever story to convey a different, though no less frightening scenario of hell and Heaven. This book will not only make you re-think your life after death.....it will challenge you to consider giving greater meaning to your life right now.The brilliance of Lewis is that he was able to convey his message equally well through non-fiction or fiction. Mere Christianity or The Great Divorce, both take different paths to the same destination...the need for God, for Christ in our lives. And the consequences of living our lives thoughtlessly or thoughtfully."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The format of the story is this:A bunch of &quot;ghosts&quot; board a bus in a dreary, drizzly town which is in perpetual twilight (we later learn that this place is &quot;the valley of the shadow of death&quot;). This flying bus takes them up to a bright (as in &quot;a minute or two before sunrise&quot;) natural setting (which we later learn is &quot;the valley of the shadow of life&quot;). Here the narrator (presumably Lewis himself) sees how without substance the ghosts (including himself) really are. They are not even substantial enough to bend the grass beneath their feet. Some of them are barely visible. They are met by &quot;spirits&quot; (each ghost has a specific spirit coming to meet him/her) who are bright and solid.The narrator describes each &quot;interview&quot; he sees between ghost and spirit. Each interview highlights a specific manifestation of pride, greed, selfishness, pettyness, manipulation - any of the sins that weigh us down. Eventually, the narrator meets the spirit sent for him (writer George MacDonald).If you read this book, you will see a lot of people you know.If you read this book HONESTLY, you will find pieces of yourself as well.This book is a magnificent moral story. An absolute must read!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"In reading this tale of a visit to the lands outside heaven, one cannot help but see himself and those around him in the characters in book. Mr. Lewis offers his wisdom and beliefs to the readers of his book. A very intelligent and striking exploration of Christianity, I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to develop religious sophistication."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I've read the book and got the CD's to have a Sunday School listen & discuss class. This has worked out very well. Healthy discussions, easy to follow story, and well read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Reading C.S. Lewis's \\"The Great Divorce\\" is like taking a really hot shower after a long day. All those confusing and heavy beliefs are washed away by his simplistic and enlightening ideas. Having the choice of choosing to accept Heaven or continue on in one's personal Hell is such a revelation.The subtle sense of humor and unique writing style is what attracts so many readers. This is a book that grows with you. If you read it at different times in your life, it will have new meanings and, hopefully, an ever-increasing value on your bookshelf.One of my favorite parts is the Teacher's description of true, selfless love: \\"It is like when you throw a stone into a pool, and the concentric waves spread out further and further. Who knows where it will end?\\""},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A different view of what people go to heaven and which don't.

Lewis knows how to convey serious reflections on human behavior in a humorous way which doesn't reduce their solemn significance. He weaves out of fiction an ultra-insightful analysis of the silly reasons why we are often hell-bent on NOT going to heaven. Recognizing those reasons and concentrating on overcoming some of them changed my life for the better. &Uuml;ber-recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"With each and every book I read by C.S. Lewis, I become an ever more admiring fan. While I cannot say this is my favorite of his works (for that spot, I reserve \\"Mere Christianity,\\" followed by \\"A Grief Observed\\"), it is as fascinating and insightful a ride as any of his. C. S. Lewis is exceptional in his ability to take the most complicated human issues and make them understandable.Blending into a queu awaiting a bus ride without fully understanding to where or why (how many of us blend sheepishly with the masses this way?), the narrator, George, takes a fantastical ride through heaven and hell. Just two possible end points on this trip, and with that, Lewis makes it clear: as much as we try to rationalize and wiggle, there is no gray area in life, or, in this case, the after life. You choose. Black or white, good or evil.With a cast of colorful characters, ghostly figures and helpful angels who only wish to give the undecided one final chance to decide, we ride along with those who, we soon realize, resemble everyone we know. Including you and me. The whiner and the complainer, the cheater and the liar, the rationalizer, the egotist, the shortchanger. Even the overly devoted mother, who, upon closer examination, clings to her son more to serve her own selfish needs than to let him go in a loving manner for his wellbeing is not the marytr she believes herself to be.It is not in the big falls that we lose our way to heaven. It is, more often than not, in the petty details of our lives, all those grand intentions come to nothing, all those shortcomings and shortcuts taken, all those more challenging routes avoided, where we take wrong turns that will land us only in hell. A stern Father reminds us, \\"Your will be done,\\" rather than His. And so, for all who did not trust in Him, but stubbornly held to their own willful ways, the bus has only one last stop.As amusing as this little tale (novella) is to read, the message is heavy duty. If you don't recognize yourself in at least a few of these lost souls, look harder. And then give your future bus stop some careful thought..."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"CS Lewis great theologian or great Christian apologist as some would say was one heck of a writer.The Great Divorce C.S Lewis good as a stand alone story or as a more deeper spiritual book. I continue to be blown away by how good C.S Lewis is one of those authors where sometimes you get the strangest sensation that he is actually speaking directly to you.The Great Divorce serves to remind all of us that while sin does indeed have an eternal penalty the first commandment for all Christians is love."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I read a review on here that said: \\"If you read this book HONESTLY, you will find pieces of yourself as well.\\"This statement cannot be more true. This book is an adventure, a page turner, an experience of self-inquiry and self-reflection, and shows human nature and egoic nature in the most recognizable forms."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I find C.S. Lewis to be a mixed bag. Sometimes he is incredibly insightful, especially on the foibles and depth of human nature and sin (see Screwtape Letters). However, he has some serious difficultly presenting certain doctrines of Christianity well, esp. Predestination/Free Will, simply because he works very hard to make sure it is above all *reasonable*. Many Christians believe in a higher standard above reason (the Scriptures), and some have found that it makes statements that just cannot be made reasonable to the critic without screwing up their meaning.The Great Divorce is an example of this. His presentation at the end of Free Will and Predestination is utterly unhelpful, having people choose and yet having the people be little more than chessmen on a chessboard shows forth the meanderings of a human trying to grope something God did not fully reveal to us. If you are looking for an answer drawn from the Bible on the subject of Free Will and Predestination, I would encourage studying Romans 9 and Chemnitz' presentation in The Book of Concord, Formula of Concord Solid Declaration, Article XI.However, he does do an excellent job portraying humans sinfulness and rejection of eternal life in a very artful way. For this, I give the book 2 stars. I deeply regret having read this as my first dive into Lewis (I loved Screwtape Letters, give that two thumbs up)... I found the Bible's answers far more mysterious and satisfying."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I tried to get into this literary classic and just couldn't quite understand it. It came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine because he knew I had just read and enjoyed Rob Bell's, \\"Love Wins\\". Apparently Lewis and Bell think similarly on issues relating to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife. But, there was just too much use of allegory and symbolism in \\"The Great Divorce\\" that I couldn't bring myself to finish it simply for a lack of understanding on my part. If I can't understand a book then I don't see the sense in continuing to read it. And, so I reluctantly stopped reading this one about halfway through. If you have no problem understanding allegory, then I recommend this book. But, if you are like me and find it difficult to understand allegory, then save yourself the time and read Love Wins instead."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Having read Mere Christianity and Miracles by C.S. Lewis and having loved both, perhaps I was unprepared for the fantasy, The Great Divorce. The two former works were 5-star hallmarks of lucidity which I found deeply influential, but this book introduced unneccessary things which discount the seriousness of the subject matter. Describing a bus trip from Hell to Heaven, C.S. Lewis' primary goal is to inform the reader of the various ways our imperfect beings embrace the former and reject the latter. All well and good. But, why C.S. Lewis (unless in a nod to Narnia) decides to include unicorns and earthly hauntings I know not. To put it simply, a man who so cogently argued in favor of God and the existence of miracles abrubtly decides to provide an utterly fantastic rendition of Heaven populated with the frivolous imagery of horses with horns! I was left wondering why not a jack-a-lope? And why not a flying saucer in which we might reach it?My disappointment lies not with the book itself for, taken alone, it provides useful insight, but in it's departure from a cherished framework. I have come to see Lewis as a provider (or at least a seeker) of truth. That we in The Great Divorce then descend into whimsy is somewhat surprising. I am not saying that the book has no merit. To the contrary, it is a fine portrayal of the hidebound pettiness of which we are all capable. Indeed, were one to read The Chronicles of Narnia first, one might find little to carp about. However, if one reads The Great Divorce as presented, in series with Lewis' works of Christian apology, then it is of no amazement should one be taken at least slightly aback.The Hereafter is, by definition, beyond the reach of temporal description (Lewis himself declines factuality in his preface). But, mythology need not be the place holder for fact. Perhaps (and just perhaps) our conceptions of Heaven and Hell are better served without unicorns and other fanciful fluff. They present, after all, a bit more of a leap than may be required. Let us stick to the meat of the matter. 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Okay, I admit that I probably shouldn't even be reviewing this book, I'm not in the target audience. For those who are in the book's target audience, I'm sure it is a wonderful book. If the description \\"enjoys Christian allegory\\" fits you, ignore my bad review and read the other reviews. All I'm saying is that for me, it was so boring I couldn't hardly finish it. I only read it because a Christian friend gave it to me.Just a few other small comments. In his introduction, Lewis finds it necessary to remind the reader that it is allegory, and he is not trying in any way to factually describe the afterlife. In fact he says, \\"encouraging factual curiosity of the afterlife is the last thing I want to do\\". Well, um, then what's the point? Though I maintain being agnostic, but I have to admit I lean more towards atheism. One of the reasons being that no one has presented, to my mind anyway, a plausible scenerio for what the afterlife is really like. An infinite life where there is presumably no pain or evil, would have to be inherently very different from our mortal existence. So different if such does exist, then it seems difficult to imagine any purpose to this very limited existence we have here. After all, a billion years from now, are you going to be sitting around heaven talking about the time your aunt died or something? I'm wondering if the reason Lewis doesn't want to \\"encourage factual curiosity\\" about the afterlife is because that when one tries to ponder it factually, it seems rather implausible.I think that a Christian would say that a quote late in the book more or less sums up what Lewis is trying to say. Lewis says that \\"there are two kinds of people, those that say to God 'thy will be done' and those that God says to them, 'thy will be done.'\\" Well, don't take the following statement as \\"bashing\\" Christians, I am fully aware that by and large, Christians are fine people. But of course there are those that claim to be Christians that don't seem like such fine people. My only point in this is that I basically reject that there is some intrinsic difference between those that choose to be Christians and those that don't. The point of the book is to try to show this supposed intrinsic difference, an intrisic difference would would last for eternity, which I reject exists. I reject Lewis' premise. I'm just in general not a big fan of allegory. And even Lewis himself says it says nothing about the real form of heaven and hell. So for me, it was a boring, useless waste of time. But if you are a Christian and like allegory, well, ignore me, I'm sure you'll like the book.NOTE: At the time of this edit of my review, I've got 0 out of 4 helpful votes. I guess I shouldn't be surprised as I'm giving a negative review of a popular book. But the point is - is my review actually helpful? And I think it is.

That's what's called a GOOD review folks - don't say it is a bad review just because you don't like my opinion!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"As C.S.

My book club friends and I, all bought this book very excited.

But we all read it anyway because we had paid 13.99 for each one. But do you know what? I actually ended up enjoying it alot! It was probably better for my mind to read this anyway, it really made me think about my life and what I can do if I try to change it for the better."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Am I the only one who finds this book mean-spirited, even sadistic? Lewis takes these poor neurotic people and consigns them to hell. They get a chance to go to heaven for a visit. There, they only see Jesus briefly from behind as some kind of celestial bus driver, and God not at all. They are mostly left to shift for themselves, without a single kind word, even though they are obviously in extreme psychological pain. Occasionally heaven deigns to send them a helper in the form of a flaming angel or someone they despised on earth. The outcome is already decided,though, in nearly every case, allegedly by their &quot;choices&quot; on earth (although one expects that they were always neurotic and weak; they just grew that way, like an oak seed grows into an oak tree). Lewis refuses to be drawn into a discussion about predestination, but it is clear he has nothing but scorn for these poor weaklings who didn't cut the mustard to begin with. There's no talk of grace here; it seems clear that the inferior neurotics just don't &quot;deserve&quot; to get into heaven, unlike all the &quot;great&quot; &quot;well-adjusted&quot; Christians who reside there. I suspect what is really going on here is that Lewis despises the neurotic aspects of himself, and has found a way in fantasy to damn them, while celebrating his own rectitude. I would have been much more impressed if the people in heaven had faults and weaknesses, but were full of grace, love and understanding instead of &quot;virtue&quot;; and if Christ had met the neurotics with assurance and love and help instead of just sitting at the front of that d--- bus. Lewis's sneering, superior attitude toward the poor &quot;sinners&quot; in this book is particularly unjustified, in light of what should be apparent to everybody: neurotic sinners usually end up being neurotic believers."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A wonderfully written story with many wonderful moments in it. Lewis paints a very vivid picture in this book, and the allegories in it are for the most part, easily seen. This book is an allegory of Heaven and Hell, and how the realities of Heaven are greater than the realities of Hell. This book follows around some folks from Hell who are given the chance to visit Heaven, and shows how those from Hell want nothing to do with Heaven. Especially delightful is Lewis's understanding of humanity, and why those in Hell would rather choose Hell than Heaven. Of course, some of these things are not doctrinally sound, but Lewis says in his preface that he wasn't trying to be sound in everything to begin with. After all, the Bible says nothing about a bus trip from Hell to Heaven, allowing those who take the trip to possibly say.As many clever things as there are in this book, I believe Lewis ruins his own book. I was shocked to see a writer who has left such a deep an impression upon Christian thought in the last century to be using unjustifiable profanity throughout this book.

Instead of being chosen, the characters have to choose whether to stay in Heaven or return to hell by choosing to adhere to their attachement such as pettiness, rigid expectations, or possessive love.

The story of one soul's experiences is told first hand by a ghost making its way from Hell onto this plane. There, it and those that came with the ghost encounter more radiant beings that have obtained a closeness with God and come from a place beyond the mountains. These spirits converse with the ghostly entities. For the most part, each chapter focuses on a conversation between one ghost and one spirit where the actions of the ghost's earthly life that have kept it from heaven are examined. The points Lewis makes are sharp and intriguing. The work itself is short and can be quickly read. I found this book to be both very interesting and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Perhaps you've read the Great Divorce and never really considered what a great way it is to introduce folks to your faith. For those in your life who consider themselves above your faith, offer them a time tested and revered author.The name certainly doesn't give away your motive. C.S. Lewis is considered a great author in almost all circles, and the book is just unclear enough to keep them holding on through the entire reading. Lewis' writing style and use of the King's English are also seemingly sophisticated and offers another reason for your unsaved friends to read the book.If you've never read the book, jump in. It's short and somewhat whimsical. It conveys a serious message of understanding your relationship with the eternal life given to each person. Where is your eternal life to be spent?"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Few books about spiritual matters are as imaginative and illuminating as Lewis' &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;....my only criticism is that the title is puzzling and off-target.What is &quot;hell&quot;, you ask....Lewis has an answer and it works for me...and it gives me hope....I'd recommend this books to anyone who wonders about what happens when this life is over...."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The is truly a Christian classic. In this book, CS Lewis gives you a glimpse of hell, and a glimpse within your own soul in ways that will have you relating completely to the characters. CS Lewis does a magnificent job of illustrating the denials and rationalizations that are faced by society, and even though this book was written decades ago, one can see the timelessness of his message. One must be ever vigilant! It is an insightful commentary on our human nature and often our obsession with being self-centered. Without you knowing it, CS Lewis touches on some basic theological issues, but without what some would consider his usual &quot;headiness&quot;. This book, along with The Screwtape Letters can serve as a good introduction to the writings of C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"\\"The Great Divorce\\" is C.S. Lewis' allegory of our lifelong struggle with our fallen nature in search of faith in God and Christ.Lewis uses the image of a bus trip taken by a few hardy souls - some of whom have an agenda, others who have nothing better to do - to a familiar yet fantastic place where they discover themselves to be ghosts in a realm of \\"solid people\\". Through a series of vignettes, the narrator describes the travails of other ghosts who contend with the roadblocks to salvation - pride, jealousy, vengeance, lust, and the love of earthly life itself.Lewis' theology owes much to the character \\"My Teacher\\", George MacDonald. A universalist, MacDonald echoes the sentiment that would dominate Lewis' other writings: that those who are condemned to Hell are there because they chose to be there over Heaven. Another readily apparent Lewis theme is that human emotions or feelings are two-edged: they can be used for purposes noble or evil. \\"Love begins to be a demon when he begins to be a god\\", lower case \\"g\\" in god emphasized, Lewis would later write in \\"The Four Loves\\". In The Great Divorce he shows that concept in action.If you are a fundamentalist or conservative protestant, you may not like some of the suggested implications, like Lewis leaving open the possibility of a purgatory, or the concept of people making salvation choices in the afterlife. Remember, it is an allegory, and as Lewis points out, we humans see things through the lens of time that appear differently in timeless Heaven.For those willing to relax their dogma a little, The Great Divorce is a thought-provoking insight into Lewis' theology and, better yet, a good catalyst for self-examination. Am I obstructing another person's spiritual progress through my selfish demands or careless attitudes? More to the point, am I willing to put on a mantle of humility and seek out those I have wronged, asking forgiveness and showing myself to be a true Christian? These are questions well worth asking, and The Great Divorce a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This seems to be the question that powers the engine of this classic novella from C.S. Lewis. Of course the answer is, why should it? Creation is not ours to control, something Lewis seems to hint at with the impenetrable nature of the garden the bus passengers visit at the tale's opening. Inspired by a science fiction story, Lewis crafted a fantasy of his own that explores the rather petty nature of humanity that keeps our eyes (or souls) closed from the beauty of creation. The book features some splendid yet amusing passages (Unicorns in Heaven? Cool!) but it does not skip over the meatier issues of faith, free will, and the traps that they are capable of creating in our oft times bitter hearts. One thing I found ironic is that the one star reviews put forth some of the very same arguments made by some of the rebellious ghosts in this allegory. I think that is the very point Lewis hoped his fantasy would make. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book basically examines the Platonic ideal of belief. In summary, a group of real world souls take a bus to heaven and speak with angels. Through opposition to their flawed eyes, Lewis describes divinity. Fabulous. I've made all my friends read it."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is a modern twist on Dante's Divine Comedy: Inferno. C S Lewis used Dante's basic theme of a solitary man (assumed to be the author) suddenly finding himself on a journey through the afterlife. Lewis differs from Dante in his conversations between the solitary wanderer and the souls already in hell. Lewis mixes truths about pride, love, service and devotion with conversational commentary about issues that are relevant to modern men. Also, Lewis approaches the nature of sin from a decidedly Protestant point of view, where the deep, ingrained nature of sin silently destroys lives until there is nothing left.The Great Divorce is a parable and at most the story is to be used, not as a continuous narrative, but as a series of extended parables dealing with the ultimate nature of eternity and how the small choices made in life show ultimate fruit in eternity. Lewis does not intend to develop an extended theological thesis on eschatology or the doctrines of heaven and hell. Besides acknowledging the reality of these realms, Lewis is more concerned with the character of the types of people who inhabit heaven and hell.Lewis uses the literary type of a journey motif. The book begins with a lone bus-rider, unaware of where he is, or where he is going. He travels through (and above and around) the hell, and as he travels, meets new arrivals and old residents of hell. His encounters with various individuals and the conversations they have illuminate the follies of all men and specifically the various temptations that befall modern men through faulty worldview thinking.One of the more dramatic conversations in the book happens between a ghost mother and her brother who was redeemed. Here the greatest example in the book of what proper love looks like is given. The mother, presuming that her love for her redeemed son is great when really it is possessive, cannot fathom how God could love a believer more than earthly relations. For the believer, this book does a clear job of explaining the nature of right relationships.A redeemed man converses with a skeptical ghost in an attempt to show the differences between the two different views of reality. The redeemed man lives by faith, and intends to act as a child. The ghost man refuses to act unless there is proof. The point is clear; the redeemed man's given faith is sufficient for approaching God. The ghost's reason and intellect is so tainted that it will only push him away in the end. At the end, the bus-rider wakes up in his study at 3 pm (the time of Christ's crucifixion) and he is led to wonder what his state is in Christ, and by proxy leaves the reader to examine his destiny and the destiny of those whom the reader loves.This book is an encouragement that there is hell that is much more serious than what is often portrayed in even the popular subculture of the church. Lewis attempts to take the insanity of the sin is to its logical conclusion. Loneliness and isolation are the emphasis in The Great Divorce. The warning here is for those who are members of the visible church to examine themselves to see if they are members of the invisible church."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce by C.S. Lewis is a short allegorical work wherein occupants of Hell travel to Heaven. Lewis is a well-known mid-twentieth century writer with well-known works in a variety of genres; religious fiction, children's fiction, science fiction as well as religion/philosophy.In my opinion this short novel (an evening or afternoon read) is one of the author's best work of religious fiction. As other reviewers have noted Lewis has a rare gift for communicating religious concepts in a clear and non-threatening manner - this ability is evident in The Great Divorce. In this work the visit to heaven, by the damned, provides an excellent forum for discussing a range of sins (e.g. self-righteousness, pride, anger) and their debilitating effect.Overall, this is an outstanding short work that is enjoyable and readable. I strongly recommend it to all readers. Those that enjoy The Great Divorce may also enjoy another short fictional work by Lewis - The Screw Tape Letters."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is one of a kind, indeed. Like that of his Screwtape Letters, it is a fantasy book, but based on a real belief in the Truth - Christianity and everything therein. C.S. Lewis definitely wrote a lot on Christianity (his apologetics), but this relatively small book puts those beliefs and convictions into a real story and situation. We are not necessarily expected to believe in the story as the Truth about the afterlife, though it is probably a good guess, but we are to realize that it is very hard to let ourselves go, to let God rip and peel off the black soot from our shoulders. I highly recommend it for anyone either strong or weak in their faith. It is also a great piece of literature for those athiest-postmodern people out there!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"As the author of Project 314, I have a deep respect for writers like C.S.Lewis who can present Biblical themes in creative ways. Lewis presents heaven in all its glory. As in his Narnia and Perelandra series, he also presents the struggle between good and evil in parabolic form. I highly recommend that this book be on your shelf with the rest of Lewis' writings."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"&quot;The Great Divorce,&quot; by C.S. Lewis, tells the story of a bus ride from hell to heaven. The title is a riff on William Blake's &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,&quot; which Lewis cites in his preface.Although Christian theology is briefly cited in the book, it seems that Lewis' overall point--to promote belief in and adoration of a supreme being--is as applicable to Jews, Muslims, and many others as it would be to Christians. To quote the book directly: &quot;There is but one good; that is God.&quot;The story is full of wonderful visual images and imaginative flourishes that give the book the flavor of classic fantasy literature. And although at times the book has a certain smug quality, it is entertaining and thought-provoking. Lewis' prose style is consistently engaging."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis's writings have captivated me since I was a boy growing up on the Chronicles of Narnia. then I discovered his space trilogy, and after that I began to explore his more openly Christian writings.It amazes me that one man is able to contain so much wisdom!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Even though I like other C.S. Lewis books, I didn't think I'd enjoy his fiction. I preferred facts over fantasy. Then, at the coaxing of a friend, I read this book. While reading the first few chapters I was entertained by his imagination &amp; creativity, but soon my interest soared. The second half of the book captivated me and the inferences to theology amazed me. Before I finished this book I was ready for more of his fantasy works. Upon finishing this book I exclaimed, &quot;Clive, you're the man!&quot; ... and yes, I did thank my friend for his encouraging me to read this book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is arguably one of Lewis's best books. His thought provoking journey from Hell to Heaven on a day excursion suggests quite powerfully that Hell is a choice -- and a choice that many people freely make. It is ironic that (with a solitary, glorious exception) all passengers on the excursion choose to return to Hell, rather than to enter Heaven -- because they still, even after death, refuse to give up the sin that most seperates them from God.A profound read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis, once again, delivers a complex synopsis of what virtues are lacking in those who are evil. The characters dwelling in hell in this little novel are, for the most part, not what we would describe as evil folks, but Lewis points out how they truly are. Lewis provides all who give this novel a fair shake a wonderful since of optimisim. This book is not one to be missed by those interested in intellectually contemplating Heaven and hell. Give it a read!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"like the other reviewers, i too, have read this book so many times i've lost count. each read is like a new trip to heaven. all the wisdom and insight in this book would be impossible to capture in one reading. every time you read it, it will speak directly to something happening in your life, whether it be a person you know, a problem you're having, or just your ever-changing relationship with the creator. lewis's insight into human nature is so accurate and frank, you will find yourself laughing out loud, conviced he's writing specifically about you. also, if you've read the great divorce you have to read the space trilogy. if you haven't read these three of lewis's you need to...right now...scroll up and find them and buy them now! you'll thank me..."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Only C.S. Lewis can write a story like this. A man takes a bus ride through Hell, then Heaven and witnesses the choices made by others in their lives.The vivid stories within the story show that indecision is still a decision... it underscores the petty things in our lives that we allow to dominate us, things that will still plague us in Hell for eternity if we don't abandon them.Lewis' concepts (fantasized, of course) of the substance of spirit versus the substance of flesh and blood are incredibly thought provoking. There are mental images I got from reading this book that I will never forget.It is basic truth - you choose life, you choose death, or you choose not to choose. You will either give up the things that are holding you down (whether they be bitter resentments, anger, material gain, control, etc.) or you will cling to them until they become your master and you their slave.The book presents these concepts in such a non-threatening way that you've gotten a life lesson that you don't realize until you've finished this short, yet vibrant book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Although this book is written as a novella, it contains TONS of thinly disguised theological truths and brain-shaking ideas. This is one of those books where everything means something. Every bit of the scenic description of Heaven and Hell reveals something that Lewis believes to be true about the two places and how people respond to them. Other fascinating things about this book are the fictional characters and seeing how different types of people respond to being in Heaven. There is one man who realizes that now that he is in Heaven, and in the presence of God, he is no longer useful. But he doesn't want to start feeling useless, and so cannot enter the presence of God--because in Heaven God provides for everyone's needs. This book really makes you contemplate whether Christianity is more about the journey or the destination. It's entertaining and full of wisdom, and is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Some folks only know Beethoven for his 9th symphony. Some folks only know C.S. Lewis for one of his &quot;greater&quot; works. (Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia etc..) What a loss. Anyone who has read any C.S. Lewis should make the time over the course of their lives to read THIS C.S. Lewis. I loved this book. No writer in the twentieth century ever hit the nail more directly on the head when dealing with human nature than did Clive Staples Lewis. This book is a perfect example of his talent in this area. Not even the Screwtape Letters did it better. I heartily recommend this book to all readers."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The brilliance of &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is Lewis' focus on the spiritual aspects of Heaven and Hell and not just the literal aspects. The very day I became a Christian, the thought entered my mind that the very worst things about Hell had to be the absence of love and the absence of Christ. That was as far as my thinking went. Lewis took me much further with this book-- The lustful man lives in a kind of Hell already. The woman with a forgiving and humble heart lives in a kind of Heaven already. In the Bible, believers are described as already seated with Christ in Heavenly places-- spiritually, they have already arrived at their eternal destination. The converse is true of unbelievers. They dwell in the dark shadows of the underworld-- willingly without love and without Christ, burning in the flames of their own selfishness. An excellent read!! Lewis mentions his predecessor, George MacDonald, in &quot;The Great Divorce.&quot; I have read that Lewis derived much of his theology from MacDonald's interpretations. I recommend MacDonald's book &quot;Phantastes,&quot; the very book which Lewis partly credits for his conversion. I also recommend highly, and I do mean highly &quot;Castle of Wisdom&quot; by Rhett Ellis."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"As Lewis explains in his preface, The Great Divorce is a response to the attitude of William Blake, among others, that someday there will be an ideal union of the secular and divine, or Heaven and Hell. Unable to see how this could ever be, Lewis wrote The Great Divorce to explore the issue further. The result is a religous allegory of the highest caliber and impeccable, nearly frightening, insight.As with all allegories, The Great Divorce relies on symbolism to make its point. Lewis admits his book is not to be taken literally as a tour guide of either Heaven or Hell, but merely as an artistic expression of his ideas. And the plot device works well--Lewis's intensely brilliant yet readily accessible and familiar writing style makes it easy to imagine oneself in the narrator's shoes on the uneasy bus ride out of Hell, hunkering under the great mountains of Glory, or even talking uncertainly with Ghosts or Spirits (oh yes, there is a big difference!).The Great Divorce is a fine read for anyone, believer or unbeliever. The former will find many challenges and assurances; the latter will discover new insights into the Christian faith not readily available from other sources. Above all, The Great Divorce is a Dante-esque tour of not only the Worlds Beyond, but just as importantly one of the often unexplored metaphysical World within us all."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis' \\"The Great Divorce\\" is a book that I have owned for years but only recently read. I don't know why it took me so long, but now that I have read it I want to read it again all the more. I guess that is a sign of a good book. Many of you reading this review are no doubt familiar with Lewis the philosopher, theologian, writer, and speaker. Suffice to say he remains one of the most esteemed and brilliant thinkers and writers of the last century.This book easily compares to the best of his work. The idea of using a fantasy-land constructed around a bus trip to try to give us some look into the unknown is pure Lewis. A dark, desolate, rainy bus stop gives us a mental picture of hell that reminds me of the films \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Dark City\\". The descriptions of a heaven-like place given in the book remind me of the house of Elrond and the elvish city in the recent \\"Lord of the Rings\\". The book essentially follows the author as he tours both of these worlds-seemingly seperated by a million miles. With George MacDonald as his guide, the author witnesses many interactions between those in the 'heavenly' world and those arriving from hell on a bus. The heavenly beings-who are solid-attempt to convince the spirits aboard the tour to remain with them and allow themselves to be made whole by the overseer of the heavenly realm.Unfortunately, most of the spirits prefer to deal with their various troubles 'some other time' or not at all. Wishing to remain as they are, they refuse the help of the heavenly beings. We witness spirits literally and figuratively in chains of pity, anger, pride, arrogance, and fear. The answer to all of these maladies is offered to them with outstretched arms, they need only accept the gift.The most powerful exchange in the book comes between a spirit who arrives with a little red lizard on his shoulder. (Readers of Lewis will recognize this from his earlier essay 'Horrid Red Things' in \\"God in the Dock\\"). The lizard embodies the spirit's struggles with lust; it continuously goads him on. As the spirit comes into contact with one of the heavenly angels, the angel states that if the man will only ask him to, he will kill the lizard. The lizard immediately warns the spirit that the angel is capable of this and reminds the spirit that if this is allowed, he-the spirit-will never enjoy the pleasures of lust and sin again. The spirit hems and haws, asking the angel many questions. Each time the angel responds \\"...MAY I KILL IT?\\"It is heartbreaking to read as the spirit decides to allow the angel-hands hovering just around the neck of the lizard-to kill it, only to relent when he realizes that he himself will be hurt in the process of obtaining freedom. The angel responds: \\"I never said it would not hurt you, only that it would not kill you.\\" This seems eerily similar to so many of us in the 'real' world who, when offered freedom thru Christ and the solutions to our myriad of social, emotional, spiritual, and physical struggles, raise an angry hand to God and reject His offer. How many of us want our problems to be fixed, our wounds healed and our pain dealt with-without any pain!? How many of us prefer to hold onto the very things that are destroying us? Keeping us from God?A brilliant treatise on the ability of the human-in this case the spirit of departed humans-to rationalize and justify our behavior, whether it be an overbearing, controlling mother, a frightened woman, a man diseased with lust, those consumed by career, or any of the other characters in the book. Look deeper because there is a message for everyone in this book. A powerful allegory of the struggle to make the Gospel known to others.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I don't think Lewis meant to &quot;preach to the choir.&quot; He knows that many fine people deny Christianity because they think its a naive and silly belief. Lewis understands the skeptics mind and speaks directly to it. He isn't an entrenched, Christian Theologian, he is a normal man who speaks planely. In fact he almost always prefaces his books by downplaying his own knowledge of Christian Theology. This make Lewis very approachable, yet intellectually sound.Unlike the other reviewers, I am not a Christian and I have read and enjoyed this book. Lewis was a die-hard ATHEIST before he became christian. He was a brilliant intellectual and made the leap of faith, not because he got hit on the head, but because he objectively analyzed the Bible. His background alone puts me immediatley at ease when I read him. He won't try to manipulate the facts to push you toward Christ. He just lays down his ideas, with nothing up his sleaves and lets you make of it what you will. Unlike many Christian apologists, he knows that you can't be forced into Christianity (God Knows Many Have Tried).Skeptics, myself included, should read at least some of Lewis. I suggest Mere Christianity as a primer and then The Great Divorce. If you are a responsible intellectual, unsatisfied with other &quot;Christian&quot; apologies, and looking for concrete answers concerning the Christian Faith, it would be foolish to ignore Lewis."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Please don't be amazed at my poor rating of this book; it is not actually a rating of the great C.S. Lewis's &quot;The Great Divorce,&quot; of which the earlier reviews speak eloquently; rather, it is this particular edition by HarperCollins/Zondervan. Simply put, this edition is liberally peppered with typographic errors, perhaps even a missing word here or there--you won't be able to tell unless you get a reliable edition elsewhere and compare the two. But I found errors like &quot;to&quot; spelled as &quot;eo,&quot; &quot;the&quot; spelled &quot;teh,&quot; and so on, far too many simple errors to be permitted in such a slender volume. Hey, Harper/Collins and Zondervan: no one cares if fundamentalist claptrap books has typographical errors, since these are not read by thinkers, but when you set to reprint a work by one of the Great Authors, at least show him the courtesy of hiring an editor and proofreader to check the galley pages. Suffice it to say, since this edition is part of the &quot;Signature Series,&quot; and presumably other Lewis books in the series is prepared in a similarly slipshod fashion, I will have to look for other editions of Lewis's works that I don't as yet own. (Of course, none of this may be important to the reader if he doesn't mind less than acceptable fidelity to the original editions of &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;: in which case, I suppose this edition is better than none.)--A Former Editor"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A friend told me that this book opened his eyes to the fact that some people don't want answers, only debate and politics. He couldn't believe people would think that way, but then he went to college and experienced them for himself.Lewis has written a fun, memorable story about going to hell in a dream (or vision) and taking a bus tour of heaven. The ghostly figures that file timidly off the bus are barely visible in the bright light of heaven, and the grass is so much more real (or true) than they are it hurts their feet. One man tried to steal a golden apple, and he may as well have been trying to hiest a boulder. Lewis himself, writing in first person, feared a coming rain may pummel them into the ground.But after the initial shock of a world more real than he could imagine, he watched the other tourist interact with heavenly friends who had come to greet them. Some of them were friends from earth, some just kind-hearted people. Again and again the hellions (if I may call them that) choose to hold on to their worthless pride or foolhearty beliefs rather than humble themselves to the truth. Pride manifests itself in a hundred subtle ways as these pitiful souls whine about perceived injustices or irrational motives. Thankfully, a few tourists do humble themselves, become transformed into marvelously real beings, and remain in heaven. But most don't, about which the great Scottish author George MacDonald, Lewis' heavenly guide, says, \\"They may not be rejecting the truth of heaven now. They may be reenacting the rejection they made while on earth.\\"This book has curious insight into our human hearts and teaches a few Biblical ideas in very memorable ways. I enjoyed reading it myself and again aloud to my wife. Lewis has a nice, readable style. 4 stars, only because a guy can't give everything good five stars."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Allow me to begin by saying that I am, at best, skeptic regarding the existence of God. Yet, C. S. Lewis remains being one of my favourite authors, and this is by far one my favourite books by him. Through the allegory of a bus journey, this Christian writer allows to enter what he believes Heaven and Hell to be like. This, however, is just the means Lewis uses to face us with something much deeper and, to many of us skeptics, mind-boggling: The question of Free Will. Why is it that some people are granted entrance to Heaven, while others are doomed to Hell? How can a benevolent God punish his creatures so cruelly? He does not, Lewis claims; it is us who make the choice, whether consciously or not. This is what THE GREAT DIVORCE is about: making us aware of our own actions and where they lead us, thus forcing us to take a good, hard look at human nature... and our own. Afraid to do so? Then you should definitely read it.PS: What can I say? I've declared myself an atheist for a long time. Yet, the more C. S. Lewis I read, the more I doubt my beliefs- or lack thereof.Andrea"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"As a pastor, so many times people want to know about God, and God condemning people to hell. They want to challenge me that a loving God wouldn't let anyone be punished.But they forget that God has given all of us free will. God has given us choices all of our lives. What if the choice to be separated from heaven doesn't come from God, but rather comes from within ourselves. What if we are the ones who can't tolerate heaven.In this intriguing book, we are challenged with that very concept. Is C.S. Lewis right or wrong? I'm not sure it matters. What matters is that this opens up the conversation in a very different way."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I am not a fantasy fan, much to the chagrin of many, and I still don't \\"get\\" the magic of the Narnia series (even though I am glad to see it have so much meaning for others). It was with this mindset that i finally picked up The Great Divorce, and I admit to being pleasantly surprised.As some reviewers have pointed out, this probably shouldn't be used as a theology text. What it is is a thought generator and a conversation starter with those who have questions about eternity. And, beyond that, something that can be read--even thoughtfully--in only a couple of hours."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis' The Great Divorce is a chilling story which goes deeper than it seems. It is very easy to pass this little tale off as mere philosophy or &quot;thoughts on death&quot;; the truth is, this book is a warning against those who think their &quot;story&quot; is neither good nor bad. Lewis doesn't leave much wiggle room in describing heaven: it is a place so substantial that it cuts and causes pain for those who don't realize the wonder of it. There isn't much solace in hell, either: completely reversed, hell has no substance at all. In fact, its residents don't even realize they are even in hell in the first place. I believe Lewis intended this to be a caveat against a lack of substance in one's life as well as death. Of course, Lewis and I are both Christian, so working within that understanding, there is much more to be said. But even for non-believers, The Great Divorce is a commentary of great value, as many of Lewis' works are. In the end, it would seem that The Great Divorce isn't about Heaven and Hell; it is about the great chasm between Life and Death themselves."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book had a profound impact on me when I read it for a class in college. It seems a more believable vision of heaven and hell than the traditional fire n' brimstone/pearly gates and harps version. When you think about it, what could be worse than forever wallowing in old resentments, temporary schools of thoughts, or the should have, could haves of life?I think Lewis' central message is that we all have the means to our own salvation---for some it is a seamless process, but for others it's a struggle involving \\"fear and trembling\\". The benefits of reading this book is that it puts the things in life that seem such a big deal into a perspective of is spending time on this going to hinder my spiritual progress or not? It reminds you to \\"render unto Caesar, the things that are Caesar's\\" and keep your focus on becoming selfless and not letting anything get in the way of your spiritual growth.....even if you believe that what you are doing will benefit your own brand of religion. This book never ceases to shock my thinking because any of us can identify with the characters he depicts in hell....how they refuse to shed their fears, hatreds, pettiness, trendy thinking, whatever. This book is a wake up call for everyone regardless of their religion. It quite frankly offers a better way to live."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Reading \\"The Great Divorce\\" was formative for me the first time I came across it (some years ago); and with each re-reading, I'm reminded of just how apt are Lewis' descriptions of human interaction and the often blurry lines between what he terms \\"brass\\" and \\"gold\\" -- that which we might otherwise accept as a \\"natural\\" virtue, and that which is of everlasting, divine makeup.Of all the books CS Lewis wrote, I think \\"The Great Divorce\\" is the most often passed over-- regrettably so. I don't know why that's the case, but I do know that those who are introduced to \\"The Great Divorce\\" after having read other Lewis classics (such as \\"Mere Christianity\\" or \\"Screwtape\\") are often left with a new favorite in their Lewis collection. That was certainly true of me.What I find most powerful about \\"The Great Divorce\\" is Lewis' ability to distill examples of human conversations that reflect some of the most basic realities of our engagement with each other and the divine. That gift of Lewis' is what made the Narnia Chronicles so popular; with equal imagination here, he draws out even more subtle theological precepts. I often use the vignettes from this text as illustrations for not only those who ask for a thoughtful consideration of Christianity, but also a thoughtful consideration of human nature."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I don't happen to be a believer in a higher power, Christian or otherwise, but I thoroughly enjoyed this bus ride from the very first page. C.S. Lewis' writing is contemporary and hits a nerve. The story is about the the great divide between heaven and hell but I was drawn to the character studies. Lewis was a psychologist, self-taught no doubt, by being a keen observer of his fellow travelers. A voracious reader I rarely have time to re-read a book but, I've picked up this one several times; you'll never forget the story. It's the kind of book you can open at any page and have a good read. He shows you that it's the little character flaws that keep you small. And little they are, but powerful. And it's done with a degree of humor which was unexpected. I promise you won't be disappointed. This book is a fairy tale for adults (definitely not for children). It didn't change my views about religion, but I learned some lessons about good and evil."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Any Lewis book is a guaranteed good read. But if you want to expand your viewpoint about the afterlife, the value of this life, God's mercy and justice, or virtually any other highly important topic, pick this one up. It's an extremely quick book (the chapters are short, and the book is thin) with brilliant imagery and an interesting concept- what is Heaven and what is Hell? However, Lewis warns in a preface not to take this writing literally, and I do the same. The plotline serves more as a contextual setup in order to get his point across. You'll have to read it to discover that point.A great addition to your library."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of Lewis' easier reads with beautiful imagery, but as with all of C.S. Lewis' books thought provoking. It does suggest a purgatory, but I think the main purpose of this book is to illustrate how people willingly choose sin over God and that it is a choice. A choice that we can easily fall into without thinking, but nonetheless a choice. Regardless of whether you believe in purgatory or not you can get quite a bit from this book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This man has done many amazing things. C.S. Lewis never fails to amaze me! When it comes down to it, anything I pick up by him becomes one simple question, and that question is this. Where will he take me this time? Well, in this case, it happens to be a bus. And seeing as I've ridden in many a bus, there probably aren't any seatbelts, so you just have to hang on!The Heaven and Hell concept, right? There is a Heaven and there is a Hell, rest assured. And even though this is allegory along with fantasy, don't fool yourself into thinking that it was simply made up. C.S. Lewis was always inspired! So don't be surprised when you see ghosts. If you ever read Lewis before, you won't be too surprised if this makes you think. Do we really ever think about what we say and do in everyday life? I'll tell you right now... I don't! Reading this really shocks you back to reality.There is usually at least one part of each Lewis read that really hits me. This is no exception. I found this to be so simple, yet so amazing! Here's just a tidbit... \\"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \\"Thy will be done, and those to whom God says, in the end, \\"THY will be done.\\" All that are in Hell, choose it.\\" So also keep in mind when reading this, that you have and I have free will. We make our own choices, people.Speaking of choices, whether or not you choose to read this is entirely up to you. I'd say you're missing out. But for those who haven't missed out know that this is one amazing read! On the backs of most his Lewis's books it says that he continues to attract thousands of new readers every year. It only took me about 27 years, but I'm glad he finally caught my attention! This man not only grabs the attention, he pricks the heart, and you just hold on for the ride! WOW!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I love CS Lewis and had never read this one but it has now become my favorite. He gives an intriguing and insightful look into the afterlife and into the possibility that the most recognizable sins are quite possibly not the most difficult to overcome. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially Lewis fans."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Having read everything published by C.S. Lewis , The Great Divorce is likely the best overall synopsis of his thinking and emphasis. It was the first book of his that I read, and what &quot;hooked&quot; me. If you are unfamiliar with C.S. Lewis, I suggest you start with this little book, which is one of his best. The story is about a bus ride from hell to heaven, and it is a romp to read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"&quot;The Great Divorce&quot; was a wonderful read. I have read 18 of his works (all I recommend) And I recommend this one to anyone who likes to keep their imaginations fresh and young.It is fantasy in the way that only Lewis can conjure it. Full of insightful analogy and beautiful, flowing metaphor. The imagery he uses brings to vivid life the hidden thoughts and suspicions we all have about ourselves and the workings of the inner man.All of Lewis' works of fiction, particularly this one carry-at least for me-that movement of mind toward those things that we see as &quot;through a glass darkly&quot;. The process of taking the mind there invokes awe and wonder at the limitlessness of God. Not just God's ways but the infinite and out of timeness of God as a personal entity. I brings me to that place of childlike wonderment, and just when you think it gets no better, or deeper, he reveals better and deeper still till it extends beyond the edge of comprehension of our frail human intellect -and can only be embraced by the heart."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis' short fiction THE GREAT DIVORCE is an engaging drama of the ever-dreaded, yet inevitable, afterlife that all of humanity will face. Lewis takes his readers on a &quot;bus trip&quot; from the dreary streets of hell to a land that one could deduce to be something of a Purgatory. The author creates intriguing senarios between the many faces of humans and the enlightened &quot;spiritual beings&quot; that challenge the reader immensely. The ever-so nebulous spirits in the ever-so mysterious place frustrate the minds of Lewis' characters as well as the minds of his readers. A thought provoking, short, fiction for literature lovers and thinkers alike! Buy this book!!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"As I step forward to attempt to write a review of The Great Divorce, I acknowledge that words probably won't express how important this little book is to me. Lewis' intellect is so brilliant as to easily illuminate the most profound thoughts, ideas, truths--anyone can follow the language, who will. With each read (so far there have been six), there is more wisdom and food for thought. This is a book that can change your life. It changed mine."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I have read the Great Divorce 4 times and each time I read it I glean some new insight into Lewis and his \\"Seeing Eye.\\" I don't need to elaborate on the content of the book the other reviewers have done so, so eloquently. But for anyone who really wants a fictional picture of both Heaven and Hell this book is a must. Lewis, who was and still is one of the 20th centuries-greatest apologists for Christianity brings Heaven and Hell to life like no other writer I have ever read. The first time I read the book I could not put it down it is a quick read with beautiful, well rounded and scriptural accurate views on Heaven and Hell a must for any library."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Incredible. Wow. I read it more than a year ago and I'm still reeling"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis brings his reader from the gray-dusk and shawdowy unreality of &quot;hell&quot; to the pre-dawn hours of the gloriously solid &quot;heaven.&quot; Journeying through _The Great Divorce_, Lewis's reader gains insight into humanity's deepest roots of entanglement with self, sin and brokeness as they come to light in various characters in the book. Finally, the reader catches a glimpse of God's gorgeous gifts to those travelling toward Him; a challenge that makes Lewis's book less about Heaven and Hell and more about the choice of living in the kingdom of God or not."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book gets my vote for most &quot;bang&quot; per page. Lewis vividly portrays human nature - good, evil, and rationalizations for the latter - in a form that is picturesque and penetrating. This book has so many facets but, typically for Lewis, deals with deep subjects in a light, easy-to-understand manner (though is background in classic litereture peeps through often). Questions such as:What is the nature of good and evil?What is the nature of God's grace?How is a person truly converted?What is love?And much, much more...All this in a book which can be read from cover to cover in about an hour and a half."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book by Lewis is by far the best Lewis I have read. It sheds a lot of light on how much our present day small petty selfishness prevent us from being able to see the big picture. I particuliarly like the end of the book, where Lewis gives us an excellent glimpse of time, and how time differes for mortal and devine."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is fiction of a similar kind as *The Screwtape Letters* in the sense that it is indeed fiction, but it also has a heavy philosophical and religious side to it.The story begins at a bus stop, and you quickly realise this is no ordinary story as the bus takes off into the sky!The rest is a philosophical tale of faith and faithlessness as newly arrived \\"dead people\\" are faced with the after-life. Ghosts meet spirits (two different things), and discussions follow.C.S. Lewis illustrates all sorts of reasons why we may not embrace faith, even when we think we actually do. And it is too profound for me to summarise very well any of the material included in this awesome little volume.Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book helped me gain a new perspective on the idea of heaven. It wonderfully written and though it is fiction it really reaches deep into your mind and asks you to think... really think."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This may be my least favorite of C.S. Lewis's stories, but that isn't saying a lot. I thought the bus ride to heaven and hell was a bit goofy, but everything else was phenomenal. From detailed descriptions of the physical properties of heaven to the wisdom of George MacDonald, this book will make you rethink your priories in life and the afterlife. It serves as a \\"reality check\\" of sorts. Though told as a fantasy story, I believe this book is more of an essay.I would not pass over this book!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Good old Lewis gets us on the bus from Hell! If you don't know anything is better, then your happy. Heaven is there for those who want to be complete."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is not a book for people on terrestrial ground but for those with expanded minds seeking faith and understanding spiritual freedom"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"While C.S. Lewis wasn't an apostle and the things that he writes are not equal to biblical truth, the insight that he has into the nature of sin and of what \\"hell\\" really signifies is great.The metaphorical situations and sensations described in the \\"The Great Divorce\\" are a clever way of illustrating spiritual truths in modern language and cultural understanding. For example: His description of hell as an insubstantial place, constructed by the very people who inhabit it, vs the \\"real\\" world that God has made. Or that the people in hell don't really want to leave because of their unwillingness to set aside their old, self-centered ways of being/thinking and because of the pain they experience when beginning their approach to Heaven.These are at once simple and powerful ways of describing precisely some of the facets of hell as outlined in the New Testament. Obviously it lacks other pieces, such as the final annihilation, but Lewis's assertion that people who \\"end up\\" in hell were in fact there their entire lives is an interesting, and I think accurate way of describing their predicament.A short, easy read that'll leave you with a greater understanding of the Christian view of sin, hell, self-centeredness and divine love."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"CS Lewis' Great Divorce addresses questions that many Christians and non-Christians have regarding heaven and hell. Of course, Lewis does not address or claim to address all the questions or attempt a comprehensive thesis on heaven and hell.What he does discuss adroitly are the choices that people make and the grace that God gives to all people to accept his gift of salvation or to reject it.By using various characters faced with the decision of heaven or hell with different perspectives, Lewis shows the flawed logic, spirituality, views of God and selves, etc that cause people to reject God and all of his goodness. He also shows how a person can relinquish pride and self-righteousness to enter heaven by accepting God's gift.This is a stimulating story that also serves as apologetic and defense of Christian principles without being overtly religious or theological.The reader for the cd version dramatizes the characters and enhances the writing.Craig Stephans, author of Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis always fascinates. In this easy-to-read small volume, he takes us through a fictional dream about the afterlife. Starting in a dark, rainy and grimy town, he boards a bus that takes him and a number of grumbly souls for a trip to heaven. There, they meet relatives and friends who try to get them to stay. It's Lewis's perceptive genius that his lost souls are rarely inherently wicked, but have turned back on themselves and away from the ultimate source of love. There's the mother who demands to see her long-lost son; the wife who intends to continue improving her husband in the afterlife; the well-meaning religious person who is more interested in lecturing about God than experiencing God firsthand. To the saved, the dark town is only a purgatory - the place where they finally shuck their human attachments. To the lost, even heaven itself seems like hell, and they long to return to their gray and dismal existences.Other than a line or two here and there, as with the mention of Purgatory, there is little to indicate that this work was written by a committed Catholic. Frankly, you don't even have to believe in the afterelife to apprecciate Lewis's ability to see through human illusions and attachments. An interesting exploration of human frailty by a subtle and gifted writer."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis begins The Great Divorce by talking about Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, a marriage which Lewis finds impossible. Heaven and Hell must be divorced and all of his readers considering one or the other as an ultimate destination must realize that they won't be able to have it both ways. The two places are, by definition, different one from the other. You must embrace the joy that is heaven without reservation and you must renounce absolutely that which partakes of hell. The book itself, of course, is absolutist but it is also suffused with joy. Lewis' method of description/delineation of these alternate destinations is fantasy/allegory. His story moves along briskly and his arguments are sharply etched as they are embodied in spirits and those spirits' dialogues. This is not my favorite book of Lewis' but it is a nice introduction to his ways and his thought. It is also a very quick read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This little book is a total joy to read. I know that the author makes it very clear that one should not suppose that he is factually presenting details of the afterlife, yet, in the end he has created a most satisfying image of a plausible afterlife. As for the title, he is referring to the poet-mystic William Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell. He points out that this is a synthesis that can never be, for to do so would compromise the absolute Goodness of Heaven, thereby making a Hell of both. Perhaps there can one day be a marriage of Heaven and Earth (thereby showing both to really have been Heaven all along), but never of Heaven and Hell.I loved the imagery of Hell being very much like a never-ending city on Earth where it is always twilight and eternal night always on the verge. Yet, it is not a crowded city for people keep moving apart because they cannot stand each other's presence. That's just it. People dwell in Hell by their own choice. It is the obsessions that separate them from God and the highest Reality that keep them from leaving. It is even shown that such higher impulses as love and pity, if unhealthily indulged in for their own sake and for nothing higher or transcendent, can keep you in Hell. Yet, this Hell is also Purgatory for those who workout their obsessions. In fact, there is a regular bus service to Heaven for fieldtrips that serve just that purpose (I always suspected that the omnibus originated in Hades.)As for Heaven, it is perpetually just the moment before dawn and eternal day. The idea that Heaven is actually more substantial than Hell, or Earth, is reasonable, since it is after all the more Real of the two being closer to the Creator. Indeed, the visitors from Hell appear as pale and insubstantial deformed ghosts who find the adamantine hardness and density of the higher plane physically painful (even walking upon the grass.) The residents of the realm however are radiant spirits who do everything that they can to point out the mistakes and illusions that the ghostly visitors still cling to- and which are the only thing keeping them from traveling higher up and farther in to the one true goal. The most detailed and believable of these tutelary spirits is Lewis' own spriritual mentor, George Macdonald."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Doesn't matter if you are young or old you can read this again and again"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Having read all of the Narnia books I was already a fan of Lewis but had not read any of his more overtly Christian works.

It is possible that people in this world will get so attached to it that when presented with something far greater they might just choose something else."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"As a thoughtful adult and a Christian, after I got through the initial opening pages of this short read, I was very engaged at its contents and could not put it down. I have attempted to read the Narnia classic, but having not grown up with it and now an adult, I find that I quickly lose interest and never finish the first in the series. This book was different than what I expected. I enjoyed his creative descriptions of the worlds found in this book, but what excelled for me was the very thoughtful discourse that transpired in the different encounters between the visitors of heaven and its inhabitants. I found new insights into the nature of man and the thought patterns of different types of people and what inhibits them from embracing their creator. Having been an atheist up through college, I find it very refreshing to read thoughtful works from intellectual Christians."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Amazing book by a great storyteller.

If you liked Screwtape letters you will love this as well."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Everyone, not just fans of Narnia and the Screwtape Letters should read this book. It offers incredible insights into the human mind, especially how we're often unwilling to give up the very things that are holding us back. As always, Lewis' writing style is enjoyable and approachable. Readers from Junior High onwards ought to pick it up and read it a few times over their life."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book will make you:SmileLaughCryPonderLook up words that are hard to understand (Applicable for Non-natives like me)And it leaves you with a feeling of wanting &#34;More&#34;The story is excellent and his points are all very very powerful.

I'm so glad I did. It's an incredible book - one that inspired deep discussion. It really makes you focus on your own short-comings and how those might back up on you in the after life. CS Lewis was masterful at writing characters - you know who these people are, you know what motivates them. The narrator's perspective is so interesting. I honestly learned a lot about myself and about my view of heaven - it's a choice we make. Do we want to live there? Or do our weaknesses - desire for acclaim, desires for substances, desires of superiority - disqualify us for that existence? Compelling, yet easy read. When he mentions that notable people in heaven are not who were notable on earth - it was thought provoking. Do I live my life to please the crowd, or do I live my life to be the best me, to please God? Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I've read a couple of Lewis's novels and wasn't too crazy about them, but this one was really good. He gives his take on the afterlife and how Hell can exist in a universe ruled by a loving God."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I have found the Great Divorce to be a book for all time. I saw so many people on that bus that I recognized and after a while, I recognized most all of them were a part of me or my life. I got some great insight into how we think when we think of others and how others must see me. Often we think in terms of who will be going to Heaven and who will not in our own human and limited way of thinking. C.S.Lewis puts an interesting and very introspective point of view on this often discussed theme using Christian theology in allowing us to ride in and off the bus with so many others. I think I saw how narrow we can be in our judgement concerning who will or will not be allowed beyond the gates of Heaven. Great book and one I recommend hightly."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"CS Lewis has forwarded his theory on sin, redemption & punishment with clarity, imagination & his trademark logic & reason - the proof in the book's success is its acceptance by atheist & religious communities alike. Whether you are religious/spiritual or not, Lewis challenges us at the universal level of human nature & this through our most common relationships: neighbors, children, spouses, parents. Lewis suggests that our relationships & attitudes within them reveal who we are & what we are becoming. Indeed, seemingly harmless, little attitudes & habits shape actions & character which then determine destiny.His vision of Heaven & Hell are credible in as far as they advise us on the benefit and detriment of daily choices. Lewis seems to believe that all sin is never really initially sin - it becomes sin when some attitude consumes us & controls us - Heaven & Hell are merely the continuation and magnification of the attitudes we chose to pursue in life. Righteousness is not a function of religion, but rather a function of true humanity & real life. Indeed he suggests that life isn't life at all without the honesty, humility & forgiveness we are offered & should offer. Qualities & ideals that no one would argue against.Finally, this book is an explanation of how God's love works. It can be the hardest thing to accept & yet is the greatest thing to accept. Lewis continues to offer the balance of God's responsibility & man's responsibility. He never leaves us enough room to blame anyone else for our choices but doesn't leave us without Divine help. A good book for the Christian Apologist or the person who is simply in pursuit of a better way of being."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I first heard of this book in passing by a guy giving a talk on \\"getting out of hell\\".

During that rant he kept making references to this book, so, having nothing better to do with my time, I bought and read it.A few months ago I doubt I would have gotten any of it. Even now I doubt I understood half of it, but the half I did understand was just amazing. I'm not a Christian, but it made sense in everyday life.I am a huge fan of parables, of stories with meaning.

This is probably because it's usually done poorly. That is not the case in this parable/allegory of the afterlife written by one of the great writers of the modern era. Lewis does a masterful job at not only describing some of the dangers of the Christian life, but also gradually revealing them in a way that allows for the reader to discover the important points of each argument as his/her own place. This is truly one of the best books I've ever read, and I learn something every time I re-read it. Highly, HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"No one can write like CS Lewis. The ideas will challenge any conception of Heaven and Hell you have, not to mention eternity and our decision-making process.

Lewis provides a view of the afterlife in stark contrast. A brilliant piece that will inspire anyone to be better."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I enjoyed this book. Lewis patterned this fairly short novel on Dante's Divine Comedy with a dream visit to Hell/Purgatory and what he describes as the \\"Valley of the Shadow of Light\\" or Heaven's front yard if you will. Most of the book is concerned with various \\"ghosts\\" from Hell rejecting the offer of Heaven for selfish reasons. Lewis makes a lot of good points about Hell being the rejection of God's love. Doctrinally the book can be a bit fuzzy, such as having Hell and Purgatory be the same place, but it was not supposed to be a book of theological doctrine but rather a story. I wish more time had have been spent in Hell but that wasn't the point of the book. I would recommend this book, and highly recommend Lewis' Screwtape Letters as well."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"\\"The Great Divorce\\" is a strange allegorical novel written by the well-known Christian writer C.S. Lewis, who was also a friend of J.R.R. Tolkien. \\"The Great Divorce\\" is also my favorite work by Lewis, alongside the classical children's story \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\".The novel is about Heaven and Hell. Hell turns out to be a boring, great city, where the sun never really rises. An angel operates a bus that takes people from Hell to Heaven. Anyone who likes can go onboard the bus. In Heaven, the denizens of Hell are met by angels who call upon them to enter. The offer of salvation is (almost) free. Despite this, most of the bus-passangers voluntarily decide to go back to Hell!On first reading, the story might sound completely absurd. Who would be so stupid as to voluntarily remain in Hell, if you are offered an eternity in Heaven instead? The story makes more sense if read as an allegory about why people reject the Church here on Earth. For instance, one of the main characters is a heretical priest who refuses to accept the truths of traditional Christianity, even when confronted with hard evidence. Another character is some kind of bohemian left-wing artist. They both retun to \\"Hell\\", i.e. the meaningless, grey, secular world outside the Church.The story could also be read as a criticism of modern society. The people in \\"Hell\\" live in houses that slowly but steadfastly move away from each other, making the inhabitants more and more socially isolated from each other, and more and more preoccupied with their own negative feelings, rather than turning towards what C.S. Lewis believed was the best source for Meaning in life: traditional Christianity. (Poor Napoleon is held up as a particularly bad example of a meaningless, self-preoccupied denizen of \\"Hell\\". Lewis was British.)But the story is also theologically interesting. Indeed, Lewis seems to have believed that his allegorical description of Heaven and Hell reflected something real. It's not just a story about modern man rejecting the Church, or modern society becoming increasingly meaningless. It's also a story about the actual, supernatural realms known as Heaven and Hell.Lewis felt extremely uncomfortable with the traditional idea of Hell. Small wonder. The traditional idea is deeply immoral: Jesus throws most of humanity in Hell, for eternal torture, simply for disbelieving in him and his mission. Christian groups who believe in this, claim that everyone who disbelieves *them* will end up in Hell. \\"Ultra ecclesiam nulla salus\\". And once you've been cast into Hell, let go of hope, for there is no turning back, not even an \\"Arbeit macht frei\\".Modern Christians have tried to mitigate the hellish ideas of traditional Christianity somewhat. Some say that people who go to Hell choose to go there voluntarily. Others claim that even non-Christians can go to Heaven, at least if they act as Christians. Still others, who really believe in Hell, refuse to discuss the matter if a critic gets to close for comfort. For instance, did the victims of 9/11 go straight to Hell? Most of them weren't born-again Christians.Lewis felt so uncomfortable with Hell, that he went one step further still. He essentially identified Hell with Purgatory, and claimed that those who want to leave, can do so. He thus rejected the idea, based on the parable of the rich man and Lazarus in the New Testament, that denizens of Hell cannot leave their place of habitat. Lewis created a more humane, rational and logical view of Hell. What a pity that main-stream Christianity took millenia to come around to this position! Indeed, many still haven't.At the same time, Lewis couldn't accept universalism, the idea that everyone gets saved in the end. What if people don't *want* to be saved? And that is precisely the main point of the novel. Why would a person voluntarily reject Heaven, even if given unlimited chances to enter? Why indeed? Many people here on earth refuse to get helped. They refuse to listen even to the most kind, loving advice. In fact, we all do, to a greater or lesser extent. What makes us think that angels or God himself could change this? Yes, many people would be changed, but the greater the love, the greater the rejection might be, the more supernatural the love, the more supernatural the rejection. Hence Heaven and hence Hell. And at a certain point in time, people get so ingrained in their real or imaginery insults, that they are simply beyond redemption. That, I take it, was Lewis' point. And no, I'm not saying I believe in Lewis' supernatural speculations...And yet, Lewis simply couldn't end his book on a sombre, pessimistic note. He was no Albert Camus. Good old Jack seems to have been quite a party-animal, perhaps even a bit too hedonistic for his fellow high churchmen. So in the novel, he lets one of the characters discover that the seemigly endless City of Hell is actually just a pinprick compared to the vastness of Heaven.In his heart, I think Lewis might have been a universalist after all.Goodspeed, Jack, wherever you are.Five stars!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I must say that it seems that any time anyone says something somewhat intellegent, It reminds me of C.S.Lewis. The Great Divorce is not just a book it's a progressive revelation. I'll be driving down the road thinking and all of a sudden understand what the heck he was talking about. Lewis was the master. I've read this book two and a half times and it isn't enough.Andrew Klicka"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis gives us yet another masterpiece in his Great Divorce. In this book he paints beautiful pictures in our minds with the words he uses to describe his \\"dream.\\" He also gives scenarios of people in hell (or purgatory), and how their attitudes and decisions affect their eternal destination. Lewis, a master of allegory, uses his gift to portray his views of heaven and hell to us in an extraordinary way. It is quite possibly the best book I have read on Heaven and Hell."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book is a wonderul teacher on the difference between the carnal, or temporal, desires of humanity and the way that our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ designed it to be. He illustrates beautifully the great difference between selfishness and selflessness. Buy this book if you are interested in something that won't rot your brain."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is an excellent primer on sin.My impression is that many of the reviewers have taken Professor Lewis too literally here. In my view the entire thrust of the book is spiritual and in particular it is an excellent analysis of our sinfulness.Each parable discribes a sin. Much of the book is autobiographical in terms of sin and I think this is most remarkable.If one reads this book with care one will see that it is often a biography of ones own sin. Do not get tied up in the presentation. To do so is a little like critizing the Gospel parable about daily wages as a story about economics."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book has changed the way I think of death and the world after. I highly recommend this to any Christian, as it stretches the mind and enlarges the soul."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book show's how horrible sin is. How it ruins people, How it ruins their minds. Read this book and think about yourself. Think about what you are holding onto in life, and ask yourself if its worth it. This book should shed some light on the subject."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors. I read this book expecting great things and Lewis delivered. In the characters I saw something of myself, the human condition and the meaning of Life. The insights in this book range from the trivial to the profound, something for everyone. For example, Lewis explains how Time and Eternity make it possible for us to have both our free will and our destiny. He shows how important we are, yet also how insignificant we can become if we choose not to see our spiritual paths."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I have read &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; about 6 or 7 times and I get something out of it every time I read it. It is a beautiful, incredibly insightful book about the nature of Heaven and Hell."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The interaction between the Ghosts and the Solid People in &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is heartbreaking to me, because it reminds me of how I desire to cling to pieces of Hell and still enter Heaven. Yet, in order to become a citizen of God's kingdom, you have to surrender yourself wholly to the forgiveness and grace of Christ, which I believe is one of the major themes of this book. C.S. Lewis asks a question that could possibly be the most important one we answer in our lifetime: what are you willing to sacrifice in order to obtain the eternal happiness of Heaven and the glory of God's presence?"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"And what's your excuse for not walking in faith?? Has all the charm of only CS Lewis, and a must for everyone interested in looking at themselves. A 'must have' book if stranded on a desert island."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This was an easy book to read and enjoy - in some ways. I saw the reflections of so many so-called Christians that I know. But the more I got into it, the more I was confronted by my own false pride and assumptions about the afterlife and how God sees us. Reading this book was like the first time I read (and REALLY thought about) the Sermon on the Mount."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"In the preface, Lewis suggests that this book is a sort of response to Blake's \\"Marriage of Heaven and Hell.\\" Now, I haven't read that particular book, so I can't say how adequate this particular response is, but overall, I really enjoyed the themes, presentations and thoughts brought out in this book.The basic premise is that Lewis finds himself in a strange gray town where he boards a bus with a number of other passengers. After a somewhat strange trip, he finds himself in a beautiful, but strange location. He follows some of the other passengers as they explore the new land and are met by the inhabitants. TO \\"spoil\\" the premise a bit, the \\"gray town\\" represents HELL and the shining land at the end of the bus ride represents HEAVEN. The passengers are ghosts who have taken a trip from Hell to Heaven...and as they are greeted by the brilliant beings in Heaven, we learn that the inhabitants from Hell are given the option of staying in Heaven. Naturally there are some rules in order to stay (they must give up remaining vices, pride, animosity and embrace the everpresent and all important love of God).The book is broken into a series of vignettes as the narrator watches the behavior of the visitors from Hell and their interactions with Heaven and with the angels they find there.At first, the narrator wanders alone through Heaven but after a time he encounters an angel who engages him in conversation. The remaining chapters then reminded me a bit of the interaction between Dante and Virgil while Dante wandered through the various levels of Hell/Inferno and made observations on the inhabitants there.This book is another great example of Lewis's thoughtfulness and insight into religion, heaven, hell, God's love and other elements of Christianity. It's not as scholarly as \\"The Four Loves\\" and isn't as allegorical as his Narnia series. It's more akin to his work with Screwtape and shares many similarities. We are again shown examples of how the human mind gets caught up with pride, offense, lust, greed and other elements that hold us back from attaining our eternal potential. Where Screwtape is very tongue in cheek and has the humorous voice of a devil, Divorce is humorous at times but also has a certain sadness in its poignancy. In Screwtape we were distanced from the actual temptation and fall of humanity. Here we get to see individual humans who have fallen from Grace and (sadly) hold fast to their fallen state even while sitting on the borders of Heaven itself.I really enjoyed this book. It had a lot of very thoughtful segments and passages. I found real examples in each of the character sketches he presented. There are a few points of religion on which I vary quite significantly from Lewis's proposal, but from a high level, I found this exploration very intriguing, well crafted and (although certainly a fiction) of the general feeling and spirit of the concepts of Heaven and Hell.I want to share one particular passage really stuck with me in pointing out the importance of our own agency and choice:\\"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, 'Thy will be done.' All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. To those who knock it is opened.\\"In God's plan for us, He truly wants us ALL to return to Heaven to partake of His presence, but He will not force us. The choice is always ours. But He cannot modify the laws that dictate who may and may not enter Heaven and His presence. If we choose the path that takes us away from Heaven, that is our choice. He will present us opportunities again and again to repent of our choices and choose His path. But in the end, it is a matter of choices and the consequences of those choices.I found this book very thoughtful, insightful and inspirational. It shows great insight into the human mind with relation to the eternal. It also does a great job of illustrating how our own failings may hold us back even if we don't acknowledge them.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I have probably read almost every word of C.S. Lewis' published writing, he has been one of the great influences in my intellectual and spiritual development. But The Great Divorce is at the top of my list of favourite books by him (though Perelandra and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader are up there with it).This short work displays Lewis the mystic instead of Lewis the apologist or literary critic. Through a symbolic story he delves deeply into the mystery of spiritual life and the eschatological destiny of humanity. The busload of citizens from Hell taking an excursion to Heaven are exposed to true Reality and the final choice that remains for everyone - whether to relinquish their false Ego and find the joy of their true Self or to hold on to a fantasy of ever-diminishing self-satisfaction.The Ghosts are beautifully drawn types of various forms of human selfishness. The compulsive flirt, the smug intellectual, the bitter revolutionary, the grumbling old woman, the blinkered materialist, the social climber, the self-righteous bully, the controlling wife, the besotted mother, the narcissistic artist, the manipulative lover, and the shamefaced pervert all face the eternal world, where all they bring is the shadowy unreality of the person they have become. Lewis depicts even himself as the fearful and self-conscious believer in need of a bit of 'thickening up'. Some of the encounters he describes are unforgettable. In particular for me the pathetic fate of the Tragedian is almost unbearable to contemplate and the triumph of the man with the 'lizard' inspires me with the power of grace.The story closes with an impressionistic glimpse of eternity and a hint of the mysterious destinies that it may contain. No answers here - 'You cannot know eternity by a definition' - but a profound insight into the nature of choice and the journey 'farther up into the mountains' that is the only one worth taking. This is a classic of Christian devotional writing."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis' creative imagination has left a greater impact on my life than most other writers in this genre. In The Great Divorce, Lewis presents a fictional glimpse into the afterlife that includes various portrayals of individuals encountering significant consequences of decisions made on earth. The story takes place within the context of a dream, inviting readers to follow the dreamer's exploration into a realm of supernatural proportions that comes to life through the main character's interactions and observations of discussions between Ghosts (dead people who hang in the balance between Heaven and Hell) and Spirits (repentant individuals who have embraced God's promise) as well as angelic beings and even animals that all contribute to the greater understanding of the mysterious environments presented and of the conditions for progressing into or digressing from the realm of Glory. Though Lewis takes creative license to describe a realm that Scripture does not explain at length, what he ultimately wants the reader to experience is the unsightliness of sin, which when fully developed distorts the very image of God's likeness originally fashioned in mankind. Reading through the main character's journey personally heightened my awareness of the importance of examining the intentions behind my pursuits so as to avoid the faithless involvement in outward deeds severed from sanctified heart-motivations."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis has a great talent for combining fantasy and reality. Here, he follows an average man as he travels (by bus) from Hell into Heaven and overhears a number of conversations between souls trapped in Hell and the angels who are trying to free them. In each of these conversations, the trapped souls cling a particular type of sin (or mindset, if you will) that prevents them from experiencing the total joy and love of Heaven. I think most of us will see a bit of ourselves in each of these poor souls, and as the angels struggle mightily to open their minds, they give us plenty to think about as well.In fewer than 200 pages, Lewis paints a vivid picture of Heaven and Hell, although he makes it clear in the preface that his portrait is merely a flight of his own fancy. On the surface, the narrative is simple and can easily be read in one sitting. However, beneath the surface are many deep theological questions. Lewis probes the nature of God and our perception of time and eternity. He allows us to see our own lives from the perspective of angels, which is quite disturbing. What we value may be at odds with truly matters, and we are stubborn in ceding any ground - so much so that in the end we may knowingly choose a miserable Hell over Heaven itself.If it sounds impossible that we could make such a choice even when Heaven is within our grasp, you may change your mind after reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I have been working my may through several of Lewis' books over the past year, and this is one that I really enjoyed. The more I read of Lewis, the more I appreciate his wisdom and his views on religion and mankind's purpose in life.This book reminds me of \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" in some ways since he uses a fanciful story to teach some profound truths about human nature. Instead of a series of letter from a devil to his apprentice, he has a man visiting heaven and hell and overhearing several conversations of ghosts and spirits. Each of these illustrates effectively things that keep us from making it to heaven, or becoming happy. In all cases, the biggest obstacle to a person's happiness is the failure to love unconditionally. Many of the characters are so wrapped up in themselves that they have no idea the others are trying to help them.Books like this are very good for me to read since I often times get thinking too much about myself and this illustrates weaknesses in others that I have myself. I seem to do better having my weaknesses pointed out by reading an example in a book than by having someone point it out to me directly.Lewis does a great job highlighting the fundamental principles of Christianity; to love God and others unconditionally; and that due to the atonement of Christ, we can be forgiven and must forgive others. Some of the examples show victims trying to help those that hurt them in life. Happiness is within everyone's grasp if they can forgive and love unconditionally.Great book; I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is a light, one-night read. However, as usual, Lewis manages to meditate on weighty topics. He highlights that the core of faith is based on knowing God and Christ, in contrast to a philosophical understanding of or assent to God's methods and requirements. Permeating this entire fantastical account is the idea that we must die to ourselves in order to really live and to be free. Ultimately, I think the message of the story is that faith is not a matter of hedging our bets. As Lewis points out in this fantasy, \\"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, 'Thy will be done.'\\" There is no marriage between Heaven and Hell, hence The Great Divorce!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"An excellent book. I read this even before I became a Christian and it really spoke to me. \\"The Great Divorce\\" is pretty much the story about a group of people in hell taking a one day vacation to the \\"entrance\\" of heaven. In it, Lewis paints a vivid image of what the \\"truth\\" of heaven would look like from the point of view of the weak and faiding souls who are too scared to leave the pitiful \\"comforts\\" of hell. Lewis, as always, gives deep insight and clear understanding of the various tactics and lies we use daily to \\"protect ourselves\\" from hearing, seeing, and believing the Lord's Truth."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of the little known but POWERFUL books by CS Lewis. He has a way of making you really think about your life and what you're letting control you.

This book is like a thinking man's \\"Pilgrims Progress. C.S. Lewis has the whole plan of a soul's trip to the after life worked out. The logic and symbolism is what makes this book. C.S. Lewis has worked out a neat little belief system. As a new arriving soul, C.S lewis narrates his journey, he meets other souls with personalities we have all met. Lewis's helpful guide explains away the problems other souls have in reachng the \\"mountains\\". This book was a very thought provoking book presented in the context of an journey, all the while handling the major questions of life and religion. One does not necessarily have to subscribe Lewis's reasoning to enjoy this book. It can be read on the basic level, a simple jouney or asan explanation for the major questions of life and death. One can see why Lewis's works maintain their popularity over the decades. I thought some of the coversations of newly arriving souls was a litle long winded in some parts and it took away from the flow of the journey."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Once again, CS Lewis captivates the reader with an excursion into an imagined hell and an imagined gateway to heaven.

The pages are thick and sturdy, the font used is clear even to my aging eyes, as is the size of the print.

If marriage is heaven, then divorce, of course, would be hell. C. S. Lewis supernatural characters travel between the two, reviewing their relationships with God and their overall behavioral tendencies. Not a bad lesson for the courtroom either."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Many years ago C.S.Lewis attempted to moralize through a fantasy. Actually, it seems he did this quite often -- That Hideous Planet, etc.What he does in Great Divorce is to assume the role of one having recently died. He appears on the scene of what may be a holding area for the dead; specifically, he finds himself among persons awaiting transportation.An omnibus flies them through the air (space?), up into a frightening for some chasm toward a dawn of sorts. Arriving at the destination, some return to the bus, while others try to explore, and Lewis only seems to explore as he observes the others.His encounter with one of his benefactors -- George MacDonald of the previous century -- gives reason and grounding for Lewis' moralizing.Lewis' perspective on life after death should raise the hackles of the conservative Protestant who seems so often to idolize Lewis -- after death there is a process during which one has many chances to rectify one's lack of loving during life on earth.Is there a Hell? There is some sort of Purgatory!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I haven't read too much of C.S. Lewis's work. I'm not a huge fan of his writing. But someone at work was reading this, and I had it sitting at home, so I decided to pick it up and go through it. It wasn't a very satisfying read.An unnamed character is transported by bus to heaven from what he eventually learns is hell. He meets a diverse group of people on this bus, and even more when he reaches heaven. These people, which are actually ghosts, are each met by someone from heaven who tries to convince them to let go of what they are holding on to and leave hell. Our unnamed character(who tells the story in the first person) is met by George MacDonald, of Lilith fame. The two engage in dialogue that expounds Lewis's thoughts on heaven and hell.This book is a response to William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and is not very well written, especially when compared to some of Lewis's other works. The overall thought is that you can't fully embrace Christ while embracing the world, and that whatever you lose in the world will seem trivial once heaven is gained. A nice story and moral, but the way it is told isn't great."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce by C.S. Lewis is a theological triumph. Narrated by the character George MacDonald(a fantasy writer who resides dead in hell) Mr. MacDonald in this story gets the unique opertunity to go from Hell to Heaven via a bus trip. Where he can then decide to stay in Heaven if he wished. It is to the reader's surprise that most of the travelers on the bus trip choose to go back to Hell instead of staying in Heaven. it is a lesson in the concept of human hunger and thirst. In Heaven your thirst is satisfied, but in Hell you may continue to thirst. A true modern day lesson of the nature of sin and sinners. The message of this book is portrayed strictly and carefully. Extremely detailed and exact. The narrators description is one we will all recongnize, he describes the vises and sin we all suffer from in everyday life. He goes to great pains to inflict the read with a personable feeling while reading. Lewis' talent for relaying the flaws of humanity back to humanity is clearly shown in this book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Other than a very good portrayal, as Lewis imagines it, of the sort of people who may likely inhabit Heaven or Hell, this book is not very uplifting or enlightening as compared with other of his books I have read (Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity). His doctrinal suppositions, woven together in a fanciful tale of a bus full of visitors to Heaven from Hell, are nonsensical. The whole book reads much like a bad dream, with no clear direction or point, except for the basic premise that human beings ought to love one another and learn to get along together. And, I suppose that is his main point in writing it, although the reader is left to himself to decide that."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I must have a tendency to go for thin books. Ah, but that's just the lazy side of me. C.S. Lewis is definitely a renowned author, especially for his Narnia tales.You will like this book if you like the metaphorical way of telling things. The story is interesting and yet has depth. I would strongly recommend it to all Christians."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Let me begin this review by making a couple of things about this book absolutely clear. First, it's not a book about marraige or divorce. Secondly, it depicts a vision of the relationship between Heaven, Hell and Purgatory which is utterly incorrect. However, Lewis admits to this second point at both the beginning and end of the book. It's a work of fiction; nothing else, so with that said, we can move on to the book itself.In this novel, a soul travels from Hell to Heaven, with a few of his fellow souls, and bit by bit, each discovers just why they don't belong there. The slavedriving, condescending boss doesn't even want to be around so many miscreants, the apostate is repulsed by the idea of knowing one idea to be true and all the others false, the thief finds he can't steal anything from Heaven, because he has nowhere to put it, etc... It's a clever little device for a story, although as the book goes on, one is forced to wonder; just what did the narrator do to end up in Hell, and will he be able to overcome it and remain in Heaven?This, by the way, is the element of fiction that the book makes ample use of; that technically, souls in Hell are given a chance to visit Heaven, change their ways, and remain there. This is ludicrous, of course; the very idea of Hell implies that people have already chosen not to change their ways, and made their final decision already. There are no further choices of this sort to be made after Death. Still, as a basis for a story, it's an amusing little plot device. It's just a shame that we never really learn anything of substance about the narrator. I feel Lewis could have fleshed him out and made him an interesting character, rather than a mere cypher for viewing the other occurrances. Still, it was fun to read, for what it was.Now, on to specific goods and bads about the story. I have no major complaints to speak of for the entire first half of the book. As I said, the premise is absurd, but apart from that, it holds up very well.However, in Chapter 9, Paragraph 88, one of the saints says that people who drink the waters of Heaven see their works as though they belonged to someone else. Thank you, but no. I already know what it's like to watch other people do great things, and I know it's not sufficient. If I wanted that, I wouldn't need to go to Heaven for it.This is one of those things that I don't think Lewis ever really understood; the notion that being with God implies the -exhaltation- of man, not his reduction. In retrospect, many of my problems with his books stem from this basic problem.Ch9Par100-103, for example, in which the ghost of a painter \\"realizes\\" that people receive no recognition in Heaven at all, except from God. Needless to say, I don't agree. God grants to the saints all things which are good, and no things which are evil. Recognition from peers is a good thing. Therefore...In Ch11Par14, it's implied that people must never treat God as a means to other good things. While I admit readily enough that God is the greatest possible goodness, and should not be undervalued, we sorry humans sometimes need to motivate ourselves, which is made even harder for those of us who have difficulty being motivated by something as abstract as true and complete goodness, or as humanoid as the son of God. In this kind of situation, it would be prudent to seek some other good, so that one might be motivated to make the right decisions and arrive in Heaven to receive it. Now, this is not relevant to the situation of the woman the saint was talking to in this paragraph, but I feel it should be pointed out.As the book continues beyond these segments, however, it begins to make a number of very good and interesting points. First is Ch11Par113, where it essentially says that every aspect of man can be raised to glory, so long as it's killed first. I personally believe this to be true, since otherwise, the glorified man wouldn't really be a complete \\"man\\" at all.Next is Ch13Par43, which makes the point that those who make others miserable until they choose to be happy on their own terms will be very unhappy in the end. Still, I think this point needs to be studied just a little more closely. On the one hand, this point really only applies to those who make other people miserable by their own choices, but on the other hand, it could be misread to imply that there's something wrong with being hard to please, which I don't think is true by itself.Then, in Ch13Par47, we learn that the action of pity must be elevated, and the passion of pity must be executed. Mostly correct, I think, and an important distinction to make. When we become weak and immoral, and let ourselves become victims as a result of feeling pity towards others, we're not helping anyone, and there does need to be some way to correct this.Finally, I feel I should mention that this book includes George Macdonald as one of its characters. He shows up as a saint in Heaven, which by this point, I'm inclined to think he is. Macdonald's biggest problem, aside from not being Catholic, was his universalism, and unless he intended to apostatize, which seems unlikely, I don't think his mistakes were enough to merit eternal punishment. I disagree with him about some things, but I don't see any reason for supposing that he failed to make it to Heaven. It did bother me a bit to see him treated like the old mentor there, though.Ultimately, the book is about the people we observe; the study of the kinds of people who failed to make it to Heaven and why. Of course, during this study, we examine many types of choices and psychological conditions, and find out what's wrong with them and what kinds of problems they cause for the soul of whoever has them. This is the real meat of the story, and I really enjoyed it, in spite of all the things I was hoping to see.On the whole, I found this book to be very enjoyable and very fun, although again, it needs to be treated as the fiction it is. Take it in that context, and you should be just fine."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Although similar to the Screwtape Letters in explaining Christian doctrine, The Great Divorce movingly portrays he need to for conversion and submission to God. The anedoctal format provides lifelike characters and and shows their struggles to let go of the things keeping them form God. It is one of Lewis's most moving books."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis presents a story of one's journey towards God or away from God. The central characteristic in each of us is Free Will and our daily choices to embrace God or not. A much more succinct journey than Dante's, Lewis challeges us to look at the direction our life is headed based on the choices we make. Based on George MacDonald's definition of hell: I am my own, Lewis ' character is invited to embrace eternal Joy by giving himself to God. I use this book with high school seniors and they say it is a must read"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Very rarely does an author impact me more than does C.S. Lewis, and very few C.S. Lewis books have impacted me like &quot;The Great Divorce.&quot; A tale both of the desperation of the human condition and the glorious mercy of God, it is presented as a narrative about a bus ride from a dismal town in which the sun is always about to set to a bright shining place of painful realities. The book deals with humbling yourself, dying to yourself, and putting to death all that is unholy in your life to be raised up again as glorious. I often wonder why sometimes it takes a book other than the Bible to describe things of God so plainly and simply. Reading &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; has made me see that in desiring God alone my desires for other things will die, only to be transformed into holy desires, good desires, true desires"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The writings of C.S. Lewis are so splendid I do not feel qualified even to review his works He was truly one of the most thought-provoking writers of the 20th century with his many books and especially his approach to theology. The Great Divorce is a story of Heaven and Hell, simply told but with great impact. It is an excellent title to start reading Lewis, and it is one to be read over and over getting more out of it with each reading. This is one of the charms of Lewis--the fact that re-reading brings as much enjoyment as the first opening of his pages. His theological comments are more thought provoking and deserve more study than any writer available in publication today. Reading all his writings is a worthwhile and enjoyable task.The rewards are priceless. Any book by C.S.

I can't even begin to describe the insight and wisdom Mr. Lewis displays in this little book.

If God is good, how come He can stand knowing that people being tortured in \\"His\\" Hell. CS Lewis summarize the answer to this question, with his line: 'There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \\"Thy will be done,\\" and those to whom God says, in the end, \\"Thy will be done.\\"'. Personally, I saw the impact of people 'being left alone by God' on May 1998 during Jakarta riot, they can raise \\"hell\\" by themselves.What CS Lewis described of Hell (we do not get to Heaven yet, but a glimpse of it since the character in the book woke up) is a bunch of people \\"being left alone\\" to their want and get 'him/herself' as the center. I caught a glimpse of this kind of 'hell' when I read one of Philip Yancey and Dr. Paul Brand book regarding a leper person, the disease is already severe, it devoured his senses, he lost his skin-touch sensation, he is mute and deaf, one eye blind and the only connection to outside himself is his one cataract eye that is worsening. If that physical condition can be an analogy of what happen in spiritual condition, being left alone by God and cut off from the source of life (God Himself) because that what we choose, that is surely one hell of a hell. Does it diminish the misery compare to tortured chambers? I don't think so.In this book, CS Lewis, played several scenarios of \\"me and myself\\" as the center from the people who chose hell. You can be surprised of some of the scenarios played, some scenarios that we thought to be a value in human condition, but if extrapolated in forever lifeline can be utterly self-centered. One thing got me wondering, even though it is an imaginary story, but the vivid description will get you wonder \\"where the hell did CS Lewis thought of this of?\\""},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I adored the imagery in this book.

Maybe someone else who is a much deeper thinker than I am would enjoy it. This is the only C.S.Lewis book I have read, so maybe this is how they all are.

It is a fictional account of man who takes a bus ride to the afterlife where he must choose between Heaven or Hell.Many of the concepts Lewis introduced about Heaven and Hell have no scriptural basis. If you set that aside, it is a somewhat interesting look at how things could be.Overall, I thought the book was OK, but nothing great."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I very much like this book. It is not as good as Screwtape Letters, which is my favorite book of all time. The imagery is well-done and the sense of how people choose hell is thought-provoking. It is important to remember that this is fiction, and that Lewis is not a theologian, so the images should be viewed as just that and nothing more. And Lewis makes some theological errors too (such his belief in a type of Purgatory) and those errors are in clear view in the book. But if you can get past that, there is much to be learned from it. The pivotal passage is in Chapter 9: \\"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, 'thy will be done'.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of only two books I usually re-read annually (the other is Elizabeth Goudge's \\"The Dean's Watch\\").

Lewis was a gifted writer, and it is evident in The Great Divorce. I read some of the reviews on this site, and I think that the people writing the negative ones are not in a place where they can read the book with some imagination. It is not meant to be a factual account of heaven and hell (who could write that?), but it is meant to make you think about yourself and the things that are keeping your heart from being ready to meet the Lord.

Every Christian or aspiring Christian should read/listen to this book!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Of the many C.S. Lewis books I have read I find this one to be the most gripping and fascinating. If someone is looking for a picture of how a good God could possibly let people go to Hell, this illustration though not a picture of the truth, nor is it intended to be, is incredibly powerful. The wisdom some of the conversations that are held in heaven contain is enormous, and I will never forget Napoleon pacing in his gloriously unfulfilling mansion in hell. Lewis' platonic vision of the afterlife is fascinating and that such a small book could be so heavy with eloquent expressions of truth is extraordinary.Some people may not like Lewis' writing in general because of his large vocabulary so my advice is to not be afraid to learn some new words, its good for you."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I could not put this fictional story down. The story representing heaven and hell is short but captivating. The numerous characters in the book reject the offer to heaven and give excuses that are really excuses people give for rejecting heaven while they are on earth. I must admit that there were parts of the story that I did not understand, but the basic premise was obvious and interesting."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I gave this book three stars because while it is entertaining, there is a significant potential for people to try and get theology from it, which for the most part I don't recommend. The author makes sure to make that point at the end of the book, though. But I'm sure it's too late for a lot of people by then.The primary theological point that C.S. Lewis is actually intending to make is that one goes to hell as a consequence of rejecting God and \\"loving\\" self. It is the person's rejection of God, not the other way around. However, in trying to make this point in a novel, a lot of the theology seems to get messed up."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Seriously. If you're honest, you'll either see your past self in this book or you'll see your current self in here. Lewis wasn't just a good writer, but also had a keen insight on human nature.The Great Divorce makes an excellent discussion tool for the believer to share with their unsaved friend. Of course, don't build your theology DIRECTLY off of it - it IS allegory and all of the images presented therein (i.e.- folks in the shadowlands simply going on about their lives in the perpetual gray darkness and the opportunity for a 'shadow' to become 'solid' by travelling to the foot of the land of the solids) may have to be stretched a bit to be fully Biblical, but folks will get the idea.As a believer, this book will give you some serious thinking material. Pick it up, read through and re-read. A few of the images from this allegory on heaven and hell will sit with you for a long time."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"i just finished this book and had to come on here and tell everyone about it. first off, i'll tell you that you have to read to the end to get the main theme and Lewis' message. i had to read some parts over again to fully understand. this book really made me think, and when i finished i felt so proud of myself for understanding it. it's weird.i feel like this book will have a lasting impression on me greater than any other book i've ever read. i wish that this was a book that was read in schools, but since it's about religion, they can't. but it would be perfect to teach in schools. theres a lot of references to people and other famous works in this book also (btw) over all, i'd say if you're looking for an book that will get your mind going, an intellectually challenging book, you should read this."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A great book by C. S. Lewis. Definitely one of his best. Even though it is a fiction, it has so many spiritual truths. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"&quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is the first work of Lewis involving Christian theology that I have delved into. Needless to say, while the story is put forth much the same way as Lewis's space trilogy, it does carry a large amount of theological speculations on heaven and hell. I believe the best way for an author to communicate his feelings with the reader is this way, by presenting a fictitious reality and injected into that reality the truths of our own reality. In this respect C.S. Lewis has certainly hit a home run.The story involves a man, presumably and through my thought Lewis himself, traveling on a bus ride into heaven. While there, he experiences events beyond human comprehension, coming across many instances of people rejecting the grace and goodwill of God, and instead choosing to live their live down below in the town which the narrator first departed in the bus from. Obviously, this town is hell. Milton was indeed right with his statement from Lucifer just before he was throw into the pit, &quot;It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven&quot;. This is the ideology of many of Lewis's characters in this book.While in the wonderful land, the narrator meets with George Macdonald (a hero of Lewis's throughout his life, both before his conversion and after.) McDonald takes the narrator on many trips around the land, witnessing discussions between humans and angels.Every writer has at least one great work: C.S. Lewis was blessed with the ability to produce many. &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is perhaps one of his most insightful works of fantasy/fact ever conceived. It reminded me very much of the book of Revelation, in which the Apostle John records his experiences on a deserted island. By the end of Lewis's tale, we find out that the whole thing had been a dream injected into his mind by God. We finish the tale with the promise of the narrator to George McDonalds to tell no one of his events. Classic Lewis style.This is a definite read for Lewis scholars and fans alike, and is suredly one of C.S.L.'s finest pieces of literature."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"One of my all-time favorite books. Lewis, like many didn't like the idea of hell, this book shows how he reconciled the tension between love, justice and freewill from an eternal perspective. My own novel, Hike To Heaven, written about the journey into the Kingdom of Heaven was inspired in part by this story. I also like the subtle humor and sly 'digs' in C.S. Lewis's writing.The journey begins in hell - a grey, shadowy town where people grumble, debate theology and live futile lives in the darkness. They are given an opportunity to take a trip out of town and to see the life available to those who live lives touched by grace. One notable point of this story is that heaven is a place grounded in reality. The people, mountains and even the grass are solid, tangible [the grass hurts the feet of those content to live in darkness].Some people question the theology of this book, but it's not a lecture, it's a story written to provoke thought and give insight. The message this book gives me is that we are the product of our choices. We can choose life, or live dark, unbelieving and bitter lives where we refuse to give up our lies, fears and pride.In hell selfishness leads to isolation, disgrace and deception. It is as one scholar noted, God saying, 'your will be done.\\"Heaven is glorious...the woman surrounded by the throng of animals [cats] as the walking embodiment of redeemed humanity is one of my all-time favorite images of the grace of God in action."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"\\"And those who heard it said, 'Who then can be saved?'\\" -- Luke 18:26 (NKJV)Journeys have a way of capturing our imaginations in ways that other kinds of metaphors don't accomplish nearly as well. If you've ever read The Divine Comedy, Pilgrim's Progress, Gulliver's Travels, or Robinson Crusoe, I'm sure you can easily step back into the stories and feel their effects of your perspective and motivations. C.S. Lewis accomplishes a similar result with far fewer words in The Great Divorce as he describes a bus trip from Hell to Heaven.While not theologically correct in terms of describing the two destinations (or transport between the two), the metaphor is cleverly designed to help nonbelievers and believers alike see how their attachment to what they know and to their desires to \\"call all the shots\\" get in the way of gaining something much better, a relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus.I decided to read the book after our church had a discussion of another C.S. Lewis book, and the moderator expressed concern that I hadn't read any other C.S. Lewis works. A friend in the discussion strongly recommended The Great Divorce, telling me that he frequently rereads it. I'm glad I did. This is an important book that anyone who has ever had any interest in learning more about Jesus should read. I think it will lead you onto a path of wanting to know more. What could be better than that?I suggest reading (or rereading) the book of John in the New Testament after reading The Great Divorce."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I have always considered The Screwtape Letters as my favorite of C. S. Lewis's writings, but now I think that book might have to make way for The Great Divorce. I have just finished reading in and have found it to be even more insightful that Screwtape, though with none of the humor. The Great Divorce is a story about Heaven and Hell, perhaps similar in theme and intent to Dante's Divine Comedy and others, though the Heaven and Hell that Lewis portrays is not much like the conventional pictures of Heaven and Hell.The Great Divorce begins with the narrator, presumably Lewis himself, in a gray, dismal, rainy city of empty streets. This is Hell. There are no flames, devils, or torments. These things might make Hell interesting and Lewis makes subtly makes the point that while evil may be hurtful, it is also, in the end, boring. The streets of Hell are empty, not because Hell itself is empty, but because the inhabitants cannot stand each other. As soon as anyone arrives in Hell, he invariably quarrels with everyone around him and moves as far away as he can. So, there are miles, even light years between neighbors.There is a bus for those who want to travel to Heaven to see what it is like. The narrator, along with a group of quarreling travelers boards the bus to Heaven. Most of the people from Hell don't much like it there. In Heaven, they are revealed to be ghosts, while Heaven is real and solid, more real and solid than Earth. The ghosts in Heaven cannot lift a single leaf. Grass does not bend beneath their feet. The people of Heaven are bright, shining spirits.The bulk of the book consists of the narrator overhearing conversations between the ghosts and relatives or acquaintances from Heaven, and the narrator's own conversation with Lewis's favorite writer, George MacDonald. The spirits of Heaven plead with the ghosts to stay but the ghosts all have one reason or another why they cannot or will not. As MacDonald explains, the one thing that the people from Hell need to do is to forget about their preoccupation with themselves and learn to love God. Once they have ceased to trouble about themselves, they will become more truly the individuals they were meant to be. But, they simply will not do it.Lewis is careful to be sure that the reader knows that this book is only a work of fiction and most emphatically does not claim to be any sort of prophet or to have any real knowledge of the afterlife. In fact, the story ends with the narrator waking from a dream. Still, I think The Great Divorce shows a great deal of insight into the nature of Heaven and Hell, and of good and evil."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is hands down my favorite book ever written by CS Lewis, and I treasure them all dearly.I reread The Great Divorce often, it's just that good.It lead me to the works of George McDonald as a bonus."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I'm not a big fiction reader, so Lewis's \\"The Great Divorce\\" was somewhat outside my comfort zone. I decided to jump into this book as I've watched the intense conversation percolating around Rob Bell's recent \\"Love Wins\\" take on heaven and hell, thinking that Lewis might have some helpful thoughts to challenge my assumptions, as he always does. And though I found some of his figurative, poetic language in \\"The Great Divorce\\" to be a bit dense for me to decipher, I was ultimately fully engaged and significantly challenged by the vivid images and captivating ideas that he portrayed in this imaginative depiction of the afterlife.As Lewis acknowledged in the preface, \\"The Great Divorce\\" is not intended to be a specific depiction of what the afterlife will necessarily be. But Lewis offers some fascinating ideas of what things might be like, in some sense, after we depart from this earth. More importantly than the actual images of heaven and hell, though, I thought that his insights into the foibles and flaws of humanity are brilliantly demonstrated through the various exchanges between those already in heaven and the loved ones who are deciding where they want to be. The mother whose supposed love for her son is really all about herself, the pitiful man who can no longer manipulate his wife, and the man who allows his sin to be killed and only then rides into glory are such poignant and vivid images. But the images depict scenarios and realities that we all encounter around us and too often experience ourselves.Allegory still isn't my favorite style of writing, but if I'm going to read it, I'd rather it be Lewis than anyone else. He doesn't answer all of our questions about eternity, nor does he attempt to do so. But through some fascinating word-pictures, he manages to clearly demonstrate a number of vital truths about our lives on earth and destinies beyond this life in ways that a hundred sermons couldn't begin to capture. I expect that this is a book that I'll revisit, with anticipation that I'll uncover even more layers of Lewis's unrivaled wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is a man's dream journey from hell to heaven. His journey reveals a hell and heaven very different from the common conception and at times uncomfortably familiar. C.S. Lewis shows us on every page the earthly, transient things that we cling to that keep us from fully entering heaven. Our weaknesses can either be a parasitic lizard on our shoulder or a large stallion that can carry us to our full potential. It is a dynamic and life changing read. It makes you think deeply and evaluate yourself.This book would be good to read with someone else and discuss. Lewis can be confusing at times and it is helpful to discuss his ideas with others. Plus you get the added insight of another individual which gives you a deeper understanding of the book.In the end, the book, illustrates what C.S. Lewis stated in the preface to The Great Divorce: \\"Earth, I think, will not be found by anyone to be in the end a very distinct place. I think earth, if chosen instead of Heaven, will turn out to have been, all along, only a region of Hell...\\""},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is a very curious book. When I first picked it up, I had no clue that it would be an excursion into death; more specifically, into what might happen to the soul after death; and even more specifically, into how souls might achieve Heaven or choose Hell.For starters, The Great Divorce is not a dry, philosophical book. It is a cleverly written first-person narrative that begins on a bus ride from a dreary town and ends in a lush garden full of creatures both magnificent and wretched. For the passengers on the bus, the garden is so unbearably real and solid that they can hardly stand it at first. Most will find an excuse to get back on the bus. But a scant few will be persuaded to cast off their attachments to life in the town and head off toward the mountains where an inexpressible joy awaits them.It is against this backdrop that Lewis sets up the core of the work--a sequence of vignettes that perceptively describe some of the major reasons why people turn away from the salvation offered by God through His Son, Jesus. These are, in the main, so beautifully drawn and so frighteningly true to life that every reader must find himself in the crosshairs in one or another of them.Lewis is a brilliant writer and thus this book is littered with wonderful little aphorisms. Two of my favorite are:\\"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says in the end, 'Thy will be done.' All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell.\\"\\"Every young man or boy that met her [an anonymous saint] became her son -- even if it was only the boy that brought meat to her back door....There are those that steal other people's children. But her motherhood was of a different kind. Those on whom it fell went back to their natural parents loving them more.\\"In short, The Great Divorce is brilliant and enlightening. Great food for thought for those traveling through the earthly existence."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce by C. S. Lewis, is available in many editions, either alone or in collections of Lewis' Christian novellas and essays such as The Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity, and The Problem of Pain. Like his Narnia stories for children and his Out of the Silent Planet trilogy, this is a collage of science fiction, fantasy, and theology. Even more than some of his other works I've read, it is really quite a pastiche of different ideas, some of which seem to have been thrown at the text as Jackson Pollock may have thrown paint at his canvases. For example, here and there are brief but very familiar quotes from the Bible which seem to pop up to fill in some space in a paragraph. But Lewis' charm and easy assurance in handling the underlying theology always seems to keep things together and keep you interested.The title is a take-off on The Marriage of Heaven and Hell by that \`so great a genius', William Blake. In spite of Lewis' reverence for fellow Christian, Blake, Lewis thinks the great poet / engraver got it wrong. Lewis thinks that good and evil follow fundamentally irreconcilable paths, and for one to reform from evil to good requires backtracking all the way to where the first wrong turn was taken. For his efforts and his novel notion, Lewis presents us with an image of heaven and hell which would look quite unfamiliar to his distinguished predecessors, Dante and Milton. But that doesn't mean he doesn't borrow liberally from both.Aside from all the usual classics, Lewis primary influence is the writings of George MacDonald, who is virtually unknown today. One is touched not by him today, but we are still touched by the many writers he influenced such as J.R.R. Tolkien, W. H. Auden, G. K. Chesterton, and even Mark Twain.Lewis \`borrows' one big idea from Dante when he introduces George MacDonald as the principle character's guide around heaven, taking the role of Dante's Virgil in The Divine Comedy. He also freely admits that he 'borrowed' one central concept about heaven from an unnamed American science fiction author, whose name he forgot. I suspect that Lewis even went so far as to borrow from Plato's theory of ideas in identifying some of the differences between heaven and hell.Lewis does not hide the fact that the whole story is a dream, as that is the subtitle of the work, but one is inclined to forget that little detail very quickly, as the opening of the book seems very undreamlike. We are not in Dante's forest, but \`...standing in a busy queue by the side of a long, mean street...it was raining...And just as the evening never advanced to night, so my walking had never brought me to the better parts of town.' As in \`The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe', Lewis demonstrates that he is really good at opening a story and setting an evocative tone from the outset. Now from the preface, we know the book is to be about heaven and hell, and it is a fair guess that this dim view of a London neighborhood is not Lewis' conception of heaven. Suddenly, that eerie Twilight Zone theme song goes off in your head, when you realize things are not as they seem. Our suspicions are confirmed when we seem to find almost everyone landing in some kind of quarrel with their neighbor. Not enough to overdo it, just a bit of a parody of a crabby (I imagine NYC) crowd queuing up in the rain for the bus after a day at dismal jobs. But they aren't going home. This is an excursion bus to heaven. As the bus, Harry Potter style, takes off for its divine destination, we get a better look at hell as one vast grey, twilit bedroom / light industry district of a major city.In heaven, we encounter Lewis' borrowing from a novel about time travel. Just as one can't change the past, the visitors from hell can't change heaven on iota, so even the blades of grass and the butterflies are as hard as diamonds. The narrator meets George MacDonald about halfway through the story. The MacDonald spirit, from that point on, serves as the narrator's guide and crutch (since walking on that diamond-hard grass was hard on the feet). Soon after arriving at heaven, Lewis' originality tends to dry up and the story is less fresh; however, that may be because we primarily deal with the ghosts, the expatriates from hell who, regardless of how often they are given a chance to stay in heaven, they find the task too great, in keeping with Lewis' theory that one needs to unravel your whole life, back to the point where you made the wrong turn.I am not sure how closely Lewis' theology is to Anglican thinking, but I'm fairly sure it is not a very comfortable fit with either Lutheran or Calvinist theology. I am also just a bit skeptical of his distinction between God's love and earthly or \`natural' love. I suspect that from the perspective of how we feel things, the two are remarkably similar and not different in kind. But we don't read C.S. Lewis to understand Anglican theology. We read C.S. Lewis because he gives us entertaining takes on serious ideas which makes us want to understand theology better. Lewis himself is like Dante's Virgil, who can take us to the gates of heaven, but who does not enter them himself, because once we do get a better understanding of serious words such as redemption, atonement, and grace, we discover that Lewis didn't get it quite right. But he certainly made the journey entertaining. He cannot carry a suspension of disbelief nearly as well as his friend Tolkien, but he can be read, understood, and appreciated without needing a truckload of preparation in either theology or ancient Norse legends."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis' very short book is a fictional work that follows the journey of a group of people in Hell who take a trip to Heaven. Like his \\"Screwtape Letters,\\" this book provides some excellent insights into the psychology of humankind.During this trip to Heaven, the inhabitants of Hell are given a chance to repent and enter the kingdom of God. Each person upon arrival is eventually greeted by a person from Heaven who tries to convince the unrepentant to receive salvation. It is almost painful to read as these inhabitants of Hell steadfastly refuse to repent. It is painful to see the characters accept Hell and reject Heaven, but it is even more painful because it is easy for us to see our own flaws represented by these unrepentant people.Lewis' construction of Hell as a place where the unrepentant wander around and never achieve satisfaction or fulfillment is conspicuously lacking searing flames and torturing demons. And although Lewis may not have meant for \\"The Great Divorce\\" to be a systematic description of the nature of Heaven and Hell, I think that he is certainly on to something. The vision of Hell found in this book is, I think, closer to the reality of Hell than the traditional Dante-esque version of torture and pain. But the primary accomplishment of \\"The Great Divorce\\" is that it shows us the psychology of unbelief, even when manifested in ourselves."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I think this is one of Lewis' very best. He attempts in this work to paint a picture of heaven and hell based on his understanding on Christian theology; and what a picture it turns out to be! I found myself captivated from the beginning with the author's depiction of the confines of hell and its inhabitants, which then become a perfect foil for the soul-lifting glory of heaven that he goes on to describe. What makes the work so powerful is the believability of the picture that is painted, despite its speculative nature and imaginative leaps.The book has something to offer to everyone. Heaven and hell become platforms from which to probe the depths of human morals and motivations. Every reader will find himself/herself identifying with one or more of the caricatures compelling constructed by the author. The picture of heaven itself and what it represents (read and find out for yourself!) is enough to provoke thoughts about purpose of the earthly life. The fictional nature of the book allows Lewis to convey a Christian message about heaven and hell without coming across as preachy or high-handed.A masterful combination of Christian theology, vivid imagination and excellent prose. I cannot recommend this book more."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis himself says in his preface, &quot;The last thing I wish is to arouse factual curiosity about the details of the after-world.&quot; This book kept me wondering just what he WAS trying to say--whether he thought there were choices after death, or whether he was just trying to get us to think about life and the terrible seriousness but potentially glorious finality of our choices. If you are the kind of person who believes common 90s philosophies like, &quot;That's YOUR reality but not mine,&quot; you should let Lewis tell you a little story. Aside from being very entertaining, it cuts right through a lot of &quot;intellectual&quot; nonsense, and makes you really THINK, maybe for the first time &quot;outside the box&quot; you didn't know you were in.In the end, I believe he makes it clear that there are no choices after death. His characters are simply acting out the choices we make within the boundaries of time here on earth, with the element of time removed from the story as it plays out in &quot;heaven&quot; and &quot;hell.&quot; While you are caught up in the story, you will be in another whole &quot;world&quot; of Lewis's creation, and will be surprised to find yourself back on earth at the end--but you'll now see it (for a while at least) through different eyes. Reality is absolute, and what is seen is the least real of all."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"William Blake wrote of the marriage of heaven and hell and in this splendid fantasy novel Lewis becomes judicator of the divorce. The narrator joins a bus queue in a perpetual sunset kafkaesque town and takes a trip to heaven where any can stay and go to the mountains if they repent and trust. Lewis hits the mark at describing our fallen psychology. As Dante had Virgil as guide so our narrator has Scottish author George MacDonald along on the tour. MacDonald trying to explain the choice of the lost says: \\"Milton was right,\\"... \\"The choice of every lost soul can be expressed in the words, 'Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.' ..... There is always something they prefer to joy --- that is, to reality.\\" The people from hell are shades as they all quickly discover on leaving the bus. The grass, trees, and even the water are solid and the shades from hell leave no impression. Conversely the new environment does effect them, one example being that rain drops would blast holes in them like machine gun bullets. The heavenly region they visit is much larger than hell although they don't realize it. \\"All Hell is smaller than one pebble of your earthly world: but it is smaller than one atom of this world, the Real World.\\" The reason hell is so small is that it is so full of mostly nothing. The insistence on self will leads eventually to the person becoming more and more unreal. The narrator, who is really Lewis of course, asks MacDonald about his being a Universalist, that he talked in his books as if all men would be saved. Paraphrased MacDonald says something like: Doctrines such as universalism or even predestination may be true in eternity from God's perspective and paradoxically not true in time where freedom operates and the choice of ways is before you. In eternity it may be as our Lord told Lady Julian of Norwich \\"that all will be well, and all will be well, and all manner of things will be well.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of those books I have made notes from and will probably quote in the future. Reading it, I kept wishing I had read it a long time ago. Even if you don't usually have patience to sit and read books of theology, this book and Lewis' \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" will grab your attention and make you think without realizing what's going on. C.S. Lewis wrote like no one else in our modern times."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This amazing little book explores the difficult subjects of heaven and hell and salvation and damnation with a depth that will enlarge your vision, shrink your ego, and strip away all your excuses for living lives of pretense. While accomplishing these feats, the book may just help you grow in maturity. Do not read this book if you are frightened of challenge. Do not bypass it if you are eager to stretch. I rarely come across a work with such potential to change lives. This book is worth purchasing to give out as gifts. With the recent popularity of his \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" this might be the next Lewis classic for you to read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"It begins with a character who takes a mystical bus ride to a mid-point of Heaven and Hell. (Lewis' Catholic views protrude in the area of purgatory but that should stop one from reading it.) Each proceeding chapter tells of a story of a person in Hell that has the ability to go to Heaven but chooses not to because each one is too indulged in something else. Lewis' creates a different view of Hell than the original stereotype. This book may help others realize the necessity for selflessness. One should look past the fact that there is a purgatory if one disagrees (as I do). This is not the theme of the book. Any Christian can learn a valuable lesson and new perspective."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"First I have to admit that I have not read much CS Lewis. Given his reputation as one of the premiere Christian writers of the last century I recently purchased a small stack of his signature series books. The Great Divorce is the first one I have read, and I was truly amazed by its simple, yet complex message.This book is powerful fiction with enough theology to put the gears of your mind into overdrive. In my opinion Lewis addresses two key questions in The Great Divorce - Is there a difference between heaven and hell? And, does God truly give us the freewill to decide our own eternal destination? Lewis really makes the reader ponder these two &quot;deep&quot; topics, and think about why certain &quot;types&quot; of people may have more difficulty choosing heaven over hell.I won't give away Lewis' conclusions, but instead I will highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a short, but powerful book. If you are a Christian you should definitely add this to your reading list. Lastly, if you are not a Christian, don't be afraid to read it. Lewis was a great writer by anyone's standards, and his &quot;theology&quot; is subtle enough to be enjoyed by anyone."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book was one of the launch pads into the realm of Lewis. The book, fiction though it is, requires one to follow the point of Lewis--those who do not go to heaven would not enjoy it there anyway.This book has caused unnecessary fire from people who have a terrible habit of reading \\"fiction\\" literally. This book is not canonical Scripture. Please do not think that Lewis proposes that one can travel from heaven to hell, and vice-versa. Lewis is merely trying to make a point.I would encourage readers to enjoy the book, apply the message to their lives, and not to dampen the impact with wooden literalism."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If you haven't yet read any theology or Christian apologetics, this novella is a fine place to start. If you already read such, then you know that you just HAVE to read this classic.C.S. Lewis uses a dream device, ala not only Dante and Bunyan, but also echoing of Isaiah and John, to give us a keyhole glimpse of the afterlife, albeit in more modern terms.Hell is an endless, shabby, grey city in the rain, where the quarrelsome and disputatious residents are given a chance for a bus ride to Heaven. There they must confront their sins and foibles and make the ultimate choice. Even faced with the reality of God, many are still unable to free themselves from the shackles of vanity, uncertainty, and pride!Lewis clearly is intending The Great Divorce as a metaphor, for the notion of the damned being given \\"another chance\\" and a bit of a day-excursion to Heaven is, of course, not in accord with any Christian doctrine. However, he uses the metaphor to illustrate many telling points of Christian theology, starting with God being the Great \`I AM.' The bus ride itself, and the relative sizes of things are also evocative of the extra-spatial nature of the Godhead.In summary, Divorce is a short, brilliantly-written tract and a wake-up call for many: A thought-provoking read for anyone and worth multiple readings! Get it."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book is unforgettable -- both comforting and disconcerting. The narrator, together with a busload of damned souls, takes an allegorical trip into Heaven (or at least, into the Shadow of its Valley). Here he discovers that Heaven is for all souls who truly want it, but at the price of giving up all there is of Hell within them. This price proves too high for many of the damned, who prefer to return to Hell. The thing is, many of these pitiful and lost souls who choose damnation are very much like all of us.A wonderful cautionary tale. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"For some reason, I find myself returning to this book about once a year to re-read it. It's a short and easy read, but it's length is deceptive. Lewis is an excellent observer of the human condition and this allegory is very thought provoking. Written over 40 years ago, it still stays fresh.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"We all remember stories of The Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe, about Aslan and his famous victory over the Witch. The Great Divorce was something of a different nature. Lewis still had his ideas about heaven and hell, but they were a bit more obvious. There weren't a lot of undertones as in the children series, but everything he wrote was concrete and it was obvious what his views were. This made the book a lot better and I enjoyed it very much especailly the ending, showing Lewis' rather cruel humor and sense of style. If anyone likes Lewis I recommend this book and I would also recommend The Screwtape Letters. Then if you enjoyed Screwtape I would recommend This Present Darkness and it's sequel Piercing the Darkness by Frank Peretti."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I'm not usually a fan of allegories such as this. And, in truth, I'm not overly fond of this allegory either. It's not that Lewis' points aren't excellent ones. It's not that the story isn't interesting. I imagine it's because sometimes the points are so allegorical that I have to sit and think too long before I really understand what he's driving at, and I don't like to stop so often when I'm reading a narrative. Still, the metaphors are beautiful and often brilliant, and the book did hold my interest until the end. With a little patience, I'm sure I could have gotten a great deal more out of it. Those who choose to put in more effort than I would probably find it well worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A must read for any believer, as with all of Lewis' books."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If I had to choose only one book (excluding the Bible) as my all time favorite, this would be it. I was brought up as a Catholic and turned Protestant. This book helped put into perspective the concept of Purgatory and the idea that God does not send anyone to Hell, rather, they choose to go themselves. The imagery in this book is wonderful, the senarios are timeless. I have read this book many times, but I have to keep buying new copies because I love this book so much that I keep giving it to other people to read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis' title would seem to be an answer to Blake's work &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,&quot; but his method is Dantean. Like Dante, Lewis attempts to portray the spiritual existence of souls in Heaven and Hell in a physical manner. The vision of Hell as a somewhat dingy city is inspired, and the idea that the souls there don't even recognize that they are separated from God is a grand revision of Dante.Still, like many allegories, the work gets heavy handed at times. It is always clear who is right in any discussion--and that's fine, but to me there are about 2 too many such colloquys. Nevertheless, this is yet another venue into Lewis' theology, and though it isn't as forthright as some of his other works, the addition of fictional ideas makes it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is an excellent book! As there are already many good reviews here, I would only add a quote from the book that I like very much:&quot;Earth, I think, will not be found by anyone to be in the end a very distinct place. I think earth, if chosen instead of Heaven, will turn out to have been, all along, only a region in Hell: and earth, if put second to Heaven, to have been from the beginning a part of Heaven itself.&quot;If this is at all true, it sure offers a fine perspective on living!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A sometimes overlooked classic of Lewis's, involving an imaginary trip to the afterlife.

I had difficulty following all the thees and the yees, tracking the differences between the spirits and the ghosts, deciphering the solid beings from the translucent ones.I can sit through an amount of philosophizing; I don't think I can sit through much theologizing.But there are times when something--and the gift of this book is you feel it is addressed to you. . .the meddlesome wife. . .to you the vain artist. . .to you the knowing teacher--is said just right. Listen:\\"We met several Ghosts that had come so near to Heaven only in order to tell the Celestials about Hell. Indeed this is one of the commonest types. Others, who had perhaps been (like myself) teachers. . actually wanted to give lectures about it: they brought fat notebooks full of statistics, and maps, and (one of them) a magic lantern. Some wanted to tell anecdotes of the notorious sinners of all ages whom they had met below. . . \`You have lead a sheltered life!' (these teachers) bawled. \`You don't know. . .We'll tell you. We'll give you some hard facts.' . .All alike, so far as I could judge. . .were wholly unreliable, and all equally incurious about the country in which they had arrived. They repelled every attempt to teach them, and when they found that nobody listened to them, they went (away).\\"If you are a teacher--as I am--you should be arrested by the truth of that scold. So I plodded--at times reluctantly along a paragraph a day, a page a day--to get to the next bit of truth. And--at times--I was similarly arrested. Here, about the consequences of habitual \\"small\\" sin, listen:\\"I am troubled, Sir,\\" said I, \\"because that unhappy creature doesn't seem to me to be the sort of soul that ought to be even in danger of damnation. She isn't wicked: she's only a silly, garrulous old woman who has got into a habit of grumbling.\\"\\". . .The question is whether she is a grumbler, or only a grumble. If there is a real woman--even the least trace of one--still there inside the grumbling, it can be brought to life again. If there's one spark under all those ashes, we'll blow it till the whole pile is red and clear. But if there's nothing but ashes. . .they must be swept up.\\"\\"But how can there be a grumble without a grumbler?\\"\\"The whole difficulty of understanding Hell is that the thing to be understood is so nearly Nothing. But ye'll have had experiences. . .it begins with a grumbling mood, and yourself still distinct from it. . .Ye can repent and come out of it. But there may come a day when you can do that no longer. Then there will be no you left. . .just the grumble itself.\\"I benefited from these, and similar insights, disappointed, though I was, in the book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"CS Lewis in this book proves once again why he is a favorite of so many Christians today!He gives a picture of what those in hell would do if they ever actually got into heaven, and how our personal problems are really caused by ourselves. But, it is often difficult to see that. And, truly, only by seeing through Christ's eyes can we see the truth of who we are!The book is an AMAZING read, and a wonderful picture of humans, God, heaven, and hell.Again, this book is not intended to be accurate to the Bible, nor is it theology (CS Lewis states this himself), but a wonderful literary fantasy! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis takes us on a profound journey through both Heaven and Hell in this engaging, allegorical tale. Using his extraordinary descriptive powers, Lewis introduces us to supernatural beings who will change the way we think about good and evil. Although he doesn't mean to give his readers \\"even a guess or a speculation\\" of what Heaven or Hell is actually like as to factual details, there is still much food for thought for anyone concerned about eternal life, both here and hereafter. In incredibly creative, imaginative vision! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is just what I needed and it works great."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis takes us on a fascinating travelogue through Heaven and Hell in this book. Lewis' Hell is like an endless dreary town where people get further and further away from each other and more and more twisted up in ancient resentments. Lewis takes the gentle Christian's approach to Heaven--anyone who wants to enter Heaven may do so, but many choose not to, for one reason and another. As an atheist, I can't take Lewis' evocation of Heaven and Hell as seriously as Lewis would like me to. As a metaphor for the human condition and the way we allow ourselves to get wrapped up in the trivial and ignore the things that truly bring us happiness, it is excellent.At one point in the book, the narrator is discussing with his teacher that he thinks he ought to feel sad about all the people who decide they don't want to go to Heaven and instead return to Hell. The teacher replies that this is \\"The demand of the loveless and the self-imprisoned that they be allowed to blackmail the universe: that till they consent to be happy (on their own terms) no one else shall taste joy: that theirs should be the final power; that Hell should be able to veto Heaven.\\" This certainly has some wisdom in it. I sometimes feel that I ought to feel sad that people are starving around the world, and there are so many other problems. Lewis gives a gentle reminder here that whatever I do or don't do about the world's problems, there is no point in my being personally unhappy about things I can't help.As fiction, the book is fine and interesting. Before taking it too seriously, however, I would strongly recommend reading other points of view. Christianity has a nasty habit of ignoring the major problems of our time, including overpopulation and exhaustion of resources, because they aren't mentioned in the Bible. As far as the major problems of our times, I would suggest Kunstler's \\"The Long Emergency.\\" For a defense of the naturalistic worldview, I would suggest Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" or Taner Edis' \\"The Ghost in the Universe.\\"I read \\"The Great Divorce\\" because I feel as a scientist that it is important not to simply dismiss religion as silly, but to give Christians their chance to convince me. If you're a Christian, are you willing to do the same for the other side?"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce, is with only few exceptions, my favourite book. You take a stroll through hell which seems like a pathetic greek drama, only to find a bus stop destined for a Heaven that will only at first seem like hell, a giant that is George MacDonald, and a whole host of characters a few saints but most sinners. A must read, and one of the few books that I have read other than the bible where it seems as if something divine was actually helping to guide the hand of the writer. I can't wait for the sunrise."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I believe this little book will be one that reveals more and more on each subsequent re-reading. For such a small book there's an awful lot of wisdom packed in there. Lewis paints such a vivid, imaginative picture of the afterlife that I find myself hoping that something like this is what it is like in reality. Of course I'm sure that reality will surpass this - that heaven will be more wonderful than we can even begin to imagine, and God more majestic and more merciful than we can comprehend. But this book provides a good stimulus to start thinking about it, and about the heavenly or hellish character of our lives in the here and now. A book to read and re-read, like most of Lewis' work."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I read this book in college, my first C. S. Lewis book, and was floored by Lewis's use of language, images and symbols. For those who found his Screwtape Letters an amazing work, you may find yourself a bit overwhelmed with this one (not meant to be arrogant but rather based on personal experience). Lewis takes great effort to demand that the reader follow the many characters and what constitute them in order to convey his idea of &quot;seeing God&quot;. Many friends who were please with Screwtape did not like this book and found it to be too heavy in message. This book takes a route not so much of ethic but of idea and concept and it is within the latter that one can get lost. I experienced this when reading Dune so I can appreciate the frustration. If books of this type do not interest you I would still implore you to give yourself and the book a chance.Not being what one would call a &quot;person of the faith&quot; one can still understand what (t)ruth Lewis is trying to express. I won't disclose what that is as it is the crux of the experience. What I will say is that it makes faith a universal approach by humanity whether it be to religion, science or any other belief system.

I wish I had read it years ago. It is now one of my personal favorites, one I recommend to my family and friends.My view of the afterlife...and current life....has been forever altered and enhanced because of this book. Lewis's imagery reinforces biblical teachings in a powerful way and encourages Christlike living NOW to avoid the miserable extended journey in the next life.So many powerful scenes and imagery, but my personal favorite was the lizard on that man's shoulder, representing lust, that was constantly wispering into the man's ear. The man could not shake it off himself, but had to be painfully ripped off by the angel once the man gave his consent. The man quickly recovered, and what happened afterwards to the man's soul once it was free of the lizard was thought-provoking.I highly recommend this book to all.

And it has a few addendums that are useful and entertaining: The Lamps of Experience is a collection of English proverbs with origins and Arabic equivalents; English words of Arabic origin; and Biographical Names - this is particularly well-done with many color pictures.The only minor complaint I might make is that the Arabic words do not have the vowels marked so I must make a second trip to my Arabic-English dictionary to &quot;discover&quot; the correct vowels.

All he had was a vague image of a woman and an address in New Orleans. Four months earlier, Leah had been told by the Orlando Police Department that her husband had died in an automobile accident with an 18-wheeler.People are shooting at Hunter and he can't remember why. Leah is pregnant with Hunter's child but can't tell him because she doesn't know if knowledge of that fact would endanger their unborn baby, so she tells him that they were friends before the accident and that her name is Leah Johnson and she doesn't mention the baby growing inside her.Hunter realizes that Leah is the key to unlocking his memory but he doesn't know if he can trust her. On his first day after returning to the home he does not know is his, FBI agents with a search warrant knock on the door and once inside tell Hunter that they are not there to hurt him but to protect him. They tell him they can't tell him any more than that. Hunter and Leah agreed to go into protective custody but while the FBI agents are driving them to a safe house, a mysterious black SUV tailed them and shot out the rear window and chased them with guns a-blazing. The FBI agent driving the car allows Hunter and Leah to jump out of the car after turning a corner and were out of the SUV's view for a few brief seconds. Throughout the rest of the story, Hunter and Leah have to dodge both the FBI and the bad guys as they try to unravel the mystery of why someone wants Hunter dead.Barbara Colley has brilliantly weaved a set of intricate details and circumstances into a superb and intriguing mystery that kept me wondering and guessing right up to the very last page. She has embedded into her story numerous cliffhangers that would not let me put the book down. Every page is filled with suspense and the sexual tension between Leah and Hunter keeps building and building throughout until they can no longer control their urges and desires.The main characters are interesting and believable. Even the secondary characters were true to life. I enjoyed reading about New Orleans and all of its charms: a camp on Lake Pontchartrain decorated in Mardi Gras motifs, New Orleans streetcars, a tropical storm, oyster po'boy sandwiches, Audubon Zoo, and a Mardi Gras parade, to mention only a few.Barbara Colley's book is so extremely well written and intriguing that I can't wait for the next one to be released. I felt really good reading this book and I know that anyone else would enjoy it as well. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Fly Homer Fly [Signed]","review":"This is one of my all time favorite Bill Peet books. I remember the good ole days of my youth spent at library reading most of his books. Fly Homer Fly is a heartwarming story about Homer, a pigeon who leaves his dull country life for the big city.

I enjoy all of them, but Making Pigeons Pay is the CLASSIC.I recently purchased it with two other great pigeon books by the late Wendell Levi - THE PIGEON, and ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PIGEON BREEDS.Yes, in some areas MPP is outdated - the miracle he supposed DDT to be turned out not to be the success envisioned. Yet, most of the other salient points remain as valid today as when the first edition was published in 1946.If you are interested in squab raising on a commercial scale you will need Making Pigeons Pay (MPP).If, though, your interest is in raising breeds primarily for show or exhibition buy Encyclopedia of Pigeon Breeds.If you are interested in exhibition breeds with the ambition to sell breeders, you of course will want to at least buy The Pigeon and Encyclopedia of Pigeon Breeds."},{"Title":"MAKING PIGEONS PAY","review":"A good more than basic text on commercial squab production by a man who bred more than 20,000 pair of them a year for many decades.

And unlike an ordinary chessbook, this is one you actually READ, as opposed to study. The ratio of words to game annotations is unusually high.What's really great about the book is the number of relatively obscure players who receive attention. Fischer, Lasker, and Steinitz receive the most, but 45 other players get their own separate sections, in addition to the Italian School theorists and the 7 Pleiades of Germany.Paulsen gets a much-deserved section as a player far ahead of his time and typically overlooked in chess history. Writes Fauber, \\"The tragegy of Paulsen is that only the players who went beyond his successors ever understood him. His play has such a contemporary feel that it is hard to appreciate what a true pioneer he was.\\"The two noteworthy omissions, Bronstein and Tal, are perhaps forgivable, if not laudable, for those players have popular, excellent, and readily available autobiographies. (Sorceror's Apprentice & Life and Games of Mikhail Tal.) However, there are no GAMES of Bronstein's, and only a non-tactical loss for Tal.There are many players mentioned in passing, and though there are no post-Fischer games, there is at least a chapter discussing the three K's, plus Polgar, up-and-comers, and the damned computer itself.With this coverage, Fauber dovetails nicely with Saidy's March of Chess Ideas, which concentrates on mid to late 20th century players and has full chapters on both Tal and Bronstein. Also, Saidy goes into more depth on the smaller number of players covered. I recommend buying BOTH books, if you can find them.Euwe's Development of Chess Style, which concentrates on playing style rather than on biography, provides an interesting comparison. You would not regret purchasing all 3 books.Back to Fauber.... There is a complete index of players and their opponents. There is also an index of openings, which serves mainly to demonstrate the wide coverage of the book as the annotations are not thorough enough to make this a useful treatise on openings. (Get Dumont's 500 Master Games if that's what you want.)There are over 200 games, many well-known. I did not find the annotations particularly enlightening, aside from the simple threats mentioned in many of the games of the first half of the book, and I doubt that a stronger player would see much value in them either. But the primary aim, according to Fauber in his introduction, is not instruction, but rather, \\"to spotlight the major players and their contributions to chess. Games have been included that attempt to portray the style, [and] the personal touch which goes with the greatness, of the players. Sometimes, though, a game has found entrance because it is pretty, and the readers will enjoy it. That is the ultimate aim of this book, to offer some evenings of enjoyment exploring the rich past which chess bequeaths to all of us.\\"He succeeds in this aim: A chess book for all fans, weak or strong.

Because of its light-hearted romantic approach in the midst of \\"the devil's own scrape,\\" this is one of my first recommendations to readers who I am introducing to Heyer.Poor Cardross is in love with his wife, but doesn't know how to show it so very well. To make things worse, it's just not the thing to sit in your wife's pocket, and the servants always seem to walk in whenever he wants to display affection.Nellie, always aware of the fact the she had to marry Cardross/his money since her family didn't have a feather to fly with, finds herself equally attached to her husband, but wondering how she can show him that it's not his money she loves (her pockets-to-let spending isn't very convincing). Due to well-meaning but careless comments from his younger sister, Nellie is aware of his past \\"liaisons\\", and figures that his current reserve may very well be due to the same.The difference in the ages ( 30's vs. 19) accounts for much of the misunderstanding. He's a Man of the Town and she's still a bit of a green girl. She is not the cleverest of heroine's but very likable. He is not the completely rakish fellow one loves to laugh at, but the reader feels that he is indeed the strong and wise hero able to smooth over all the heroine's mistakes.Her unwise choices create many doubts in her husband's mind that he is trying to overlook. His overlooking makes him reserved, causing Nellie to fear his final rejection. Her foolish but generous use of money has created a bit of tension, and sets them up for an amusing conflict that is carried through the book, with laughable little twists-and-turns until the end.Also, the secondary characters - Cardross's friend and younger sister - add tons of color and wit to the story."},{"Title":"April Lady","review":"Once again, Georgette Heyer takes the reader on a rambuncious ride with laughs and surpises at every twist and turn and doesn't stop until the very last page. This is a great novel for first-time readers of Regency stories, as the plot and character descriptions sweep you away even as you acclimate yourself to the idioms, mannerisms and delightful dialogue of the English Ton. One of Heyer's more outlandishly comedic novels, you will find yourself laughing at Nell's antics as she tries to settle her debts, which in and of themselves do not seem terribly outrageous but taken in the context of the time period are undoubtably hilarious. I challenge you to be able to put this one down once you realize Nell's predictament -- and wonder how it will resolve."},{"Title":"April Lady","review":"If this were anyone but Heyer, I'd probably give it 3 stars. Her ability to write vivid characters, and her sense of fun, earn this one an extra star.I haven't checked, but I'm sure this must be one of her earlier Regencies. You can see her experimenting with characters who become archetypes, like the gamester brother, or the perfect gentleman friend who supports the heroine in her trials.She includes some details that don't appear in later novels, hinting at the darker side of Regency society.My biggest problem is the hero, Lord Cardross. Her heroes often have a harsh streak, but he comes across as too harsh and cold, without the humor that usually softens her heroes. He and Nell are at outs for most of the story, which doesn't help.He's a man in his thirties, while Nell is barely nineteen, and that makes them an uneven match. And he has an unkind and ungracious habit of baiting Nell for marrying him for his money. Since she came from a noble but bankrupt family, the rules of their world dictated she didn't have a choice. He knows that as well as she does. It's unpleasant to watch him holding it over her head.Since Cardross isn't the most sympathetic hero, it's hard to identify with Nell's love for him. She can seem like a bit of a twit. That's especially true since she's got a debt she won't tell her husband about, and all kinds of silly, frustrating scruples about how to get the money to pay it back. She's not all bad, but she reminds me of the kind of female Heyer satirized in later books.Also strange is that we are asked to believe they both fell in love at first site, and that neither one of them has even suspected it, even though the marriage has been consummated for several months. Possible, I suppose, but not pleasant to think about.What saves this story for me is the tempestuous Letty, Cardross' half sister and ward. She's more of a risk taker than Heyer's later young ladies. Of course she is head over heels in love with an unsuitable young man. Letty's attempts to get her own way and marry him before he sails abroad are very entertaining. The lover himself is certainly not what you'd expect.In short, this is not Heyer at the top of her form. For the true fan it is worth collecting, and certainly worth re-reading, but not as often as her best."},{"Title":"April Lady","review":"One of my absolute favorite Georgette Heyer books, April Lady is charming, funny, and at one part, heart-wringing.A year into their marriage, both Nell and Giles are deeply in love with each other but assumes that the other had only entered into a marriage of convenience. Misunderstandings between the two are exacerbated by the unwitting actions of Giles's spoiled, willful sister Letty, who's determined to marry a poor diplomat and Nell's brother Dysart, who's always in debt and borrowing from Nell.My favorite moment is when Giles is under the mistaken impression that Nell had sold the family jewels he gave her but he still forgives her and calls for her to come back to him."},{"Title":"April Lady","review":"This is one of the lesser visited plots where the main characters are already married and we follow the story as they fall in love.At times I wanted to shake the heroine for being such an idiot and the hero for being so reserved. If they had just opened up to each other and talked everything out, there would have been no problems. Of course, there would have been no story, either.That said, I usually don't care for these misunderstanding-based plots but, somehow, my irritation was overruled by my enjoyment of the story."},{"Title":"April Lady","review":"REVIEWER'S OPINION:I did not enjoy reading about the heroine Nell. She did too many stupid things. She was not honest with Giles her husband which resulted in inaccurate assumptions by both of them. They each thought the other didn't care, so they acted in stand-offish ways, which reinforced the beliefs that the other didn't care. How did this start? Nell's mother was ignorant and told a lie. The mother told Nell that Giles only married her for convenience, would never love her, would always have a mistress, and Nell should not show her true feelings or any insecurities. From the stupidity of youth Nell believed her and felt she could not go to Giles with her problems, and she never let him know that she loved him. Nell avoided being with Giles for various reasons. In one scene, Giles wanted Nell to stay home with him, but Nell said she wanted to go to a play with Letty. She really didn't want to go, but she chose to go because she feared Letty might argue with Giles if they stayed home. This was not following Nell's feelings, and it was a stupid reason (IMO). Another problem was Nell frequently acting afraid of Giles, and he saw this. Giles loved Nell, but he never told her. He believed she married him only for his money which was not true. The plot starts with Nell telling a lie to Giles. Then she had to keep making up more lies to cover previous lies which snowballed into a mess by the end of the book. At one point Giles was angry at Nell believing she stole something which was not true, but she didn't deny it which was another lie. This did not work for me. I was more annoyed than enjoyed.Another example of stupidity: midway in the story Felix offered to loan Nell the money, and she said no. I'm shaking my head - what? She was desperate and that would have solved her problem.On my profile page, I have a list of pet peeves. This story used three of them: (1) conflicts due to vague communication and inaccurate assumptions (2) lying with does not fit with one's feelings and motivations and (3) heroine doing stupid things. Sometimes a small amount of these can work, but this story had too much.I loved the narrator, Eve Matheson. She spoke slowly, was easy to understand, and had such a pleasant, lovely voice. She's my favorite female narrator so far.STORY BRIEF:Nell's brother Dysart is an irresponsible gambler. He borrows 300 pounds from Nell which means she can't pay her clothing bills. She doesn't tell Giles that Dysart borrowed from her. She doesn't tell Giles she has an unpaid bill of 300 pounds. She goes to Dysart for help, and they consider and attempt various schemes to get the money.A second story is about Giles' half-sister Letty who is 17 and wants to marry Jeremy who has no money. Giles is against the marriage at this time due to Letty's age. But he will support it in a couple of years. This is unacceptable to Letty who is furious and plans her own schemes. Letty is selfish, foolish, and very stupid.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 9 hours. Narrator: Eve Matheson. Swearing language: none. Sexual content: none. Setting: 1813 England.

From what I can tell, the entire series is based around world war 2, and there are many good transitions in the series from history to story.

I thought that this book met that expectation quite well."},{"Title":"The Defenders","review":"The fifth Helmsman book finds Wilf Brim as commander of the space port over the capital planet Avalon. As in the past book, Brim finds many adventures to get into with the help of his friends, the Emperor Onrad, and his enemies in the 'League'.As part of the continuing series, I felt this one was the weakest. As a thinly plotted remake of &quot;the Battle for Britan&quot; the rescues and adventures are somewhat tired and predictable. As an author, Baldwin has succumbed to the hazards of writting a series. However, that does not mean that it fails to carry the plot to a conclusion that leaves room for the next book in the series.This book is predicatable to anyone who has read the series.

But, this book is not about reversing macular degeneration for those who have it now, as it is billed. It presents the view that macular degeneration can be prevented through nutrition, exercise and the use of protective eyeware.

While it uses the modernist experimentation that characterized \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" it is very easy to follow, but still invites several rereadings to explore its depths more fully.The novel takes place on a single day in June of 1939 at an English country manor called Pointz Hall, owned by the Olivers, a family with such sentimental ties to its ancestry that a watch that stopped a bullet on an ancient battlefield is deemed worthy of preservation and exhibition. Every year about this time, the Olivers allow their gardens to be used by the local villagers to put on a pageant for raising money for the church. This year, the pageant is supposed to be a series of tableaux celebrating England's history from Chaucerian times up to the present.The Olivers themselves are tableaux of sorts, each a silent representation of some emotion separated from the others by a wall of miscommunication. Old Bartholomew Oliver and his sister, Lucy Swithin, both widowed, are now living together again with much the same hesitant relationship they had as children. Oliver's son Giles is a stockbroker who commutes to London and considers the pageant a nuisance he has no choice but to suffer. Isa, his discontented wife, feels she has to hide her poetry from him and contemplates an extramarital affair with a village farmer.Attending the pageant is a garrulous woman named Mrs. Manresa, who is either having or pursuing an affair with Giles. She has brought with her a companion named William Dodge, whose effeminate sexual ambiguity is noticed with reprehension by Giles and with curiosity by Isa. The somewhat romantic interest Isa shows in Dodge implies that she knows Giles would be annoyed less by her infidelity than by his being cuckolded for a fop like Dodge.The other principal character is not an Oliver at all, and this is Miss La Trobe, the harried writer and director of the pageant. At first, she appears to serve the mere purpose of comic diversion, as she frustrates herself over details that nobody in the audience notices anyway; however, when the pageant is over, a new aspect of her character is revealed, one that has made her an outcast among the village women. Nevertheless, she graciously accepts the role of a struggling, misunderstood woman artist, and in this sense, she echoes the character of Lily Briscoe in \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" as does Isa with her repressed poetry.At the end of the pageant, to celebrate the \\"present,\\" Miss La Trobe has planned something special and startling: She has the players flash mirrors onto the audience as if to say, \\"Look what England has become. Shameful, isn't it?\\" Likewise, with this novel Woolf holds up a mirror to humanity, reflecting our unhappiness in her characters. It's not a cheerful notion, but it's a fitting one to sum up the career of a writer like Woolf, one of our greatest chroniclers of sadness."},{"Title":"Between the Acts","review":"This under-appreciated work is slowly gaining the recognition it deserves from Woolf critics... but I would say that, since I wrote my dissertation on it! Woolf's fiction is never light reading, but Woolf lovers will here find a masterful synthesis of descriptive power, her exhaustive knowledge of English history and literature, her feminism, her passionate hatred of war and her conviction that only aesthetic experience can enable humanity to question the status quo and *perhaps* create a better world... interested readers might consider reading it alongside The Years, Three Guineas, Moments of Being, the last volumes of the diary, or such Woolf essays as &quot;Thoughts on Peace During an Air Raid,&quot; as well as Shakespeare's Tempest. This slim novel speaks volumes; it is a work of mature genius by one of the 20th century's greatest writers."},{"Title":"Between the Acts","review":"This book is not about what goes on outside the play so much as it is about Woolf's new expression of her continued criticism of English society. There is humor in the book. Her Victorian policeman is a biting and explicit critique of the sexism, racism, and general destructive intolerance that was actively supported by the Victorian imperialist discourse. I only wish she'd lived so we could see what she would have tried next."},{"Title":"Between the Acts","review":"Virginia Woolf (1882 - 1941) was a well known writer, critic, feminist, and publisher. This was her last novel, and it is a departure for Woolf from prior styles, and many like the novel. It is interesting, but falls short of being a masterpeice.As background information, I read most of her work starting with her first novel \\"The Voyage Out\\" published in 1915, skipped her second novel - which is considered to be a flop, Night and Day from 1919 - and then read \\"Jacob's Room,\\" her third, then went on and read \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" her fourth, and next read \\"To The Lighthouse,\\" etc. Also, I read some of Woolf's non-fiction.\\"The Voyage Out\\" is simple and straightforward work and it might remind the reader of a Jane Austen novel, but it set on a ship and then at a remote location. It is over 400 pages long, and has an Austen theme. After her second novel - which did not do very well - Woolf decided to be more risky and creative with the next book. She changed her style and approach to the novel and Woolf uses the stream of consciousness technique to bring a sense of the chaos and shortness of a young man's life around the time of World War I, Jacob's life, i.e.: from the pandemonium of Jacob's life as portrayed by Woolf through the use of the stream of the consciousness technique, we eventually have clarity in the novel. She carries this writing style on into the similarly chaotic story in the novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" and most of her later writings - including the present novel - her last written just before her suicide. The subsequent books, including the present novel, are shorter and use the stream of consciousness technique.The story is a bit similar to \\"To The Lighthouse\\" in the setting. It has a rural setting, a home in the country, and it is about a community play held at the home. The story describes some of the family members at the home, the other members of the community, and also, and interestingly here, much of the novel describes the play itself.I guess what is disappointing here is the structure or plot compared to her best novel, \\"To The Lighthouse.\\" In that novel, the reader is fully engaged with that story and it is a compelling read, and hard to put down. That book, along with \\"Jacob's Room,\\" moves the reader emotionally. That is missing here. The novel is short and has a low key \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" quality. Nothing dramatic happens \\"between the acts\\" of the play that one would call interesting or compelling or highly emotional. The reader waits for something to happen - as in her other works - but it never occurs. Also, it lacks sympathetic characters. The story seems very hazy and undefined, and it seems to lack direction. The play itself is interesting and it is unusual to see the play worked into the story. That is a sign of Woolf's genius. But it is not enough to carry the novel and make it a masterpiece.As a \\"common reader,\\" as Woolf describes us, we readers of her books, I think her best fiction is \\"To The Lighthouse\\" - that is a masterpiece - and her best non-fiction is \\"A Room of One's Own.\\" I like the Oxford version of the latter published along with \\"Three Guineas.\\""},{"Title":"Between the Acts","review":"Between the Acts (BtA) was Woolf's last novel, finished but not yet revised before her death in 1941. It is, like Woolf's other novels, experimental. She takes some of her already established techniques and adds new things. She sets it in the span of a single day (i.e. Mrs Dalloway), depicts and parodies historical events (i.e. Orlando). Woolf centers the action around a village play (a bad play, but that is part of the fun). The social commentary on Britain is there, but BtA is far from the &quot;usual British stuff.&quot; In the course of the novel the reader should look at the actors and the audience, drawing parallels to our own daily acting. Woolf includes a number of literary allusions. See if you can find the use of Gerard Manley Hopkins in the narrative, for example. As with Woolf's other writings, plot is not the focus. Even though she died thinking it was unsuitable for publication (she was mistaken), BtA is a fine novel from a master writer."},{"Title":"Between the Acts","review":"Virginia Stephen Woolf finished Between the Acts in 1941; however, she never revised the novel because of her suicide during the same year. Between the Acts takes place in a small town in England before she has entered World War II in 1939. The novel, which spans one day, is about the annual village pageant at which villagers present a play to the community and guests about the history of England. The action splits between the acts concerning England in the Elizabethan Age, the Age of Reason, the Victorian Age, the present day, and the intermissions between the acts. In Between the Acts, there are many characters that are involved in the immediate action of the novel. Bartholomew Oliver, a retired Indian Civil Service worker, lives in a medium sized home called Pointz Hall with his widowed sister, Mrs. Swithin, his son Giles Oliver, who is a stock broker, and Giles' wife, Isa Oliver. Isa and Giles have a son named George. Two characters show up at Pointz Hall and attend the pageant with the residents. One of these characters, Mrs. Manresa, who is the only non-British character, is very flirtatious with Giles throughout the book. Her companion, William Dodge, is a very poetic yet nervous character. A final major character who is behind the scenes for the entire novel is Ms. La Trobe, the director of the play. There are also some minor characters that are involved in the action of the novel. Mrs. Haines, the wife of a farmer, appears in the opening scene of the novel. Isa hires Mabel, who plays Reason in the play, to take care of George as his nurse. Lynn Jones, a member of the audience during the play, disagrees with a statement made by Badge, an actor in the play. A final minor character, who is an actor in the play, is Albert the Village Idiot. One theme in this novel is unity. Unity is shown through the acts as the come together to create the play. The group of main characters also expresses unity. Another theme, which is a dominant theme in Woolf's writings, is feminism. There are many feminist images and references in the play. The acts of the play are about the woman rulers of England and love stories. The personality of Virginia Woolf can be seen in Mrs. Swithin, Isa Oliver, and Ms. La Trobe. These two themes are both major themes in Woolf's writings. Between the Acts can be viewed as a conversation that moves from point to point throughout the novel. The novel seems choppy and moves around constantly. The narrator sometimes seems like a character in the novel at points where he or she appears almost involved in the action of the scene. This is a dominant trait in Woolf's literature. The novel is whole with no chapters or significant breaks in the action. Instead, the book seems like a play with many scenes divided by long spaces in between paragraphs. The novel is also a combination of poetry and prose. Many people say that this work is not complete because Woolf never revised the novel."},{"Title":"Between the Acts","review":"Much of the writing is beautiful and evocative, but it's hard to know what's going on. The summaries posted here have more \\"plot\\" in them than is easily gleaned from the book. Because the stream of consciousness leaps from character to character, it's hard to know the relationships let alone see who is flirting with whom and why it matters. You do figure it out but it takes too long to figure out which characters go with which names.There is a lovely portrait of an English village in 1939, and the heartbreaking innocent pageant of English history portrayed, but really, you can get such atmosphere from the series Mystery-- and there you get a plot as well. I think this is not a good introduction to Woolf, as it takes certain kinds of experimentation and heightens it. At least with Mrs. Dalloway you see things for the most part from one point of view and come to care about it.I enjoyed this, but then I'm in theatre, so I enjoyed all of the description of the pageant. This is a little bit like reading the equivalent of a home movie, it's pretty, but you don't know the people portrayed well enough to really care."},{"Title":"Between the Acts","review":"if you love countryside, old women having tea every day at 5.00pm and chatting about weather reports and neiborhood's affair, this book is for you...if not, well, stay away!"},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"This book has the feel of JD Robbs \\"In Death\\" series. The main character, Sam, is a thief. Rick is the super-rich love interest who wants Sam to go straight. Mildly familiar or not, it's fun. And like Robb's series, the romance continues past the first book. So often with romances--everything comes to a happy stopping point. In this series, however, the relationship continues to develop in the following books. I enjoy the growth of the story and the return of characters as \\"main\\" characters instead of cameo's in subsequent books. I would recommend it. See book 2, \\"Don't Look Down\\"; book 3 \\"Billionaires Prefer Blondes\\"; and book 4 \\"A Touch of Minx\\".

I picked it up in the store because of its bright, interesting cover, and I'm glad I did. The writing is excellent, the characters are delightful, and the suspense story can't be beat.However, I must say that the romance between the two main characters seemed to take a back seat to the suspense plot. I was more interested in the conclusion of the mystery than I was in the romance - there was never any question of whether or not the two characters would end up together, since they were together almost immediately after meeting. Ms. Enoch seems to only be able to write suspense in one element of her book, and the suspense of the romance is gone here.The mystery is excellent, wonderfully complicated and impossible to figure out. I didn't know what was happening until the surprising ending. Sam Jellicoe, a professional thief, is a delightful character, and Richard Addison, the rich man she tries to steal from, is a very sexy romantic hero.I would recommend this book to anyone, although if you are looking for a true romance novel then you may be a bit disappointed. I look forward to reading more of Suzanne Enoch's books."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Okay, so I see I am in the minority here with my opinion on this book, but I thought the characters in this one were so superficial.The hero was 100 percent stereotype of a rich and powerful man with really no unique characteristics that made him someone to remember. The heroine was an unrepentant criminal (I had a little trouble getting past that). But the worst for me was that she seemed to have the emotional maturity of an unruly teenager, speaking in one word sentences or cheeky comments at all times. I really struggled to find some redeeming qualities in her. It would have helped had she been a bit sophisticated -I could have romanticized the criminal aspect probably had that been the case, but, alas, it was not.Because I struggled with the two main characters it made it really hard for me to pick this as a winner. I love Suzanne Enoch though. I buy all of her books and will continue to do so. This one just isn't a must read in my opinion."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Back in November, I was going through a difficult period in my life.

Sam tells Richard she knows people \\"in the business\\" who can help solve the mystery more easily than the cops.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This is entertaining. Good dialogue. Good lines. Some chuckling. Interesting characters with interesting interaction. He's used to the press following and taking his picture. Her goals are never be photographed and never be seen. Yet to her horror, she is photographed when with him. She is suspicious of people he's not suspicious of. They think differently. It's fun seeing their interaction. I prefer romance stories where the couple is together at the end forever. This does not do that, but the couple is together in good ways. There is romance and sex. They just don't make it legal. It's still rewarding and fulfilling. There are sequels which continue their relationship.This was labeled romantic suspense, but I didn't feel much suspense. It was more mystery than suspense. Sure, some bad things happen, but it didn't feel suspenseful. The sex scenes are not emotionally charged or super hot, but they are ok and fit the style of writing. The author has a good writing style. The focus of the book is the mystery/plot. But the plot felt formulaic - not really creatively different. I want romance novels to pull me emotionally out of my life or entertain me with humor, and that was not the effect here. Therefore I'm not hot to trot out and buy the sequels.The ending was vague and incomplete as to the plot. I didn't understand how three different bad guys fit together. I wanted to know more about their motives and how and what they did. I wanted more details and motives about the multiple murders. I also wanted more details about what happened to the bad guys at the end.DATA:Story length: 366 pages. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words. Sexual language: moderate.

Picked this up on the off chance, and was pleasantly suprised. Imagine! A woman who actually participates in the solution of her problems. Wow! What a revolutionary idea. And not just participates, but contributes valuable skills and knowledge. At best, these books usually involve a woman who knows alot about a subject, but a man who knows more (Nora Roberts, sexist extraordinaire, is the foremost example of this). But Enoch lets the female be strong and sexy, and the male be strong and sexy and it all works beautifully.I ran out and bought a couple of her other books. DOWNER! They are just as I thought! I forbid Ms. Enoch to write historicals from now on. Your mission, Ms. Enoch (and you simply MUST accept it!) is to rescue us starving but intelligent romance lovers from the gag inducing banality offered by most writers and publishers."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"I found the opening of the book intriguing, and I was interested in the characters for a while. But about 2/3's of the way through the book, I became weary of it. It just kept going and going. It is also very hard to get past the fact that the lead male character falls so hard for a thief! If I found a thief in my house, no matter how handsome he was, I would not want to date him. I would say read it as long as it interests you, then skip through the rest. You don't lose anything doing that."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"This is a fast one.

I was so suprised when I found out that one of my favorite historical romance authors had switched gears and genres! My first thought was...\\"a contemporary romantic supsense read? No way!\\" WAY! Ms. Enoch has mangaged to switch gears without missing a step. The end result is a rather funny but entertaining read that you won't want to miss out on.Sam Jellico is a thief. She has her standards but she's a thief none the less. She has just broken into Rick Addison's home. She is there for one item, and one item only. What she ends up getting is caught and not in the way you think. One minute she's almost home free...the next she is saving rich Rick from being blow sky high. Problem with this is she is now considered a suspect in the death of a security guard. She has only one witness to the fact that she didn't kill anyone...if anything she saved a life, and that witness is...yup, you guessed it Rick. Wull she be able to convince this handsome Brit that they can and should work together to figure out just who on earth wants Rick dead?Rick should have been in Germany...instead he's home and right in the thick of things when BAM! His life is turned upside down. He knows that his lady thief is not responsible but the police think otherwise. Than the minx breaks in AGAIN and offers to make a deal with him. Should he get himself tied up with the beautiful thief or should he take his chances with a killer?This was a very fast read! Samanatha and Rick are great characters. Both are strong willed and used to being in charge. It was fun to read about them falling in love while hunting for a sick would be murder.

The characters were believable and not to contrived. Sam's attraction to Rick was visible from first sight and Rick's attraction to Sam was evident from the second break in. Their mutual lust brought them together to solve the crime which played nicely against the romance and was not suddenly pushed to the back.The changes they brought to each others life gave them things they were missing in their own lives which led to slow trust and then love. I love this book and wholeheartedly recommend it."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"I was attracted to this story because of the unusual protagonist - Samantha Jellicoe, a cat burglar. Sam is hired - through her agent, of course - to retrieve an item from the mansion of Richard Addison. Sam's done her research concerning security, and Addison is out of town. Except that Sam gets caught, and ends up saving Addison's life in an explosion that was supposed to take care of a theft - and Sam - at the same time. Sam goes on the lam, until she decides that the only way to clear her name of a theft she didn't do and find her enemy is to join forces with Addison. Falling in love wasn't part of the plan. A very humorous tale of romantic suspense, with an excellent mystery intertwined. I enjoyed the humor and the mystery."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Flirting with Danger is a well written novel and I am looking forward to the next installment. I laughed so hard. Suzanne Enoch normally writes historicals. I had read an excerpt for this novel and was just a little nervous about reading it. I however thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent book.The heroine does a few stupid things that cause the reader to laugh as well as the stupid things the hero does. It takes place in the United Staets which is also a step away from normalcy for Ms. Enoch. There is murder and intrigue that draws the reader in as well as the chemistry between the two main characters. The second in the series will be out in January and continues to follow the story of Samantha Jellicoe and Richard Addison."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"This was a fantastic, fast read, with likeable, exciting characters, a fun, fast paced story line and all of the great details that I love about historical romances -- but in a modern setting. (Come on, who doesn't like to fantasize about how the fantastically wealthy live, not matter the era.) I'm not going to write a re-cap of the story. It's been done, and done well. But I am going to say, if you as a romance reader have been disappointed with what has been published lately, as I have been -- this won't disappoint. While I enjoy all of the great fantasy romances that have been published over the last couple of years historical romances have been particularly dismal, even from my favorite author's (and not Suzanne Enoch:), as have contemporaries, so much so that I've been having an a hard time feeding my romance novel habit.If there are any editors or publishers trolling Amazon, and I'm in marketing so I know you do, kick up your publishing efforts, bring in some better editors, please. This is a growth market, I worked at a bookstore for about 3 years, romance readers will buy 3,4,8 books at a time if they are interesting and well written, and most of the regulars are like me - they buy weekly if there is stuff to buy. If I can find enough books to read, I'll read anywhere from 4 to 7 books a week. So please spend more time on grooming new authors and editing your cash cows. I haven't enjoyed such a romance that wasn't either romantica or fantasy romance, in months."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"The last thing wealthy businessman Rick Addison expected to find in his Palm Beach mansion after returning from Germany early is a sexy cat burglar. When she keeps him from getting killed in a blast, he's not convinced that she was the culprit behind the crime. When she breaks in again to make a deal with him - help prove her innocence and she'll help solve the crime - he at first turns her down. Samantha Jellicoe came into burglary as a family business, and has successfully eluded capture when liberating and \\"relocating\\" other's priceless antiquities. She's the perfect cohort for the upper crust Brit, while the bodies pile up around them. As they try to figure out how it all fits together, the two quickly burn up the pages with a steamy affair. But can he really trust his heart to a woman who lies and steals for a living after an especially bitter divorce?Enoch's first foray into contemporary romance novels is a knock out. With two charismatic leads, hysterical situations, true suspense, and great dialogue, she has created the perfect romantic-comedy-suspense. Her heroine is a kick butt gal who takes no gruff until she meets her match, while her lover tries to keep a stiff upper lip and keep up with her. It's a treat from cover to cover.Enoch has included a bonus at the end - her musings on what it took to change genres from historical romances to contemporary romantic suspense. It's a nice insider's guide on the creation process of a writer, and just as humorous as her novel. The adventures of Sam and Rick continue in the sequels \\"Don't Look Down\\" and \\"Billionaires Prefer Blondes.\\" If either follow up is as good as the intro, this is quite a series!"},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this book.

Samantha is an international theft and breaks into British playboy millionaire Rick Addison estate. Before Samantha can steal the priceless antique, a bomb goes off and she saves Rick's life. Samantha decides to work with Rick to clear her name and and solve the mystery. The last page of novel gives a humorous touch of Enoch old historical romance. Great book - was sad to finish it! If you enjoyed mystery romance novel I would also suggest \`Saving Allegheny Green' by Lori Wilde, Crazy For You by Kate Angell and Vanish With the Rose by Barbara Michaels."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Seriously entertaining, witty, and delightful.

Inside the Solano Dorado House, her operation falls apart as security and the owner Richard Addison catch her. A bomb explodes killing the guard, but Sam manages to pull the unconscious Richard to safety before escaping into the night.The police suspect Sam, though they know her as \\"Smith\\", murdered the guard and attempted to kill Richard; he knows otherwise, but is unable to persuade anyone that she saved his life. With the heat on her and her partner under surveillance, Sam breaks into Richard's home again offering a deal; she will help him learn who wanted him dead while he helps clear her name of the homicide rap. As they work together they fall in love, but finding the culprit proves difficult.FLIRTING WITH DANGER is a fast-paced, action-packed romantic suspense that accelerates from the onset as Sam the cat burglar meets her latest target British businessman Richard. The story line stays at its rapid rate until the final confrontation with the villains. The lead duet are an interesting pairing because both are used to being in charge, making for extra sparks and conflict. Though his seemingly in the dark over other purloined valuables appears off kilter for his personality, fans will enjoy this cat burglar romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"I've read this book several times already and I loved it from beginning to end. It's so entertaining. The characters are refreshing in their extremes. I mean we're talking about a mega-rich British hottie falling for a brilliant sexy cat burglar. What's not to like? The story is infused with lots of crime and mystery. It kept me on my toes. And the romance...whew...scorching! I had to put down the book once in a while it was so hot ;) I loved the whole series and wish the silly publishers would pick it up again. I want to see more of Samantha and Richard! Pretty please...If you like good dialogue, witty smart characters, and a little mystery added to your romances then this is your series. If only it would continue :/ It is definitely worth a read.

That is why, when a bomb explodes in the very house she is stealing from, at the very moment she is doing her \\"work\\", the red flags fly. Keeping the handsome, billionaire owner alive and getting out without getting caught is her first priority, however, it isn't until she discovers her life is in serious trouble later that she is forced to take action.This book is so much fun, one hates to put it down - even for a moment - to get anything else done! If I didn't think the sex aspect was too soon and too much (totally personal, I admit) this would have been a definite 5 star just for sheer entertainment and excitement!"},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"This was recommended to me because I enjoy the In Death series by JD Robb (Nora Roberts). This book is similar, but doesn't have the same depth or skill in characterization as Robb's works. However, it was an interesting read, with good pacing (dragged a little in some parts). The tension/conflict between the characters was well done. If you enjoy romantic suspense, with a billionaire and thief thrown into the mix, you'll enjoy this one. If you want something grittier, more intense, check out the In Death series by JD Robb (starting with Naked in Death)."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"This is my first Suzanne Enoch book and I am very pleased. She writes a mystery that is amusing, witty, and suspenseful. I will be reading more of her books in the coming months."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this restrained romance between burglar Samantha and billionaire Rick. Published in the Avon Romantic Suspense series which means there's a lot of 'who cares' plot which climaxes in a gobsmackingly violent denoument scene. The heroine gets her head battered repeatedly by the baddie. Unbelieveably she seems to make a complete recovery in just about 2 weeks. I felt all her pain even if she didn't.There are no secondary romances (praise be) and reading Sam and Rick together was a nicely sensuous experience.Sometimes I didn't really like how Samantha speaks but that wasn't a big concern. After all the story is set in Palm Beach and we all know the wives/girlfriends of Florida millionaires are foul-mouthed. My other criticism is that the brit lord, Rick Addison, is mostly portrayed as refined, rich and classy when at the end of the novel he is shown to be a mean, vengeful shark. And the american heroine is too often called a no-class whore by other characters in the book when she's nothing of the sort. Also 'Mr Wonderful' Rick totally fails to protect Sam from harm. And he stops wearing 'body armor' after only 2 days into their biblical relationship.With each twist and turn in the plot I kept asking myself 'Why does he stay with her,' or 'Why does she stay with him.' And I liked the fact that the answer wasn't necessarily 'He has money,' or 'She's beautiful and clever.'In the end I read the story about 2 or 3 times. And each time I felt more sympathy for Sam, the burglar heroine. Ok, she's an unconvicted felon. But basically she goes through the whole story with some quite serious, deep cuts on her back and leg. Which she got when she protected Rick from the bomb blast. Yet she rarely complains nor does she allow her injuries to cramp her style.Plus. It's not her fellow criminals who are doing all the killing."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Enoch's first contemporary novel is fresh, sexy and witty; having read all her historicals I was wary of how she would translate into the 21st century, but Flirting was probably her best novel to date.Sam Jellicoe is a premier cat burglar who's attempt to relieve British billionaire Rick Addison of an ancient collectible goes awry when a bomb kills a security guard during the job. Sam rescues Rick from the explosion (a nice switch) and, now a murder suspect, leverages his gratitude and her black market connections to persuade him to help untangle the mystery.The book was fast-paced, the dialogue was snappy, and the sexual tension between Sam and Rick keeps you nicely distracted from the sometimes-convoluted plot. At times the suspense was undermined by drawn out conversations about possible suspects and improbable plots as Sam and Rick tried to solve the mystery. Early hints also left little doubt about the identity and motives of the villain, though the 'how' was elusive enough to keep me interested.However, one of the best things about this book was watching Rick's character change as the story evolves. Rick was introduced as a bit of prig; judgmental about Sam's nefarious profession even while using her experience to decipher the plot against him--but by the end of the book he was much closer to accepting her past. What made this transformation unique was Enoch's decision to avoid the usual whitewash, i.e., she was a thief because she had an abusive childhood or was valiantly supporting a younger sibling with her life of crime, etc.The book also appears to be the first in a series, reminiscent of JD Robb/Nora Robert's Naked in Death; though less gritty and more focused on romance than suspense. The characters also echo Naked, though here the criminal tendencies are on the female side, the male lead's charming accent is British, and the tone is much more light-hearted.I very much enjoyed the book overall and look forward to reading the next in the series."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Ok, so for a while now I have been searching for a Great new book as all my favorite series do not have anything new out. Well I am so happy to say that I found one! After reading dozens of samples on my kindle and even pushing myself to finish the ones I bought out of their potential from the samples, I was still unsatisfied. I have read everything from Sci/Fyi, mystery, erotica, fireman, military / seals and more, and so many have the same pathetic relationship struggle and overdone feel to the storyline. Not this one! Yes there is a little of the \\"oh I've been so independent for so long, I've been burned before\\" but it was put in the story in small doses at the right times. The story and the journey is what brought them (or sold the relationship to the reader)together, not a bunch of corny lines and mushy over the top sharing of feelings. The story plot built the relationship while keeping the male lead extremely sexy, keeping the female lead from being annoying in anyway, and topped it all off with a truly sexy kick a$& mystery / action adventure!

Ms. Enoch is one of those doing better. Rick and Sam are complex characters that catch your interest and hold it. The plot works, the characters work, we have humor, we have sex, we have conflict and the story pulls you in and won't let go. It's one of those books you don't want to end. Fortunately, it won't since Ms. Enoch tells us at the end of this book that another Rick and Sam story is on the way. Can't wait! For a GREAT cat burglar/historical romance, read Connie Brockway's ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Having never read Susanne Enoch before, I don't know how this compares to her other novels, but I do know how it compares to other contempary novels on the market (being an avid reader of this genre) and it ROCKS. This book is fast paced and clever and the characters are interesting and genuinely likable. That is a hard combination to find. I had no idea 'who done it' and there were plenty of small twists in the plot to keep it going. I thought the chemistry betweent the main characters (Sam and Rick) was well evolved and in a word - hot. The sex scenes were sexy and hot without stealing the show. Definately pick this book up if you are interested in a fast, delightful read. I even plan to try one of Ms. Enoch's historical books because I liked this one so well - I hope its as good, although its not my usual type of book."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"I have to admit, I was holding back reading this book. I have read all Suzanne's historical romance novels, which I enjoyed tremendously, but I was afraid to read this one. I did not want to be disappointed by one of my favorite authors. And I never was!I really can't add much to the plot description, only that I found the last few lines on the novel being a very nice touch. The novel reads easily, the action, the events, the intrigue flows effortlessly. There is humor found almost everywhere. There are also \\"Star Wars\\" artifacts lurking on pages and knowing what a big fan Suzanne is, I thought that she might have written a contemporary title just for the fun of being able to mention \\"Star Wars\\" in there.The romantic scenes are also done with much more \\"freedom\\" than those in historical titles. And there is much more humor and fun in them too.After reading this book, I can't now decide which I like more: Suzanne's historical titles or her contemporary one. I am very hopeful that she will not stop at just one contemporary novel, but I am also looking forward to her next historical one too."},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Samantha Jellicoe)","review":"Flirting With Danger is a fun, sexy, suspensful, modern-day romp which is both different and eerily the same -- fabulous characters and great storytelling -- to Suzanne Enoch's earlier work.

On page 4 you read: &quot;For my purposes, the story of Thomas Alva Edison is the most relevant; he played a major role in many of those early information industries..&quot; (yes yes go ahead); a few paragraphs later you read &quot;Edisons's story is a great place to start.

The author makes a number of good points about why PCs are such pigs to use. I've personally always felt that PC stood for &quot;pig computer&quot;. I have always believed that where we are today with computers is where the automobile was in the early 1900's. Back then, you had to be part machinist, part chemist, part electrician, part mechanic, to run and keep your auto running. Today, you have to be part OS expert, part networking expert, part hardware hack, and part wizard to run and keep your computer running.

Norman is a great writer, and the ideas set out are important - just lacking completion."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"The book is absolutely not as provocative as the title. There is some solid information in it about:* user-centered design,* the technology life cycle,* product design processes, and* why it is so hard to design easy to use products which are successful in the marketplaceBy way of example: If you are unfamiliar with Moore's book &quot;Crossing the Chasm,&quot; there is a decent summary in Chapter 2 of Norman's book, and he covers issues like this reasonably well throughout the book, and ties them in to product design issues. None of this is new, though, and it might have little to do with information appliances.I was hoping for a bit of a harder sell from Norman, to see him stick his neck out and make a stronger call for an information-appliance-rich future, but he spent too much time on supporting information to ever cover his vision well.If you have read Moore's book, have read Mirrorworlds, and do human-centered design on a daily basis, then read:Chapter 3 (&quot;The Move to Information Appliances&quot;), Chapter 11 (&quot;Disruptive Technologies&quot;), and Chapter 12 (&quot;A World of Information Appliances&quot;) ...and skip the rest of the book.If you who would like a broad brush overview of some of the bullet points listed earlier, consider this book. In fact, skip chapters 3,11, and 12. Just don't be confused about the originality of Norman's work, here: he may be an evangelist, but the gospel did not originate with him.If you want to read Don Norman, consider &quot;Turn Signals are the Facial Expressions of Automobiles&quot; and &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot; before you read &quot;The Invisible Computer."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"The book is persuasive in its central argument that today's PC is overgrown, difficult to use, and suffers from its fundamental architecture as a multipurpose device. The point is made adequately in the introduction and first chapter, however, and the rest of the meat of he book just belabors the point, often repeating the same points in the exact same words.The appendix on examples of information appliances is fun, as he finally gets to what he thinks will be the next generation of devices to replace the PC. This is what I was waiting for through the whole book. Unfortunately, this part is the thinnest of all with only a few obvious examples.Also, I sometimes found his arguments about market forces and the business model of the technology industry simplistic, even naive. I found it hard to believe at times that he worked at Apple all those years.Still, I enjoyed skimming it."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"An interesting book from somebody who is obviously a very smart guy. I'm willing to follow most of his arguments because he seems like a very smart guy and because his tone is so engaging and compelling. This is the best thing about The Invisible Computer.The weakest points in his book for me, however, is that he tries to an extend a metaphor without proper back-up in the way of solid evidence. At the same time, he still presents his issues as objective. Norman does a better job, in my opinion, when he is talking about design.At least I have to say that it is well-written, and raises some interesting issues about the future of technology."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"I only at chapter 2, but I need to rant.

In this book, it was called Invisible Computer. I would have preferred he cover more about modern tools and why they could not be as useful as they seemed. User Experience was covered and that is one thing many folks here work with. I had to disagree with some of his examples. He stated that in a modern car, you only need a speedometer and a gas gauge. I would sure like to know if my transmission fluid, brake fluid and steering fluid are low. I would also like to know my radiator needs coolant, BEFORE I am on the side of the road with the hood up. I thought at times he was too desparate to state how we don't need as much technology as we have. People will use it if it is there.

Overall, interesting to read, but had a hard time agreeing with much of it."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"His basic argument in this book is that the computer industry has matured to the point where it can no longer just cater to the early-adopter technologists and must appeal to the masses to continue growth. Unfortunately, the industry doesn't know how to do this and continues to deliver technology for technology's sake, leading to fat computers and technology that aren't that useful or appealing to most people, and are beginning to exhaust the technologists too. He introduces some recent, but standard models of technology adoption for discussing the problems, customer-centered design in cross-disciplinary teams (marketing, engineering, and user experience) for designing products that transcend the problems (explicitly discussing Contextual Design a few times), and &quot;information appliances,&quot; multitudes of small, task-focused technology products that will replace our big, cumbersome, general-purpose (but not great at any) PCs.Norman's forte is definitely cognitive and experimental psychology in product design, and not being a technological or product development process visionary. I found very little new or interesting content in the book, and I don't think he articulated even some of the derived ideas very well. The whole book could have been condensed into a long magazine article. His prose is wordy and redundant, and the book is regrettfully lacking in many of the detailed case studies and examples he's used in previous books to elucidate his ideas. I want the idiosyncratic and outspoken psychologist professor back, such as he was in The Design of Everyday Things, or the powerful academic argument of Things That Make Us Smart. His short stint as a VP of HPs &quot;Information Appliances&quot; division, and his earlier work at Apple, was not enough to give him a deep understanding or insight into the problems of the current technology-product market.He does make some good book recommendations, however, and I'll add my favorite articulation of the problem, that I think articulate the problem and potential solutions much better:C. M. Christensen, _The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail_, 1997. G. A. Moore, _Crossing The Chasm: Marketingand Selling High-Tech Goods to Mainstream Customers_, 1991. T. K. Landauer, _The Trouble With Computers: Usefulness, Usability, and Productivity_, 1995."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"I'm a fan of Donald Norman's work so when I finally had achance to pick up \\"The Invisible Computer\\" I had high hopes.Unfortunately, this work didn't provide the same insight andfocus as his previous books such as \\"The Design of EverydayThings\\".Throughout the work Norman draws upon \\"Crossing the Chasm\\"and \\"Inside the Tornado: Marketing Strategies from SiliconValley's Cutting Edge\\" [both by Geoffrey Moore]. Alsoheavily emphasized are the ideas put forth by \\"TheInnovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firmsto Fail.\\" All of these books are interesting--but I wantedsomething from Norman himself.Chapter 7, \\"Being Analog\\", was more in line with what I hadcome to expect from Norman. He ends this chapter with this:\\"Alas, most of today's machines, especially the computer,force people to use them on their own terms, terms that areantithetical to the way people work and think. The result isfrustration, an increase in the rate of error (usuallyblamed on the user--human error--instead of on faultydesign), and a general turning away from technology. Willthe interaction between people and machines be donecorrectly in the future? Might schools of computer sciencestart teaching the human-centered approach that is necessaryto reverse the trend? I don't see why not.\\" That's what I'mlooking for! If only the rest of the book had followed thatpassion.Instead focusing on human factors and man-machineinterface issues, Norman wanders discussing substitutablegoods vs. nonsubstitutable goods, a rehash of why softwareis hard to write (and the mythical man month), and even someembarrassing admissions now that he'd spent some time outsideacademia and worked a bit in industry: \\"Time, or rather thelack of it, I was starting to learn, is one of the greatestbarriers to quality\\". As my young nieces would say to me,\\"duh!\\"Finally, although written in the late 1990's with thepaperback edition published in 1998, I found the text toalready be a bit dated. You don't realize how quickly thecomputer industry moves until you find a book frozen in timelike this one.My recommendation is to read Norman's other works and theworks he recommends here (Crossing the Chasm, Inside theTornado, and Innovator's Dilemma). Finally, I recommend\\"Machine Beauty\\" by David Gelernter. It provides morepassion and keener insights than this work--and is generallymore fun to read!"},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"The book is a rallying cry for the technology industry, a call to arms for the geek troops. Sure, the writing is like a beta version that the publisher decided to go live with, but the essential concepts and emotion come through loud and clear.Norman builds a solid foundation for his arguments, citing historical cases and several written works. The book was a fun, easy read. When I finished Invisible Computer, I felt the same sort of illumination and clarity that came after reading Alan Cooper's About Face.His vision of ubiquitous information appliances and devices will undoubtedly come true in ways none of us can imagine. But what will become of the PC? Will I have 100 individual devices replacing the 100 software programs I have installed? Hardly. But the book doesn't really address the ongoing need for a general purpose computer.In the end, I would recommend this book to anyone involved in technology. It definitely altered my personal perception of where tech products have come from and where they are headed. Time will tell if his ideas are strong enough to truly help shape the future of software and product development."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"The content strives to support the design of information appliances due to the complexity of the computer coupled with creeping featurism. Human centered design must be used to overcome the increasing complexity.Chapters 7 (Being Analog) and 8 (Why is Everything So Difficult to Use) are reminiscent of Things that Make Us Smart and The Design of Everyday Things also by Norman.Chapters 9 and 10 focus on human centered development by defining it as a process and then describing 'immutable principles' that should apply. Six disciplines of user experience are identified.As I progressed through the book, I had to continually return to the cover and back pages, rereading the title and description to remind myself of what the book is about. Read the two referenced books first!"},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"I have greatly enjoyed and valued some of the author's previous work and ordered multiple copies of &quot;The Invisible Computer&quot; as soon as I heard about it in order to share with my colleagues. After reading the book twice (I was certain I had missed something the first time) I was disappointed in the quality of the arguments presented and lack of substance. The basic tenet - that computer should be submerged into our environment and serve highly specialized functions - cannot be disputed. I found the discussion of substitutable and non-substitutable items interesting and the most useful portion of the text."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"The historical case studies are fascinating -- but the best chapter, in my opinion, has little to do with &quot;information appliances&quot; and much to do with the nature of monopoly systems.I'm educated as an economist and found Norman's descriptions of an infrastructure market (historically the 'natural' monopoly market of power and telephone companies) a compelling read -- and a must read for anyone following the DOJ-MSFT trial.While I agree with his premise that the machines need to become 'simple to use' -- I'm still having trouble seeing lots of individual &quot;appliances.&quot; However, I think the iMac may have captured some of Norman's philosophies."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"This book covers in detail the role technology has pervasively interrupted our lives by intruding into everyday living. His major point is that we should have small, independent devices that do one task and one task well, rather than a general-purpose computer to do many tasks. Personally as a technologist I disagree with his major assumptions and points and found the book and some of it's major themes troubling.An example is the way children interact with computers compared to senior citizens. When a child grows up with something is becomes natural. Most children who have access to a computer at an early stage find it as natural as using a video/DVD player, television or CD player. If the technology is introduced at an early stage it become part of the natural language of the child. Normal disagrees with this, and I think although he is a well researched observer that this is one failing of the book.It wasn't until I reached the last quarter of the book that I could start to agree with his ideas and see the point he was trying to make. That is that some devices work as an appliance. The examples of the TiVo (which we don't have here in Australia) seem best to fit the example. They do one thing, and do it well. Network Computers are the other example, where the complexity of the device is hidden from the user (although he still feels uncomfortable with NC's as they are still &quot;computers&quot;.)Norman's style of writing made me think I had skipped back a few pages every now and then as he often will repeat himself in greater detail over points he thinks are important.If you're a technologist you should read it. But don't take it as gospel. Although Normal is correct in some of his point, you need to use your own experience and environment to understand the points he is trying to make, rather than accepting them carte blanch."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"Don Norman makes his point early on Chapter two about the current situation of computer technologies and what companies have done and should do about it. His examples are sometimes useful, but he didn't need to write 300 pages to explain something other people have said before and he could have reaffirmed in a long article."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"Donald Norman seems to have taken up a position like that of Eric S. Raymond of Open Source, but in usability. This is a business-argument pitch for information appliances. It draws very heavily in its early chapters from the book &quot;Inside the Tornado&quot;, I think by Moore.Inside the Tornado was a book adopted as Marketing Bible by my previous employer, an entrepreneurial venture in the digital imaging industry that may yet sink, but not because of the book. Inside the Tornado is right, but if you've absorbed it, you'll be irritated with the first half of this book.For people who read and appreciated his earlier books and are looking for interesting theoretical or experimental stuff on or near the topic of cognitive science will be disappointed. Don't buy this book for that reason.If you have only a weak grasp of information appliances, what they are, and why they're good, you will want to read this book.I wish someone else wrote this book, though."},{"Title":"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution","review":"Much of what Norman says in &quot;The Invisible Computer&quot; needs to be said, and based on his earlier work, I expected it to be said clearly. Unfortunately, this book appears to be a bunch of lectures put into book form with insufficent effort spent to remove overlaps between chapters.Much of the history is fascinating, particularly the idea of &quot;peripherals&quot; for electric motors around 1910, and the technological/business battles about phonograph standards.Overall an interesting book, but I expected better writing from Norman."},{"Title":"In My Father's Arms: A True Story of Incest (Oxford American's \\"One of the best Southern Books of All Time\\")","review":"I am &quot;Caroline&quot;. I have just finished reading my brother's book. His sensitivity and pain grab your soul. At times I felt I was floating above, reading about someone else, not my brother, not my family. Walt's journey, as told in the book, has been a long and hard one. I am so proud of his courage, He is a gentle, sincere, witty, and intelligent man. Despite his abuse, all the little Walts (some of whom I knew) and Walt have never faltered in character. That is the miracle in all this. No one who reads this book will be untouched. I hope that those readers who have been abused will find this book part of their healing. For those who have not, I hope it will give a clearer understanding of what it feel like to be abused and the lasting effects of it. Knowledge is a powerful tool in any fight. It is my hope that this knowledge will bring help to those who need it, whether it is in the form of laws, therapy, or simple a helping freind."},{"Title":"In My Father's Arms: A True Story of Incest (Oxford American's \\"One of the best Southern Books of All Time\\")","review":"As a psychotherapist that specializes in treating men with a history of sexual abuse and having been an incest victim my self, I have read a great deal of the literature and books on the subject. This is one of the best at really conveying the pain and impact upon a developing mind and body. A fast but powerful read that anyone who really wants to understand or to see that he was not the only one. I will recommend it highly in all of my workshops on abuse and to my clients that are ready to face their pain. I am grateful that Walter shared his pain and most of all his healing. It will help many."},{"Title":"In My Father's Arms: A True Story of Incest (Oxford American's \\"One of the best Southern Books of All Time\\")","review":"While novels reflect the human condition and provide the reader with vicarious experiences, biography brings life itself to the printed page. Autobiography and memoirs are especially intriguing, despite the fact that the author only reveals those aspects of his life that he chooses to share with others. Autobiography and memoirs most often provide a catharsis for the author. The writer relives his experiences by sharing them with his readers. The memoirist enhances the understanding of human psychology through sharing experiences with others, while he views himself simultaneously. deMilly's work, which would not have been published a few decades ago, deals candidly with the subjects of incest and pedophilia. It is no wonder that the author experiences multiple personality syndrome at the hands of a father whose pedophilia extends to his own son. In graphic detail, deMilly spells out the ordeal of a child who knows intrinsically that something terribly wrong is happening - yet he cannot tell it to anyone. With the onset of adolescence, deMilly's problems are compounded by his own emerging sexual preference - which he cannot fathom. Could it be that his homosexuality is attributable to the sexual abuse from his parent? Psychotherapy does not provide satisfactory answers or solutions. deMilly has written a brave memoir, a testament to the strength of the human spirit to survive successfully in society. His work is a positive addition to the expanding discipline of gay and lesbian studies."},{"Title":"In My Father's Arms: A True Story of Incest (Oxford American's \\"One of the best Southern Books of All Time\\")","review":"Taking a powerfully disturbing story and writing about it in a simple, almost poetic, manner is truly profound. Walter De Milly's personal story about child abuse, his relationship with his father, and his own way of dealing with it and understanding it, is a great accomplishment in the art of storytelling. The book deals with the loss of innocence, disturbing childhood memories, and the interaction between Walter and his father, both as a child and adult. One sentence in the book lends dramatic insight into the feelings of the author throughout his ordeal and the aftermath: &quot;The eyes scream what the lips dare not whisper.&quot; One can only imagine how a boy's silence could be ignored when all one had to do was look into his eyes. It is a story well told and strongly felt by any reader."},{"Title":"In My Father's Arms: A True Story of Incest (Oxford American's \\"One of the best Southern Books of All Time\\")","review":"As you can well imagine, this material is rather hard to take. Mercifully the book isn't too long, and by that comment I simply mean that the author is never verbose. He doesn't allow his story to become maudlin. What struck me most was how sympathic the author is with his father. He is able to convey a myriad of conflicting emotions - confusion, anger, love - with a clear and candid style. What his father did to Walter and all those other boys was horrendous and, some would say, unforgivable. What this book did for me was to communicate the ambiguities in his father's character. This was not just a tragedy for Walter, but for his father as well. Don't misunderstand. I'm not condoning his father's actions. No, I'm just saying that one can understand and feel a certain pity for someone obviously afflicted by demons too powerful to fight or conquer. This is a very special book, both sad and optimistic, objective and pointedly direct."},{"Title":"In My Father's Arms: A True Story of Incest (Oxford American's \\"One of the best Southern Books of All Time\\")","review":"\\"The eyes scream what the lips dare not whisper\\" -- these are images of father-son sexual abuse that no one should have to live with in their head and Walter de Milly and other victims should not have to live with alone.Walter de Milly's short memoir remains one of the precious few opportunities to truly experience the utterly horrifying truths of father-son incest in all its sickening complexity and to understand the rank evil lies and trickery of an unstoppable and selfish serial male target pedophile. Deeply disturbing in its beautiful poetic prose; tragically ultimately lacking in the crucial summary naming of this \\"father\\" as exactly the unspeakably sick monster that he was, a pedophile who belonged in prison or a mental institution. In My Father's Arms remains a study in the triumph of evil -- nevermind a pedophile father's \\"mental illness\\" -- enabled in a deeply disturbed \\"loyal, loving and sentimental\\" (and tragically naive) family. You will never forget Walter's Southern story of a dissociative and multiple personality disorder producing \\"good\\" family, and he and other shattered victims of the X-Files insidiousness of father-son incest and male target pedophiles will never be out of your prayers after. The classic People of the Lie by M. Scott Peck and the astute Intimate Worlds by Maggie Scarf are both wise companion reading. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In My Father's Arms: A True Story of Incest (Oxford American's \\"One of the best Southern Books of All Time\\")","review":"Currently trying to understand my own past, De Milly's story is told with such clarity and care, that after I put it down (i read it in one sitting) I felt comforted. De Milly confronts something most of us try to keep quiet, and he does so with grace and compassion. The book, undoubtedly a reflection of the man, is painfully sincere. Thank you Walter De Milly for opening the door for so many of us."},{"Title":"In My Father's Arms: A True Story of Incest (Oxford American's \\"One of the best Southern Books of All Time\\")","review":"Walter de Milly's story isn't necessarily more horrific than other survivors of incest. But the depth of his understanding of what he went through and his prodigious talents as a writer combine to make me feel that this slender volume may simply be the ultimate incest survivor story, that it couldn't possible get any better than this.With his measured, nearly dreamlike voice, deMilly takes us back to the 60's South and to the family bombshelter where the sexual abuse began in earnest, allowing the reader inside the mind and soul of a young boy who is now locked in anguished sexual conflict with his handsome and smiling father. From this chilling opening, the writer unfolds his story of pain and gut determination to survive, creating unforgettable portraits of the people and events around him.One comes away from &quot;In my Father's Arms&quot; with the feeling of having just encountered an instant classic."},{"Title":"In My Father's Arms: A True Story of Incest (Oxford American's \\"One of the best Southern Books of All Time\\")","review":"I heard this writer read when he was a panelist at the Key West Literarty seminar, and was struck by the lyricism of his work.

G. T. Griffith's work, now some 70 years old, remains one of the most in-depth and scholarly studies on the hired soldiers of ancient Greek and Successor State armies available for the average layperson.The states examined include: Philipian and Alexandrian Macedon and Greece; Alexander's immediate successors; post Alexandrian Macedon; post-Alexandrian Greece; the Ptolemaic Kingdom; the Seleucid Empire; Pergamum and Pontus; and the Hellenistic colonies of western Europe and Africa. The origins, history, and numbers of the mercenary units of all of these kingdoms are examined in detail; the information is drawn from a variety of Classical sources. Griffith closes his book with chapters on the origins, recruitment, pay, and maintenance of the mercenaries.The mercenary bands in the Hellenistic world came from all across the world as the Greeks knew it and brought many fighting styles and weapons with them. They included Gaulish cavalrymen - who, despite their barbaric appearance and behavior revolutionized cavalry warfare as the Greeks knew it; Thracians, who were known both for their skillful light cavalry and their ferocious light infantry; hoplites, archers, and light cavalry from fellow Hellenistic and Hellenized states (such as the famous Spartan adventurers who fought during the Punic Wars, and the light cavalrymen of Tarentum in Italy); and assorted Illyrians, Africans, Italians, Spaniards, and Easterners who all found their way into the armies of Alexander the Great and his successors over the course of two centuries.Overall, this is an excellent, irreplaceable source for someone seeking to learn of the significant role played by mercenaries in the Greek and Macedonian armies of the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd Centuries BC, and their organization and national origins."},{"Title":"Senator Haidasz (Polish Edition)","review":"Na przykladzie dzialalnosci pierwszego kanadyjskiego senatora pochodzenia polskiego Stanelya Haidasza, autorka ukazuje przekonujaco i realistycznie wklad Kanadyjczyukow polskeigo pochodzenia w cywilizowanie Kanady, walke o rownouprawnienie mniejszosci etnicznych i rozwoj kanadyjskiej wielokulturowosci.

Along with Hugo Brehme, Augustin Victor Casasola is one of the founders of that tradition. His photographs of the Mexican Revolution have passed into the realm of iconic. Casasola is so esteemed that the Mexican Government purchased all of his negatives and used them as the foundation of a National Photographic Archive.In 1912, Augustin and his brother Miguel started the Casasola Photo Agency. They hired a number of photographers around the country to take pictures of the great events of the day. Along with portraits of the important people of the time, there are many beautiful photographs of revolutionary soldiers, peasants, urban workers and criminals. A quarter of books photographs are of the Revolution. The rest show Mexico as it was entering into the Modern Age. I especially loved his photographs of Mexico's Jazz Age.This is a high quality publication produced by Aperture. It is hardback book and is 13\\" by 9.5\\" in dimension with 155 photographs.

There are a variety of Drafting Textbooks available, but none are incrementally better, let alone drasticaly better."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"I can only speculate that this book is, as was one of the previous editions I've read, used and loved, is bound to provide an exceptional foundational education in the skill of technical (engineering design) drawing/drafting for those with the natural aptitude for freehand drawing. Readers will indeed learn about and develop precision drawing skills--whether drawing with instruments or computer.The true value of this book is in its ability to guide and therefore transform the natural artist's raw talent into that of a professional grade design artist--capable of rendering technical depictions, representations, or designs, at any time, with little effort, and without error. As with learning to walk, this of course takes time, patience, and practice.I have personally witnessed the struggles of many whom, having necessity to complete a course of study based upon this book, were ill-suited by their own admission for the discipline required of the eye, hand, and attention (or mind) as demanded by the capable sketch artist--to say nothing of the trained detail design drafter.If realizing the instructional value of Technical Drawing, 12th edition, seems to come at great pain and effort, the obvious question clearly becomes one of aptitude for drawing. However, while the aptitude for drawing is extremely beneficial, proficiency in technical drawing can still be achieved by sheer tenacity.Technical Drawing, 12th edition, as with previous editions, is therefore highly recommended for the tenacious engineer, designer and drafter. It has stood the test of time as a solid component of engineering design instruction in this nation's premiere academic institutions."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"When originally published, this decades old book had exercises dimensioned in inches only. When the authors decided to include some exercises with metric dimensions, they reused old drawings, converted the measurements from inches to millimeters, rounded off to one decimal place, and DID NOT CHECK FOR ACCURACY. Every chapter has exercises with inaccurately dimensioned drawings.My AutoCAD teacher has taught this class for 27 years. Years ago he wrote the authors with corrections. Nevertheless, each new edition reproduced the same errors. My instructor gave up trying to get the authors to correct their work.As an AutoCAD student, I find the sloppiness of this book appalling. Technical drafting requires a high degree of accuracy. The whole point of drafting is precision, whether you're building a house, designing a chip, or modeling an object. This is like a color theory book published with only three out of the four colors necessary for full color.I paid a premium for the latest edition, the 13th. Don't make the same mistake! Try to find an old edition, published by the original Giesecke, with dimensions in inches only. As my teacher explained in disgust, every new edition costs a lot more for no additional value. The 13th edition has full color photographs, and for that I paid an extra $25 over the 12th. One of my classmates has a 5th edition with only line drawings, no photos, no color, but IT HAS ACCURATE DRAWINGS. It would probably cost a lot less than the $80+ I paid for the 13th edition, too."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"This book is an excellent reference for anyone needing an introduction to or a reference for technical drawing. Most of the content concerning machine component drawings are geared (no pun intended) more toward traditional methods for technical drawings (i.e. compass, ruler and pencil), but the methods given are well suited to modern computer-oriented methods of solid modeling. Engineers in the manufacturing industry will find it especially useful, as it can be a helpful reference for weldment drawings."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"The thing this book does best is demonstrate the inferiority of 2D drafting when compared with 3D modeling. In several parts, the 2D documentation of the parts glosses over some of the more complex implications, and simply leaves it to someone else downstream to figure out. If you try to build some of the example parts in 3D, you see that the dimensions in probably 40% of the parts I worked through simply don't add up.Shouldn't the book at least describe the concept of draft on example parts that are for the most part cast and forged parts? Some of the example parts become extremely difficult if you consider draft.Also there is the combination of some very dated material with some semi-modern entries, especially when covering computer hardware. This kind of thing is almost impossible to cover in a published hardcopy because the computer hardware has gone through two generations between writing and distribution of the book.On the plus side, it does have some nice examples, but this is far from complete if it is being used to prepare college students for jobs in the 2000's."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"The book arrived on time and for that I have no problem, the shipping service worked great. My unhappyness results from the book not being complete. During a recent classroom session we were directed to turn to the appendix, imagine my dismay when the appendix was not in the book. A further review of the book revealed several of the photos were not present and in place of the photo \\"FPO\\" in place of the graphics."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"This book is a good book to learn basic drafting pratices. It is also a good referance book to keep in your bookcase beside your desk."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"If you are a designer or intend to be, this book is perfect for you.My only observation is that the dimensions in the exercises are not too easy to understand, i would make them easier to read."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"It's a very thick manual with everything you can possibly need for technical drawings and cad work. I was very pleased when i found out that it had a very big chunk dedicated to bolts, screws and general hardware."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"I am a CAD designer at a large Billion dollar international company and I use this book constantly. I guess it is a good thing that I use it less and less, but amazing explanations for starters."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":".: edit, June 30 2007 :.New rating: 3 starsI wrote the original review in 2005, after several hours of trying to decipher this book and find misplaced information within it so as to complete a class assignment. Discovering that one of its specific textual errors made my specific task impossible, I wrote the following.If Amazon let me increase my rating, at this point I would, but I maintain that it is unpolished and desperately under-edited..: end edit :.As a freshman engineering major, I have been compelled to use Technical Drawing for a graphics course. This has been a profoundly frustrating experience. It seems that the authors, in their zeal to attain unto the dry, lifeless style characteristic of most professional engineering publications, also unintentionally created a text which is superlatively unclear.I am recurrently astonished at the utter incomprehensibility of entire paragraphs. I will read a section, cynically assert that it communicates nothing, read it over a dozen more times, show it to others who in turn read it a dozen times, only to have my first conclusion affirmed.There are extremely blatant contradictions.Terms are used at the beginning of a chapter and not defined until the end.It speaks voluminously about how critical it is to follow the prescribed techniques, only to devote less-than-the-bare-minimum amount of space to the actual descriptions of those techniques.The review questions are frequently unrelated to the content they are supposed to be reinforcing, or are simply placed in the wrong chapter.This (expensive!) book is a conspicuous example of \\"writing by committee.\\" Technical Drawing may well be a decent-enough reference book - useful if you need a reminder about material you already know - but expect to get angry at it, especially if you're learning the information for the first time."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"This book is loaded with technical information for the dratsman and designer. A must have for anyone who is in the mechanical technology field."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"This is a emotional book about dead and dying loved ones. And in the beginning it evokes strong feeling. But ultimately it is just &quot;same old, same old.&quot; Young wives die in the sea, and their husbands live out their lives alone, tending a lighthouse. The dialogue often seems artificial. And the author is careless with details. For instance, the French do not make bourbon; it's an American drink in spite of its French-sounding name; and the P-38 aircraft was a Lightning, not a Mustang. Which makes me wonder what else he got wrong. This book started well, but in the end, it was a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"This is an exceptional faith-based novel. The story of Uncle Billie (imigrated to the US from Ireland) and his nephew Peter. Their life stories are revealed through the years including their love for their wives. Very inspirational."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"This book is insipid at best, an uninformed offering of vague snippets of history and regional culture. The characters are two-dimensional at best. Mr. Pratt's narrative reminds me of melodramatic juvenile dreams filled with self-aggrandizement, fairy-tale like glory, stereotypical heroism, and plenty of death and dying to wring out every drop of emotion possible. I also found myself very distracted by certain descriptions. Mr. Pratt repeated the ineffective adjective &quot;manly&quot; three times in describing his protagonist's demeanor, appearance, or actions. I couldn't help but wonder what the author intended to drive into readers' minds, or if some fear-of-seeming-effeminate motivated the repetition of such a poor word choice."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"Sappy, predictable and boring. One of the worst books I have read in a while. It reminded me of what my teenage niece use to say: \\"Gag me with a spoon\\". I had to force myself to finish it and I am sorry I bothered."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"This is one of the worst books I've read all year, possibly ever. First of all, the action is poorly blocked. Everything happens abruptly, and the whole plot is so predictable it's offensive. The characters are caricatures--all the Irish people speak with an atrocious brogue (they drop their g's at the end of words faithfully and say &quot;ya&quot; instead of &quot;you&quot; and &quot;ta&quot; instead of &quot;to&quot;). They even WRITE to each other in the brogue. The main characters are also too good to be true; none of them fight with each other, and they're lovey-dovey all of the time. And worst of all, the author's grasp of English seems marginal at best. Many of the sentences aren't particularly coherent. The author also suffers from a terminal case of adjectivitis--every noun is modified to death, and many times the adjectives are repetitive and/or redundant. Routine words are misspelled. But I have to admit, this book is so bad it's almost enjoyable. More often than not I was laughing at the awkwardness and the unintentional (I think) homoeroticism and phallic imagery. For those of you who like reading bad books for camp value, I heartily recommend The Lighthouse Keeper."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"Oddly enough, this book was inspired by the memory of the author's father, who served in the First Armored Division in WWII in North Africa and Italy. Its not really about the First Armored, nor is it about lighthouses. This is a good thing of sorts because Mr. Pratt not only knows nothing about lighthouses, he doesn't even suspect something. &quot;Write about things you know something about if you want to be believable&quot;, and here is where JMP falls down, his complete lack of knowledge about lighthouses, southeastern Massachusetts, ships, WWII, aircraft identification made for a difficult read. Even in fiction, accurate research is essential. Everything about his Port Hope lighthouse smacks common sense in the face: from the year it was allegedly built, the type of illuminant employed, the manning of the station, the organization which administered it, to its sale into &quot;private hands&quot;. All of it nonsensical. His knowledge seems to be derived from paper placemats with bad poetry about lihghthouses printed on them and used in &quot;Ye Olde Chowder Shoppe&quot;. As for the other points, they are too many to mention and to an uninformed reader don't really matter. However, practically every word jarred with things I know to be vastly different. If this were a nonfiction book it would never get past the editting stage. However, it isn't and it did. If one can suspend belief a bit further and get past the insipid Irish brogue that his characters are condemned to speak and write, then there emerges just another emotional rollercoaster ride. Perhaps a better title for this book would be &quot;No Good Deed Goes Unpunished&quot; as everyone who experiences an emotional high is almost instantly thrown into the abyss. Uncle Billie's travails make Job seem like a namby-pamby lightweight. Too much evidence that showed the author was setting his story in very unfamiliar ground ruined what might otherwise have been just a passable, if hopelessly contrived love story of unimaginable loss, and faith. I can't say that I really recommend it, but it is light fluff and shouldn't take you long, so at least you won't waste alot of your time."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"One of the most touching, beautiful books I ever read. I could not put this book down and stayed up most of the night to finish it. Anyone, who wishes to be inspired will buy this book. Also, they will buy it for their family and friends."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"This delightful story of personal and family trials, tribulations and triumphs will appeal to all readers. James Pratt allows his readers to share his characters' lifes as he introduces the reader to Peter, Billie, Anna, Katie and Kathleen. Life is a struggle but it also has its rewards. As I was reading, I felt empathy for the characters. I laughed with them; I cried with them. I experienced their misery and I experienced their joy. Seldom has a book pulled at my heart and emotions as much as &quot;Lighthouse Keeper&quot; did. James Pratt has not just written a wonderful story but also a book that teaches a moral. I'm glad that i read &quot;Lighthouse Keeper&quot;."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"I bought this book simply because some of my online reading buddies have raved about this book. And they were right. Normally, I don't read such sappy stories as it is predictable, but I must confess this book isn't predictable and it's really one of the sweetest books I've read in a long time.The Lighthouse Keeper isn't about just about lighthouses ~~ it is about two men and a woman keeping in touch with their heritage and learning life's tough lessons along the way. Uncle Bill came to Port Hope after a tragedy happened to him and he found renewed hope and joy in life again. Peter, his nephew, comes home from WWII to carry on the tradition that his uncle has started ~~ by keeping the light on for other weary sailers in the world. And Kathleen, Peter's daughter is the silent observer with her own glimpses into her family's heritage. And Pratt combines the two men's stories into one.This novel is not normally what I would choose to read because I am spoiled by lyrical writing and thought-provoking novels ~~ but I am glad that I managed to pick this book up. It is one of the most uplifting novels I have read so far this year. It provides a glimmer of life and hope after tragedies abound in one's life. And it leaves you with a warm glow after the last page is turned.If you like Pratt's &quot;The Last Valentine,&quot; then you will like this book. It's one of the sentimental and uplifting book with a moral ~~ never let life's woes keep you down. It's also a quick read and a thoroughly enjoyable one as well. This is one I would recommend to others!"},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"In recent years, a variety of sentimental books like The Lighhouse Keeper have entranced readers everywhere. And this title is no exception for those who enjoy this genre. The reader is consumed by a wonderful story based around a gentle man's past experiences as a once proud lighthouse keeper to a stoic man now suffering from a terminal illness. In a series of flashbacks we learn of his early tragedy, how he came to be a lighhouse keeper and about his powerful love for a woman who becomes his wife.For those who enjoy windswept beaches and flashbacks to the past, pick up this book.

This work is a great love story.It tells of love between man and woman , yes of course. The loveof members of family bridging generations is the story. Peter O' Banyon 's oral legacy to his daughter Kathleen is touching tothe reader and teaches us lessons in life. The story for hisdaughter, telling of suffering , love , lives , and strength isa family legacy. There are many people who would relish knowingtheir first hand family stories. Having a close family member tell their story and the story of those before them is truly avaluable legacy to be cherished. The setting of the lighthousewas a beautiful image to the theme of the story as it taught theidea of strength and faith as one faced life tragedy. This novelrates very high on the list of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"I bought the book for the beautiful cover, hoping that the inside would be as good as the cover. I was wrong! This book is decent. This book has substance. This book tells a story that could have been a chronicle of a neighbor lighthouse keeper - and I know because I grew up as the daughter of a lighthouse keeper 17 years worth - on an island in Massachusetts. I tell you this: Mr. Pratt has accurately captured the spirit of people who have manned the lighthouses over the years. I could not get over this! I will read and reread this book for years to come. I will give it to my children and say to them, &quot;That's like your grandfather.&quot; Oh read this book, I say for it is love in words - love of the indominable spirit of a people to survive adversity. Thank you, Mr. Pratt for putting the hope of the world on to paper."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"I picked this out for a little distraction from my Rat Pack, Sinatra, mafia obsession I was going through.....and it was perfect. First of all, if you love books the cover art and dust jacket art are exquisite. That's what first caught my eye. Truly a keeper.The story starts as a dying father tells his daughter about the lighthouse and how he came to be the island and how his \\"Uncle Billy\\" came there, and the story of the family. Little did I know that the story would parallel my life.....the man at one point goes to basic training at Fort Knox, KY (I'm there), while at war he meets Joey from NJ (my home).It's love, tragedy, faith, and mostly hope. Pratt never drags you down, he'll leave you with a feeling that you lived with the characters and they were a part of your life. I know I did, I was sorry to see the story end."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"I thought this book was charming and heartwarming, it tells the tale of a family from Ireland, and all the things that they endured.

Now with his second work, The Lighthouse Keeper, he proves that his first book was no fluke. Once again, Mr. Pratt has achieved that which so few fiction writers today seem able or willing to attain: a story that lifts the human spirit; speaks of love, compassion, trial and triumph-and all without the crutch of &quot;Hollywood-style&quot; profanity and sex. As with the lighthouse in his story, the reader is gently drawn into Mr. Pratt's book and encounters an uplifting and unforgettable experience. For all those who enjoy reading words of light, I highly recommend The Lighthouse Keeper. I can't wait for Mr. Pratt's next book!"},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"This is an excellent book!It's a tale of life's lessons....some sweet and some bitter.I had to give this book a 5 star rating because I asked myself.....Am I glad that I read this book?..Emphatic yes!

The Last Valentine may have been his most successful novel, but The Lighthouse Keeper is IMHO the best. It ought to be made into a movie...as long as they are faithful to the character and story line in this book.

But as I got into the book I realized it was more than just a story about a lighthouse keeper, it was a story about all of life's triumphs and tragedies. I was really drawn into the book by Pratt's style to make the characters come alive. We see through the eyes of the narrator that not only do some things in life cause major heartbreak, many things also cause joy. This heartfelt story of a father telling his daughter all about his childhood is one of the best works I've read in a long time.

A story of a man, Billie, who loses everyone in his life, except his nephew Peter. The story tells about their lives; both tragic and hopeful. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. The only disappointment were the WWII entries (there are only a few; those were the pages I skipped towards the end).

It is the tale of a World War Two veteran who has become a lighthouse keeper. In this book, he tells the history of himself, his true love, and of his family through the use of flashbacks. There are some sad moments in the story; however, the overall tone is one of inspiration and uplifting feelings. One of the things that I liked about this book was how it intimated that one does not have to &quot;be religious&quot; in order to &quot;be spiritual.&quot; I also liked the symbolism of the lighthouse portrayed in the story. The ending was especially poignant, and will be sure to bring tears to the eyes of all who read it.

This second book is absolutely great. What a pleasure to find it and read it. Spanning generations, the lighthouse keeper shares his hard-gained experience with his family, as he relives parts of his life. He shows us how to be happy, how to take the high road, and how to love people in spite of themselves....some pretty essential understanding for me and my two teenagers! I wish I had read this years ago...might have helped with my first wife. The whole book is exciting and thrilling as the lighthouse keeper progresses in his life and gains the wisdom of his experiences.

I loved the characters and the writing."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"This was a very enjoyable book with some discrepancies. For instance, in 1949, Kathleen would have been 6 years old, not 4. And, at first, it says that Uncle Billie told Anna about his wife and children. Then, later, it says that Peter wrote her about it in a letter. And, it says that Alexander was Billie's firstborn son, when he actually was the second born son and third born child.It wasn't very clear what happened to Billie's property in Ireland. Did he hire people to care for it? No one in the family ever went back to it. And, I wasn't sure why the author would make Billie, a man in his fifties, out to be an old man.I didn't care for the interactions with General Patton. I've never liked it when an author has a real person interacting with fictional characters, giving the real person actions and words that never happened.But, other than those few things, this is a very good book. It is the story of much heartache, but valiantly overcoming grief and finding a greater purpose."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper","review":"What a beautiful story about love, loss, and what is really important in life!

Jim is a moral compass in a world that knows only shades of gray. What Jim does best is to wrap a story around the principles of character.I must admit that The Lighthouse Keeper is my favorite. It ought to be made into a movie. I understand that Hallmark is producing Jim's \\"The Last Valentine\\" for a TV special in 2010. I hope that they do his book justice and don't mess with the 'heart' of the story. It was perfect as written and it would be refreshing to see Hollywood produce a movie that was as good as the book.

From the cover, which includes a paste of three pages done to scale of an actual love letter from the First Lord Chatham to his future wife, everything is delightful. Phrases, poems, letters of a lifetime, are included in a small book that can only be cherished as close and deep to one's heart as the same love letters it contains.The first half of the book includes suggestions on technique and materials, and the second half offers a large number of love letters for inspiration. There is a third portion, much smaller in number of pages from the other two, which was for me the most difficult to read, simply because I am in love and just could not imagine going through the agony of a break up. This last section contains letters of break-up, admissions of adultery - and subsequent longings for pardons, and letters of good bye as well.

Perhaps the author's prose is hinted at. But the ultimate answers are your's alone. I respect this unbiased presentation of facts. Not having the explanations as being the unquestioned fact.This publication is definately a useful history book. My personal interests have been in the pre- Columbus settlers to the North American continent. Western history books are very biased to European history. Any discovery extending the idea that other peoples visited and lived here before Erikson or Columbus is considered a &quot;major find&quot;. It's only logical that other civilizations were here before the Europeans came. In fact, it's quite proposterous to believe that only the Europeans found this continent. With this mindset, much of the overall *world's* history has been lost.This book was published in 1978 by the respectful &quot;Reader's Digest Association&quot;. During the last 30 years, there have been many discoveries that would only seem to enhance this book's findings. I found this book to be very educational, as well as entertaining.

The contributor of the article on the subject of Atlantis suggests evidence that the real Atlantis may have been the Minoan civilization of Crete destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Santorini. also that the parting of the waves that allowed the Israelites to cross the Red Sea out of Egypt at this time may have been caused by the eruption that destroyed Santorini.But there is also a viable theory that links Atlantis with the island of Heligoland off northwest Germany.This digest follows the search by Spanish explorers in South America for the legendary golden city of Eldorado, and where it may have been and contains several chapters on the civilizations of the Olmecs, Toltecs, Mayas and Aztecs of Mexico and Nazcas and Incas of Peru.Also discussed in this digest is the Land of Sheba (in today's Yemen), whose queen visited and became a consort of King Solomon of Israel, the prehistoric and ancient mysteries of what really took place at Stonehenge, the giants of Easter Island, the massive buildings in Babylon (on which the tower of Babel is based) and the destruction caused by a giant meteor that hit Siberia in 1908."},{"Title":"Wild Season","review":"I read this book many years ago and have read it every Spring since. It never gets stagnant. It moves along with a flow that could be compared to Nature. I recommend that anyone with the least bit of interest in nature and wildlife, should read this book.It will remain in your memories for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Wild Season","review":"I had to read this book as a school assignment (I'm in 7thgrade), and enjoyed it immensely! Mr. Eckert presented the nature ina clear, understandable way without twisting the facts. The story flows well from one animal to the next. Wild Season is definitely one of the best books I've read. I'd recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Wild Season","review":"Though written to more of a junior high reading level, this book has been a favorite of mine for many years. It chronicles the events surrounding a pond in the midwest from the early spring through the fall. It is more of a rambling journey up and down the food chain more than a scientific text. The book can make you realize just how important every part of nature can be in &quot;the big picture&quot;. I highly recommend it to all readers interested in nature."},{"Title":"Wild Season","review":"If I had a list of my top ten favorite reads, something I find impossible to create, as I like so many different books, I would probably put this one right at the top of that list. I first read this one when it was first published around 1967 or 1968. I, like another reviewer, have read this one each spring since that first read. It has become sort of a reading tradition for me. It never seems to get old.The entire work covers the thirty one days of May. It consists of some of the best nature writing I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The author takes a very small geographical area, centered in the woods, around a pond and stream, and examines just what happens during this brief but explosive time of year. Eckert goes from animal to animal, insect to insect, plant to plant, critter to critter and gives us a wonderful story of the life cycle of these creatures and plants during these thirty one days. His writing is quite blunt and to the point. This is not a Disney Bambi book! Nature is revealed in all of its fascinating glory which includes birth, life and very sudden death. The author does a wonderful job of showing us how the death of one creature, gives live to another and on how all life is so closely interwoven. He examines the habits and habitat of each of his subjects and explains how one cannot survive without the other. There are no anthropomorphisms here, and rabbit is a rabbit and a blot fly is a blot fly. Yet, you find yourself pulling for the survival of this creature or that, even a wayward seed of wheat that is sprouting in the forest via bird droppings being deposited there.The book takes us on a day by day journey through surroundings that are all around us but few of us actually take the time to see. It becomes very apparent and vary obvious that there are entire micro-worlds around us, so much is happening, so much living and so much dying...all for a purpose though. The author's writing style is almost flawless. This is one of those rare works that a rather young girl or boy can read and thoroughly enjoy and at the same time can be just as enjoyable to geezers like myself!Now I have always been fascinated by the outdoors and nature, even as a very, very small child. This book though, started me on a life long hobby. As an example; we have lived in our present location in the Missouri Ozarks for almost twenty five years. We live in the woods. My wife and I have left over two acres of our property as it was and is. We do not mow, or disturb it in any way. It is wooded, full of brush, has a small water source and can best be described as a rain forest. I have spent all these years since we began living here, studying this small patch of \\"wilderness.\\" This has not been a casual study, to be quite frank, I get pretty intense about it, observing, writing, drawing, painting, photographing and watching. The neat thing about this is that after all these years; I still keep finding and observing new species and events. Love it!It you have the slightest interest in the world around us, the outdoors, and the life we share this planet with, then this is one of the most enjoyable books you will ever read. Recommend it highly.Don Blankenship"},{"Title":"Wild Season","review":"I read this book as a youngster, and have reread it several times since. I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to explore a world that most don't take the time to notice. The author is most descriptive in explaining the how and why of all that happens in a very interesting ecosystem."},{"Title":"Wild Season","review":"If you know a kid that says that he or she does not like to read much, buy them a copy of this book.I own everything Eckert has written, I believe, and have been a fan for most of my life. His efforts to pass on the stories of Tecumseh, Simon Kenton, the Shawnee people and the Ohio River Valley certainly gained my admiration. Wild Season is one-of-a-kind and if you place an order I recommend that you buy 3 because once you loan it out it is hard to get back. I have probably purchased 30 copies in my lifetime, but currently have none on my shelves. One friend recently told me that it went through his entire household in the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, from the youngest in 5th grade through the 4 siblings, his wife and -sorry- \\"my neighbor has it but I will get it back to you soon.\\" For adults, it can be completed in an evening. I try to re-read it in the spring after purchasing a fishing license, and then again around Labor Day after purchasing my license to hunt.It is not a difficult scientific tome, nor would Disney consider it in a re-telling of their circle of life, although between the spring and the frost it is likely that all of the wild creatures are singing one song or another. This book allows the reader to realize first-hand the point of view of many of God's creatures, one after another, as the sun rises on high and they experience their life's routines. As the writer conveys up front, it is what it is: beautiful, tragic, essential....The beauty is in the description of each animal in tune with the environment; the tragedy in that one living creature is but a meal to another (poor rabbits - making every list); and the essential part really needs little explaining since the lower order animals have yet to form groups that try to disallow the eating of meat in favor of legumes.If you have read this far I offer a simple version: In this book you become one animal until it becomes lunch for another, then you become that animal. I especially enjoyed the Bass, the Bull Snake and the Owl. The Dog makes an appearance as well, as does the most dangerous animal of them all, one that may kill without an allowable or acceptable reason.The thing that I am left to wonder about is that this idea has not been widely copied. I can envision an entire series -the desert, The Red River of Eastern Texas, the coral reef, Eastern Woodlands, etc.In November of this year, I stood high in a tree stand with the string of my bow pulled tight. As I watched, a large doe wondered into the area sniffing at the air for danger. My arrow followed true. She walked a few steps and fell. I climbed down from that tree and walked toward her. Pausing for a minute to give thanks, I'll admit that this book entered my mind. As I bent down to complete my business, I remember hearing Jeff Buckley singing somewhere in my mind:Well I heard there was a secret chordthat David played and it pleased the LordBut you don't really care for music, do you?Well it goes like this:The fourth, the fifth,The minor fall and the major liftThe baffled king composing Halleluja.I am still looking for what that means although I suspect it is an inner question about my place in the circle, about David and Uriah, and about the sometimes deep relationship between love and pain."},{"Title":"Wild Season","review":"As another reviewer did, I first read this book when it was published in 1967. I went on, over the years, to read almost all of Mr Eckert's Winning of America series, but among all his titles, this is the one I keep coming back to.Not just a book to read every year, it's also a book to read with your children when they're old enough, and then to read again with your grandchildren. It's a book about a world that hasn't changed in literally millions of years. Rather than drawing our attention to a small part of the universe, it reminds us of how small OUR place is in the universe.The writing is just right. The number of details Mr Eckert slips in is spot on - any more, it would be a text book. Any less, it would be Bambi again.Don't know when this title went out of print, but any who can should scarf up used copies while they're still out there."},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"It's official! Series heroine Amanda Pepper and her long-time, ex-cop lover, C.K. Mackenzie have finally decided to commit matrimony. On top of moonlighting with C.K. as private investigators to help keep the wolf from the door while C.K. works on his PhD in criminology, now all she has to do is face up to the pressures of a new term at Philly Prep while bracing herself for a close encounter of the first kind with C. K.'s unconventional parents and pacifying her own demanding family anent her as yet up-in-the-air wedding plans. What Amanda really doesn't need when the novel opens is the added complication of overbearing, reluctant mother-in-law-to-be Claire Fairchild who hires them to do a background check of her wealthy son Leo's enigmatic new fiancee, Emmie Cade, and suddenly winds up very dead because someone has decided to call a halt to their investigation by poisoning her. In for a penny...Amanda doggedly tracks down Emmie's past only to discover that it's a checkered one indeed. There seem to be way too many loose ends for her to make sense of until a clever killer makes one simple yet fatal slip. Amanda may teach English, but she's enough of a mathematician to add up the pieces that quickly point to the real culprit in the veritable nick of time in the slam-bang finale to this thoroughly engrossing caper.As always, the ex-teacher in me takes an enormous amount of pleasure in following Amanda into her classroom and watching her in action. Ms. Roberts has crafted a thoroughly literate, utterly delightful puzzler that kept me guessing right up to the climax. This delightful series just keeps getting better and better as new characters arrive on the scene to share Amanda and C.K.'s lives, and I'm really looking forward to spending more time with Gabby and Boy."},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"High school English teacher Amanda Pepper has her hands full with the new school year and planning for her first meeting with her prospective inlaws. Still, a high school teacher planning on getting married needs some extra money and Amanda is flattered to get her first independent job at the private detective agency where she works. The task should be straightforward--do an identity and background check on a woman for her prospective mother-in-law. Except who has been sending those nasty notes to the mother-in-law? And what should Amanda do when the mother-in-law turns up dead?Author Gillan Roberts creates a memorable character in Amanda Pepper. Her worries about the upcoming in-law fest, concern for the teenage ostracism she sees in practice in her school (which blends nicely with her use of THE LORD OF THE FLIES in the classroom), and determination to get to the bottom of the mystery even when she is told that her job is over all make her sympathetic and admirable. Roberts's writing is fast-paced and involves the reader at multiple levels.I especially enjoyed the way that Roberts blended together Amanda's teaching experience, her own mother-in-law concerns, and the themes of ostracism into the mystery. CLAIRE AND PRESENT DANGER is almost a fractile experience--every scene is, in some sense, a microcosm of the entire novel. Maybe it's Roberts's experience as an English teacher that makes her write this way but I certainly found it enjoyable and interesting.CLAIRE AND PRESENT DANGER is not filled with constant sleuthing or hard-core detection. Whole chapters go by that are only connected to the mystery symbolically. And experienced mystery readers are likely to wish for a few more red herrings for suspicion to fall upon. Trust me, neither of these detract from the reading experience."},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"Gillian Roberts takes on a topic of recent nonfiction best-sellers, the long-term effects of teenage cruelty. She finds parallels in her classroom, in the mystery she's hired to solve and in the reading she assigns her teens.This tightly written book deftly weaves together several subplots: Amanda's job at Philly Prep, where she has learned to manage her wimpy headmaster; Amanda's classroom, where she teaches Lord of the Flies with creative, contemporary techniques; Amanda's romance with C.K. Mackenzie and the impending descent of the inlaws; and most important, Amanda's foray into private investigation, under Mackenzie's supervision, which furnishes the main plot driver.Hired to investigate a wealthy man's prospective bride, Emmie, Amanda and C.K. quickly learn the woman has a dark and complex past. Their investigation moves with lightning speed when Amanda coincidentally meets Emmie's old friend, Vicki. When Emmie realizes she has been investigated, she insists there's another side to the story, albeit a rather implausible one.When Amanda finally figures out the real truth, we readers are treated to a delightful scene where we gain a new appreciation for Amanda's future mother-in-law. True, there are some coincidences that move the plot, but the book offers what cozy mystery readers want: a fast read, not too much danger, interesting characters, and some deeper points to ponder.The pace and polish of this book show the author continues to grow and move her skills to the next level. I hope Amanda's marriage doesn't slow her down. And while I enjoyed the classroom scenes, I can't help wishing Amanda would find a more fulfilling, better-paying career. She's too smart to toil in underpaid anonymity under the supervision of an incompetent Headmaster Havemeyer."},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"The appearance of a new Amanda Pepper novel is always welcome. Anthony Award-winning author Gillian Roberts has gently but skillfully evolved her creation over the course of several novels, molding Pepper into a credible character in improbable situations. Pepper is a full-time high school English teacher and part-time private investigator. The latter occupation is performed with her fianc&eacute;, C.K. Mackenzie (the initials, we are informed, don't stand for anything other than C.K.). Amanda and C.K. are fish of separate species out of different ponds. Mackenzie is a Louisiana transplant who runs a private investigation service in Philadelphia, while Pepper is a lifelong resident of the City of Brotherly Love. It is an interesting combination, and when their diverse backgrounds bring them into conflict, it more often than not results in warmth instead of sparks.CLAIRE AND PRESENT DANGER continues the name-game play on words that Roberts initiated a couple of novels back. The Claire in this case is Claire Fairchild, an aristocratic matron in declining health whose son, Leo, is engaged to Emmie Cade. No one knows a thing about Cade --- itself a serious faux breach of Philadelphia society etiquette --- and the worries of the elderly Mrs. Fairchild are compounded when she begins receiving anonymous letters, indicating that her erstwhile daughter-in-law doesn't have just a skeleton in her closet but rather whole graveyards full. Mrs. Fairchild hires Mackenzie's firm to investigate Cade's past. Though the grand dame seems at first to be merely a worrisome busybody, Pepper finds that Cade's past seems to be marked by a sequence of mysterious deaths, name changes, and disappearances.Just when Pepper and Mackenzie are about to present their findings to Mrs. Fairchild, however, the dowager passes, apparently of natural causes. Mackenzie feels that the agency has done its job, and since the client is dead, the matter should come to an end. Pepper, however, is certain that Mrs. Fairchild has been murdered, and was murdered because of the investigation that she initiated. Pepper finds out she is right...and wrong. She has trouble convincing Mackenzie of any intervention until help arrives --- from a most unexpected source.CLAIRE AND PRESENT DANGER is a very well done drawing room mystery novel that sustains reader interest from the first page to the last. Roberts does an excellent job of balancing and conflicting Pepper's personal and both of her professional lives, while keeping the plot of the story memorable and the narrative moving ever so gradually forward. Roberts also manages to draw a parallel between events in the life of one of Pepper's students and Pepper's own past without making it too much of a stretch. An important milestone for Pepper and Mackenzie also occurs in this novel, as does the introduction of at least one character with the potential for significant appearances in the future.CLAIRE AND PRESENT DANGER is ultimately a milestone in the Amanda Pepper series, and is a must-read not only for readers who have been with the series from the beginning, but also for those who are ready to jump on for future journeys.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"Claire and Present Danger is a murder mystery in the Amanda Pepper series. Our heroine is recently engaged to C K McKenzie who has left his position as a homicide detective and is now a student at Penn State. She is also a teacher at a not too prestigious private school and this story takes place during the first days of the new school year. To make ends meet for the student and teacher who are planning their future lives together, Amanda takes on a part-time job helping CK as a Private Investigator. All of these factors swirl about and contribute their own patina to the meat of the story.The story itself revolves around a different relationship. It seems that an attractive widow appeared in Philadelphia's social circles and very quickly ensnared one of the most eligible bachelors in town. A bachelor, who has made a lot of money, no less! The fly in the ointment is that the bachelor's mother - Claire Fairchild - is suspicious of the young widow and gets even more suspicious when anonymous letters appear in her mailbox claiming to know that the young widow has a history of her previous husbands and lovers dying in semi-mysterious situations. Of course, the mother is now worried about what kind of gold digger is spinning her son's head and she call in the Investigative team.Amanda really wants to help work the case for the money and the prestige. Not only will this help her PI career, but it will help distract her from the pressures of meeting her future in-laws for the first time; introducing them to her own parents; getting a handle on the new students that she has; dealing with the ditzy secretary at her school; dealing with the headmaster; dealing with a domineering mother of one of her new students; dealing with the apparent teenage problems of another of her new students; and on and on.Due to all these factors, it really seems to me as if the murder storyline almost interferes with the story of Amanda's complicated life. The author does a nice job of pulling all the threads together towards the end of the book and the conclusion is satisfying because we could see it coming in echoes of the other threads in this story.The writing is light and witty. Introducing major characters like a new mother-in-law can be difficult and the way this book handles it is by creating a very memorable, colorful, and \\"unusual\\" character who will probably play a large part in any future volumes of this series. I mean, how can you resist a lady from the South who claims she is a witch and performs her witchcraft in the Northeast United States on her very first visit?The one thing that marred this story for me somewhat was the excessive self-introspection and thoughts about female to female relationships during the teenage years that this book is chock full of. Maybe because I am of the male persuasion, I had a hard time understanding why Amanda is so full of remorse and has to explain various episodes and behaviors in great detail. I will admit that I found her description of the difference between how men and women deal with telephone conversations to be absolutely hysterical, but the wittiness fails after you realize how much of this book is devoted to this kind of self-analyzing psychotherapy.I will read other Amanda Pepper mysteries because I enjoyed the wit of the author and the setup of the characters (as improbable as they are). I recommend you try this one to see if you like it as well."},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"In case you just tuned in: 30-something Amanda Pepper teaches English at a prep school in Philadelphia. Her live-in fiance, Louisiana native C. K. Mackenzie, recently resigned his position as a homicide cop to pursue a Ph.D. in criminology. Though they've collaborated informally to solve murders in the past, the couple now works part-time after school hours in a private investigation firm. After all, poorly-paid private school teachers and beginning graduate students have to watch their pennies, and additional income helps.Enter Claire Fairchild, an elderly woman who hires them to do a background check on her daughter-in-law-to-be, Emmie Cade. Amanda and C.K. easily uncover a number of sordid details from Emmie's dubious past. When they stop by Claire's condo to drop off the information (and hopefully get paid for their work), they discover that their client has died, presumably from a heart attack. But what really happened? And was Emmie involved? While Amanda wants to sort it all out -- against C.K.'s better judgment -- she's simultaneously bombarded with visits from her future in-laws and her own Florida-based parents, and everyone's pressuring the two to set a wedding date and get on with marriage plans. And it's the first week of school, for heaven's sakes; Amanda's also dealing with adolescent angst and _The Lord of the Flies_ to boot. How many balls can she juggle? We keep turning pages to find out."},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"A lot of the focus of the book was on \\"detective\\" Amanda Popper's engagement to her former homicide detective boyfriend CK Macalester. She is about to meet his parents for the first time and they are about to meet her parents and she's worried -- will his parents approve of her? Will there be conflict between the sets of parents? What will she wear? And then there are classroom scenes (Amanda teaches English at a private school in Philadelphia) -- seemingly irrelevant, although it becomes clear that there is thematic unity between the classroom issues and the mystery that unfolds.Amanda and CK (he's quit his job and is getting a PhD in criminology) have a part-time partnership as private investigators, mostly doing background checks. Amanda is sent to interview someone requesting a background check, just to make sure this is on the up and up. It turns out this woman wants a background check on her future DIL -- which makes Amanda rather upset as she faces the prospect of meeting her own future inlaws. But there is reason to be concerned, so Amanda takes on the job.Much of the book is spent on subplots (classroom scenes and meet-the-inlaws stuff) and yet in the end, you can see how it all fits together and was not as irrelevant as it seemed as you were reading it. This was a fairly masterful accomplishment from a literary viewpoint.I stopped short of giving the book five stars because I nevertheless would have liked a bit more mystery. I plan to read this whole series, though, because I really like Amanda Popper and Gillian Robert's literate, witty style."},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"A light, enjoyable read. I truly like Amanda Pepper.But... I've finally figured out the big flaw in this series, or rather in the relationship between Amanda and CK. Simply put, the man that Amanda intends to marry absolutely REFUSES to take her seriously.Over and over again, she has proven herself to be an intelligent, competent woman. But over and over again, CK just laughs and pats her on the head whenever she states an opinion that HE doesn't agree with. CK is truly the most passive-aggressive character that I have ever &quot;read&quot;.And the advice that Amanda gets from her future mother-in-law, married to the same type of man? &quot;Oh, you'll learn how to manage him.&quot; How quaint.Run, Amanda!"},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"Amanda Pepper is a high school teacher at Philly Prep in Philadelphia. She is also engaged to C. K. Mackenzie, former homicide cop and now studying to get his PhD in criminology and moonlighting as a PI with Ozzie. Amanda is moonlighting working with Mackenzie.Mackenzie sends her to do an interview. She wants to do a good job on this her first solo investigation. Claire Fairchild doesn't make it easy. She wants Amanda to investigate her future daughter-in-law, Emmie. The problem is that Claire gives Amanda sketchy information about Emmie -- she says that this is why she wants her investigated. Amanda meets Emmie and likes her. Amanda is about to meet her future in-law's and is not sure she wants to investigate Emmie. But there are the anonymous letters Mrs. Fairchild received about Emmie.When Amanda begins probing into Emmie's past, she finds there was a fatal accident that may have been murder. There are more questions about accidents in her past. Then things heat up when more things start happening. Is Emmie behind them or a victim herself? Amanda rushes to find the truth before it is too late.I have enjoyed this series for some time. This is the best one yet as I enjoyed Amanda working with Mackenzie on this case. Yes, he still had his doubts and didn't go along with everything Amanda came up with, but I felt they were on the same side most of the time.I also enjoy Amanda's interaction with her high school students. It is fun getting a glimpse into that side of her life in each book, some more than others.I hope Mackenzie will become more involved in the stories in the future now that he is a PI.The introduction of Mackenzie's parents is very interesting. His mother is a real character.I highly recommend this book. It is a great cozy mystery."},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"As always with Amanda Pepper mysteries, there is more going on than a &quot;mere&quot; murder mystery. This time, it's LORD OF THE FLIES and how contemporary its themes remain. It's this little extra that Gillian Roberts always adds, this something that makes the books about more than solving the crime at hand, that I enjoy. Which is not to say that this book isn't fun. CK is as adorable as ever, and while there is less Macavity than I would have liked, there are the charming MacKenzie parents added for entertainment. And Amanda's sharp observations about teaching and Havermeyer are always great. Only one complaint -- I figured out the who in this whodunit LONG before Amanda did. The &quot;why&quot; was pretty clear early on, too. So as much as I enjoyed it, I came away feeling a twinge of disappointment. If only she'd spent as much time on the plot as she did on the atmosphere!"},{"Title":"Claire and Present Danger (An Amanda Pepper Mystery)","review":"After ten novels, Amanda Pepper and former cop C.K. Mackenzie are finally engaged. Both work part time as private detectives while C.K. completes a Ph.D. in criminology and Amanda teaches in a Philadelphia high school. Amanda meets with new client, upper crust Claire Fairchild, who is concerned that her darling son Leo is marrying beneath their station. She demands that the sleuths investigate her future daughter-in-law, Emmie Cade, in case she is not worthy of becoming a Fairchild.C.K. quickly uncovers disturbing information about friends and lovers of Emmie. She is a death magnet as several died under questionable circumstances. As C.K. and Amanda wonder if Emmie is dangerous, their client suddenly dies of what looks like natural causes. A seemingly shocked Emmie asks Amanda to learn why she is the Grim Reaper with several people from her inner circle dead.Though at times the myriad of subplots seem overwhelming and require a scorecard to keep track, several of these serve as contrasting parallel paths that add depth to either the lead couple or the prime theme. The glimpse of the personal lives of the heroes is fun especially when Amanda empathizes with Emmie on the eve of her meeting the mother of C.K. for the first time. Fans of the series will enjoy the latest entry and newcomers will appreciate the banter between C.K. and Amanda. Though difficult to stay focused on whether Emmie is a killing machine, a death attraction magnet, or a victim of something sinister, CLAIRE AND PRESENT DANGER is a fun private investigative tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"At the very end of the book, the author quotes James Madison as carved into the marble of the Library of Congress: \\"...a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.\\" And there it is--Howard Rheingold has documented the next level of the Internet, in which kids typing 60 words a minute with one thumb, \\"swarms\\" of people converging on a geospatial node guided only by their cell phones; virtual \\"CIAs\\" coming together overnight to put together massive (and accurate) analysis with which to take down a corporate or government position that is fradulent--this is the future and it is bright.As I go back through the book picking out highlights, a few of the following serve to capture the deep rich story being told by this book--breakthroughs coming from associations of amateurs rather than industry leaders; computer-mediated trust brokers--collective action driven by reputation; detailed minute-by-minute information about behaviors of entire populations (or any segment thereof); texting as kid privacy from adult hearing; the end of the telephone number as relevant information; the marriage of geospatial and lifestyle/preference information to guide on the street behavior; the perennial problem of \\"free riders\\" and how groups can constrain them; distributed processing versus centralized corporate lawyering; locations with virtual information; shirt labels with their transportation as well as cleaning history (and videos of the sex partners?)--this is just mind-boggling.Finally, the author deserves major credit for putting all this techno-marvel stuff into a deep sociological and cultural context. He carefully considers the major issues of privacy, control, social responsibility, and group behavior. He ends on very positive notes, but also notes that time is running out--we have to understand where all this is going, and begin to change how we invest and how we design everything from our clothing to our cities to our governments.This is an affirming book--the people that pay taxes can still look forward to the day when they might take back control of their government and redirect benefits away from special interests and back toward the commonwealth. Smart mobs, indeed."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"\\"Smart mobs\\" sounds like an oxymoron: after all, what's more impulsive or uncontrolled than a mob? It's typical of Howard Rheingold to throw down such a brightly-colored rhetorical gauntlet, and then to describe how smart mobs are emerging in places as diverse as Tokyo, anti-globalization protests, and virtual communities. Forget images of mobs storming the Bastille, or rioters: smart mobs are a new kind of social organization, made possible by real-time, connective technologies-- cell phones, SMS, pagers, and the Web. If old-fashioned mobs were just giant assemblies of individuals, communications technologies give them nervous systems, the ability to coordinate their actions, to work together, and respond to changes and challenges. Smart mobs are not automatically good or evil. The crowds that brought down Phillipine president Joseph Estrada responded to calls put out via SMS. Anti-globalization protesters have been avidly embraced network technologies. So has Al Qaeda.Some readers will doubtless find familiar ideas in \\"Smart Mobs:\\" for whatever odd reason, 2002 has been The Year of Books About Self-Organizing Social Networks, thanks to writers as different at Steven Johnson (\\"Emergence\\") and Mark Taylor (\\"The Moment of Complexity\\"). But Rheingold is scrupulous and generous about acknowleding his influences; besides, the real value of his book lies in his own fieldwork, and his reflections on what the smart mob phenomenon will mean for business, politics, and social life. Even if your copy of Wolfram is dog-eared and the spine is weak from re-reading (and let's face it, whose isn't), it's still worth following Rheingold through Shibuya, Helsinki, and the Web..."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"In Smart Mobs, Howard Rheingold catalogues the technologies that are converging to change the way we live: mobile communications, social networks, distributed processing and pervasive computing. He does a good job of identifying and explaining these and predicting what it will mean when they get together. This makes for an interesting read, but I'm afraid I still found the book maddening.The worst thing is that a whole half the book is in quotes (or worse, block quotes) from other people and their dissertations or promotional materials. This makes the book lack a singular voice and is very disconcerting. Rheingold not only attributes everything to a fault, he also has the bad habit of explaining where he interviewed each person, what they ate, what funny thing the interviewee had in their office. This makes for ponderous, stalling prose that is painful to read.He also makes the Lessig-inspired mistake of dividing the world into two camps: the government and big media are lumped on one side, and heroic no-property anarchists are placed in the other. He's right to point out that big media's vested interests are a creature of government, but he doesn't get that that really isn't capitalism. A true market is the ultimate form of the mediated cooperation he pines for.If you are a techno-cultural geek, you have to read this book. But take it with a grain of salt, and brace yourself for plenty of minutiae."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Howard Rheingold has impeccable timing. In the mid 80s, aware that personal computers were changing the way we think, he wrote Tools for Thought. In the early 90s, he explored how emerging digital networks were changing social groups in The Virtual Community. Twice now he's put words to important social/digital trends, years before they reach critical mass.So when Rheingold writes a book, it's a good idea to pay attention. His new book, Smart Mobs, takes a hard look at what happens when networked virtual communication goes mobile. And it's a mind-bending read.Consider for a moment that, for a good many years, personal computers sat in offices and living rooms totally disconnected from each other. It seems quaint now, but I remember that time. And if you can remember the sea change that happened in the world when all those computers (and the people behind them) got connected to the internet, you can get some inkling of the change Rheingold predicts is on its way when that same networked computational power goes mobile.We're in for another whirlwind of change in technology, and with it, a change in the way communities come together and express themselves. The book is a captivating exploration of what these new technologies are (think internet-enabled, location-aware mobile phones and PDAs) and how they're already shaping communities around the world.Howard's writing is engaging and deep, and the book is an evenhanded exploration of the new technology, both good and bad.

He is still trying to keep up with the kids and shares their distain for authority. I wonder if Howard ever met an anarchist he didn't like.So, we get to 'run with the pack' for a while. It seems the kids are constructing a society of self-organizing, ad-hoc networks founded on wearable wireless computers, mediated by privacy protection algorithms. Their networks are always on and location aware. The computer is mutating into a universal remote-control wand and the purpose is having fun.If it's not fun, the kids don't do it. The kids find their friends via the internet, keep in touch via cell phones and turn the city into a game board with GPS. It is all amazing and new.What does it mean? It means more \\"wealth, knowledge and civil society\\". There will be new forms of \\"sex, commerce, entertainment and conflict.\\" The danger comes from the adult crowd, the 'big brother' bureaucracies that will want to redirect all this creativity into a straight-jacket.It seems the decision we have to make involves our use of the 'commons', or in modern parlance, the 'internet'. Will we allow the 'free riders' to sink the ship? Will we allow the fence builders to steal our playground?To engage in the debate, Rheingold does a good job of teaching enough chaos theory to make sense of the issues. You might get tired of him invoking the prisoner's dilemma and 'swarm intelligence', but they are interesting ideas. It's a bit thin, but the book is rushing through so many gadgets, inventors and theories that I didn't mind.Personally, I'm not sure there is anything 'new' to be invented about sex and entertainment. The most important exploration is the discovery of self. 'Sex, commerce, entertainment and conflict' may provide ever changing milestones in that journey, but I doubt our experience of despair and wonder are any different than they were 1000 years ago. Would a network of wearable computers help Hamlet make up his mind? Would Hamlet have wanted assistance? Additionally, the reader ought to be aware that the themes elucidated by Rheingold: 1) interconnectedness, 2) compression of time and 3) demassification are commonly used in defense department articles on the 'modern warrior'. It's not all fun and games."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"There are few books that fulfill their promise to describe tomorrow. This is one of them. The &quot;texting tribes&quot; ride the same currents as our &quot;post-literate&quot; age, using technology to augment and implement our human need for communication.Rheingold describes a coming new world where one-to-many communication is focused on &quot;doing&quot; things and where the &quot;one&quot; can be anyone with a mobile phone. Teens and protesters are using texting (a function available on many cell phones) both to &quot;hang&quot; with each other and to coordinate movements.What he has seen in Japan and Finland is becoming commonplace in America's public schools as teenagers flock together in texting &quot;virtual&quot; space more easily than they can in &quot;real&quot; space. Recent reports show that texting is becoming as popular as the telephone -- and it is certainly more stealthy for those seeking to circumvent nosey parents.This is an important book for public libraries.

The sequence of chapters does not provide a progressive build-up of a framework of any sort. Even more, the sequence inside each chapter does not carry the reader towards any defined theme. On one section the author describes teenagers in Finland sending text messages, then he jumps to his meeting with a company executive, then jumps to describing the mobile phone standards in Europe, etc.The only common thread among sections in chapters and among the chapters is the smart mobs theme, obviously, but the author does not break down clearly this central theme into its parts. This makes for a very confusing and bothersome reading."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Smart Mobs are dynamic groups of people who can act together cooperatively even if they are complete strangers. Their communication is facilitated by a new wave of wireless, mobile, portable computing devices. Howard Rheingold provokes us to foresee a future where people spontaneously interact and exchange ideas in a manner that will transform how we work, play, trade, govern, and create.Rheingold cogently explores examples of what he refers to as a \\"social tsunami\\". Special attention is given to mobile telephones which are transforming how youth exercise their social power. Teenage \\"thumb tribes\\" have developed new ways of communicating using SMS text messaging in Tokyo and Helsinki. Spontaneous groups coordinated by SMS messages had a more serious impact in the Philippines in January of 2001 when groups of protestors responding to SMS messages managed to play a primary role in overthrowing then President Joseph Estrada.Much attention is also given to networked PC's and how supercomputers, open source software and the mobile internet are facilitating social networking. Rheingold adroitly explains how these tools can be both weapons of social control and resistance.Perhaps the most provocative ideas revolve around the fact that we now have access to information about each other as never before. He explores privacy and trust issues and appears particularly concerned with surveillance web-sites, software and the electronic \\"bread crumb\\" trails that we are unaware we are leaving.Overall, Rheingold expertly weaves his experiences, interviews with experts and solid research to elucidate his interest in how human behavior will change as a result of the latest technological advances. He convincingly argues that our changing notion of community needs to be used in a beneficial manner to create a more humane and sustainable world.This book is a must read for academics, corporate types and anyone interested in how technology can promote grassroots social change."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Howard Rheingold has excellent credentials to write this book through his long involvement at Wired magazine. He blends an effervescent interest in smart new gadgetry (point your phone-cam at some foreign signwriting and have it translated into your own language) with a thirsty desire to understand what it means to our society. To hunt down the story he structures the narrative in a breathtaking first-person style that takes us from Shibuya Station in Tokyo to the wireless capital of the world, Helsinki, and then back across the Atlantic to Bell Laboratories - and beyond.Clearly our society has been undergoing massive underlying change since the advent of the internet and mobile phones - but few writers have really grappled with the wider implications. If, as McLuhan said, the Medium is the Message then wireless technology provides a medium that totally re-engineers the way people can interact with their physical and social environment.Rheingold calls on dramatic examples of how individuals, wireless and mobile, can outwit the top down forces of the establishment - for example in the World Trade protests at Seattle, and political protests in the Philippines. He uses these as a metaphor for how the top-down 20th Century style organisations, political, industrial or media are increasingly out of step in the mobile age. Rheingold looks to young urban people - urban tribes if you like - as a bellwether to tomorrow's society.I loved this book. The writing is sharp, the insights deep and Rheingold's ability to take us into the labs of tomorrow a real treat. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Mr. Rheingold is a well know scientist that seems to write a book every two years on the next generation of technology.

Cooperation, Howard Rheingold argues, was the founding Internet weltanschauung; now, aided by tiny computers, sensors and transmitters embedded in the environment, mobile ad-hoc social networks might make for more profound social change. These are \\"smart mobs\\" - groups who use technology to coordinate their actions in unpredicted ways. American college students, Tokyo teenagers, Al Quaeda and WTO protestors use mobile phones and peer to peer file sharing today, and tomorrow will likely use geospatial bulletin boards, mesh networks and reputation systems. Smart Mobs tingles with provocative prescience."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"The cool thing about \\"Smart Mobs\\" is that it's really happening. People are behaving in \\"linked\\" ways that transcend the obvious demographic definitions of groups we typically think of as \\"behaving in unison.\\" As technology and the infrastructure arriving with it enable increasingly extemporaneous networks between people, marketers are similarly challenged to reach outside of traditional mass channels. Howard Rheingold brings us a really nice set of actual examples--combined with his own unique insights--that provide the basis for next-generation communications strategies as what had been cohesive groups fragment into a foam of indivduals united (only) by this moments current interest and the task at hand. For marketers, it's a great read...and a big clue. Anyway, I liked it."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"How many of you recall that EF Hutton commercial that started off by saying, &quot;When EF Hutton talks, people listen&quot;. The same thought can be applied to Howard Rheingold.Rheingold is veteran technology watcher and well-publised futurist. He has identified yet another transformative technology. In 'Smart Mobs' he describes in vivid detail how large, geographically dispersed groups connected only by thin threads of communications techology, such as text messaging, e-mail, cell phones, two-way pagers, and web sites, can draw together in the blink of an eye, groups of people together for a collective cause.From various parts of the world, Rheingold, has gathered stories about engineers and inventors of all sorts, working feverishly to create ever-smaller and more powerful devices that contribute to this new paradigm.In this book,Rheingold points out examples of Smart Mobs such as the swarms of demonstrators who used mobile phones, Web sites, laptops and handheld computers to coordinate their protests against the World Trade Organization in November of 1999.Rheingold shows a concern of smart mobs other than describing the weath of new communications technology that is available and coming. He is also concerned about the social, political, economic, environmental and even genetic consequences of the ever-expanding and more intrusive plethora of multidirectional communications technology.This book is a must read."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"When this book was published, I was in 8th grade and 100mb zip drives were the hottest technology to enter my school. This book was written Facebook was invented, before wikipedia became important, and while 'wireless internet' was still a geek fantasy. Upon seeing the publication date, I wondered how much weight this book could hold considering the rapid recent advances.So after reading the wonderfully concise book of 210 pages I was amazed to find that Rheingold had seemed to have taken the best elements fromNeuromancer,The World Is Flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century, and computing history to make a manifesto for the social implications of internet and mobile technology. Proof of this book's prescience and relevance exist in the fact that I am publishing this review to an open forum, without monetary gain on multiple online social networks. Proof of this book's prescience is that YOU are reading this review. All of these things were theories or isolated subcultures when he wrote his book, now they are the reality.This book provides an excellent theoretical basis for the rise of social networks and why they are becoming powerful. From the tragedy of the commons to game theory Rheingold ties in many fields without becoming too basic or general. The only flaws that I found in the book seem unavoidable. The chapter on 802.11b seems moot because, well, it happened. Many of his ideas on ubiquitous computing sound like a list of soundbites from graduate CS students at my university. But despite these flaws, and despite its age, this book is still better than some of its modern companions at explaining how technology is changing our society."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Rheingold believes that \\"what we understand about the future of smart mobs, and how we talk about that future, holds the power to influence that future.\\" That's why he wrote Smart Mobs and that's why you should read it. Rheingold's gone round the world, on the street as well as and in cyberspace, and has discovered that the future - one aspect of it, at any rate - is happening perhaps a little more rapidly overseas than it is in his native turf. If you haven't been there, then Rheingold has experience and intuitions that you don't have - I know I don't.Even as he reports from the field, Rheingold also offers the insights of sociologists, economists, legal experts, and others, thus allowing us to glimpse general patterns of social organization and interaction at work. He detects an emerging interest in cooperation, as though the intelligentsia are slowly beginning to awaken from their core conception of humans as individualistic utility maximizers. From eye contact to tit-for-tat, from swarms to open spectrum, from ritual to wearable computers, Rheingold weaves a dazzling fabric of ideas, observations, warnings, and opportunities. You owe it to your children and grandchildren to read this book."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Reading this book reminds me of the line attributed to William Gibson: \\"The future is here. It's just not widely distributed yet.\\"Rheingold sees elements that will be important in the future, and he tries to forecast what will happen when they become widely distributed. The result is an important book.Probably the central part of the future will be an explosion in wireless communication. This will lower the cost of Internet access in countries that never developed a solid wired infrastructure. It will enable people to remain constantly aware of one another's presence and location, using instant-messaging-type services. It will make possible what Rheingold calls \\"sentient things,\\" which are physical objects that sense and response to people, because both the objects and the people are on the universal wireless network.Rheingold looks past the technology to the social implications of the wireless age. For example, in a world where we have the potential to be bombarded with messages, he believes that the only way to achieve order rather than chaos is through reputation systems. Something like my Amazon reviewer's rating will matter more and more in the smartmobs world.There is much here to chew on. Rheingold deserves praise for helping to distribute the future."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Rheingold is very bright and full of profound insight.

Anyone-to-anyone communication is already changing our world view and according to the research he cites ad nauseum, young folks growing up in this Webbed world are changing fastest of all.Rheingold would have immensely profited from the expertise of a thoughtful editor."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Smart Mobs is a book about ubiquitous wireless communication. A world where your clothing, your walls, your vehicle, your streets, your dust are made of materials in which wireless devices are embedded and always on.

And as each wireless device enters our world it increments the number of potential links exponentially.Let Howard Rheingold reveal the mob world that will be ever there and ever on."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"The book consists largely of interviews with creative thinkers in the field of computer-enabled communication and on-site impressions of places where mobile communications have created \\"smart mobs\\". If only for these interviews and Rheingold's thoughtful reporting of his impressions, the book is a very useful and thought-provoking one. But beyond that, Rheingold is probably right that the question of competition vs. cooperation is precisely the central dilemma of civilization, and it is, as many have observed, a particularly acute question in the early twenty-first century as nation-states from China to the U.S. struggle to define the line between unlimited access and the needs of national security.It is hard to sum up the total impact or value of a book that is at once discursive in that it examines so many aspects of the social issue of the \\"age of instant access\\", and rather narrowly focused in that it keeps returning to the central question of competition vs. cooperation. For me, the value of a book lies in whether or not it makes me think about new issues and to begin to investigate them. I think that Smart Mobs is such a book.For a full review see Interface, Volume 3, Issue 1."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Took a class of \\"Self-organization in Science, Technology, and Society\\" (at a highly respected research institution) where this was used as a main reference.

The book is quite engaging and thought provoking. Yet, it was good for when it was written.

To cut the long story short, I got bored after the first few chapters."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Smart Mobs stands at the intersection of great social science and science fiction. Rheingold's weaving together of seemingly dispirate strains of inquiry makes for compelling reading. Of these threads, most interesting to me are his ruminations on how technology enables the emergence of new social forms, and hence new varieties of identity. Rheingold takes in stride individuals that wear computers that filter (mediate) their interaction with the world. While I find intriguing the concept of pervasive any-time any-place network access, my vision encompasses technologies that are less invasive; that are part of the woodwork or buried within the supporting structure rather than windows through which our world is mediated. I'm not sure that Rheingold would disagree with that. Never-the-less, this is a great read for anyone interested in the social consequences of the connectivity technologies that are rapidly diffusing through our societies."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"As one who needed a basic primer on various areas of technology--past, present, and future--and their implications for the human being, I found &quot;Smart Mobs&quot; to be both helpful and conversational. Rheingold's journalistic style kept the topics easy to understand, interesting to read, and fairly light hearted in spite of some rather daunting conclusions that one could draw from his research. As well, those who want to delve further into the various topics discussed will find his endnotes quite helpful--annotated are works from a number of key figures who a) are making, or have made, breakthroughs in technology, or b) provided insightful critiques on those breakthroughs. I found that engaging in &quot;Smart Mobs&quot; opened the door to further research and understanding of this seemingly complex and very progressive area of study."},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"My attraction to SMART MOBS was the language that enables swarms to emerge from Science and appear in our daily lives. The theories aren't really new and neither are the observations, which never break any new ground. It is a masterful collection of sources capable of leading you on a merry journey. Yet someone not already partially aware may find it tedious, for within a descriptive prose it fails to uncover real dreams for tomorrow. As a result it won't create many inspiring new options for you...This book is exploratory not prescriptive not asking questions that CEO's marketers and strategists should ask about a SMART MOB world. If you send it to your CEO friend for Christmas make sure you make it your job to get them thinking constructively beyond this book. Sell them a Learning Journey; collapse Howard's travels over two years into two days. Then help them create. Here there is not enough to move the majority of businesses forward. If you see possible impacts on your business the challenge will be to create a dream and road map for action. For CEO's it fails to conceptualize how smart mobs will affect the business model. Or how will money be made in a world like this? What does marketing mean in a smart mob world?FIVE STARS for those that need SMART MOBS as a wake-up call, and realize that the book is out of date. I believe much is inevitable. Hidden within are market-changing concepts and ideas. Believe and you will ultimately need to rethink everything regardless of market and industry, from Inventory to customer complaints.Smart Mobs covers a lot of ground. The changes are global and local. The challenge is also personal. I wish HR had spelled it out more boldly. You will need to take a stand. A revolution is in the making. It will tip the whole system. Think about your position on intellectual property, digital exchanges. How should wireless spectrum be regulated? What is the future of publishing? Are you managing your reputation? Where do you place your bets and investments? How should learning and education change? Will this affect my government? Etc.If you have views on these things and need examples, use this book. Then share your motivation to learn and swarm seeking answers collaboratively in real-time. For the next hit about SMART MOBS will emerge collectively perhaps bloggedly with many faces, contributing. Despite today's uncertainty the web is already a better place to learn, experiment and prototype these concepts. There are daily blogs that provide more up to date perspectives. The supportive SMART MOBS blog has a nice focus and a theme to clip around. Absorb the postings and you will probably be on your way.My largest learning's in the book linked to Steve Mann and CYBORG. Again this is not news. Mann has been a roving CYBORG for twenty years. The link that Howard makes bringing Cyborgs into this picture was interesting to me. His quoting of Mann was worth reading the book for: \\"The smart room is a retrograde concept that empowers the structure over the individual, imbuing our houses, streets and public spaces with the right to constantly observe and monitor us for the purported benefit of ensuring we are never uncomfortable or forced to get up from the armchair to switch on a lamp...\\" Naturally Mann's research is working to foster independence using wearable computers. Bring it back to today. Now look at networking your house. Will you wire it? Or simply go wireless? Wireless is already winning on cost!For those that know how technologies trickle down and where to look, Smart Mobs gives great examples out of DARPA. (Mesh networks and more.) When our kids and soldiers operate this way. Take notice. The book may also help you understand quickly why the regulations around wireless and selling bandwidth have been a mistake. We now have incumbents with enormous investments trying to protect and maintain a system that is no longer effective. Change the way Wireless is regulated or simply watch it overturned by consumers.I'd like a stronger conclusion. I really believe Howard is on the side of decentralization, collaborative communities, protecting the innovation commons and thinking about governing in a world of SMART MOBS. SMART MOBS is simply another name for communities of consumers (COMSUMERS) empowered and collaborating to accelerate the use of their information assets. Are costs for moving to unbound systems rapidly dropping? SMART MONEY will be on invisibly aggregating these new markets while consumers stay in control.There is a thread. Not one I found blaring out in the book. SMART MOBS accelerate learning. Whether you are part of a music sharing community, fighting on a battlefield, a human cyborg, all are part of collaborative SMART MOBS prototyping real-time solutions. They are more open source by nature. The thread is there. ...hot lists and the emergent subscription communities around blogging for example.Despite underscoring SMART MOBS as the next social revolution there is little clarity on when the revolution will tip. What is the tipping point? As examples from Philippines to Seattle show, systems can tip in just a few days. There is an inherent suggestion that systems around wireless may tip and become P2P based. I remember writing such a Scenario a couple of years ago. As we wrote it CYBIKO was announced (another example in the book) which added credibility to our scenario. That stimulated a financial discussion (the book lacks any financial insight about tipping points). How close is it? That will be for you the reader to guesstimate.As a business you cannot afford to wait!"},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"Having read the first book by Howard, and finding this on his site, we had to have it, since an important part of our online cybersyndicated toungue-in-cheek Political CALMintery radio prgram, Politics au Naturel, depends on cyber distribution.The clarity is amazing, the premise of what might be is astounding, and we're going to put it in practice for the upcoming election thriller season.[...]"},{"Title":"Smart Mobs : The Next Social Revolution: Transforming Cultures and Communities in the Age of Instant Access","review":"This is a very thought-provoking book and the evidence is all around us, from teens IM'ing each other to the current craze of \\"random mobs\\" where people use their cell phones to gather at some destination and do something silly, as was recently happening in New York City and elsewhere.

S. MercerThe \`Foreword' by William H, Kittrell gives a history of this censored book. Although Mercer escaped alive, the shop that printed it went out of business after its owner was jailed (p.xvi). Asa Mercer once sat on the lap of Congressman Abe Lincoln, graduated from Franklin University, and migrated to the Northwest Territory. He became the first president of the University of Washington. In 1864 he aided the migration of marriageable young women from Lowell Massachusetts (p.xxi). Mercer encouraged immigration to Washington Territory. Mercer later lived in Oregon and Texas, then moved to Wyoming in 1883. \\"Banditti\\" is a now obscure term for highwaymen who robbed travelers; the cattle barons of Wyoming and their imported Texas mercenaries would be better called terrorists today. The corporate owners and their hired killers sought to exterminate the homesteaders and small ranchers of Wyoming to steal their property. The cattle barons owned the governor and senators, who passed laws to give the cattlemen incredible power: they could seize and sell the cattle of anyone they called a \\"rustler\\". \\"Rustler\\" defines a person who is \\"energetic, smart, and successful\\"; a \\"go-getter\\". The cattle barons only wanted the lands that were next to their lands.The \`Introductory' by Mercer explains how the pasturage of this area was discovered by accident (pp.5-6). Corporations were formed to raise cattle. The boom was followed by a bust after the long winter of 1886-1887. Pages 7 to 9 explain the economics behind this industry. Mismanagement caused declining dividends; they sought a scapegoat. Mercer wonders if the losses were caused by local management diverting stock and pocketing the money. Mercer points out there is less stealing and lawlessness in the West than back East base on the rate of the prison population (p.10). [Does this relate to the rate of owner_operators against wage-earners?] Mercer acknowledges that fencing the range adversely affected the free movement of cattle (p.13). [Should settlements of people be discouraged to benefit the cattle barons?]The first victims of the cattle barons were Jim Averill and Ella Watson in July 1889. Next came the killing of Waggoner in June 1891 (leaving a wife and two small children). An attack on Nate Champion failed in November 1891 (pp.22-23). Next they ambushed and killed Orley Jones and J. A. Tisdale (pp.24-25). The cattle barons then decided to send in a small army of hired gunmen and organized an invasion (Chapter III). A propaganda campaign published stories in Eastern newspapers. The laws of Wyoming made it illegal to hire a body of gunmen without legal authorization (p.42). The cattle barons planned to kill the Sheriff and deputies, some of the County Commissioners, then run amok to get rid of the homesteaders and small ranchers (pp.47-48).The invasion of Wyoming began in April 1892. They took a detour to attack the KC ranch and kill Ray and Nate Champion. They succeeded this time, but travelers now carried a warning to Buffalo. Sheriff Angus formed a posse of 200 armed citizens to come after the invaders (Chapter VI). The invaders then retreated to the TA ranch for their defense. Sheriff Angus discovered the murders of Champion and Ray. After two days of siege the cavalry from Fort McKinney showed up and captured the cattlemen's gang. Colonel Van Horn refused to surrender these criminals for trial! The Acting Governor prevented Sheriff Angus from arresting these killers (Chapter IX).Chapter X tells how two witnesses to the murder were taken out of state. Would the cattle barons kill one of their employees to advance their agenda (Chapter XI)? One Presidential lie is on pages 117-118. The cattle barons tried to muzzle the press (Chapter XII). When the trial began in Jan 1893, the judge ordered the charges dismissed (Chapter XIV)! The farce was over, but it created opposition to corporation rule in the future. Chapter XVI explains why no cattle were missing from the Western Union Beef Company -they had a surplus! Mercer ends by telling of the advantages of Wyoming: coal, iron, oil (Chapter XVII). [This can explain why corporations sought to prevent people from the \\"right to keep and bear arms\\". Today's Supreme Court could have taken away their lands by \\"eminent domain\\"!]James D. Horan's \\"Desperate Men\\" has a biased account of this event in Chapter 21. He doesn't explain why some volunteers quit after they learned the purpose of the attack on Johnson County. Some say the story \\"Shane\\" was the last Hollywood western to portray this corporate attack on the citizens of Johnson County."},{"Title":"The Real Truth About Teens and Sex : From Hooking Up to Friends with Benefits -- What Teens Are Thinking, Doing, andTalking About, and How to Help Them Make Smart Choices","review":"I loved this book and wish all parents would read it! Ms. Weill had my complete attention when she started out by saying that \\"teens nationwide are suffering from a lack of honest communication from their parents and other pivotal adults around them...\\" She later says that it is dangerous to rely on schools to provide sex education and that parents have to be the primary educators of their children. She is confident that despite the horrified looks on their faces when we bring it up, teens want to talk about sexuality with adults they trust - and that they want adults to know what is going on. Teens are vulnerable emotionally and physically and susceptible to regret as their feelings emerge after sex. We can help them avoid those situations in which \\"sex just happens\\" and the consequences that follow.Far from inducing fear, Ms. Weill constantly reassures parents that research shows talking to kids about sexuality does not make them have sex earlier and that there are positive trends reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggesting youth are having less intercourse as well as using more contraception, and that there was 30% less teen pregnancy between 1994 and 2004. She is matter of fact about the risks of the Internet, early sex, pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, but never lets parents off the hook. The more parents know, the better equipped they will be to help their teens avoid \\"sexual risks\\" including sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.Ms. Weill reminds parents throughout this book that we [adults] have the power to have an enormous influence on the behavior of our teens and although I cannot endorse her statement that \\"teens should be pulling away from adults\\" I do agree that they need to take on more responsibility and that they still need our supervision and guidance. Teens need to know that 66% of teens and 81% of 12 - 14 year olds regret their first sexual experience and parents and teens need to know that teens have the knowledge and strength to \\"make good decisions.\\"Parents being in denial will not help and it will undermine our relationships and make them superficial. I appreciate the fact that Ms. Weill respects youth and is very clear that sifting through their emails or reading a diary or blog is a major invasion of privacy and it will take a long time to rebuild the trust and credibility lost by the action. There is no substitute for putting the time into developing a strong and positive relationship with our child!Parents need to be able to talk honestly with their children about sexual rights, pleasure, and risk. Teens need to know that it feels good to be excited, but that sexuality should be protected, consensual and planned with someone they love to feel great. For parents who do not think they can talk easily with their kids, Ms. Weill includes resources and wonderful examples throughout the book and there is even a discussion about developing a safety plan with your teen.My favorite quote from this book is \\"good parenting is always inconvenient for the parent.\\""},{"Title":"The Real Truth About Teens and Sex : From Hooking Up to Friends with Benefits -- What Teens Are Thinking, Doing, andTalking About, and How to Help Them Make Smart Choices","review":"This book explains it all in regards to what is going on with our children today.

It reads as though the author is still writing one of her teen advice columns when her audience is primarily adults. The tone of this book very condescending. Weill constantly repeats her qualifications to write this book (\\"teens trust me,\\" \\"I have spoken to 1000s of teens in my career\\"); while those qualifications are good, the constant mentioning of them gets old and can be insulting to the reader.The statstics sprinkled throughout the book were interesting and I wish more of the text was spent talking about their implications. What does it mean that X percent of 13 year olds have had sex? Have had 4 or more partners? The text was quite separated from the survey results and was too simplistic and not very insightful. I understand that this book was supposed to be accessible, but I found it so basic that it offered very little that was new or even interesting.Her quotes from teens were also suspect to me. If she got responses from 1000s of teens about their sex lives and beliefs, why these quotes? They seem to come from the same mold and offer little diversity. Basically, they all say that a person should wait for sex or talk about negative experiences with sex. Where are the stories of teens who have healthy sexual experiences? I am not necessarily advocating teen sex, but I do believe that people should be exposed to the idea that some teens do like to have sex and have it responsibly.If you have never read anything about teen sex before, this might be useful.

We don't need a thousand more studies to indicate that telling the truth is better than preaching.Unfortunately, the truth is not always obvious in this book. The study carried out by the author is not particularly well designed and the sample is not much. Weill has some helpful observations about discussions with parents, but most of her book is not relevant to today's teenagers, who are active sexually. She is biased against friends-with-benefits, but this is actually a more balanced choice than possessive dating or hooking up for many."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"Over the years I have read and re-read this 1932 novel by Charles Williams many times - it continues to fascinate me, exerts a peculiar hold upon my mind and provides unfailing stimulus for thought and contemplation (it is undoubtedly the most readable and entertaining of his works of fiction). 'The Greater Trumps' is a very strange sort of novel, a mystical thriller if you like, featuring the prototypal deck of Tarot cards which has by odd chance fallen into the hands of the prosaic and unimaginative Mr.Coninsgby. His daughter Nancy is being wooed by a young lawyer of Gypsy descent, Henry Lee and when he sees the deck the spiritual drama begins and the Coningsby's are invited to spend Christmas at the lonely house of Henry Lee's grandfather Aaron Lee who guards the secret inheritance of the Romanies and has long sought the innermost mysteries of the Tarot. A conspiracy to ruthlessly obtain the Tarots at all costs is afoot and here we have a central theme of Charles Williams' novels - the intended profaning of a sacred Mystery by those who would abuse it for ego-aggrandizement and the quest for personal power. In 'The Greater Trumps' the classic tarot figure of 'The Falling Tower' is the symbol of the fate which invariably engulfs those who attempt to lay hold of the Holy Mysteries of Magic to satisfy the all-too-egoic thirst for power and ascendancy and this timeless message is as pertinent as ever in an age where debased occultism of questionable motivation is all too prevalent. Henry and Aaron Lee's dark quest to wrest the Tarots from Mr Coningsby and murder him unwittingly unleashes primal powers which are entirely beyond their ability to control - for the archetypal potencies of the Divine World cannot be controlled or manipulated by the unworthy for their own ends and the attempt to do so cannot be made with impunity: thus the novel builds up to a compelling denouement which is also a transfiguring and mystical meditation upon the all-prevailing power of pure love...The characterization in this novel is quite superb, from the romantic high spirits of Nancy, the faustian ambition of Henry Lee and the sublime equanimity of Aunt Sybil who amongst all the characters has truly attained to a high degree of spiritual freedom and thus plays a pivotal role: Sybil's selfless and calm wisdom contrasts strikingly with the hubristic greed of the magical 'adepts'. The dialogue is period 1930's and thus possess a charm all of it's own and the plot is superbly realised.But skilfully woven through this brilliant and cautionary tale of young love, unlawful lust for power, satires on conventional mindedness and supernatural high jinks is an extended esoteric meditation upon the emblems of the Tarot as timeless Mysteries of Power, Images, Divine Ideas, Virtues and eternal Platonic Forms which is uniquely insightful, penetrating and unparalleled in its profundity. The suggestive concepts concerning Tarot which Williams imparts throughout are truly extraordinary. This beautifully-written novel conveys an exciting narrative which is at the same time a penetrating moral exploration of man's spiritual motivations and inner relation to the sacred. I consider 'The Greater Trumps' to be Charles Williams' little-known fictional masterpiece, an occult novel of rare brilliance."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"It takes but a short time to realize that we are in an era when 'daily work' is not true for a large number of people of substance. Yet there are other things to fill their time. An estate shall be settled soon by the inclusion of a number of sets of antique tarot cards - something that a number of the protaginists have never heard of - others wonder if their 'gypsy feelings' towards same are no longer proper in their situation; and a father of one, who they shall visit, feels quite certain that the Original Deck MUST be among these. If so, how can it go to the museum, only to be catalogued and placed in some drawer. To me, there is a warm engulfing into the story - there is a feeling of tension and hope as certain characters begin, by recognizing more and more of all the symbols and interrelations that these make up, in quite a spiritual way, the Dance of Life and our/their place within. Their sharing is real. I freely say now that I have not totally finished this book. This is a special author. My copy is a first edition {1950}. The Saturday Review stated &quot;Reading Charles Williams is an unforgettable experience.&quot; The NY Times stated &quot;It is satire, rommance, thriller, morality, and glimpses of eternity all rolled into one.&quot; Whew.I gave this book a four because it does take a little 'work' to get in to. I feel clearly that Mr Williams was a deeply spiritual man. This book's language is to the reader as though we are entering the late 19th century - a different place for us to be going to. But, quite worth the effort. Thank you for your time. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"How does one combine tarot cards, gypsies, Christianity and the most mundane creatures on God's earth -- the English! -- into a rich, complex story, that grabs the imagination? Beats me, or I'd write it myself! Charles Williams, an acquaintance of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, takes the mystic Christian tradition and the most ordinary of events of modern life and fuses them together. This fusion makes the modern reader feel almost cross-eyed while reading this &quot;spiritual thriller&quot;. I find much of his writing very heavy to slog through, but this is the most accessible of his novellas. It gives a unique, yet orthodox view of Christianity. Reminds me of Charles de Lint, for some reason."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"This excerpt is taken from:\\"Charles WIlliams - Poet Of Theology\\" pp. 76-78by Glen CavalieroJust as heat is the pervading element in \\"The Place of the Lion\\", so the pervading element of \\"The Greater Trumps is cold\\". Much of the action takes place in an isolated country house during a raging snowstorm on Christmas Day, a microscopic drama dominated almost to breaking-point by its central symbol, the Tarot pack, most ancient and mysterious of playing cards. Williams draws on his knowledge of the Kaballa for his account of them, and, as with the Grail and the Stone, uses them as a symbol of the creative power of God. He relates them to a group of magical golden figures, similar to those portrayed on the greater trumps, figures whose perpetual motion corresponds to the ever-lasting dance which is the rhythm and pattern of the universe. When the original cards and the images are brought together, the fortunes of the world can be read, for the relation between them constitutes the true knowledge of reality.The fortuitous reassembling of cards and images provides the mainspring of the plot. The figures are hidden in the house of Aaron Lee, latest of a long line of gipsy guardians, now 'civilized'. His grandson, Henry, finds the cards in the possession of Mr Lothair Coningsby (a Warden in lunacy - both his name and occupation are pleasing but superfluous jokes), whose daughter Nancy he is engaged to marry. Through her, by using the spiritual energy of their mutual love, he plans to possess and rule the cards - the blasphemy against love degrading him to the level of the false magicians of the earlier books. The cards have magical properties controlling the four elements. Following their owner's refusal to part with them, Henry unleashes on him the forces of rain and wind, only to lose the cards in the storm, which as a result breaks out of his control. But Nancy, who loves without calculation, restores the remaining cards to the images and thus re-establishes the balance of nature.The novel is a drama of vain desire and the nature of the re-conciliation between such desire and its only possible fulfillment. The separation of the cards from the images symbolizes the separation between reason and knowledge, and provides yet another myth of that condition (also imaged in the stricken state of Israel, of the Fisher King, of Balder and of Osiris) described here as 'the mystical severance [which] had manifested in action the exile of the will from its end'. (\\"The Greater Trumps\\", p.154) It is an image of the Fall.The union between the human will and its destined and unavoidable end is indicated through the figures of Nancy and her aunt Sybil. The latter is Williams's most elaborate portrait of achieved sanctity: she lives in a condition of joyous calm, ironic, affectionate, secure, beholding 'the primal Nature' (the nature of co-inherent triune Godhead) 'revealed as a law to the creature'.\\" Williams was always chary of using the name of God in his work, for so all embracing a synonym blunts imaginative response; and his account of Sybil's spiritual journey is the more convincing for the omission.Sybil's anti-type is Joanna, the embodiment of emotional frustration. An old gipsy, convinced that she is the divine Isis (though in Williams's world such identifications usually have some justification), she vainly searches for her dead child, craving the Tarot cards as a means of satisfying her own warped will to love, warped since it is an example of the inevitably thwarted human urge to love on one's own terms rather than to accommodate one's self will to its predestined end.Nancy, on the other hand, is awakened in time to make that accommodation: her vision of romantic love as being the start of a vocation recalls the similar awakening of the Duchess of Mantua, Williams's 'Chaste Wanton'.'But I can't', [Nancy] exclaimed, 'turn all this' - she laid her hand on her heart - 'towards everybody. It can't be done; it only lives for - him.''Nor even that', Sybil said. 'It lives for and in itself. You can only give it back to itself.'- \\"The Greater Trumps\\", p.69This sense of vocation is brought to life by Nancy's horror on finding that the beloved Henry is trying to kill her father - the Impossibility again. Sybil sends her to Henry in order to reaffirm their love, and to unite its mystery with the mystery of the Dance, by giving the cards back to the images and thus quelling the storm. But they must do this together; only in so far as they are lovers have they power rooted in exchange. Henry himself is lost in the mist which surrounds the images and comes to a knowledge of his real self through a vision of the perpetually falling tower of Babel, itself one of the greater trumps. Assenting to his defeat, he is purged to share again the mystery of love.The Greater Trumps is a closely knit book, in which the symbol of the dance recurs repeatedly. The magical golden images mark the different capacities of man and the facts which those capacities exist to encounter: again the unity of inward and out-ward is stressed. But the symbolism is not fully worked out, for the speed with which these novels were written tells badly on The Greater Trumps. Nowhere does Williams have such a rich and suggestive complex of imagery, and nowhere does he throw it away so carelessly. He displays an impatient imagination, and there is a disproportion between the profundity of the theme and the frequent frivolity of its expression. 'This also is Thou: neither is this Thou' is not an easy maxim to sustain in literary performance, and in this novel Williams appears to have been overwhelmed by his material."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"Charles Williams (1886-1945) was one of the Inklings, that group of literary pals that included J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Owen Barfield. I had intended to read his novel, \\"The Greater Trumps\\", for years, ever since encountering Gareth Knight's favorable references to it in his Tarot books, \\"The Treasure House of Images\\" and \\"The Magical World of the Tarot\\". The title of Williams' novel refers of course to the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot, and that imagery figures prominently throughout a book in which the Tarot emerges as a living expression of the cosmic dance. Major themes in the book include the dire consequences of lust for power and the transformative power of Love. Originally published in 1932 (by Victor Gollancz, Ltd.), this novel would make a great film, especially with today's special effects. However, it would be a difficult film to market: It is not so much a \\"horror\\" novel as it is an occult (or magical) novel with religious intention. I can imagine that it would appeal to any student of Tarot, Jungian/Archetypal psychology, or Christian Hermeticism--maybe also to fans of magical realism. (Williams, although a \\"Christian writer,\\" had also been a member of The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and I give Grand Rapids-based Christian publisher William B. Eerdmans credit for the stretch that their 1976 re-publication--the edition I own--of this work might have seemed to some segments of their readership.) The paranormal sequences have a vividly evocative power much like that found in Dion Fortune's \\"The Sea Priestess\\", and one could think of \\"The Greater Trumps\\" as occupying a literary space somewhere between \\"The Sea Priestess\\" and C.S. Lewis' Narnia series. Basic familiarity with the structure and imagery of the Tarot would enhance any reader's appreciation of The Greater Trumps. Allusions to the Tarot images abound--but often subtly so--as the characters embody and enact these archetypes in their experiences and interactions. One example is this passage on page 213 that refers to the character Mr. Coningsby as being \\". . . . moved for the first time by those two great virtues, strength and justice. . . .\\" Also, unless I'm grossly misconstruing his intention, author Williams seems to me, in the book's final passages, to pay tribute to the Divine Feminine, as one of the female characters becomes, in effect, an Incarnation of the Logos. I rarely read novels anymore, but I'm glad I finally made time for this one."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\"The Greater Trumps.\\" Not having any knowledge about the Tarot cards left me a little behind, but I belive that the morale to the story is to love, completely, without reserve, from a position of great personal self knowledge."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"Feels like entering another time and space with this family and a very special tarot deck of magical powers. It's slow, but worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"Read this book at the recommendation of several other authors that I had been reading. Most interesting but confusing novel. The characters seem very inconsistent (aren't we all) and do strange things that in no way relate to Christianity as I understand it. Nevertheless, it was interesting enough that I will re-read the book."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"Williams maligns the tarot in this book. He does not know much about the tarot. For example, the proper name for card no.1 is the Magician, but he calls it the Juggler.Williams gives evil intent to some of the cards. This is ridiculous. Each card has deep meaning, and none is evil.In the book Henry creates a terrible storm with the cards. Such a thing cannot happen. Novels on magic are fine, as long as they have a genuine occult basis. In contrast to Williams, Dion Fortune wrote excellent occult novels based on a thorough understanding of the subject. To anyone who has studied the tarot, Williams presents a confusing and downright wrong picture of the tarot."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"I was ever so excited. My love, Tarot, was about to meet my other love, reading novels, and dance together to the sounds of life going by...But it was a boring dance; the musician did not perform well. The sentences towards the end of the book seemed to repeat each other over and over and the ending was quite unsatisfactory though a predictable and wished-for one. I dragged myself to the end of the book, to the end of the snow fall just to make sure I was not missing something.... oh no, I was not!I am looking forward to find a GREAT Tarot+novel book!Victoria Evangelina Belyavskaya"},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"Basically a \\"spiritual thriller\\" about supernatural powers breaking in on everyday life when they are summoned for selfish purposes, this story is very interesting in places but fails to convince the reader that what is happening is really very important.In the 1920s or '30s, in England, a young woman, Nancy Coningsby, the daughter of a minor civil servant, is engaged to a young man from the Roma (Gypsy) people. Nancy's father, a rather dim, pompous sort, owns a very rare, old set of Tarot cards bequeathed to him by a deceased friend, and it is his intention to turn the cards over to a museum upon his own death. Nancy's fiance, Henry, realizes that this particular Tarot deck is the only \\"true\\" deck in existence--that is, a deck that is so accurately rendered that it can truly summon and command occult powers, as opposed to other sets that lack any real power.Henry's grandfather, Aaron, occupies a 17th century house where there is a table in a secret room, and on the table, there is a collection of miniature figures in a perpetual dance that is supposed to represent the \\"Great Dance,\\" which is said to be the foundation of the universe. If the deck of cards can come into the possession of the owner of the table and the miniature figures, then the owner will achieve consummate power and be able to command the four elements of earth, wind, water, and fire.Henry contrives to lure Nancy, her father, Mr. Coningsby, and Nancy's unmarried aunt, Sybil, who lives with them, to Aaron's house for Christmas, in the hope of getting the cards away from Coningsby. Since he cannot use direct violence, he uses the occult power of the cards to create a blinding snowstorm when Coningsby goes out for a walk on Christmas afternoon, in the hopes that the man will die in the storm.Two elements disrupt this plan: one is Sybil, Nancy's aunt, who is so spiritually advanced that she lives in a perpetual atmosphere of deep, loving calm, and can apparently perceive things that others cannot and remain unhurt in circumstances that would injure others; the other disruptive element is Henry's own great-aunt, Aaron's sister, Joanna, a half-demented old woman who believes her own deceased child was the reincarnation of the Egyptian god Horus and has spent years wandering the back roads looking for a way to bring him back to life; Joanna inconveniently shows up Christmas afternoon, after being estranged from her brother for years.The premise is very interesting, and there is even some comedy at the expense of the pompous Coningsby, and Nancy's aunt Sibyl is at times a fascinating figure--rather like a female Christ or Buddha figure come to life. However, the author finally fails to make one believe that what is happening is important enough to care deeply about.Something goes awry with the snow storm, which spirals out of control, and we are assured by Henry and Aaron that the elements will now destroy the world. If that, or something like it, truly happened, as in the climax of Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" it might be compelling tragedy, but it seems we are only being teased, since a different outcome occurs. At various times on Christmas afternoon, Nancy both discovers her fiance's treachery toward her father (intending to use the storm to murder him and obtain the cards) and is nearly made a human sacrifice by the half-demented old aunt Joanna who is searching for Horus, but by the end of the afternoon, everyone is cozily reconciled, and the young pair are even persisting in their plans to be married! Nobility and compassion are one thing, but fatuity is another. None of this seems very realistic.I started out reading all this with some eagerness, but in the end, was left feeling that I had read a story that was at times quite silly and trivial, and weighted down with a great deal of overblown language about mystical themes that the events of the story simply wouldn't bear. This was the fifth Williams novel I had read, over a period of some years, and I would recommend \\"Many Dimensions\\" or \\"All Hallows Eve\\" instead of this book."},{"Title":"The Greater Trumps","review":"Before getting into the novel I think it worth saying that if you aren't already familiar with the Tarot and the \\"meaning\\" of the various \\"picture cards\\" then you are likely to find this very hard going indeed.The Preface, by Charles Lindsey Gresham (who?), offers descriptions of the 22 (or 21?) \\"Greater Trumps\\", but these are not particularly helpful, firstly because they are so brief, secondly because they don't match many of the illustrations provided at the front and back of the book!Anyway, on with the story - such as it is.In fact I won't go over the story again because the previous reviewers have, between them, successfully summarised the entire plot. All you'll get in addition, in the book, is a highly convoluted, prolix version of the same set of basic elements.Having much enjoyed almost all of Williams' novels I was prepared to give this one every chance. But by half way through I was already reading just to reach the punchline. And when it finally came I felt, as previous reviewers have said, thoroughly unsatisfied and wondering why I had bothered.Those who are well-versed in the mysteries of the Tarot, and those who like their literature as obscure as possible may find this a worthwhile read. For the rest of us, even the Charles Williamds fans, my personal response is \\"forget it\\"!"},{"Title":"Soft Shapes: Where is My Baby?","review":"My one year old twins got this for their birthday and just love it. They can pop the shapes out and put them in their mouth. The pages are easy to turn for them and they seem to read the book longer than others.

He does chew on it some (though it specifically says that it is not a teething toy), but other than a few teeth marks, he has inflicted no damage. The premise of the book is good for little ones, as it focuses on opposites. it is a good beginner book for learning to place \\"puzzle pieces\\" in correctly.Cons: The only criticism is that my son, as well as other children who have played with the book, have difficulty understanding which piece to place in each slot. They try and match the COLORS, which do not coordinate."},{"Title":"Soft Shapes: Where is My Baby?","review":"My 14 month old loves these soft books.

It's better than most current books as far as explaining riding theories. I wish I would have discovered it a long time ago but I'm very glad I have now. Museler initially discusses the rider and how many people have a misconception on what the proper seat is. Then he moves to the horse where he discusses all the stages of training from how to teach your horse to be obedient to your aids to why the horse acts out. He further explains various lessons, going through the gaits, forehand and bending exercises. Then he ends with thorough details on jumping and equipment for the rider and horse. It's just a really amazing book. I recommend it very highly!"},{"Title":"Riding Logic","review":"Mueseler of the German School writes a useful text in understanding dressage &amp; riding in general.

This is the only book that I buy for people who like riding and want to learn the mechanics."},{"Title":"Riding Logic","review":"As a rider, a student of biomechanics and dressage judge, I have my copy of Museler and do not regret purchasing it. I do understand that it is a classic publication. However, if you have limited cash, you would do much better to purchase the platinum standard book for the independent seat of dressage, AN ANATOMY OF RIDING by Heinrich and Volker Schusdziarra (father and son medical doctors). They wrote their book after being given a copy of Museler. In order to settle discussions about dressage riding by referring to Human Anatomy, they found fundamental problems with the Museler account. These problems include Museler's invention of \\"sacral muscles\\" which do not exist. They also shed light on Museler's term, \\"bracing the back,\\" which can lead to problems with the dressage seat. Their critique of Museler is sensitive and detailed, with much clearer diagrams. My copy of Museler has such tiny illustrations that they are hard to make out. On second thought, you may wish to purchase both the Museler book and the Schusdziarra book and make up your own mind. I fervently hope the second Schusdziarra book \\"Reitergesprache: Der Weg zum unabh&auml;ngigen Sitz\\" (Conversations with Riders: The Way to An Independent Seat) will be translated soon, as it continues the ideas from \\"An Anatomy.\\""},{"Title":"Riding Logic","review":"This book is an excellent book, and explains collection in clear terms. Collection is so often misunderstood as simply bringing the horse's head down into position, instead of learning how to get your horse to shift his weight into his hindquarters, really push with his back end, round his back, and lift his forehand. This book is a must-read for any rider in any discipline, english or otherwise."},{"Title":"Riding Logic","review":"A classic, nothing better has been written since, so glad to find an English edition.

I'm so very pleased with this dealer and will be ordering more books."},{"Title":"Riding Logic","review":"This book was first recommended to me many years ago by my uncle, a professional horseman of recognized fame and expertise.Meuseler's \\"Riding Logic\\" is the product of an old-school master of the classical equestrian art. The age-old understanding of the horse, its mind, its training, its athletic perfection, its physical soundness, is recognized within the ancient logic he explains. I personally have never found anything to supercede these fundamental truths. The best of the modern exponents actually, recognized through objective analysis, adhere to the principles Meuseler presented so many years ago. Horses themselves, if they could somehow, would revere him."},{"Title":"Riding Logic","review":"Riding Logic may be the only book you will ever need about dressage.

While Krutch harks back to Thoreau, his perspective, turns of thought, and style of expression are similar to the reflective essays of E. B. White. They begin with observations of plant and animal life and evolve into ruminations on the nature of human life.Krutch writes of birds, the night sky, bats, saguaro cactus, ocotillo, and desert flowers. Considering them, he rediscovers the truth in ideas he has so long held as true that they've become near platitudes. Where there is plentitude in some things, for instance, there is no need for it in others. Nature cares for the species but not individuals, while human values tend toward the opposite. While every rose has its thorn, the blooming cactus shows us that the reverse is also true. A visit to the vastness and forbidding desert monuments of Cathedral Valley in south central Utah reminds him of the precariousness of human life.The desert leads Krutch to contemplation of its paradoxes, as well. For instance, the struggle for life here where conditions for survival are more restrictive actually create an uncrowded and more serene ecosystem by comparison with the tropics. The varieties of bird life are vastly greater here than in more temperate climates. A species of toads can live unseen and unheard for 363 days of the year, emerging after a rain fall to sing and reproduce, then disappear and survive somehow in the waterless months between. Finally, there's one question he's never able to answer: why bats fly clockwise from Carlsbad cave.You can't really know a place, he believes, until you have seen it both as novel and as familiar. A landscape is no more than a picture postcard until you have spent time there and discover yourself in the midst of it. &quot;The Desert Year&quot; is a wonderful account of that process and a celebration of the joy that can be found in settling down for a while in a place that gradually comes to feel like home."},{"Title":"The desert year (Viking compass edition)","review":"If you have an interest in the desert and why we live here with JOY you must read this book. Krutch was an extraordinary man and he lived an extraordinary life his first year here. This book is the story of why he stayed instead of returning to New York. It is perhaps the most admired book about Tucson that has ever been written."},{"Title":"The desert year (Viking compass edition)","review":"I grew up with Joseph Wood Krutch, so to speak. He wrote a weekly column for the Sunday New York Times during a portion of the \`60's. Always refreshingly different from all the other columns of the day which involved societal problems; Krutch's column was an introduction to writing about the natural world, and there was a strong theme of the progression of the seasons, resulting in weekly gradients and nuances in his beloved New England landscape. I had never read any of his books, and had meant to \\"revisit him,\\" so, when I was recently in an independent bookstore in Santa Fe, and spotted this work... and realized that he had also lived in my increasingly \\"semi-native\\" Southwest, it became a \\"must\\" purchase.Krutch was approximately 60 years old when he took a sabbatical year from teaching at a New York university, and moved to a farm house, set on many acres, near Tucson, Arizona, in the lower Sonoran desert. In his postscript, he quotes from E.V. Lucas: \\"Many of us are so constituted that we never use our eyes until we are on foreign soil. It is as though a Cook's ticket performed an operation for cataract.\\" Of course, Krutch was famous for being able to see in his native New England, but his powers of observation seemed heightened, and his spirit seems moved by the delightful differences of observing natural phenomenon in the desert. The book is comprised of 16 essays, largely independent, but united by the desert theme.He drove from New England, and thus he could observe the landscape gradually changing. As with others, he wanted to determine a practical criteria for \\"where the West began.\\" Though he does not mention antecedents, he concludes, like John Wesley Powell, that the West, the \\"land of scant rainfall\\" commences at the hundredth meridian, which roughly corresponds with the eastern side of the Texas panhandle. West of the hundredth means that the average rainfall is under 20 inches, and therefore non-irrigated farming cannot be sustained.Like others also, Krutch is enthralled by the night sky, where one can note the phases of the moon EVERY night, since cloud cover is so much rarer. By and large though, it is the same sky as in New England, but he is thrilled one winter evening, to realize that he has come far enough south to be able to observe the brightest star of the southern hemisphere, Canopus, which he could never have seen in NE. On the ground, he observes the courtship rituals, and is astonished that toads, yes amphibian, should find a home in the desert. In this substantial essay, he notes the deficiencies of academia, in mainly studying dead fauna, and \\"going light\\" on observations of the living. He \\"lit one candle\\" against this darkness by conducting his own experiment on the time required for tadpoles to become toads, finding that it was 20-30% less in a desert environment than that usually observed in wetter climes. There is also a separate essay on bird life. During his year, he mainly observed from his one Tucson location, but managed a road trip to San Diego, and thus crossed another desert, the Mojave. He also visited the \\"white spot\\" on the map, the truly \\"empty\\" land north of the Colorado, in Arizona, as well as in southern Utah. And he ponders why bats always fly out of the Carlsbad Caverns in a counter-clockwise direction. The Coriolis effect, or no?Unlike the columns in the NYT's Krutch also devotes some essays to the larger issues of man's place in this world. Written in the \`50's, when the US population was around 150 million, he was a strong advocate for a limit to population, and realized that \\"free and open space\\" might be the ultimate luxury. What would he think now, at 310 million, and climbing, with the golden calves of continued growth and development still being worshipped? And there was a fine ontological piece on the ultimate nature of the color \\"purple.\\" He states he is not a part of the Proudhon \\"all property is theft school\\" but he presents some insightful observations on the \\"problems\\" of trying to claim ownership of the natural world.Far from satiating my need to re-visit Krutch, this book, of the natural world of the desert, has only whetted my appetite, as it were, for more, and I suspect thatThe Best Nature Writing of Joseph Wood Krutchcannot be far (relatively) behind. 5-stars for this effort."},{"Title":"The desert year (Viking compass edition)","review":"Joseph Wood Krutch was a literary critique and a Thoreau scholar, so there is no surprise that his writing in this book had more than a touch of the \\"Thoreau flavor\\". There are many quotable sentences -- in the opening chapter he gave us 'A \\"tour\\" is like a cocktail party. One \\"meets\\" everybody and knows no one', and the book ends with 'Wherever one goes one has one's self fro company'. Krutch wrote with clarity, this book is probably the most \\"Thoreau like\\" book I've ever read (since Thoreau, of course). It consists of the description of the desert and its flora and fauna and the author's philosophical musing. I only wish he had done a bit more of the former and less of the latter. In some part of the book, such as \\"The Metaphor of the Grasslands\\", the philosophical contemplations feel a bit too long and dry. And overall, after reading the book, I had the feeling that there was probably still a lot more that could have been written about the desert. If the book had 50% more of observations, which would also put the philosophical contemplations to their proper proportions, it would have been more satisfying. Nonetheless, this is probably one of the best nature books as an introduction to the Desert Southwest."},{"Title":"The desert year (Viking compass edition)","review":"Here is a converted desert romantic with an interest in not only nature but man.

You are transported back in time where the more bizarre the religious expression was in the south, the better. Caldwell shows the excesses of religion and the struggle for southern churches to acquire more respectability as their economic status becomes more stable.Caldwell sounds like an amateur sociologist on his observation of the religion of his region. His ignorance is especially telling when he attempts to describe the life in the Black churches. He is obviously not a church historian. His critique on southern religion of his time is interesting but at times he beats the dead horse to the ground. He dwells to much on the excesses and doesn't see to much good.The most interesting character in this memoir is that of the author's father. Ira Caldwell,a presbyterian minister of a small sect of the denomination, is a man far ahead of his time. His social consciousness, intellectual acumen and liberal ideas were far out of step with the social and religious milieu of his time. How he survived in such an environment is an interesting story within itself. It is Caldwell's father who keeps you riveted in wanting to know more about his thoughts and ministry.Deep South is a good book to have in order to gain insight on Caldwell's thoughts about the church and religion. It is also a text which gives tribute to the work of Caldwell's father. For those wishing to gain some idea of southern religion during Caldwell's childhood, this is an ideal book."},{"Title":"Sacred Eyes","review":"SACRED EYES is an excellent book if you really want to understand the new paradigm we are just now in -- or are moving into.

While the material may seem to be drawn out at times, we must remember that Milton is exercising his mastery of the English language. It is my opinion that you will enjoy this book the most after you have read the Bible. Basically, \\"Paradise Lost\\" is this. Satan has been defeated by the forces of God; Satan tries to cheer up what's left of his defeated forces; he contemplates another move; like a good leader, he listens to what his different allies have to say; he then journeys out of hell to find something he can use; God becomes aware of Satan's 2nd wind and fears that man will be corrupted by Satan; Jesus offers to sacrifice himself for the salvation of man; the angel Uriel sees Satan and warns the angel Gabriel of Satan's presence; Gabriel goes to Eden and explains to Adam how God's angels defeated Satan as well as the story of creation; Satan gets Eve to eat the forbidden apple; in sorrow, Adam decides to share Eve's fate; before being cast out, the angel Michael encourages Adam by telling of the coming of Christ. It is interesting how Milton was able to make Satan human and sympathetic. One really interesting thing is that Satan tricks Eve into eating the forbidden apple, but he honestly thinks it is an absurd rule God gave them: \\"...can it be a sin to know, / Can it be death? and do they only stand / By ignorance, is that their happy state, / The proof of their obedience and their faith?\\" (Book 4, Lines 517-520). If I may be permitted a slight digression, in \\"Bedazzled,\\" Peter Cook as the devil hinted at how he thought this was absurd: \\"I'll tell you why Adam and Eve were so happy. They were pig ignorant.\\" The most frightening thing about this book is that at times, Satan does have reason on his side. Moving on to \\"Paradise Regained,\\" that is a longer and more articulate telling of Christ's temptation in the desert. While some people may find it disturbing to see a human, sympathetic, and at times very rational Satan, Milton truly deserves to be called William Shakespeare's successor."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","review":"Mr. Milton is without a doubt, a liteary genius!

There is a palpable tension evident in every aspect of the work, as Milton endows Satan with nobility, Adam and Eve with compassion, and God and the angels with preening vanity and megalomania, only to pull back after every passage and try to negate his own words with addendums or disclaimers. The verse isn't consistent in its brilliance, but much of it is first rate, particularly in the first hundred pages or so as the rebellious angels recover from their disaster and map out their defiance."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","review":"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruitOf that forbidden tree whose mortal tasteBrought death into the world and all our woe,With loss of Eden, till on greater ManRestore us and regain the blissful seatSing, Heavenly Muse...Not a lot people know that 'Paradise Lost' has as a much lesser known companion piece 'Paradise Regained'; of course, it was true during Milton's time as it is today that the more harrowing and juicy the story, the better it will likely be remembered and received.This is not to cast any aspersion on this great poem, however. It has been called, with some justification, the greatest English epic poem. The line above, the first lines of the first book of the poem, is typical of the style throughout the epic, in vocabulary and syntax, in allusiveness. The word order tends toward the Latinate, with the object coming first and the verb coming after.Milton follows many classical examples by personifying characters such as Death, Chaos, Mammon, and Sin. These characters interact with the more traditional Christian characters of Adam, Eve, Satan, various angels, and God. He takes as his basis the basic biblical text of the creation and fall of humanity (thus, 'Paradise Lost'), which has taken such hold in the English-speaking world that many images have attained in the popular mind an almost biblical truth to them (in much the same way that popular images of Hell owe much to Dante's Inferno). The text of Genesis was very much in vogue in the mid-1600s (much as it is today) and Paradise Lost attained an almost instant acclaim.John Milton was an English cleric, a protestant who nonetheless had a great affinity for catholic Italy, and this duality of interests shows in much of his creative writing as well as his religious tracts. Milton was nicknamed 'the divorcer' in his early career for writing a pamphlet that supported various civil liberties, including the right to obtain a civil divorce on the grounds of incompatibility, a very unpopular view for the day. Milton held a diplomatic post under the Commonwealth, and wrote defenses of the governments action, including the right of people to depose and dispose of a bad king.Paradise Lost has a certain oral-epic quality to it, and for good reason. Milton lost his eyesight in 1652, and thus had to dictate the poem to several different assistants. Though influenced heavily by the likes of Virgil, Homer, and Dante, he differentiated himself in style and substance by concentrating on more humanist elements.Say first -- for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,Nor the deep tract of Hell -- say first what causeMoved our grand Parents, in that happy state,Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall offFrom their Creator and transgress his will,For one restraint, lords of the world besides?Milton drops us from the beginning into the midst of the action, for the story is well known already, and proceeds during the course of the books (Milton's original had 10, but the traditional epic had 12 books, so some editions broke books VII and X into two books each) to both push the action forward and to give developing background -- how Satan came to be in Hell, after the war in heaven a description that includes perhaps the currently-most-famous line:Here we may reign secure, and in my choiceTo reign is worth ambition though in hell:Better to reign in hell, that serve in heav'n.(Impress your friends by knowing that this comes from Book I, lines 261-263 of Paradise Lost, rather than a Star Trek episode!)The imagery of warfare and ambition in the angels, God's wisdom and power and wrath, the very human characterisations of Adam and Eve, and the development beyond Eden make a very compelling story, done with such grace of language that makes this a true classic for the ages. The magnificence of creation, the darkness and empty despair of hell, the manipulativeness of evil and the corruptible innocence of humanity all come through as classic themes. The final books of the epic recount a history of humanity, now sinful, as Paradise has been lost, a history in tune with typical Renaissance renderings, which also, in Milton's religious convictions, will lead to the eventual destruction of this world and a new creation.A great work that takes some effort to comprehend, but yields great rewards for those who stay the course."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","review":"Ricks provides the most helpful and least pedantic footnotes since James Holly Hanford's edition. They are unobtrusive and on the same page as the text.

There could, perhaps, be wider margins for making annotations."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","review":"Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare were indeed grand masters of literature for all time. &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; is enough to put John Milton in the same category. Like Marlowe and Shakespeare, Milton demonstrates extreme scholarship and a superb mastery of the language. It is interesting how Milton takes figures that are mentioned briefly in the scriptures and turns them into major characters. It is also frightening how Milton was able to make God and Satan 3 dimensional as opposed to simply good (in God's case) and evil (in Satan's case). This book is not for everyone. But if you do not mind an unorthodox portrayal of God and Satan and if you want to enjoy beautiful language, superb images, dramatic confrontations, and powerful images, you must read this masterpiece composed with superb and delicate skill."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","review":"\\"The poem provides an unwitting expose to the absurdity of Christian mythology.\\" With all due respect, I have to question how someone can consider what Milton intended as the \\"justification of the ways of God to men\\" an \\"unwitting expos&eacute;.\\" For sure there are several controversies throughout PL-Milton most certainly DOES represent Satan as noble, rationalize the Fall, and present God as less interesting and engaging than the Devil-but he most certainly does NOT do so \\"unwittingly.\\" Above all Milton was an advocate of freedom-freedom of thought and theology no less than the freedom from censorship he championed in Areopagitica. He was in many ways unorthodox, even denying the Holy Spirit as a person of the Trinity. In Paradise Lost, Milton was not writing a treatise on God's justice and unwittingly undermining his own religion: the issues of Satan's heroic charm and God's apparent coldness are fundamental parts of that treatise. Sin is tempting and attractive, but \\"the wages of sin is death\\" (as shown by the \\"Unholy Trinity\\" of Satan, Sin, and Death, by which point in the narrative the heroic appeal of Satan the reader may have felt at the beginning of the poem starts to fade). And the cold, often unappealing reason and justice of God are hard to come to terms with-indeed, impossible to come to terms with, without the redemption of Christ. Milton hardly tries to \\"negate his own words with addendums and disclaimers.\\" Show me one such addendum or disclaimer that isn't part of his intended theodicy. In my opinion, Milton's epic is one of the most cogent examples of Christian apologetics ever. Did you miss the line that \\"with reiterated crimes [Satan] heaps on himself damnation, while he sought evil to others, and enrag'd might see how all his malice serv'd but to bring forth infinite goodness, grace and mercy, but on himself treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.\\" Also, I suggest reconsidering the significance of his statement that \\"Virtue is but choosing\\"-a brief statement which alone can \\"justify the ways of God to men,\\" even without the hopeful ending and the redemptive fulfillment in Paradise Regained. Virtue, defined here as the choice to serve God, would not be possible had not man and woman been given free will; and maybe, just maybe, the horror of hell and Satan, the woes of man (and even the death of Christ) were worth the price of making possible the concept of love.For all that, I do agree that \\"Paradise Lost features some of the most wonderful passages written in the English language.\\" But I can see how you might think Milton was writing an expos&eacute;, intentional or not, if you only read (or only paid attention to?) those first hundred pages about the rebellious angels. (If you ask me, though, the description of Eden, the ironic pursuits of the demons and the perverted parallels of Hell to Heaven, and all of Book IX are the highlights). However, debate is good. I'm sure we both agree with Milton that the freedom to express one's beliefs is of paramount importance. That said, I believe that PL is indeed an expos&eacute;, in part at least-not of Christianity, but of the irony and vanity of evil. His arguments for the justice of God seem valid to me, and (is it just me?) his description of Satan as a hero, of Satan's self-righteous volunteering to leave hell, and of the horrible perversion of the\\" Unholy Trinity\\", serve not to justify Satan and thereby justify rebellion, but instead, to expose evil for what it is-tempting, but horrific. The most I personally can feel for Satan is pity, and by the end of Paradise Lost, that pity has turned almost entirely to enmity. As a whole, although Paradise Lost certainly raises some debatable issues, it accomplishes what Milton set out to do-justify the ways of God to men."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","review":"I have maybe a half-dozen editions of \\"Paradise Lost.\\"Whenever I need to reread it quickly, I pick up the Signet Classic edition. It's got to be my favorite.There are more thorough editions, certainly. But the thing I like about the Signet edition is that it's got this whole Goldilocks thing going on with the footnotes. Not too few, not too many.In the text, words and phrases that are glossed at the bottom of the page have a little circle (a degree sign) next to them. You look down if you need to; if you don't, you keep reading. I like this because many editions don't indicate in the running text when something has a gloss: one must flip to the back of the book to hunt this out for oneself.Additionally, there are not so many footnotes that they clutter up half (or more) of the page: I'm sure you're familiar with this sight.Originally this was edited by Christopher Ricks (of Cambridge). In addition to the bibliography, chronology, and footnotes, he also wrote a short introduction. That unremarkable introduction has now been supplanted by one done by Susanne Woods, to which I am also indifferent.The Signet edition also fits snugly in your hand, as other, meatier editions do not.Too bad Amazon buries this edition in the back pages.

It took me the whole first chapter to get adjusted, but then the book really swept me away. The language is beautiful and the concepts very deep and thoughtful. I can't always agree with Milton's thoedicy, but it definitely provides rich and spicy food for thought. The book requires a lot from the reader, but it's well worth every moment. We also read all 3 books of Dante's Divine Comedy for the book club. I was frequently lost, especially while reading Purgatorio and Paradisio, but Milton is different. You can understand - and enjoy - most of what he says even without the footnotes (though you'll miss 90% of the allusions without them). The poetry is sublime. Like a really great novel, this work hangs over you for days after you finish it, tugging at your heart."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","review":"Add this reviewer to the list of people who hold Paradise Lost up to the lofty title of The Greatest Epic Poem in the English Language; it is not only this, but one of the best in any language. Writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed Homeric epic verse, Mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by Homer, Virgil, and Dante -- but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work. The opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by Homer, as are other elements, but Milton has a very unique poetic style; long sentences, often with the principle verb at the end, being one of its mainstays. This language is very grandiose and quite complex; it takes a while to get used to it -- you will have to pay very close attention during the first book -- but, as with most classical literature, once the reader gets the hang of it, it goes quite smoothly. The Divine Comedy of Dante has a more towring reputation than does Milton's Paradise Lost -- for one thing, it is older -- but I among those who find Milton to be superior. The Divine Comedy is, certainly, an undisputed masterpiece, but, where it was, more or less, a satire and a thinly-veiled attack on many of Dante's political enemies, Milton's work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter: why mankind fell, how the gods themselves operate and think, the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin, the importance of love in human relationships, the moral problems of God's justice. It is true that Dante's work is more original; Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, at least in seed, come straight from The Bible. But Milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath. Milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective -- strictly within the Christian tradition, to be sure, but far from fundamentalist, and even quite radical for its day. Although some cite the work as Christian apologist, there are certainly many elements within the poem that many of the more hard-line Christians would be taken aback by; it was, of course, even more controversial in its day. One thing about the work that often gets pointed out is that Satan is a far more interesting and appealing character than God. This, in my view, does not have Milton unwittingly on the Devil's side, as some critics have suggested. Rather, he is pointing out how appealing sin is always is: of course it's interesting, of course it's appealing -- otherwise, we wouldn't keep falling for it again and again and again. If we saw its razor-sharp fangs and [dripping] mouth, we would have stopped getting ensnared in its trap long ago. However, as a non-Christian myself, I cannot but disagree with some points of Milton's theodicy; the last two books, in particular, and Paradise Regained as a whole, were, for me, quite hard to swallow. I found the more human elements of the poem to be its most intriguing. Milton paints Adam and Eve as quintissentially human characters who possess many of the same feelings that we all share: joy, happiness, fear, sadness, depression, and, most of all, the overriding paramount importance of love. The act of Adam, who was not himself [evil], eating of the apple so that he could follow Eve, no matter what doom was to befall her and them, out of love for her, is still one of the most touching moments in all of literature -- as Mark Twain, in the voice of Adam, later said, \\"Wheresoever Eve was there, THERE was Eden.\\" God, Satan, and the various angels are also endowed with human characteristics; most Christians today seem to have forgotten that God created Man \\"in His own image\\", and that He is not a perfect creature. Likewise, Satan is not entirely evil -- certainly he is ambitious and narcissistic, but so are many humans -- indeed, many have seen him as the hero of the poem (an errorenous view, as I see it.) God often comes off as extremely cold and hardly forgiving or merciful; indeed, to many readers, myself included, this poem doesn't come anywhere near its stated goal of justifying the ways of Gods to men, but only reinforces the views we already had (Mark Twain, whom I have previously mentioned, has a very different view of the situation, closer to my own perspective, that is worth seeking out.) Whatever one's objections to the theology and theodicy expressed within the poem, the poem remains a great work of literature -- poetic, grandiose, profound, extremely readable, and thought-provoking. The shorter sequel, Paradise Regained, is also included in this edition. This work, in my view, comes nowhere near the glory of it's predecessor, but it is still a good read and it is very handy to have it included in this volume as well. For that reason, I highly reccommend picking up this particular edition of the works; also because the introduction, written by Dr. Susanne Woods, is very good, and it has notes provided by the wonderful Christoper Ricks, who also edited the poem for this version. Unlike many editors, he does not include so many notes that they become cumbersome and distract from the text: they are genuinely helpful and there are not too many of them. This is an absolute classic not only of English literature, but of world literature, and a monument in the tradition of epic poetry that you owe it to yourself to read."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","review":"The connected plot of \\"Paradise Lost\\" and its accompanying poem \\"Paradise Regained\\" contains no surprises for anyone who is even casually familiar with the Bible. Milton, however, does something remarkable the Bible doesn't do--he inflates Satan from a mere flat symbol of evil into a complex personality that enlivens his identity as the principal enemy of God, Jesus, and man. Who is Satan, where did he come from, why does he do the things he does, and, most importantly, why is he an indispensable part of the Christian myth? Milton takes the initiative of asking and answering these questions.Divided into twelve \\"books,\\" \\"Paradise Lost\\" begins with a war in Heaven instigated by the angel Lucifer who, with the help of many rebellious cohorts, tries to wrest control of the celestial kingdom from God. Like a school principal putting kids in detention for starting a food fight in the cafeteria, God deals swiftly and severely with the miscreants, hurling them \\"headlong flaming from the ethereal sky/With hideous ruin and combustion down/To bottomless perdition, there to dwell/In adamantine chains and penal fire.\\" That's powerful stuff.The rebel angels, now transformed into devils for their treachery, are imprisoned in Hell, a hot, smelly, miserable place, with Lucifer (now named Satan) their lord to dwell in a palace called Pandemonium--the place of all demons. Milton assigns names of heathen gods to the devils and allows three of them to offer advice on the proper course of action for the hell-bound. The bellicose Moloch insists on resuming war with Heaven, the rational Belial believes a peaceful acceptance of their sentence will eventually restore them to God's good graces, and the pragmatic Mammon suggests they should establish and rule Hell as their new dominion rather than return to Heaven as servants. But Satan has another idea--to travel through Chaos (the dark, lifeless void connecting the realms) to Earth to corrupt Man, the new being with whom God plans to replace the expelled angels in Heaven.Satan would be uninteresting if he were no more than a fist-shaking, teeth-gnashing villain, but Milton endows this vilest of creatures with the most human of consciences. While on his nefarious mission, as he rapturously views the luxuriant Eden, he laments, \\"O sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams/That bring to my remembrance from what state/I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere;\\" and the jealousy mixed with sorrow is palpable. He knows he did wrong and momentarily regrets his misbehavior, but he also knows that there can never be a reconciliation between him and God, and therefore resigns himself to be forever the king of evil and vie for man's soul. It is here that Satan eavesdrops (pun not intended) on Adam and Eve talking about the Tree of Knowledge, the fruit of which they are forbidden to eat.Regarding the Tree of Knowledge, the poem inevitably raises the issue of entrapment. What is the purpose of the Tree? Simply that God demands obedience, and obedience can be tested only if there exists something to provide an opportunity to disobey. The material component of this opportunity is the Tree; the human component is the Tempter, who of course is Satan. Jesus, as narrated in \\"Paradise Regained,\\" is the exemplary resister of Temptation, rejecting Satan's offer of world domination and his challenges to test his faith in God by turning stones to bread and casting himself from the top of the temple's spire. Through embellishment and dramatization, Milton makes ideas like these more explicit in the \\"Paradise Lost/Regained\\" poems than they are in the Bible.Completely blind by the time he wrote these poems, John Milton was a man of strong but curious convictions--he defended the freedom of the press, but he lauded Cromwell and condoned regicide. As poems, \\"Paradise Lost/Regained\\" can be read as sacred, reflecting much of English religious thinking of the seventeenth century, or as heroic, subtly illustrating Milton's assiduous efforts to reform religion and government. But regardless of its subtext, it's no wonder that \\"Paradise Lost\\" has become one of the most celebrated accomplishments in the English language--the book of Genesis could not have been re-imagined more vividly, more terrifyingly, more beautifully."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","review":"The work itself is of course brilliant- the Kindle edition is abominable.

We're talking about the famous 17th-century English poet who wrote _Paradise Lost_ and _Paradise Regained_, two of the most wonderfully overlong Christian poems in the history of Western literature.Your English teacher will tell you that _Paradise Lost_ \\"narrates the story of Adam and Eve's disobedience, explains how and why it happened, and places the story within the larger context of Satan's rebellion and Jesus' resurrection.\\" And you know that can't be far wrong, because SparkNotes says the exact same thing.But the main reason everyone should read Milton's grand epic is that it contains certain secrets about prayer.In PL, Milton reminds us how important it is, when we pray, to be absolutely specific. The Lord has a strange, often disturbing, sense of humour (PL, books I-XII). If you leave Him wiggle room, He will answer your prayer in a way you never intended, and then say it was your own damned fault, because your prayer contained seven types of ambiguity.John Milton writes from experience. Example: Almost every time a good-looking woman passed within view of John Milton, he suffered an involuntary erection. Daniel of the Old Testament might well have suffered such a condition without complaining, but John Milton found it onerous. John was both a Puritan and a student of Saint Augustine. He was not happy when he suffered an erection, he hated it, and he especially resented the women who made that thing happen to him.In a Latin letter to his friend, George Wither, John Milton reports that, in his youth, he would sometimes see a pretty woman even in his dreams at night, and suffer, not just an erection, but the whole nine yards, up to and including a nocturnal emission; which he trained himself to handle according to Scripture, thereby to purify himself (Deut. 23:10); but sometimes he was unable to wait that long before he handled it, which filled his soul full of Puritan remorse and self-reproach.At age 33, the poet took to wife a 16-year-old lolita named Mary Powell; and you may already have guessed the reason why, which is that she gave him an erection -- more accurately, she gave him \\"one damned erection after another,\\" without remission. (Giving John Milton an erection was not the girl's conscious intent, but it just happened to him, every time they met.) And since Christian marriage is Saint Paul's only approved method whereby to deal with that kind of torment, John Milton (being an honourable man) thought it best to marry the girl (1 Cor. 7:9).Frailty, thy name is woman! After two years of marriage - after just two years of witnessing those insufferable erections that could not be beaten down, or at least, not for long - the poet's young Puritan bride ran away and skipped back home to live with her mother, Mrs. Anne Powell, who likewise gave John an erection; which is why John Milton resented his mother-in-law as well as his estranged wife.Those were the hardest years of the poet's life - nothing but a daily struggle against involuntary erections, yet here he was, trapped in a loveless marriage to a barely pubescent teenager who lived with her entirely-too-attractive mother. Which is partly why John Milton wrote those four revolutionary Christian pamphlets, correcting Moses' and Jesus' hardline policy on divorce (Mark 10:11-12).In his Latin correspondence, some of which is preserved in the Bodleian Library, John Milton reports that he was fine when alone in his study, or when hobnobbing with Parliamentarians, or even when having a hasty pudding, or a figgy one, over at the Inns of Court; but let just one good-looker cross his path, showing good ankle between the hem of her dress and the top of her shoe, and it was boing! - instant erection, just like a spring-loaded mechanical device; causing John to exclaim bitterly, \\"Oh, God, please, not again! Save me from this penal fire!\\"It even happened to him once when Oliver Cromwell's wife, Elizabeth Bourchier Cromwell, bent over to pick up a handkerchief that had fallen to the floor. On that occasion there was a lamentable accident (\\"an hard mishap\\" [verbatim quote]) with John's ordinarily modest codpiece - an incident so humiliating that John never even wrote a poem about it, although he did apologise, profusely, to Oliver Cromwell, and to Mrs. Cromwell, who saw the whole thing, and then fainted. (John at the time was employed as Cromwell's Latin secretary.)By the way: It was modesty, not arrogance, that moved John Milton, after that embarrassing incident, to wear a baggy codpiece, with plenty of wiggle room.Which brings me back to the beginning, when I was explaining why you should give the Lord no wiggle room when you pray: John Milton took his problem to the Lord in prayer, stating in his journal, \\"Father, I pray Thee, let me not suffer a stiffe joynt when I see a beautifull woman.\\"And here's how the Lord answered that prayer, in 1651: He struck John Milton blind.At first, John thought that his blindness was a punishment for his own bad behaviour - which is how that whole thing got going, in Anglo-American Christianity, about how, if you are a boy who does what John Milton used to do, it could make you go blind. But God revealed to John, by means of a dream, that his blindness was actually an answer to his own prayers - because the poet had said, \\"Father, let me not suffer a stiff joint when I see a beautiful woman.\\"John Milton then said, \\"Lord, that is not what I meant, at all\\" - but it was too late to change the outcome, because the prayer was already answered.The erections that John Milton suffered in the years 1651-1674, and there were many, even after the Lord answered his prayer, were not from seeing a beautiful woman, it was actually because John had a condition that modern physicians call PSAS (\\"Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome\\"). So the chronic \\"stiffe joynt\\" problem was not really the women's fault, and it never was; but John Milton never knew that. Even when he wrote Paradise Lost (by dictation, from 1652-1667), John was still under the impression that women, seen or unseen, were to blame for his condition; which is why he makes all of those snide remarks in blank verse about your mother, Eve, in Books IV-V and IX-X of Paradise Lost. Because whenever he pictured Eve in his mind's eye, it was boing! - the same old problem. And there would come no more blank verse to his head for the next twenty minutes or so, until things settled down. John Milton hated that.But it all turned out for the best: if God had not answered John Milton's prayer in that unusual way, by blinding him, Paradise Lost might never have been completed, and sold to the publisher, Sam Simmons, in 1667, for 5 - which was a tidy sum for a religious poem during the decadent Restoration era.It was while writing the early books of Paradise Lost that John was introduced to Katherine, a ship captain's daughter, a fat woman whom he had never seen (because he was blind); whom he nonetheless married in 1656, but not for the same old reason as before: John asked fat Kate to marry him (a.) because he needed secretarial assistance with Paradise Lost, and (b.) because Katherine did not have the same pernicious effect on him as Mary Powell and her mother Anne had done. John could dictate blank verse to Kate all night long without feeling so much as a tingle down there.Kate's surname was Woodcock. Beelzebub made a little joke about that: he said, \\"The Lord finally gave John Milton just what he always wanted.\\"- L."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","review":"This is a sequel to Paradise Lost.

Based upon the investigative journalism of William Bradford Huie, who visited Live Oak after the first murder trial of Ruby McCollum, the radio play follows Huie as he navigates the slippery slopes of Southern politics and the good old boys who run the liquor and control the gambling in the small north Florida town. While the radio play takes liberties with the facts, it is dramatically sound and well produced.

Plus it's good quality reading--and very appropriate for children."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"It's hard to decide which of Kosinski's vignette-based novels is the best, since they're all fairly similiar, and passages are interchangeable. There are slight varitations in theme - the protagonist of The Painted Bird is a child, and in Blind Date you have an investor, while in The Devil Tree you have a wealthy young man, but on the whole each one is as good as another. Considering it, though, I think that Cockpit is the best overall, with some of the most interesting vignettes and the most consistently good writing, and one of the stronger protagonists. It's also the only Kosinski book which I can really say shocked me - usually, I'm prepared for the horrible things which his characters do to each other, remembering that it is Kosinski even when things seem to be going well, but there's an episode in Cockpit involving the elderly which took me by surprise. I reccomend this as an introduction to Kosinski's work, or, if you only read one, make it this."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"Kosinski's portrait of an ex CIA agent with a knack for controlling others is disturbing, diabolical, and ultimately entertaining. Tarden is both socially and sexually disfunctional, yet somehow we can all identify with him. Kosinski creates an obsessive depressive character with Gatsby-esque personal drive. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"When you are in the cockpit you have total and absolute control over hundreds of lives. You can do with them what you wish. If you choose, you could end every life or just give them a good scare. In Jerzy Kosinski's novel &quot;Cockpit&quot; the hero - Tarden - is always in the cockpit, always in control. This book makes you realize how easy it is for a total stranger to, through a few mundane manipulations, have your entire life in his hands. A chilling thought indeed."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"This book is excellent in that it shows how one man can intimately weave his way into others lives without them knowing it, and alter their lives; somtimes joyously sometimes catastrophically. The more you read this book, the more you identify with the psyche of Tarden, the book's hero. Tarden's life will make anyone's life seem boring and mundane compared to his. International travel, spying, deception, sex, and a 200 lb. horseshoe. Read it and see what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"This book has had one of the greatest impacts on my life in terms of great literature.

He's not for the faint of heart, but if dark storytelling is your thing, no one is better."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"Each little scene is often interesting but if you're waiting and hoping that the whole thing comes together and makes some kind of sense, you'll be waiting a long time. For Kosinski, there are better choices..."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"I came across a used hardcover and decided to give it a try, having really enjoyed The Painted Bird and Being There. Right away the writing seems somewhat tired and worn, with the same vignette style as The Painted Bird but without the freshness or vigor. It picks up after a while, making you think it will eventually cohere with some twist or another, but it doesn't. The author relies on the shock value of some scenes intended to disturb the reader, but they don't come off as all that impressive -- somewhat stale, especially today with modern understandings of sociology and sexual psychology that incite boredom at Kosinski's numerous revealed dysfunctions. Some of the stories are genuinely compelling, but tainted by a sadistic mind that is not at its most creative. I'm sad to say this is one of the most horrible novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"I've used the opening of this darkly prophetic novel--told from the POV of a social terrorist interested only in exploring the depths of human evil like Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment--in countless workshops and seminars to illustrate that your protagonist's \\"sympathetic\\" nature doesn't mean we LIKE him. 'Sympathetic' in its Greek root suggests that we can \\"relate to,\\" or \\"suffer with,\\" a character and from the haunting opening lines that's exactly what causes us to turn the pages--a mixture of horror and our own voyeuristic tendencies."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"Place a razor blade in your mouth and hold it there for a few hours. Shift it around carefully, mindful of its cool threat to your tender flesh. This is the experience of reading \\"Cockpit,\\" which tempts and seduces, but ultimately mangles your sense of peace. Much like his earlier \\"Steps,\\" the book turns on what the desperate (or the simply sick) resort to when there is little to lose. Although I became sick to my stomach at some of the violence portrayed here, the book is worthwhile - even quite interesting - at times. Not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"Few books have made me as irritated as \\"Cockpit,\\" as Kosinki episodically unravels one nightmare after another. There is just a minimal spine to hold the narrative togther (American spy becomes filthy rich through his manipulation of others), minimal dialogue, and no resolution of character or story line. And to think Kosinki also authored \\"Being There\\" and was (is) a university professor! Good thing I invested just a dollar at a used-book counter."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"In COCKPIT, Kosinski presents the reader with a caricature of a hero. This anti-hero intensified his sadistic, bad seed behavior as the pages were turned. The reader must be hungry for a grotesque salad. Why not scrape off some raw flesh from the reader's bones? This is sure to wet their appetite. Throw in some good old fashioned animal torture. Toss in scenes where this caricature hero pays derelicts to gang rape a woman, bound and gagged. Let him loose in a supermarket to squirt syringes full of poison into packages. Give the hero inexhaustible wealth and let him play a dozen nasty, repulsive games with his money hungry, vegie-victims.Here is a hero character who was obsessed with manipulating and controlling even casual acquaintances. Why? Because he had no children, no family, no relatives, obvious justifications. Life to this hero became a game to satisfy his blooming impotence. He used himself as bait in traps that only he knew were being placed. This anarchist, naturally, had to make up the rules of the game as he went along.The reader may have at least hoped for some finality to this charade of realistic cruelty. In the final pages the hero became trapped in a broken elevator that would forever run up and down, up and down. This would have offered a hellish, no exit ending, but alas, this was not allowed to occur."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"As I read the book I kept hoping that at some point there would be a moment of enlightenment. That there would be a place where things fell together and started to make sense. Where I'd feel like all these snippets of a guy continuously bragging about his life would have greater purpose that would make me forgive the author's pure drive to shock the reader. Unfortunately this never occurred and at the end I found myself convinced that my time would have been better spent doing or reading just about anything."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"If you enjoy reading unconnected, plotless, sometimes titillating, always depraved vignettes, than this is the book for you. While I enjoyed some of Kosinski's sometimes lush prose, I prefer an interesting plot with at least one admirable character, and so this work rates as the very worst novel I have ever read. That can't be true, can it? I'm thinking. I've read some time-wasters, but no, this is the biggest one of all. Very disturbing as well. The soft cover advertises that 'Tarden is the &quot;ultimate secret agent&quot;. I see him rather as the ultimate demented mind. Very twisted. Tarden makes &quot;dysfunctional&quot; seem like a worthy goal.The jacket promises that &quot;the silently suffering are quietly rewarded and the unjust are mercifully punished.&quot; Horsehockey. Tarden punishes those who do not do what he requires; and I saw little evidence that anyone is &quot;quietly rewarded&quot; except those readers who pass this book up."},{"Title":"An Artists Vision","review":"As a Canadian I can vouch for the fact that Sue Coleman has captured the essence of Fisrt Nation's deep spiritual roots, their artistic beauty and the true beauty of their mythology!

And it is amazing that it was written so long ago, before much was known of the illness. I adore this book because the thoughts and emotions I sometimes have that seem to be so terribly painfull and unexplainable are all stated crystal clear right there in the pages.

As I continued through the story, I began to think that Holden was just as phony as the many people that he hates, though soon, I began to realise that his negative attitude is a result of being let down too many times, thereby, he seeing no point in making an effort himself. I find his protection of Phoebe incredibly sweet, considering the type of person he is, and the fact that he wants to protect her from the 'real world'shows that he is scared that she might one day become like those 'phonies'.

However, Holden's use of repetition really gets to you and sometimes that's all you think about...how phoney those people are that he talks about and how everything is &quot;corny&quot;. The book does have a point. And I think as a teenager I really related to his feelings and his constant cynism. Unfortunately, that comes with the teenage years. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is also a lot like Sylvia Plath's &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;.

I just hope and wish that Ms. Johnson continue this story perhaps with the relationship between Breck and Eric's best friend. I read this book over 2 years ago and have been looking for a sequel ever since. I want so much more. Ms.Johnson left the fans of this book with such a void. There are so many ways this book can continue. I know that I will miss one of the characters(not to give anything away) but with the skills that were used to write this book I know this next could be just as good if not better. Ms. Johnson if you happen to read this please take into consideration of continuing this story. You definatly have a fan base with this one. GREAT BOOK YOU MUST READ IT AND THEN TELL EVERYONE OF YOUR GIRLFRIENDS TO READ IT!"},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"I first stumbled across this book in the library and I had never before heard of Darlene Johnson. I feel in love with this book. Although I don't condone cheating, this book gave an inside view of what the other woman feels dating a married man. I do feel that what Breck and Eric shared was real and beautiful but wrong and forbidden. The issues of this book goes deeper than cheating, it shows how important it is to get fully involved in the life of the one you love. Ultimately, that is what connected Breck and Eric; she shared his passion and supported it. I highly recommend this book. I have read this book so many times I have lost count. A love that is taboo and forbidden but still is real."},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. When I found out who the author was. I hesitated to read it at first , being that I was so disappointed with Dream in Color. I am so glad that I decided to read the book after all. It turned out to be a very interesting story with some positive messages.I think this would be an interesting read for anyone who's been the other woman. There is definitely a message in this book. I understand that some viewers might ask what can possibly be positive about a man being unfaithful to his wife? But once you read the book, you'll understand how god works in mysterious ways.Other then the title and the cover of the book, I think the author did great the second time around. I am definitely looking foward to her next book."},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"The story of an affair, from the point of view of the other woman. It seemed trite to me, how everything was soooooooooo right between Eric and Breck (the mistress, all I could think of was shampoo every time I read her name). The wife came off as cold-hearted, of course. Very stereotypical affair story, nothing really surprising. The end was ridiculously shortchanged. It was the only really interesting part, and the author chopped it down to several pages. Boring, boring climax."},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"This novel was disturbingly compelling. It conjured up negative feelings being a wife of someone who has strayed. I was also very true because being in love with one and married to another is a very hard thing to do. When realizing you have married the wrong one, what do you do? I got really sick of Breck's whining and tantrums. She came in eyes wide open. It also looks better from the other side of the fence and protecting your heart is not easy business. She could have avoided it but then, we not have had a book to enjoy. Read it for yourself and get in touch with the emotions it brings to surface."},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"This book had me turning page after page trying to see how she would outdo herself. Darlene wrote As We Lay exceptionally well, and asked not just married people, but people in general the question, 'how well do you know the one you love?' I could not put down this book to see what Breck, Eric, and my personal favorite, Chi, (Kie), were going to do next. This is a fabulous read for any and everybody."},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"I loved this story. Darlene Johnson wrote a story that was real that anybody could relate to.

I thought the story line was well done and the characters as well. The story had a number of twist and turns and just when you thought one thing would happen another spin was dropped in your lap.

But I hope maybe a sequel will be written for this book."},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"I'm a married woman of 10 yrs. with three kids, so from the start I had already made up my mind that I wasn't going to like reading about a married man cheating on his wife. What married woman wants to read about a married man falling in love with another woman other than his wife. We know infidelity is wrong, but it happens. Most affairs happen when there are problems in a marriage. If people learn to communicate and realy become ONE in their marriage, infidelity will drop. It's sad to say that in most cases in infidelity, I've seen where it has had many marriages stronger, because it was a wake up call. Now in the case of the main male character Eric, even though I felt like he was in love with his mistress as well has his wife, the time he devoted in lieing to his wife to be with his mistress, should have been devoted in communicating with his wife on trying to work out the problems he saw in their marriage. We all make choices in life, weather good for bad, it's the end result that we have to live with. No one is perfect, and good people sometimes make bad choices."},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"Indianapolis architect, Breck Lawson, steps out of her self-preservationist' shoes to fall in love with a charismatic client, who catapults her career to designing fame. She leaves her hometown, her parents and her past bad relationships behind for Boston. Eric Warren of Warren & Peterson Property Management, her dashing new sweetheart lives there. . But this great catch is no Prince Charming. He's a devoted father and committed husband to a woman, who he has no intentions of divorcing, not even when Breck becomes pregnant with his son. Will Breck listen to her family and friends and let Eric go? Will Eric have second thoughts and leave his wife? Will his wife find out and throw a wrench in their plans, or will the two boys become saving graces for both families?When I saw the title to this novel, As We Lay, I immediately thought of Shirley Murdock's classic hit song whose title has the same namesake. Both Breck and Eric live their lives with a let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may attitude. Although they both know what they are doing is wrong, they can't tear themselves away from each other long enough to make an ethical decision. Breck's independence and drive has always kept her from surrendering herself to a committed relationship. So, in the beginning of the relationship, she is quite cavalier about Eric's other life. It isn't a threat to her until she bares their son, Jordan. Eric is the best version of Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde that I've seen since the Robert Luis Stevenson classic. Both he and Breck epitomize the human condition, the ability to exist between heaven and hell.Darlene Johnson is a master at presenting this love triangle in a way that keeps the reader questioning the validity of what happens to Breck and Eric, and the reality that it could happen to anyone of us. Johnson is such a great plot twister. I did not entirely agree with the resolution and ending. She has the writing capability to churn out a more controversial resolution, to haunt us at the end and leave us breathless. I wanted her to step out and floor me like she did in the first turning point and the climax. This ending cheapened all that she worked for in the beginning and the middle, which dropped the piece to something more average than exceptional.This book is provocative, sexy and a surprise. You will like it and talk about it for months to come. Nice book for a reading club.Dee Y. StewartR.E.A.L. Reviewers"},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"AS WE LAY takes a hard look at the price of having an affair with a married man; a price ultimately paid by everyone close to the relationship...Ms. Johnson tells this story with a uniquely mature look at infidelity, void of the intense drama so prevalent in somerelationship novels. And while this story in no way condones their volatile affair, it certainly gives an unrestricted view of the other side. And it escalates this situation to more than just a clear-cut right or wrong issue. There are lessons to be learned on all sides. Bold, deliberate, and provocatively real, this is a monumental read.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersComplete review can be found on our website..."},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"It is somewhat difficult to review this book because I have positive and negative feelings about this book. As We Lay was told from the mistress' point of view, which did give you a insight as to what the other woman is thinking. I am engaged to a man I have been with for ten years and personally I don't like women that mess with other people's men. I sometimes wonder how women can be satisified with being second best, agreeing to be seen when he can get away, and sleep alone every night. But Brett's attitude did shed some light on how some women think. There was way to much unneccessary dialogue in this book. Brett and Eric don't even meet face to face until 100 pages into the book!! The author spent alot of time describing the atmosphere and other things than making the actual storyline exciting. I felt like the story could have had much more drama being the situation was Eric sleeping with two women. But that must not be her writing style. Brenda Hampton, Zane, or Carl Weber would have ate that storyline alive!! Darlene Johnson didn't include Eric and Gaby's relationship enough. I wanted to go inside of their world, not just Eric and Brett's. I also agree with the other reviewers about the ending. It made me so mad. The tragic incident was so abrupt and seemed to come out of nowhere. Like I said, I have a negative and positive opinion about this book. Well, I guess I didn't say much positive. I did enjoy looking from the other woman's view. But once a man has vowed to God to be with someone else till death do you part, he is off limits! And Brett and Eric never would have discovered whatever it was that they felt about each other had they never pursued it. You can't miss what you never had."},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"Is this book being made into a movie?! Excellent, simply excellent. We saw the characters. We saw action. The dialogue was believeable and real. I was moved. I turned the page without skipping over them (a good sign). I would have liked it if the author had developed the ending a little more. It ended rather abruptly and could have gone on for at least a few more hundred pages and I would have continued to read to see what happened next. Ms. Johnson, will there be a sequel to this book?"},{"Title":"As We Lay: A Novel (Strivers Row)","review":"This was a very good book with a very good twist. When I first began to read the book it bored me with to much dialogue but as the story went on it just got better and better.

The book starts with the absolute basics of classical logic and then builds to classical set theory. This half of the book is actually far superior to any of my other logic books since it puts all the truely relevant material together in a very cogent manner.The second half of the book goes into the details of fuzzy logic and set theory while maintaining the easy style and excellent examples of the previous sections. This book, while intended as a textbook, is quite readable for those who just wish to have better knowledge of fuzzy logic. I suspect that many of the Aristotelian-based classical logicians will be hard-pressed to surpass Klir's clear explanations for their home turf.Klir delves into the philosophical basis for the existence of fuzzy logic and I feel he does an excellent job. Haack should really read this again and then reconsider her grand statement that &quot;I believe truth does not come in degrees&quot; with some of the open-mindedness evidenced by Klir.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Set Theory: Foundations and Applications","review":"Wow. It's a real shame that this book costs so much. The explanations of classical set theory and fuzzy set theory are simple, clear, and not too hard to understand. I would have liked to have seen some answers to selected problems in this text. Still, for anyone who wants to learn fuzzy set theory or review the basics, here is a very excellent place to go.The book discusses alpha cuts, strong alpha cuts, classical set theory, fuzzy set theory, classical relations, fuzzy relations, classical logic, multivalued logics and their fuzzy systematization, and more. It also contains a short reference list for further study."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Set Theory: Foundations and Applications","review":"I use this book for a course in the first semester. The students are not familiar with deeper mathematical ideas (not even with the one of a limit), but still thanks to Klir's book they are able to follow a kind of up-to-date mathematics. One of the advantages of the book is that all the principal ideas (operations, relations, logic) are firstly explained in the crisp case and then in the fuzzy case."},{"Title":"Daedalus's Children: Part Two of Two (Star Trek: Enterprise)","review":"Star Trek-Enterprise: Daedalus's Children is part 2 of the adventure started in the first book called \\"Daedalus\\" and this book concludes the very well-written adventure written by David Stern.\\"Daedalus's Children\\" takes off from where \\"Daedalus\\" adventure left off and tells an action-packed adventure where Captain Jonathan Archer shines and plays a majors roll in a good character novel bringing into play the rest of the major characters in the Star Trek-Enterprise series. We get really good character play and problem solving as the charater interact with the adventure at hand.That adventure is three fold in nature as first the Enterprises and her crew have to be reunited with each other, next Captain Archer must work to solve a civil war that is about to breakout on Denari and deal with the oppressive ruler's \\"son.\\" And, the third prong of theis adventure deals with getting back home to their own \\"Universe.\\"There are twists and turns and heartbreak in the book along with unexpected love affairs and the consequences conserning all of this three fold adventure. \\"Daedalus's Children\\" is a well-told action-adventure that will keep the reader's attention till the end as event arise and problems are thrown into the mix you'll read on trying to see if the Enterprise crew is up to the task at hand.I found the book to be quite captivating and it piqued my interest as I read the first 250 pages in the first setting. I couldn't put the book down. If you like the Star Trek-Enterprise television episodic adventure you'll be glad to know this book doesn't disturbe that timeline what-so-ever. Just that we read another well though out adventure.As I've said, this book incorporates the whole Enterprise crew to work closely to solve this adventure, along with the Daedalus's crew as they try to solve a Quantum Universe mysteryI found this book to be better than \\"Daedalus\\" David Stern's first book in the series as he really gets all of Enterprise working in this three-fold adventure. For this book, I gave \\"Daedalus's Children\\" a solid 5 star rating as it kept the reader involved and into the story. Captivating with intrigue and action-adventure and the story is well-written and keeps the reader engrossed till the end."},{"Title":"Daedalus's Children: Part Two of Two (Star Trek: Enterprise)","review":"While part one of this two part series seemed like a pursuit into the life and times of Charles Tucker III, this one was a little more balanced in its use of the crew of the Enterprise.I liked the way Stern delved into the histories of the character by bringing up the striking differences between this stories universe and the real one. We get to see the struggle of Archer and crew to fight the ailments of this universe and obtain their freedom from the quarreling factions in this universe.This was a very good completion to a well develop story. Having finished them both part of me would have liked to see them combined into one novel. There seemed to a little too much filler but more story then a single novel. If you enjoyed the first part, you have no choice but to pick this book up and see if the crew makes it home."},{"Title":"Daedalus's Children: Part Two of Two (Star Trek: Enterprise)","review":"I don't much care for 2-part stories, in which the first book has no proper ending, and the second book picks up in mid-story, which is why I marked this book (and its predecessor) down to four stars. Additionally, the actual ending was somewhat abrupt and anticlimactic, after having been built up to be a major issue, but that wasn't enough of a drawback to justify marking an otherwise excellent story down to three stars. The writing itself was quite good, the characterizations well-handled, and the action gripping and intense. Mr. Stern shows an excellent touch as a writer, and I look forward to seeing more of his work -- preferably in stand-alone stories."},{"Title":"Daedalus's Children: Part Two of Two (Star Trek: Enterprise)","review":"Daedalus's Children was entertaining and was well written overall, but I found the long-winded writing and blatent mistakes frequently frustrating. And most of the main characters from the television show, which the book is based on, took a back seat to many new minor characters.This book seemed to have been rushed to the shelves before being adequately proof-read. For example, a character named Duel is given the rank of an Ensign in the first book, but on page 7 of this book Duel is called Lieutenant, then again called Ensign on page 25. Also, on page 234, a junior Enterprise engineer named Hess is on an alien ship with Archer before Archer is reunited with Enterprise. However, Hess was present on Enterprise on pages 211-221 at the same time as he was supposed to be with Archer. This obvious mistake of one character in two places at once cannot be explained away with parallel universes.The story itself is smart and fun, but in an effort to be an epic two-parter, it greatly overreaches. In chapter 19, Captain Archer fights a frustrating twenty-page space battle in a little scout craft, though it can't really be called a space battle because it is only between his lone craft and three enemy ships. In page after page, nothing happens, save rediculous references to maneuvers learned at the Academy. Of course, Archer's little ship is victorious. And none of this actually matters, because it makes no sense for Archer to be on the craft anyway; his small crew's presence there was poorly explained as a need for a reconnaissance vessel that somehow couldn't be manned by any of the vast Denari crew.But the greatest damage to the plot was having Archer direct the Denari war to an outcome of his choosing. Hasn't Stern seen any of the television shows? Sure, the Prime Directive isn't around yet, but having Archer interfere so thoroughly with an alien war in another universe when he only saw one side of the conflict goes against all common sense.While all the main characters from the television show need not be central to every Trek book, the plethora of minor characters were confusing and overshadowed almost all the main crew. I read an Enterprise book to read about the televised cast, not a whole new crew. If I was looking for that, I would be reading the New Frontier series or the Stargazer series. All the references to people Dave Stern knows were just annoying.Any good Star Trek novel should be written as though it were a television episode or a movie. Instead, they often expand upon the show so much just to fill pages that they end up becoming almost unrecognizeable as occuring in the Trek universe. I did enjoy Daedalus, and this book almost as much, but halfway through this book I found myself longing for it to end."},{"Title":"Daedalus's Children: Part Two of Two (Star Trek: Enterprise)","review":"I'm usually not a fan of parallel universe stories but this one snuck up on me and I must say this story was well done. This was a good addition to the Enterprise story vault and kept me interested. I wasn't prepared for the two part story line and grumbled at the end of the first one (Daedalus) but now I'm glad I read both. If you are a trekkie and like the Enterprise series and the characters, you will enjoy this tale."},{"Title":"Daedalus's Children: Part Two of Two (Star Trek: Enterprise)","review":"This is a very good story, enjoyed it, could not put it down. It is a real shame that the series got cut just as it was getting much better. Great ending, good classic Star Trek type story"},{"Title":"Daedalus's Children: Part Two of Two (Star Trek: Enterprise)","review":"Daedalus's Children was a fine conclusion to the two-part series. Another fast paced, page-turning book, it continues a story of the Enterprise crew being drawn to the center of major political turmoil in an alien star system.While Tucker and Hoshi continue to play an important role in the story, this book, refreshingly, broadens the plot to include the entire Enterprise crew. Additional characters - the leaders of varios factions - can be appretiated as well. I was pleased to find that Trip's romantic interest, which was barely explored in the first book, was given much more thorough treatment in this one.As with the first book, the author's blunt, dialoug-heavy writing style is appreciated. It makes for quick reading and allows an Enterprise fan's knowledge of the show to fill in background details.One star is missing from my review because of another poorly-done plot mechanism. Without giving too much away, there is one major predicament the crew faces (among many) which seems insurmountable. But, suddenly an easy solution is found and an entire sub-plot is retired with little fanfare.Still, the book is a lot of fun to read. Like the first book, I recommend it to any fan of Enterprise."},{"Title":"Daedalus's Children: Part Two of Two (Star Trek: Enterprise)","review":"A very good 2 volume series.

He blows a mortal wound into the traditional and Pharasaic idea that there is only one Bible in the English language that can be used.He rebuts - from their own words - the spectra of KJV Only people from the vicious Ruckman to the gracious Hills. He demonstrates the conspiracy theory mindset of Gail Riplinger and shows that her charts, \\"research\\" and conclusion are fatally flawed.There are, however, a few weaknesses in the book. The biggest one is that in trying to defend the modern conservative translations, White goes too far and implies that in EVERY instance where there is a textual variant, the KJV rendering is inferior. The only exception he appears to make is at I Timothy 3:16 where he grants superiority to the KJV rendering of \\"God\\" as opposed to \\"he.\\" Although White makes a disclaimer, it is hard to swallow given that he cites only the aforementioned example of a KJV superior read.The book also could have dealt with more mainstream KJV Defenders such as Thomas Holland, Thomas Strouse, and Theodore Letis.

I saw many people using the old \\"morning star\\" argument, which James White very clearly covers in his book. The phrase \\"morning star\\" (besides being the accurate translation from the Hebrew) is used in Isaiah SARCASTICALLY.I would also like to say that the author of this book would probably be very upset that a reviewer here used it to argue against sola scriptura, since White is a strong supporter of the Solas. He does not argue that scripture is insufficient, merely that we shouldn't regard a certain translation in of itself to be sufficient. In fact, it is his belief in sola scriptura that shows how the textus receptus is imperfect, such as Erasmus' including certain lines just to satisfy the papacy. It is White's belief in sola scriptura that causes him to say that we shouldn't add (or delete) passages simply because it was traditional. Instead, it should depend upon Scripture alone, that is, what do the manuscripts actually say.All in all, this is an excellent book. I do admit that I agree with some of the other reviewers when they detect some arrogance in James White's wordings. Still, I don't think it comes off as much in this book as it does in some of his others.

I promise you this text will more than explain why so many jump on the KJO bandwagon and why so many have NEVER GOTTEN OFF OF IT. I also recommend that you visit Mr. White's website(http://aomin.org/kjvo.html) and see how dogmatic many of these people are and how downright slanderous they can be to other believers. Pay special attention to &quot;James White's refutation of Gail Riplinger's book, New Age Bible Versions! You'll clearly see from the refutation how so many KJO believers are just simply uninformed. I leave you with a quote from &quot;one of them&quot;: &quot;If it was good enough for Paul, it's good enough for me.&quot;"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I agree with the assessment of one reviewer below: White's book IS both condescending AND evasive! CONDESCENDING in his attitude toward a postion he despises; EVASIVE in his avoidance of the real issue (divine preservation of scripture) in favor of &quot;noble&quot; indictments of extreme positions and whacked-out personalities.This book has been found intimidating by many KJV advocates and little wonder- It was WRITTEN to intimidate! Still, I truly believe White really is off base in many of his contentions and conceits.One of White's supporters here speaks nobly of &quot;thinking for one's self.&quot; Here, then, is my challenge:Go ahead and read White's book-- I did!

Did Gad the prophet warn David of SEVEN years of famine (2 Samuel 24:13), or rather three years (1 Chronicles 21:12)? The KJV reads that Michal had no child unto the day of her death (2 Samuel 6:23) yet says that MICHAL HAD FIVE SONS (2 Samuel 21:8)?IN THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION, THE NEW LIVING TRANSLATION, ETC., THESE ERRORS.... ERRORS, ERRORS, ERRORS,... DO NOT EXIST!!!!!!!!Let's not play panzy with this issue. The King James Version is a translation that has led people to Jesus Christ for hundreds of years and even today... but it still has errors and has went through radically different changes since the original authorized bible in 1611. The 1611 bible (I have a copy, put out by Nelson Publishers -- \\"A word-for-word reprint of the First Edition of the Authorized Version presented in roman letters...\\") had the apocryphal books in it (Tobit, Maccabees, etc.), used them in the reference columns of the New Testament, had a listing of Catholic holidays (the purification of the Virgin Mary, the annunciation of our lady) and has this lesson from the original translators in the preface of the KJV....\\"Wee affirme and auow, that the very maeanest translation of the Bible in English, set foorth by men of ourr profession containeth the word of God, nay, is the word of God\\"Many KJV-onlyist attack scholars who participate in and endorse newer translations of the Bible? We all have sin, and if you don't think so then the truth isn't in you (1 John 1:8). Why did King James want another English translation, when prior translations in english already existed ... translations that even the translators of the KJV admit are to be considered the Word of God? Did Jesus sin by quoting the Greek Septuagint? Was there no Christian saved until 1611? Must a foreign convert learn english and then the KJV? Which of the many revisions of the KJV is the true one? Aren't many of the sources used by the authors of the KJV contradictory to each other in many texts?Didn't King James himself... order the beheading of his very own mother? ...disband Parliament? ...have a tendency of being a homosexual pedophile? ...burn witches at the stake?I appreciate the efforts of James White's book, \\"The King James Only Controversy\\", and it has many legitimate points concerning translation methods and other languages. But no ordinary Christian is going to read it -- for the most part, it's a very boring read and is still \\"greek\\" to those who don't know about the issue.My favorite chapter is 8, \\"The Son of God, Lord of Glory\\". White explains very well of how the modern translations indicate that Jesus is God, while the KJV clearly doesn't and is ambiguous. Charts comparing Titus 2:13 and 2 Peter 1:1 are very compelling.John 1:18 is the best example. The KJV says \\"the only begotten Son\\" while the NASB reads \\"only begotten God.\\" Says author James White \\"John 1:18 is one of the clearest, strongest affirmations of the deity of Christ. Yet, we see that the KJV does not contain this reference to the deity of Christ... Suffice it to say that the most ancient texts, including the oldest existing copies of the book of John... as well as a number of the early fathers fo the church, refer to Christ as the \\"only-begotten God,\\" or more accurately, the \\"unique God.\\" If KJV Only advocates are consistent, they should welcome this reading of the modern texts over against the Textus Receptus.\\" (p.199-200)Amen. I'll be reading my New Living Translation Life Application Study Bible in good conscience. Many others will be doing the same, apparently. \\"The King James Only Controversy\\" is backed by J.I.

I grew up in a church that taught we should only use the KJV. This confused me at times but I went along with it. Eventually at Bible College I began to study it more and have discovered that this position is not correct. It is by no means \\"satanic\\" or \\"manipulation of the devil\\" as some would say for those who use modern versions, but it does not align with the truth of history and the Bible itself. Here is a quote from Dr. White's book: \\"The KJV was not the first English translation nor the last. Hence, it is perfectly logical to ask 'Why should I use it as the standard to test all others?'\\" Dr. White examines the entire issue in a very fair and honest way. If you claim to be a Christian, buy this book and read it so that you can understand the truth.

The book is divided into two parts.

The Son of God, the Lord of Glory9. Problems in the KJV10. Questions and AnswersChapter 1 - the background and types of KJV followers.Chapter 2 - the history of the KJV and how it came to be. White gets into a bit of the early transcripts in this section.Chapter 3 - the transcripts available to us, biblical languages and the scribal process.Chapter 4 - more on Erasmus, Stephanus and Beza moving on to the KJV translation. White effectively begins to use charts in this chapter to show us differences between translations and manuscripts.Chapter 5 - specific examples from the King James Only camp. He starts with E.F. Hill and moves on to Gail Riplinger and Peter Ruckman. He quotes liberally from their works and explains the error - sometimes small and often times great. Again, charts are used to show Scripture side-by-side and inadequate quotations from KJO books with what was really said by the one's being quoted.Chapter 6 - a potpourri of verses to show the difference between KJV and a newer translation (frequently NIV or NASB) with reasonings behind each translation.Chapter 7 - gets into greater detail about the textual differences between the early manuscripts. Includes dates, verse comparisons, discussion on variants.Chapter 8 - specifically looks at verses where the KJO camp claims to remove the deity of Christ.Chapter 9 - examines areas where the KJV fell short.Chapter 10 - really is some Q&A; like \\"Weren't Westcott and Hort occultists?\\"There is a bridge between the parts titled: Let the Reader Understand . . .Part two provided further discussion on specific verses - some that had been addressed more briefly in Part 1 and some additional ones. I was afraid I'd be lost in this section because White states that he's assuming the reader at this point is proficient in koine Greek or has the willingness to dig deeper. Well, I'm not proficient in koine Greek, so I expected to stumble through this part and I didn't. It may have been to my benefit that I've read a great deal on translations and I could obviously see the differences in the Greek phrases - although sometimes I did have really look to see them.My favorite areas were the ones where actual verses were compared and reasons were given for why they were different based on the manuscripts.I appreciated that White was willing to sift through material from Riplinger and Ruckman because I can only take either in small doses."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"King James Only Controversy brings to light the challenges of Christians today.

Can we trust the accuracy of the Bible?All of these questions are addressed in this second expanded edition of King James Only Controversy.The author states that his desire is to bring peace to Christ's church and quell restless spirits in congregations.This book has many differing views with wonderful commentary and helpful information. What a great reference book for scholars."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Thanks, first, to Jim Hart at Bethany House for this review copy of The King James Only Controversy.This was a very informative book, which balanced sound reasoning with fairness of judgment. That being said, my initial reaction to this controversy can be described as incredulity; I saw this book as likely being little more than a thrown-together argument against something unworthy of the time and energy. Instead, the author has made a compelling case for our ability to trust modern translations. It provides readers with an appropriate background to understand how their Bible has come to possess the text it does and make an informed decision when selecting a Bible for study in the future.The introduction adequately presents the need for a book of this kind, sharing briefly the general attitude of those involved in the \\"controversy\\", the idea that the King James Version (KJV) alone is scripture and that anything other is a departure from the whole truth of the gospel. The introduction also addresses the need for well-informed believers who can process their faith and their Biblical study without thehindrance of faulty logic. Finally, it stresses the ability to trust in the integrity of what has been transmitted to us over time in the Bible.Chapter 1 discusses the spectrum within those who might self-describe as KJV-only. These include those who like the style and text of the KJV best, those who argue for the Greek underpinning the KJV to be the best, those who see the KJV as God's providential protection of Scripture, those who see the English of the KJV as having the same level of inspiration as the source texts, and those who see the KJV as new revelation, even \\"correcting\\" mistakes in the source manuscripts. This chapter also concludes with appropriate guidelines for selecting a Bible - things like translation methodology, use of a particulartranslation by spiritual leaders, study notes and content - noting that acceptance by the fellow-Christians and intimidation should not be considerations in the selection of a Bible. I thought he was wise to suggest using multiple translations.Chapters 2-4 presents a historical backdrop to the controversy. Chapter 2 presents the controversy as essentially repeating the mistakes of previous generations which also clung to established translations and traditions. I found it highly readable - full of irony but written in a style that was not confrontational or demeaning. Chapter 3 discusses textual criticism and text transmission, and is not solely focused on theKJV position. It is brimming with information, but is not \\"bookish\\". White's intention throughout is to make the material approachable. It is worth noting that the information presentedis mostly focused on the Greek manuscript base. Chapter 4 addresses the Textus Receptus and its relationship to the KJV-only position.Chapters 5-8 provide the main rebuttal of the KJV-only position. Chapter 5 focuses on the nature and character of the debate, and is meant to establish the way in which major proponents of theKJV -only position think, speak and write. It is slightly unpleasant to read, not because White makes it so, but because of the clarity with which White describesKJV-only rhetoric that spans the gamut between misrepresentation and hate-speech. Chapter 6 deals with commonly used arguments/references that are based on differences in the English words used to translate the same underlying Greek expressions. Chapter 7 addresses arguments resulting from differences in the underlying Greek used as the basis for translation, and is dependent on a thorough understanding of the material presented in chapter 3. Chapter 8 addresses those arguments which suggest modern translations, over against the KJV, intend to hide or reduce the deity of Christ.Chapter 9 is a critical response to the KJV itself. Though not meant to attack those who would use the KJV, it demands a response by anyone who would make a claim for inerrancy of the KJV text by pointing out mistranslations of the Greek and poor decisions made by translators. Chapter 10 follows this with questions and answers geared at those who would read the book critically. Finally, a rich index is provided with key passage references (Old Testament and New) as well as references to Greek terms covered.The text is free from noticeable errors, though I did note a couple of issues in the footnotes (e.g. an improper citation on p. 216 and a misplaced form of a Greek word on p. 257). White's reasoning is clear and logical for the most part, though I did find some of his claims about \\"circular logic\\" to be misplaced. He is quite right that the arguments presented within KJV-only resources are often circular. But he mistakes asking different questions (thus not working from the same assumptions or with the same goals) for circularity of logic (see chapter 6), which is not always the case.In summary: The early sections are a good introduction to text criticism, while the latter ones are full of examples without too much repetition. It was much better than I had imagined it would be!"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Whether you agree with the author or not this book should be read by everyone who has encountered the KJV-Only position commonly held in some Baptist circles (I consider myself in this category). He systematically covers the entire topic and also addresses every argument posed by the KJV-Only crowd, including Riplinger and Ruckman. I think that it would be impossible to read this book with an honest truth-seeking mind and come away still holding the KJV-Only position."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I was interested in this book because a friend of mine told me the NIV was wrong, and that the KJV was the only correct bible. I already use the NIV and KJV together to aid in understanding, but I was amazed to discover that the NIV and other versions were not just &quot;re-wordings&quot;. It is now obvious, however, that, with only a couple of exceptions, there is no version that is &quot;wrong&quot;. Each translation has its strong points and weak points. Any person who believes that this book attacks the KJV obviously either did not read the book or went into it with a predetermined idea that it is wrong. The main point in this book is that, although there are some textual and translational differences, whether you read the KJV, NIV, NASB, NKJV, or whatever, THE MESSAGE IS THE SAME. There are no doctrinal differences, as careful study will show. God did preserve His word, but He also gave us the brains to read and study. By saying that God's word can only come through one source is limiting God's power. There are much greater issues in this world for Christians to be concerned about.The author does respond to a few personal attacks by KJV-Only writers, but he does so with much less venom and much more logic than his attackers. My only problem with this book (and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that it assumes a familiarity with Greek and Hebrew that most people don't have."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Excellent book which describes the basics of how the Bible came into being, the way translations are made, and the straw-man arguments and outright lies of the KJVO camp.I question if those who gave this book a negative review actually read it."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"This is a book not only with sound scholarship, but also with a real heart and concern for those involved in the issue.

Basically a great study on the topic that exposes and strips away the emotion, leaving you with the facts."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"James White has done a excellent job covering the subject. He is thorough in providing manuscript evidence, yet readable enough for the average layman. Instead of resorting to name-calling and circular reasoning, White lets history and the manuscript evidence speak for themselves. Especially insightful is his chapter on the deity of Christ (\\"The Son of God, the Lord of Glory\\"), which decidedly proves there is no conspiracy by modern translators to denegrate our Lord Jesus Christ. Even if you do not come away agreeing with every conclusion, you will understand why modern translations read the way they do. The modern conservative versions are not \\"New Age\\", but sincere attempts to come closer to God's truth.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is trying to resolve this issue for themselves, or to someone seeking material to present to a Sunday School class or Bible study."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"As a member of an Independent, Fundamental, Bible-Believing, Baptist Church, this book was very well written. The documentation and the footnotes were helpful. Having a copy of the original 1611 KJV I was able to see many of the examples Dr. White cited. I have also read Brother Grady's book on the subject many years ago and was very uneasy about the worship of a book instead of God. The Father has preserved His Word in the Greek and Hebrew as He promised...no where can you find a hint that He would preserve it through a translation, which is exactly what the King James Version is. Dr. White's information on the Textus Receptus is also an eye-opener. I highly recommend this book because it once and for all helped me settle the question that is dividing Christians and His Church. Satan must be laughing to see God's Children squabbling over His Word. I urge all Christians to get back to the study of His Word, stop the bickering and get back to the task at hand...leading others to Christ. And believe me, you can lead someone to Christ using a Roman Catholic Bible, NAS, NIV or KJV."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Very exhaustive work. It revealed many fallacies presented by the KJV Only group and their methods of attack on believers. When challenged with hard facts the KJV Only group simply throws firebrands of emotion at all the arguments."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Before reading this book, I had been exposed to arguments from the &quot;KJV Only&quot; crowd, and was curious if their arguments held water. Once I was able to see the evidence behind each position, I was firmly convinced of the veracity of Mr. White's arguments. If you come to this book (or any other one) with the premise that it is incorrect or &quot;pretty much written by Satan,&quot; you've already made up your mind and no amount of evidence can convince you otherwise. Intellect only functions when it is not overruled by emotion and pride in one's own position. As a soon-to-be graduated engineer, I found this book to be completely logical, both in its reasons for not holding the KJV inerrant, and in its justifications for the reliability of the new translations. An excellent work on an (obviously) polarizing topic, presented even-handedly and fairly."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"In this book, \\"The King James Only Controversy,\\" James White masterfully defends against King James Onlyism in a way that both laymen and scholars can appreciate. The issue is too important to ignore as James White explains in the early chapters. Instead of jumping right into the \\"meat,\\" White explains the issues in regards to the controversy. I really appreciated the early chapters because it laid a much needed foundation; namely, to distinguish between the various forms of King James Onlyism.Unfortunately, many reviewers have unfairly criticized White for supposedly only dealing with the extreme forms of KJV onlyism. Although a large portion of the book is devoted to refuting Gail Riplinger and Peter Ruckman, in no way could anyone accuse James White of \\"avoiding\\" any of the issues. If it were the other way around, all the Ruckman followers would complain. But I felt that James White was completely fair in his dealings with the most popular arguments put forward by King James Onlyists.Therefore, if you are looking for something to get you started in the area of textual criticism, then this book is for you. In fact, I couldn't image a better introductory work on the subject. Don't let the unsubstantiated claims of the KJVonly reviewers fool you. Read this book for yourself and come to your own conclusion."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"James White has written an outstanding work for anyone who's been harrassed by those who claim that God only speaks in the archaic English of the KJV-1611 (or rather the major 1769 revision by Dr Benjamin Blayney of Oxford -- most professed KJV-1611 defenders have never even seen what it is they profess to defend!).White lucidly explains the history of textual transmission and translation, and compares the KJV with good conservative modern translations such as the NIV, NASB and NKJV. This conclusively shows that there is no conspiracy to undermine the Deity of Christ in the modern versions, which are actually *clearer* in many places. For the more technically inclined readers, there are more detailed analyses of some of the key verses in the KJVO controversy.White also exposes the flawed logic of the KJVO defenders, e.g. begging the question. That is, they try to &quot;prove&quot; their position with charts comparing the KJV and modern versions showing what has been &quot;left out&quot; of the modern versions. But this presupposes that the KJV should be the standard. How do we know that the NIV and NASB aren't closer to the original, and that the KJV hasn't *added* things?As White shows, the latter is far more likely, because of the well-known tendency he calls &quot;expansion of piety&quot;. I.e. Jesus was so often called &quot;The Lord Jesus Christ&quot;, over 60 times in the allegedly corrupt Alexandrian manuscripts which the NASB and NIV largely, but not entirely, depend on. So some scribes encountering &quot;Jesus&quot; would put the phrase in the margin in places where Jesus occurred alone, and a subsequent scribe might think that it was meant to be included in the main text, so the next copy would have the expanded phrase. So the Textus Receptus (which the KJV largely but not entirely depends on) has &quot;The Lord Jesus Christ&quot; over 80 times.Wake up people!! Logically, an *omission* is not a *contradiction*! (Atheists should realise this when they accuse the Gospels of being &quot;contradictory&quot; because, e.g. only Matthew mentions people rising from the tombs when Jesus was crucified). If there were a Satanic/New Age conspiracy, then why would the phrase be left in over 60 times??The (much later) Greek manuscripts behind the TR have evidence of Scribes correcting what they wrongly thought were errors in the originals, filling out OT quotations (first in a margin, then in the main text by the nexxt scribe), conflating readings and harmonizing passages.On James White's Alpha and Omega site, he refutes KJVOs such as Marrs, Riplinger, Ruckman and his friend Holland. While KJVOs are concerned only with attacking modern versions, White spends far more time defending the vital doctrines of Christianity supposed to be under attack in the modern versions. E.g. White has written books defending the Trinity and opposing Roman Catholicism, and is a staunch believer in Biblical inerrancy.White also *does* believe in Biblical preservation, but points out that this does *not* entail that the Biblical texts were preserved in the way KJVOs claim it should be. Nothing in any of the proof texts entail that the Greek NT should be preserved in the TR or that the KJV-1611/1769 is the infallible English translation of this.White points out that God has providentially preserved the text from wholesale tinkering via multiple copying and wide geographical spread, and burying very early manuscripts in the arid sands of Egypt out of reach of corruptors, and enabling them to be discovered 1800 years later.White also deals with the main &quot;proof text&quot; of Biblical preservation, Psalm 12:3-7, including (KJV) &quot;Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.&quot; White shows that the verb &quot;preserve&quot; is a masculine singular, while the term &quot;words&quot; in &quot;words of the LORD&quot; in verse 6 is a feminine plural. Therefore the preservation in this passage *cannot* refer to the words in v. 6, but *must* refer to the people in v. 5. Even the KJV translators recognized this as shown in their footnote (yes, the *real* KJV-1611 had these allegedly diabolical things!)."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"James White gives the most complete, sensible discussion of the issues involved in Bible translations. He refrains from attacking either side of the controversy, and explains why each of the translators made the choices they made. White also does not attack the King James Version, as some authors do, but rather presents the KJV as one of several good translations that can best be used in conjunction with each other. White specifically defends the NKJV, the NASB, and the NIV.Perhaps the best feature of this book is that it calls upon believers to investigate the issues honestly and objectively. White exhorts believers to avoid viewing modern versions as a big conspiracy to undermine the Word of God. Instead, he shows that each of the translations he defends have strengths and weaknesses, and that each of those versions excel in one way or another.In an age where some people think that truth is determined by who yells the loudest, it is great to have a scholarly book that presents the issues with light and not heat."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I at one time was a KJV only Christian because of wanting to make sure I had as close as I could of God's Word. I have Gail Riplinger's tapes (3) and books and trusted her as a Christian for truth. After reading The King James Only Controversy by White I now see how deceiving any book can be. James does a true job of showing how people can twist anything to support what they think they have discovered in their findings. His book is supported the way I would have wished Riplinger was. I once trusted her writings but not anymore. I now do what White suggests from his book, I read all versions and my understanding has increased greatly. I only wished I would have read White's book sooner. I highly recommend it to all Christians seeking the truth as well as all of White's books.

By James R. White is now an updated expanded second edition. I never got a chance to read the original edition and I know the question on many people's mind is \\"Why is an new edition needed? - I thought the KJV only thing died out awhile ago.\\" While the main focus of the book is to explain and help the reader understand how and why the King James and modern translations (i.e. NIV, ESV, NKJV, and NASB to name a few) came into being and how the scholars and translators chose the English words to explain the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek words.This book is a great introduction to Textual Criticism (which is not bad at all) and the reliability of the modern Bible translations we have. It will also help the reader understand the Bible better and help them defend it when questioned about the reliability of it. It is not a hard book to read but it is not an easy book either - it will make you think.As Mr. White states repeatedly - this is NOT an anti-KJV book but more of a call for a greater understanding in the church on how we have the translations we have and how accurate they are.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a friend in the KJV-only camp and/or wants a greater understanding on how we have gotten our Bibles we have today."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"This book helped me clarify my position the KJV controversy. Dr. White is very thorough in his refutation of the KJV Only crowd. There are only a few places where I think he stretches his point or offers a weak argument. However, his scholarship and method of explanation are very clear and succinct. This is more than I can say about Gail Riplinger's New Age Versions. Though Dr. White's thrust is to disprove the false notions of the KJV Only crowd, in the end his philosophy is balanced.For those who think this book debases the KJV don't be mistaken. Dr. White, in my opinion dignifies the KJV as well as some modern versions. It may appear at some points that he is denigrating the KJV but he is merely showing that EVERY translation has its shortcomings.When I started this book I was using the KJV as my \\"official\\" Bible and referencing other translations such as the NIV, AMP, ESV, RSV, and HCSB to help me with hard to understand passages. Now that I am done with the book I am still doing the same. The book did not dethrone the KJV or my love for it in the least.I was educated and encouraged by this great read.

Until I received this book, I was totally in the dark and unfortunately I still am, but only because I refuse to get involved in such an inane and pointless discussion.The King James Only Controversy by author James R. White, while thorough in its investigation was difficult for me to read because it was too detailed. It reads like a 'he said, she said' type of book and quite frankly, lost my interest early on. Bethany House states that it was written with the lay person in mind and while it did lead you through the basics, it became so repetitive that after pages of reading this version says that and that one says this, eventually I just gave up. The one thing that I can say that is good about this book, is that it is thorough and not only gives the reader a detailed and accurate history of the bible and how we came to have so many versions, it also gives the view point of the KJV only camp and why they are adamant that they have the right version. Of course, the author points out that they don't and so the controversy continues."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"This was one of the first books that showed me the truth and released me from the delusion of church brain washing.Mr. White goes through the King James version and compares it to the original manuscripts in Greek and explains specifically why the King James version is a bad English Translation.He proved it to me after I had spent years studing the bible and I was a fundamentalist Christian when I read this book.WARNING:IF YOU ARE A BIBLE BELIEVING CHRISTIAN, BE CAREFUL THIS BOOK COULD START YOU DOWN A ROAD OF LOSING YOUR FAITH IF YOU CONTINUE PURSUING MORE TRUTH. 200 books later I am now a Gnostic Buddhist."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"The Bible has never been, nor can ever be, the sole standard of defence and definition of Christian faith and practise. There are those who believe in a perfect Bible but still disagree on the Lord's Supper (memorial/real presence), views on war(just war/pacifism), salvation (predestination/free-will), eternal security (once saved alwas saved/self determination), baptism's significants (nonessential/essential) and method of administration(infant/adult,immertion/sprinkling), etc. Neither the doctrine of inerrancy (i.e. everything it teaches is true) or perfection (that man wrote word for word what God dictated to him) makes the Bible's meaning automatic, nor does either guarentee its correct interpretations. Realize that for centuries, the early church had no clearly defined canon. In the early church the NT was NOT AN (A RELIGIOUS REFERENCE BOOK), it was something that they were living. Their Covenant was not a covenant to paper, but to a Person-Jesus Christ. Neither did the believer need a Script in hand to \\"bear witness\\" of Him, His presence in their midst was their greatest witness (Matt 28:18)The Orthodox Church's interpretation of Scriptures echoes the experience of God's people everywhere throughout all ages. In short, if someone tries telling you that salvation is somehow easy, simple and cheap run don't walk in the other direction.

While individuals are free to differ on the topic of translations, we are not free to violate truth with inaccuracy. Dr. White, in his attempt to correct the KJV movement, offers several blunders of his own. Here are just a few:1) White sites Dr. Kurt Aland's statement regarding the tenacity of a textual variant as evidence of his (White's) view of preservation (p. 48). The fact that Dr. Aland was not referring to preservation does not seem to bother Dr. White. Nor does the fact that textual scholars believe some readings have been lost through the process of transmission.2) White sites that Dr. G. S. Paine as evidence that the KJV translators undertook the task in order to receive favor from the Crown (p. 70). However, Paine (who is a better writer and scholar) says nothing of the kind.3) White claims that no one printed the KJV for the first 100 years of its existence except for the Royal Printer (p. 244). The fact that both Oxford and Cambridge Universities printed the KJV within that time frame seems to have escaped White's knowledge. As does the fact that the KJV was printed in other countries long before 1711.4) White claims there were no homosexuals on the NIV translating committee (p. 245) and then notes that Dr. Virginia Mollenkott (a practicing lesbian) served as English stylist for the NIV. Are we splitting hairs here?5) White claims the KJV translators were inconsistent in their translation of 2 Peter 1:1 and 1:11 (p. 268). However, he never notes that the Greek text used by the KJV translators was Beza's text and does not read as he presents.6). White claims the KJV translators would have translated 2 Corinthians 2:17 as \\"peddle\\" and not as \\"corrupt\\" if they were alive today (p. 114). Yet he fails to note that Dr. John Boise, who was one of the KJV translators, noted that some translate it as \\"peddle.\\" However, he and the committee understood that the peddling concerned misusing the merchandize and came to be understood as \\"corrupt.\\"Instead of finding fault with the KJV movement (which is self-evident), Dr. White would do better to research his evidence."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"In response to T-Dogg and the supposed contradictions in the KJV, here is a explanation that addresses 2 of his \\"contradictions in the KJV\\".

Here is a great example:http://www.geocities.com/brandplucked/8or18.htmlThis is in response to the T-Dogg Review. The apparent contradictions he lists actually add more credence to the literal translation of the KJV rather than add fuel to the superiority of his more modern translations.

I post this not as a review of this book, but as a refute to T-Dogg's post as automatically dismissing the superiority of the KJV."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"James White's book claims to be &quot;a plea for understanding&quot; in the continuing discussion over Bible versions (p. 249). However, it is marked by its author's profound misunderstanding of those who differ with him. The substance of White's charges is much less impressive than the smooth writing. He assures us, on p. VII, that he has endeavored to be fair, but time after time, we find a double standard laid down by the author: the rules are generous when modern versions are questioned, but strict and even unfair when applied to the KJV or its adherents. This may seem severe but is easily documented:1. White recommends: &quot;Whenever you encounter a supposed 'change' in the Bible's text [in modern translations], take time to look carefully at the available information. You will discover that there are reasons for the differences...&quot; (p. 146). But our author has failed to allow the same latitude to the KJV. Mr. White often blames the KJV for the fact that he himself does not understand a rendering and did not bother to check an unabridged dictionary to educate himself (e.g., pp. 145-6 [2 Tim. 3:12], p. 233 [Acts 12:4--&quot;Easter&quot; means &quot;Passover&quot;], p. 226 [1 Cor. 4:4]), p. 225 [Lk. 18:12], p. 238, note 3 [Mk. 6:20: the &quot;inferior&quot; KJV reading means exactly the same thing as the NAS reading!], ). White also writes that &quot;while it is true that heretics down through the ages have appealed to this text or that, we must not allow the misuse of biblical texts to determine the readings we choose for the text of Scripture&quot; (p. 258); however, Acts 9:7 &amp; 22:9 in the KJV are to be condemned based on the understanding of Mormons, and Matt. 13:18 &amp; Rom. 13:9 based on that of a &quot;nationally known atheist&quot; (pp. 228-9).2. White complains that Gail Riplinger associates modern scholars with Charles Manson, &quot;the Mormon prophet Brigham Young,&quot; Jehovah's Witnesses, and New Agers (p. 122, note 5). Yet how is White's linkage of KJV adherents to &quot;Roman Catholics&quot; looking to an &quot;infallible pope,&quot; to Mormons seeking guidance from &quot;the Prophet and Apostles in Salt Lake City,&quot; and to Jehovah's Witnesses looking to their Watchtower headquarters (pp. 93-4) any different? Or his association of &quot;KJV Only advocates&quot; with readings found in the &quot;Jehovah's Witnesses' New World Translation&quot; (p. 267)?3. White complains that in Peter S. Ruckman's writings &quot;those who present the facts are to be insulted, belittled, and identified as 'Alexandrians,'&quot; (p. 115), but asserts his own right to use pejorative terms (&quot;KJV Only,&quot; &quot;KJV Onlyism&quot;) because they are not &quot;insulting&quot; or &quot;inaccurate&quot;--according to him!--but represent a group which uses modern translations &quot;only to point out how bad and inaccurate they allegedly are&quot; (p. 248). He also complains of &quot;Blustery words and insulting invective&quot; (p. 247) from Ruckman, but indulges in some notable bluster of his own: &quot;The [KJV] position is, by its nature, anti-intellectual, anti-scholarship, and anti-freedom&quot; (p. 151).4. Numerous other faults of research, authorial grasp, and presentation might be cited if space allowed. E.g., White seems to grossly misrepresent Aland's concept of &quot;tenacity&quot; of the New Testament text to mean that &quot;once a variant reading appears in a manuscript, it doesn't simply go away&quot; (p. 48)--which would mean that every scribal miscopy in every Greek manuscript ever written has been providentially preserved, something far more against the odds that the beliefs White attacks. Also, White defines &quot;conjectural emendation&quot; as a change &quot;made to the text without any evidence from the manuscripts&quot; (p. 63)--a gross oversimplification, since &quot;evidence&quot; can be more than the fact that a text at a given point doesn't read X; an editor can make a case for copyist eye-skip or transposition of letters, or draw on analogous passages in the edited work, all of which draw broadly on the ms's &quot;evidence.&quot; Such emendation is used literally thousands of times in Greek and Latin classical authors, and while one might argue as to whether or not it is appropriate for the Bible, an author who, like White, is not overly concerned about precision in defining this critical term forfeits the reader's confidence in other areas.White has not only a bias--reasonable in an apologetic work--but an outright prejudice against the KJV adherents' position. It may be that the author resents KJV apologetics so much, and is so convinced that they smack of double standards (and not always without cause, since some are poorly reasoned, as are a portion of writings on any controversial position), that he is overcompensating without even realizing it, taking &quot;revenge&quot; with some double standards of his own by writing this seriously flawed polemic.George Orwell's observation in writing about the Spanish Civil War--&quot;The truth, it is felt, becomes untruth when your enemy utters it&quot;--certainly reflects the attitude of some of White's partisans, as does the converse: that inaccuracy becomes &quot;truth&quot;--or 'good enough'--as long as it serves its purpose against &quot;KJV Onlies.&quot; (See the book cover blurbs, by men who should have had enough scholarship to know better, for proof of this.) White shows himself in this book to be to the &quot;controversy&quot; what Jackie Collins is to great literature. Unfortunately, too many on White's side of the aisle are trying to make him out to be Ernest Hemingway, which is much more profound a statement on the &quot;controversy&quot; than anything in White's book. Some of his backers seem interested in nothing but scoring points, fair or not, off the opposition; White's inaccurate but highly polished writing will no doubt be useful as propaganda to this end."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"This is undoubtedly the best book available supporting the position that no English translation is perfect or infallible. It approaches the subject on a scholarly level that could be convincing to the unlearned or to those who hold to the author's position. However, it does have problems that need to be addressed.In many books that argue a specific point, an author usually accuses his/ her opponent(s) of doing certain things that ultimately discredit them from consideration. The author specifically points out these things and gives examples to prove his point. Two examples of this would be Pickering's \\"The Identity of the New Testament Text\\" and Burgon's \\"The Revision Revised\\". However, in many cases, an author is guilty of doing some of the same things he accuses his opponents of doing in the same book(s) he wrote to discredit his opponents.Everyone has/uses biases and assumptions, whether valid or not. These biases and assumptions shape the way one thinks and are sometimes used to argue a point. Mr. White has a definite bias regarding textual variants, textual transmission, translation, etc. (see Chapter 3 of his book). This bias is based on several opinions or theories he holds to. He could argue that his biases are based on \\"sound principles\\", but this is beside the point. Mr. White has a theory on textual variants that he assumes is correct based on his learning. When a variant is presented to him, he automatically explains it through this theory (bias). When a \\"KJV-only\\" person is presented with a variant, he automatically explains it through his belief (bias). Both have a \\"bias\\" as the standard, and always go by that bias when confronted with issues of translation, variants, etc.If anyone would read his book several times through, a very definite set of problems surfaces over and over again. These problems caused me to question Mr. White's honesty, integrity and character. These problems are listed below.The author has a double standard when dealing with groups or individuals.The author misrepresents people.The author frequently does not give full/objective evidence when defending his position or attacking his opponents.The author's assumptions are based on scholarship that is humanistic.The author has no proof for many of the statements he makes.The author has no tangible final authority.The author has little biblical or scriptural foundation for his beliefs.Upon reading his book, one finds that most of his opinions and arguments are based on either some authority other than the bible or his own personal beliefs. He has the arrogance to make the following assumptions. These assumptions contradict clear passages in the bible whether in English, Greek, or Hebrew (Genesis 3 for example).Satan never in 6,000 years of biblical history influenced anyone to change anything God said.No intentional textual corruption ever survived to make it into any existing greek texts.Only the original writings of the biblical authors were inspired and inerrant.With these assumptions, he has the liberty to thrust on the laity his theory of transmission/preservation. This theory is based on the following points:People make mistakes and so we will find mistakes in the text of the bible.People who copied texts sometimes added words (whether conscious of it or not) to make a passage match another passage.People added to a text (whether conscious of it or not) to honor God or Jesus.People sometimes combined two readings to make a fuller reading.The transmission of the biblical text is the same as any other book.The older reading is probably the better one.If a reading has no variants, it must be the original.Most of these points are based on a humanistic approach (Westcott and Hort) to textual transmission (TO ERR IS HUMAN, Chapter 3), and the belief that God used this to preserve His Word. Does anyone notice in all of this a lack of a biblical foundation? White does use 1 Thes 5:21 (Prove all things) as a support for his questioning of how we got the KJV (13), but he uses a humanistic approach as his method of proof. Are we not to prove all things with the Word? Are we not to live by the Word of God as Jesus stated? Why would I use a secular theory to judge the bible? Is this the scriptural thing to do?Regarding White's belief about no one being influenced to try and corrupt the biblical text, White does not tell the reader about those in the early church who were concerned about corrupters of the Word. I will give a couple of quotes to demonstrate this.Gaius (AD175-200) speaks of the source of corruptions that survive in the early papyri:\\"The Divine Scriptures these heretics have audaciously corrupted.laying violent hands upon them, under pretense of correcting them.\\" Burgon, The Revision Revised, p. 323Eusebius (Eccleastical History), citing Clement of Alexandria:\\"The worst corruptions to which the New Testament has ever been subjected originated within one hundred years after it was composed.\\"He did not tell the reader about some contemporary scholarship's comments on early textual variations/changes.Colwell (What is the Best New Testament Text?, p.119)\\"The first two centuries witnessed the creations of the large number of variations known to scholars today.in the manuscripts of the New Testament most variations, I believe, were made deliberately.\\"G.D. Kilpatrick (Atticism and the Text of the Greek New Testament, pp 125-131)\\"Deliberate changes in all text types appear to antedate A.D. 200..as distinct from errors..all categories of deliberate alteration.are present in both groups.Tatian is the last author of make deliberate changes.the vast majority of deliberate changes were older then A.D. 200.they came into being in the period A.D. 50-200.\\"With these statements and the bible itself as witness to the possibility, how could White believe only what he stated in Chapter 3 of his book, and that no one was ever influenced to make changes to corrupt a text, and that this corruption was never passed on in the manuscript tradition?White accuses his opponents of using double standards (107). Does he use double standards in his book? White attacks Erasmus for being a catholic who believed in some heretical catholic doctrine, but then uses Jerome and Augustine as authorities (12, 13). He doesn't tell the reader that Jerome and Augustine were catholics who believed the same heretical doctrine that Erasmus did. He also doesn't tell the reader that one of the committee members for a United Bible Societies' text* (a text similar to the Nestle-Aland text) is a catholic (Carlo M. Martini). He implies that we should not trust a catholic scholar (especially Erasmus pp. 84-85), but does not tell the reader that catholic scholars accept Nestle's text (25th edition) as the standard for their bibles (Jerusalem and New American) and that the catholic church uses translations based on this text. Based on his implication stated above, if the catholic church accepts it, why should we?* The Greek New Testament, Edited by Kurt Aland, Matthew Black, Carlo M. Martini, Bruce M. Metzger, and Allen Wikgren, Third Edition, United Bible Societies, copyright 1966, 1968, 1975He frequently does not give full/objective evidence when defending his position or attacking his opponents.I will give several examples below:He says that his opponents use tradition (9-10) to support their views, but does not tell the reader that the committee who produced Nestle's 27th edition wrote the following, \\"The criteria used for determining the text are traditionally those of internal and external criticism,.\\" (49) Is their tradition superior? What basis (biblical?) do we use to determine if their tradition is better than ours? Since they do not tell the reader what these criteria are, how can we know that they are superior? How can we apply them \\"with an appropriate sense of balance?\\" if we don't know what they are, Mr. White?2. He does not tell the reader that there are Greek authorities that contradict his Greek authorities. He stated that the word only-begotten (m o n o g e n e s) is an inferior translation. (259) He gave three authorities he believes are final. I have Greek authorities that contradict his authorities. Who's right?m o n o g e n h s-only begotten, only born, from m o n o s and g e n o s.Moulton, \\"The Analytical Greek Lexicon Revised, \\" 1978, pp. 272m o n o g e n h s-only born, i.e. sole:-only (begotten, child)\\"Strongs Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible\\", p. 49What is interesting about this is his support for translating m o n o g e n e s as \\"unique.\\" He does not give other authorities that have a different translation for g e n os. That is, he says that only begotten is from the greek words m o n o and g e n os, and should be translated as \\"unique.\\" He says that only begotten is inferior (in a footnote on page 259) because he has support from three authorities that give a different translation. I have two lexicons that give different translations for g e n os than the ones he uses, who's right?g e n os, offspring, progeny, family, kindred, lineage, race, nation, people, kind, sort, speciesMoulton, The Analytical Greek Lexicon Revised, 1978, p. 79g e n os (g i n o m a i ), race, offspring, family, stock, nation, kind, sort, speciesThayer, Thayer's English Greek Lexicon of the New Testament, 1978, p.113White's translation may also have a doctrinal motive that may lie in his reformed beliefs (Calvinistic). To get rid of references to the Incarnation being what is meant by only begotten, some scholars translate the word differently (White) or try and make only begotten mean something else. Take, for instance, W.E. Vines explanation of only begotten:\\"In John 3:16 the statement, 'God so loved the world that he gave his Only Begotten Son,' must not be taken to mean that Christ became the Only Begotten Son by Incarnation.\\"\\"The Expanded Vines Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words,\\" p. 812This may also be the reason Thayer translates m o n o g e n h s as \\"only son\\".Thayer, Thayer's English Greek Lexicon of the New Testament, 1978, p.417Another example of not giving full/objective evidence is found on pages 113-114 regarding the translation of the greek word k a p h l e u o n t e s into \\"corrupt\\". White's greek support on page 125 is not objective. The following greek authorities give translations that differ from White's authorities.\\"k a p h l e u o n t e s, nom. pl. masc. part. pres. . k a p h l e u wk a p h l e u w , fut. e u s w , to be a retailer, to huckster; to peddle with; to deal paltrily with, or to corrupt, adulterate.\\"Moulton, The Analytical Greek Lexicon Revised, 1978.\\"Hence some suppose that k a p h l e u e i n t o n l o g o n t o u q e o u in 2 Cor.

His statements lapse far too freqently into emotionally-charged harangues belittling his opponents (attacks on their intelligence, guilt by association, etc.). Very infreqently did he seem to endeavor to comprehend their viewpoint. Regardless of whether I agree with his view, this alone is enough to render his conclusions suspect. In failing to crawl outside of his own paradigm -- even for a moment -- White has created not a text which refutes KJV-Onlyism but a slim justification for his own opinions (which are sometimes unfounded).

The Johnannine Comma for the KJO group is a hard one for them, but apart from that, I am almost convinced that &quot;monogenes theos&quot; in the modern translations has some influence to Gnosticism now, because of lack of evidence on White's part.

Not because of his position, but because of the lack of historical, scholastic, and scriptural evidence. Many of his &quot;facts&quot; simply are not so.For example, Dr. White claims that the many of the KJV translators became such in order to receive finical or political gain. However, there is no real evidence to support this accusation. The closest White comes is my misquoting G. S. Paine (&quot;The Men Behind The KJV&quot;) and how William Barlow found favor from King James. However, what White draws from Pain is anything but what Paine presents. There is a difference between Barlow's belief in the Sovereign choice of God for kings and queens, and White's claim that Barlow and others joined the KJV translation committee because of &quot;less than perfect motivations for their work.&quot; (White, p. 70).White also misrepresents what the Greek text that underlined the KJV read in 1 Peter 1:1 (see White p. 268). If he had taken the time to look up Beza's Greek text, which was used by the KJV translators, he would have seen that it does not read as he presents.Also, Dr. White claims to believe in Biblical preservation. Yet he presents NO scripture to support that belief. Does he think preservation is a Bible teaching or not? If so, what verse does he use for that belief? There are other examples, but these three illustrate the point. Dr. White should have spent more time researching and less time debating.For a good book that presents the other side from a scriptural and scholarly position, I highly recommend Dr. Thomas Holland's book: Crowned With Glory. While one is free to disagree with Dr. Holland's position, he at least presents his position openly without attacking those who differ with him."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Every Christian who believes that the Bible is God's Word should read the first part of this book, whether they agree with the author's stance or not, or whether they are interested in the controversy or not, since it covers quite a bit of background information relating to the history and nature of New Testament translation, including its history, major translations, translators, and other key figures, information about the nature of the greek manuscripts, and so on.Most of what I would comment about on this book has already been said, so I won't push the point much further.However, I would like to add another point which James White seems to have overlooked in his book, I assume because of his lack of international/missionary experience:I come from Singapore where not everyone is fluent in English, or even knows English, much less read English. For the ethnic Chinese who only reads and understands the Chinese language, the only Bible they can read would obviously be on that is translated to Chinese. Unfortunately (or fortunately?), none of the Chinese Bibles, as far as I know, are translated from the TR, and you cannot find a Chinese Bible translated from the King James version.Now that's just the Bible in Chinese, where there are a few versions/translations. How about those other Bibles in languages where there's only ONE translation (mostly translated by UBS, and not translated from TR/KJV)?Those who insist on KJV Only should perhaps remember that there's a whole world out there that does not and cannot understand English, much less KJV English. I supposed they are doomed, unless they learn English, KJV English.That said, my opinion is that this is probably the best book on the subject. Read it, unless your mind is already made up (see those 1 star reviews)."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"This book is as thorough as could be possible in presenting its case.

There are numerous places where Mr. White recommends using various translations (including KJV) to ascertain the exact meaning of a particular Biblical passage. The purpose of this book is to refute those people who would claim that the KJV is the only true word of God. Let me say Mr. White goes above and beyond in proving his case. Unfortunately, most of those who disagree will not read this book with an open heart and mind.White covers basic manuscript and textual issues.

White, tackles the King James Only controversy with clarity and sobriety in his book The King James Controversy. With the heart of a pastor he addresses what has become a highly emotional issue for many people. As such, his tone and purpose are immediately evident. He strives for peace in the church. He tactfully dispels ignorance, and he responds to the often bombastic and vitriolic statements common to KJV Only advocates. James White is concerned to show that his readers can trust many of the modern translations, and while the KJV is a good translation it is far from being a perfect translation. Moreover, he seeks to demonstrate that charges of grand conspiracy on the part of modern translators are misguided and quite false. All of these points are developed with an eye on the novice. Therefore, the flow of his book is structured in such a way as to introduce the reader to some history and to textual concepts before moving into more detailed and theme specific areas of the KJV Only debate.There is a logical construction to the book. Chapters one through three are more preparatory in character, in that they establish some rudimentary concepts before delving into the specifics of the debate. Chapters four through ten then dig into the details of the debate. The nature of these initiatory chapters will now be explored.Chapter one delineates five basic KJV perspectives. The spectrum ranges from those who simply prefer the KJV as a translation to those who actually believe the KJV is a new revelation from God. White notes that most KJV Only advocates fall into group 4, which teaches that the KJV, as an English translation, is inspired.Chapter two delves into history. The author intends to show that the KJV Only perspective, or mentality, isn't new to history. The great fifth century scholar, Jerome, provided a new translation of the Old Testament in Latin. The esteemed translation of that day was the Septuagint; it was the standard, the norm. When the people were confronted with the Vulgate they were very suspicious and many considered the new translation a threat. As time went on the Vulgate, ironically, became the accepted norm. Centuries later, when Erasmus sought to improve upon the Vulgate by consulting the original languages, a similar reluctance, and even disdain, erupted from the people. White draws parallels to the current debate. Like the Vulgate and the TR, people today murmur at new translations that seek to be more faithful to the original languages and more accurate in their textual choices. White stresses that the resistance from KJV Only adherents is not a historical novelty.Chapter three educates the reader in foundational textual concepts. Subjects such as \\"manuscripts,\\" \\"text-types,\\" and \\"textual variants\\" are explored and defined by the author. White provides the reader with a broad sense of how we have come to possess the New Testament as we have it today. He wants the reader to understand that differences in Bible versions stem from translational differences, text-type differences (and therefore, different sources to be translated), and/or textual variants. He also introduces the reader to the different text-type families, with an emphasis upon the validity of the Alexandrian text.Having laid some foundational groundwork in translational and textual issues, White begins to dismantle the KJV Only position in the remaining chapters of the book. The thrust of his polemic revolves roughly around five major thoughts. They are as follows:(1) Erasmus and the original AV translators adhered, in substance, to the same translational and textual methodologies as practiced by modern translators.(2) The charge of \\"grand conspiracy\\" leveled against modern translations, whether it is the \\"covering up of sins,\\" undermining the deity of Christ Jesus, etc., is not only untrue, but hypocritically asserted by KJV Only advocates.(3) The KJV Only position engages in slander, mischaracterization, and presents misleading data regarding alleged Scriptural deletions.(4) The KJV doesn't always translate the Greek satisfactorily.(5) The TR text harbors some poor textual choices.In the case of the first point, the author surveys Erasmus' methodology noting that he recognized copyist errors, found examples of harmonization, perceived instances of transferred material in the Gospels, was extremely hesitant to include the Comma Johanneum, and other such points that agree with the approach of modern translators. The same is true of the KJV committee. They didn't conceive of themselves as being infallible. This point is made manifestly evident by White's citing excerpts from The Translators to the Reader. The translators explicitly state that they are attempting to improve upon older translations by examining textual data and pondering afresh the original languages. White challenges KJV Only adherents to be consistent in their assessment of Erasmus. Indeed, he calls them to reject Erasmus' work on the same grounds that they reject the modern translations.Regarding the second point, White deals with the KJV Only allegation that the modern translations, and their \\"corrupted texts,\\" deny the deity of Jesus Christ and undermine His Person by arguing several key points. He argues that the Byzantine text is \\"fuller\\" due the expansion of piety principle and that earlier manuscripts are simply more compact in their titles surrounding Jesus. He also compares passages on the deity of Christ in the NIV and NASB with the KJV and proves that the modern translations are in no way inferior in their affirmation of Christ's deity; if anything, they are clearer.Point three is the focus of chapter five. In this chapter the author examines the writings of leading KJV Only advocates, Dr. Peter Ruchman, Dr. Edward Hills, and Gail Riplinger. White points out Riplinger's poor handling of the data (one might dare say deceitful). In the case of Dr. Hills, White sheds light on his fundamentally circular argumentation, but praises his honesty and irenic tone. Dr. Ruchman is shown to be a man of bombastic and caustic irritancy who, while exhibiting the sarcasm of a Luther, should prove to be more logical and scholarly in his handling of the data. After debunking Dr. Ruchman's \\"Creed of the Alexandrian Cult,\\" White says that the term \\"misrepresentation\\" seems, at times, simply too mild for Dr. Ruchman's writings. KJV Only advocates can charge the modern translations with Scriptural deletion, but the facts will not substantiate these claims.When James White turns to translational differences he catalogs a series of examples whereby the NIV and NASB are shown to be more accurate, or at least valid and clearer in their choice of translation. The same type of \\"example and respond\\" argumentation is utilized in his discussion on textual differences. But he begins the discussion by first outlining the means by which modern Christians go about studying and gathering and analyzing ancient manuscripts. He points out that one cannot simply count the number of extant manuscripts in a given text-type; rather, we must weigh them. For although the Majority Text greatly outnumbers Alexandrian manuscripts it must be carefully observed that Alexandrian manuscripts are the earliest and outnumber Byzantine manuscripts up until the eighth century. Upon examining the evidence White presents a compelling case that there are a significant number of displacements, examples of parallel influence, expansions of piety, and balancing within the Byzantine family. All of this is done in the context of specific passages that serve as concrete examples. And all of this done to demonstrate that the NIV and NASB are justified in their textual choices, and that the accusations of KJV Only advocates are unwarranted. Such discussions are written in a semi-detailed manner, with Part II serving as a detailed and scholarly defense of key textual choices within modern translations.In conclusion, the book is written as a plea for understanding. He wants to help people understand why our English Bibles read the way they do. He seeks to demonstrate that KJV Only arguments are viciously circular and blatantly use double standards as they attack modern translations. Moreover, he seeks to show us that the movement is a human tradition without a basis in history. I think he has succeeded, and he has done so with tact and tough love. I would heartily recommend the book to anyone interested in the topic."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"A long time ago I was a KJV-only person. I'd read all the books on that side of things and one day decided that since I knew the truth, it wouldn't hurt to read a book from \\"the other side\\", and that I was such an intellectually magnaminous person that I owed it to the other side to at least read one of their books. Well, this one was the most recommended, so I got it.I read it quickly, marking up all the \\"mistakes\\" in my copy. It was easy to disagree with Mr.-- er, Dr.--White because he's so freaking condescending. Honestly I don't blame all the people giving this book the one star-- it's that hard to read if you don't agree with him. In my case, I was getting a perverse delight out of being better than the author and I kept reading. Perhaps you could say I was too open-minded for my own good.At any rate, I got about 2/3rds through the book and it dawned on me. This obnoxious guy was RIGHT. That really burned me up. I didn't even finish it, I found it too unbareable. My whole world changed. Well, not really-- but you get the point. (Note: I still disagree with him on several points, but the main jist of the book I am forced to agree with)Sadly, I doubt this book will convert many from my former view because the condescention displayed in it makes it almost impossible to rationally evaluate his arguments. (Hence the 3 stars)Nowadays, I'm more open-minded, more well-read, and much more forgiving of those I disagree with. I also hope that a little bit of the false humility that caused me to read this book in the first place has become real humility. I use the ESV. And you know what? The world is a better place when there's not a Vast Satanic Conspiracy to destroy your Bible."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"First of all, to my utter shame, I must admit that several years ago, I myself was an avid KJV Only person. I purchased Gail Riplinger's book: \\"New Age Translations\\" and was totally convinced that Satan was the author of a grand conspiracy to undermine and eradicate God's Word from the face of the earth. I meticulously went through the book and highlighted changes, deletions and additions as well as supposed testimonies by those who worked on the NASB and NIV translations. I then gave this book to my associate pastor and then to several of my friends in an emotionally charged attempt to \\"open their eyes\\" to the \\"evils\\" of the modern translations. I made snide remarks directed toward people who did not carry a KJV as I taught my adult Sunday school class. I told people that the letters \\"NIV\\" really should be understood as an acronym for \\"Non - Inspired - Version.\\" I only wish that my associate pastor had been more straightforward with me about the depth of foolishness into which I had descended. I pray continually that God will forgive him for allowing me to wallow in such abject ignorance and I have asked God to forgive me for participating is such flagrant idolatry. On the other hand I thank God from the very depths of my soul that He has seen fit to liberate me from this ridiculous and baseless tradition. Interestingly, it was not James White's book that set me free; it was God Himself. Allow me explain.I had long been aware that the original autographs were written in Hebrew and Greek, but I was totally ignorant about the process of textual transmission. Nevertheless, I asked myself the question, why should the KJV be the standard by which all others are judged when it itself is a translation? My conclusion was that this was absolutely illogical and foolish. Shouldn't the KJV be measured against the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts from which they were taken? After all isn't the goal of any translation to render the original text into another language as accurately as possible? And how do we determine if a particular translation is as accurate as possible? By comparing it to back to the manuscripts from which it was taken! However, I was so staunchly KJV Only, that I pushed this problem to the back of my mind. But God would not allow me forget it altogether. Time and time again, He brought it to my mind and finally, I could push it to the back no longer. I had to deal with it. I was, however, still unwilling to give up my beloved KJV Only position and I tried desperately to find a way around this problem. The only way I could come up with was to say that God had \\"re-inspired\\" His Word through the translation process of the KJV of 1611 and therefore that the original manuscripts were no longer necessary. But I realized that this was purely a baseless fabrication that I had created in a desperate attempt to cling to my beloved KJV Only position. However, more and more, God was convincing me of the utter folly of this fabricated ideology until finally I had to admit that I had been wrong. It wasn't until later through other studies that I realized to my utter amazement that I was not the first to come up with this \\"re-inspiration\\" excuse to hold on to my KJV Only position. In fact it was already being believed and taught by those in the KJV Only camp!! I immediately recognized it for the fabrication that it was and I even knew why they had invented it: in order to vindicate and justify what only amounts to the flagrant, idolatrous worship of a seventeenth century translation of the Bible.In closing, let me just say that I am a conservative among conservatives. I hold staunchly to the full plenary-verbal inspiration of the Holy Scriptures and will tolerate nothing less from others who call themselves Christians. The Bible, as it was given by God in the original autographs, is to be the sole authority upon which we base our faith and practice. Any translation of the Bible also carries this same authority, insofar as it represents the original manuscripts. If it is asked: how can we know that we really have the word of God seeing that we do not posses the original autographs? I answer: we have faith in the providence of God. Through faithful men on fire with zeal for the preservation of the Scriptures, God has ensured that His Word has been preserved. I fully recognize that there are some translations out there that are far from representing the original manuscripts and I do not recognize them as authoritative. But I give full sanction to those translations that seek to reproduce a word for word rendering of the Hebrew and Greek into English (i.e. the NASB, NKJV, KJV and on a lower level, the NIV). Notice that I included the KJV in my list of authoritative translations. That is because, like James White, I am not against the KJV. I like it and I use it. I am, however, against the foolish and divisive idolatry of KJV Onlyism. To those who have not yet encountered the KJV Only position, BE CAREFUL!! This idolatry has a false piety that is very romantic and captivating. I wholeheartedly urge you to read this book because it clearly presents the facts of the issue while at the same time exposing to what desperate lengths KJV Only people will go in order to hold on to their idolatrous KJV Only position, even to the point of employing hate speech and mean-spirited invective against other Christians. I pray that all Christians will read this book. It will prevent many poor souls from being sucked into this cultish idolatry; and it will liberate others from the prison they do not even know they are locked up in."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"To me, there is no substance to the KJV Only debate. It's ridiculous because, let's face it, the KJV is merely a translation just as the other versions are. Every translation is going to naturally have holes in its rendering because every language is unique and has its own nuances. This is true for all translation, such as when you translate a German song into French or a Spanish poem into English. If you want to get as close as possible to the original, learn Hebrew and Koine Greek.Truly I have no problems with those who want to personally use the KJV alone, but why force your personal preference on others and use such harsh language to critically undress those who disagree? It makes no sense. James does a scholarly job in showing how the criticism against the &quot;bloodless&quot; translations are unjustified. The proof is in the pudding, and James brings it all out in this rather lengthy, complete work. Be forewarned that this is not a book you'd read on a flight from Boston to Atlanta. No, it's not easy reading, and you will probably want to have your modern translation (NIV? NASB?) next to a King James so you can personally look at the context of the passages exegeted in the book.I know this book is very controversial in King James Only circles, but I would hope that they would honestly reevaluate their position. Even if they disagree, my prayer is that the name-calling and other loaded language techniques would stop. Be professional. James was. With a Christless world needing the Gospel, we can so much better use our time than to bicker with each other about which translation is the best."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Let's face it, the KJVO debate is deeply intertwined with the history and making of the English Bible. When you begin to talk about the Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, the Textus Receptus, and etc., it get's complicated in a hurry. White does a very thorough job of explaining the manuscript families, what textual criticism actually is, and other translational issues. While textual criticism is criticized by the KJVO camp, many people do not know that Erasmus, who is responsible for the TR, engaged in textual criticism, as did the KJV translators. Once you've been exposed to this and other information contained in \\"The King James Only Controversy,\\" you can sort out many of the KJVO arguments with relative ease.White does a service to the body of Christ by staying professional and calm throughout this book. Many pro KJVO arguments are examined in a fair and Christian way. The question about whether the newer versions water down the deity of Christ is really covered well. He also gives a pretty in depth look at just about any disputed verse that you would be likely to have a question about. Once you have read this book, you will be well equipped to carry on a dialogue about this sometimes emotional topic. If you want to buy only one book on this topic, this is the one!"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"The title is \\"Can You Trust the Modern Translations?\\" so James White ought to have kept himself to proving that other translations are trustworthy. His error is in going off on a counter-offensive and critiquing valid translation choices in the KJV. These critiques are based on White's shallow understanding of context, Greek, and English. I give this book 2 stars because although it exposes the folly of the extreme KJV Only position, the book does a great disservice to people who use the KJV for its accuracy. James White does not seem qualified to speak on the subject of Bible translation. Here are some examples of White's misunderstandings:Isaiah 65:11 - Troop & NumberWhite alleges that the KJV translators did not understand that Gad and Meni were the names of the Pagan gods of fortune and destiny. White is mistaken. For centuries the Latin Vulgate translated the god's name as \\"Fortunae\\" (Fortune). The identities of Gad and Meni were common knowledge to Christians. The 1611 KJV's margin has \\"Gad\\" and \\"Meni,\\" so the translators knew that these were names of gods. Moreover, by translating the names as \\"troop\\" and \\"number,\\" the pun in Hebrew becomes apparent. The underlying message of the passage is that the Israelites had opted for polytheism (\\"that troop\\" and \\"that number\\") in defiance to their one God. White does not discuss the pun that exists in the Hebrew, which becomes apparent in the KJV.Matthew 9:33 - DevilIn the right contexts, \\"devil\\" is a proper translation of \\"daimonion.\\" In English \\"a devil\\" refers to any evil spirit (Merriam-Webster Dictionary) whereas \\"the devil\\" refers to Satan. Even in Greek, \\"devil\\" does not always refer to Satan, but to any accuser: e.g. Jesus calls Judas Iscariot a \\"diabolos,\\" which means \\"devil\\" (John 6:70). \\"Diabolos\\" refers to human beings in 1 Timothy 3:11, 2 Timothy 3:3, Titus 2:3. Most translations do not always translate \\"daimonion\\" as \\"demon.\\" In Acts 17:18, the NASB and ESV translate \\"daimonion\\" as \\"deities\\" and \\"divinities\\" respectively. So White is incorrect in critiquing the KJV for translating \\"daimonion\\" as something other than \\"demon\\" and using \\"devil\\" to refer to beings other than Satan.Mark 6:20 - ObservedGreek lexicons define \\"suntereo\\" in various ways. One definition is \\"to keep within one's self, keep in mind (a thing, lest it be forgotten)\\" (Thayer's Greek Definitions). In Luke 2:19 \\"sunterei\\" is translated \\"treasured\\" (NASB, ESV, NIV) in the sense of \\"saw the importance of.\\" This is close to the meaning of \\"observed.\\" In Mark 6:20, we read: \\"Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.\\" Herod recognized John as a holy man and heard him gladly. This is best described by \\"sunterei\\" being translated \\"observed.\\"Acts 5:30 - And\\"And\\" is a conjunction that indicates simultanaeity, not causation or chronology. The slaying and hanging occurred simultaneously because the two occurrences coincided in time. White does not understand the role of the conjunction here.Acts 12:4 - EasterIn modern Greek, \\"Pascha\\" means \\"Easter\\" and \\"Pascha ton Ioudaion\\" means \\"Passover (Pascha of the Jews).\\" The question is when \\"Pascha\\" came to mean Easter in ancient Greek. There is considerable evidence that the early Christians had already used \\"Pascha\\" to mean \\"Easter.\\" John 2:13 and 11:55 have the term, \\"Pascha ton Ioudaion\\" (Pascha of the Jews), so by John's time there was already a distinction being made between the Christian Pascha (Easter) and the Jewish Pascha (Passover). Eusebius refers to the early Christian celebration of the \\"Saviour's Pascha\\" (as differentiated from the Jewish Pascha). So in very early times, Christians were already using \\"Pascha\\" to refer to the Christian Easter as opposed to the Jewish Passover. Acts 12:4 concerns an event after the resurrection, so Luke (the author) may have intended the Christian Pascha, which is Easter. It is hard to be dogmatic about what Luke intended, so Passover or Easter are both possible referents.Acts 22:9 - Heard\\"ekousan\\" can be translated as \\"heard\\" and Acts 22:9 will not contradict Acts 9:7. Those who allege a contradiction here need to examine the two passages more carefully. Acts 22:9 says that the men did not hear the \\"voice of him that spake\\" to Saul - this was the voice of the Lord. The voice in Acts 9:5-7, which the men did hear, was the voice of Saul addressing the Lord, saying, \\"Who art thou Lord?\\" The men heard Saul's voice which addressed a person, but the men could not see the person who was being addressed. This is why Acts 9:7 says, \\"hearing a voice, but seeing no man.\\" Consider John Gill's commentary on Acts 22:7, \\"They heard the voice of Saul, saying, who art thou? and what wilt thou have me to do? but saw nobody that he spoke to, which surprised them; for it is certain they did not hear the voice of Christ, that spake to him, Acts 22:9.\\"Philippians 2:6 - RobberyWhite says that the NIV's rendering, \\"did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,\\" to be \\"clearer than the KJV's ambiguous translation.\\" However, White does not reveal that the KJV reads as it does because it translates the Greek word \\"harpagmon\\" in the active voice rather than the passive voice. So the issue is not that the NIV is clearer (which is debatable), but that the NIV translates it differently with a slightly different meaning. This is not to say that the NIV translation is wrong, but White is misleading readers by not presenting the grammatical reason for the KJV rendering.Titus 2:13 - Granville Sharp's RuleGranville Sharp's rule is a valuable hermeneutical tool, but a problem arises when it is directly incorporated in the translation. The Greek says that God is \\"THE great God\\" and the Saviour is \\"OUR Saviour\\" - namely, Jesus Christ is only \\"OUR\\" saviour (for believers) but God is \\"THE\\" God (over everyone). He is not just \\"OUR\\" God. Jesus Christ is \\"THE\\" God. Although incorporating the Granville Sharp rule sharpens the Christological significance of the phrase, an important theological truth is lost. White does not discuss this. He makes it seem as though there is nothing to be gained from translating the Greek literally without incorporating Granville Sharp's rule. This is dishonest. A comparison of both the KJV and a translation that incorporates the Granville Sharp rule will provide the full picture of the passage.These are some examples of White's errors concerning the translation choices in the KJV. At most, readers should take this book as an expose of the extreme KJV Only movement. However, do not use this book as a primer on Greek lexicology or translation theory. The KJV really is a great translation. There is no need to make an idol out of it, but there is no need to needlessly allege errors in it. Compare various translations."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I am a reviewer who strictly-speaking is undecided on the controversial \\"war\\" between the Westcott-Hort side of textual criticism and the John Burgon side, and while my leanings are with the reasoned eclecticist side that James White staunchly upholds and defends, I can honestly say that this book hardly settles the question definitively on whether the textual basis for the modern conservative versions (NASB-U, ESV, NIV) *really* is better than the \\"received\\" Reformation text that underlied all English bibles up until 1881 (with the RV).The KJV-Onlyism of Ruckman and Riplinger is absurd. Hands down. That they would say that some edition of the KJV (the 1769 Oxford edition for some reason??) is inerrant in its English renderings is just so silly as to be beyond comment. (Okay just one: What is it about the years 1525 to 1769 that permited *ordinary* text-critical and translationary revision of the English bible, but that 'locked' in the wording ever since, making all revisers evil adulterers of God's word with no final authority?)Riplinger, Ruckman, and Waite do better when they accidentally follow the position outlined by TR-Only extremist theologian Edward F. Hills who stated the Greek *underlying* the (1769 Oxford??) KJV is inerrant in all its particulars and it is immune to revision because it is already a 100% providential restoration of the bible. We can thank the Reformation and Mr Gutenberg for giving us the perfect originals back, end of story (on this line of thought).While I don't think that view explains the manuscript data at all, I suppose it is at least a possibility that evangelical Protestants and Fundamentalists could handle in their ordinary doctrinal manner (seeing what the bible teaches about itself, concerning how it will be preserved after the autographs have been destroyed) as well as compare their resultant doctrine with the sheer raw data of the Greek manuscripts, early foreign language versions, and Patristic citations.If White's book against Ruckman/Riplinger already only indirectly and somewhat unsatisfactorily deals with the more sophisticated preservation arguments of Hills, then White's book is almost hopeless at refuting the preservation arguments of the more plausible Majority-text defender dean John Burgon and his latter day followers (Maurice Robinson, Wilbur Pickering, Theodore Letis, etc.) which in my experience is by the far numerically the main academic school of thought that is quasi- KJV-Only.Burgon, whose best work is \\"The Revision Revised\\", repudiates the 1881 Revised Version (RV) of the New Testament's underlying Greek text (which was very close to Westcott-Hort's and the modern UBS text).The central pillar of Westcott-Hort is that the \\"traditional text\\" a.k.a. the Koine Byzantine text type a.k.a. the Majority Text (of which the Greek NT of the Protestant Reformation *more-or-less* is an exemplification of), is secondary to and derivative from the Western and Alexandrian text types, and the product of a formal-or-informal recension in Antioch and/or Constantinople in the 4th century. This proof allowed textual critics to ignore the koine [common] text almost entirely and only need to determine which of the putatively parent Alexandrian or Western text type variants are authentic autographical readings. The reasoning is sound _if the proof was good_. The Westcott-Hort text of 1881 assume this proof fully. The modern eclectic text of the NT (the UBS 4 or the NA 27) upon which all modern conservative version except the NKJV are based does not accept this argument in its full consistency, and includes approximately 500 Byzantine-only variants in its main body Greek text. Yet even so, today the the Majority reading on the one hand (when one exists) and the \\"Received\\" reading of the Reformation on the other hand is routinely considered to be inferior upon analysis to the earliest Alexandrian text type readings.If you reject the multitude of text-critical proofs offered that try to argue the oldest manuscripts are better textually than earlier ones (see Metzger's book on this), and further offer theological arguments for providential preservation that seem to require the dominant text type of the middle ages to be VERY faithful to the autographic variants, then suddenly defending the Greek underlying the English bible and further, the KJV itself, starts making a lot more sense if you are already a Christian fundamentalist.On one very popular line of reasoning, exemplified by the central figure John Burgon, the Byzantine Majority text form (which he calls somewhat biasedly 'the traditional text') is not only even more ancient to the *derivative* Alexandrian and Western text types, but is the ONLY faithful text type. Burgon argues the other two early text types were the products of corruptions intentional and unintentional and that both the surviving variants of the Alexandrian and Western text types are nearly USELESS to the practice of textual criticism, include all the early documentary evidence that supports the non-Byzantine readings. In summary, Burgon argued that the very latest manuscripts were the best and most accurate to the autographs, and that the earliest ones we have preserved into the 19th and 20th centuries were the absolute worst and only survived so long because they sat in total obscurity and were not being re-copied.This line of thought, which is accepted by most KJV defenders, would turn textual criticism on its head, and mean that specifically constructing manuscripts based on the Western and Alexandrian text types (as is essentially the practice since 1881) is guaranteed to lead you to an inferior and corrupted and altogether lousy New Testament, exchanging gold for copper. How stupid of us to do that!, (they say).Daniel Wallace, a Wescott/Hort/UBS/Nestle-Aland advocate, has three articles up online at [...] that respond directly to this serious attack initiated by Burgon on the central pillars undergirding the theory and practice of modern textual criticism. Look for the articles called \\"Some Second Thoughts on the Majority Text\\", \\"The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical?\\", and \\"Inspiration, Preservation, and New Testament Textual Criticism\\".James White's book is not strong at refuting Burgon, because the Riplinger/Ruckman tandem are so inferior to the fiery--and more scholarly--Burgon even though Burgon wrote his book 100+ years earlier! It is not even that strong at refuting Hills type positions which is closer to Ruckmanism, being grounded on the same a priori preservation arguments. The actually decent review of this book by KJV-Onlyist David Cloud (who embraces a Hillsian TR-Onlyism) picked up on this immediately (up at [...] ) and he was right to consider White's book shallow.The King James Only Controvesy is an interesting book, but its place in this larger controversy (ignoring small bit players like the extremists Riplinger and Ruckman) is small, since the book targets two extremists with \\"refutations\\" that a lot of the time only work if you already buy into the system of reasoned eclecticism that James White holds to be true. D.A. Carson's book on the KJV Controversy is much better at defending the eclectic text and the value of our ancient Alexandrian text type manuscripts and ancient versions (translations) and patristic citations. Read that one first if you are still trying to decide.White responds to two insignificant highly negative reviews of his book by extremists in the D.A. Waite/Peter Ruckman mold at [...]. But they are good to show the generally shallow and captious type of response this book has provoked from extremists.In the end, James White, D.A. Carson, Norm Geisler, B.B. Warfield, C. Van Til, Greg Bahnsen, and many others may be right in thinking that one can embrace textual criticism while *still* being a conservative Protestant convinced that the immediately inspired autographs of the OT and NT were by the singular care and providence of God kept pure in all ages in the manuscript tradition. (This question is ultimately the real one, because KJV-Only writers rely on fideistic appeals to say the Greek beneath the KJV is best and by accusing all positions that don't lead to KJV-Only as being rationalistic and atheistic.)However, we shouldn't dismiss out of hand John Burgon (even if he is a bit rough around the edges) and others who argue that providential purity required by conservative theology *requires* the koine majority text of the middle ages Greece to be substantially alike to the autographs, just because Gail Riplinger, Peter Ruckman, and D.A. Waite are almost caricatures for how NOT to defend the King James Bible. If Burgon was even half right about W&H;, then we would be making a hugely ironic mistake in editing the Textus Receptus by the standard of corrupted early manuscripts, corrupt ancient translations, and early Fathers who used corrupted texts."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"James White does an excellent job of going through the relevant points in a logical, orderly fashion while presenting his case about the KJO controversy. The book features plenty of discussion about translation of specific words and serves as a 101 for textual criticism. Plenty of scripture is examined and the book does not serve to merely affirm all current bible translations. One of the best aspects of the book is its even handedness in dealing with the topic. White goes out of his way to not offend those who would favor the King James bible yet still address the necessary concerns that have been put forth by King James Only advocates. White also points out issues with some of the modern translations so that the book does not turn into a King James bashing session; White makes it clear that the King James bible has many good qualities and in fact would be preferable over some of the modern versions. The book is moderately scholarly so is best for those who have some knowledge of the relevant issues already but can be tackled by those who are unaware and looking for a book on the topic. The updated edition includes some information on some of the newer bible translations published in recent years and current conclusions on textual criticism issues. I give the book 5 stars since it accomplishes what the book intends to in an orderly fashion, is accessible to readers of various persuasions about bible translations, and is considered the standard text on the issue of KJO."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I grow as a Christian in a church that uses KJV Bible and was exposed to teaching of KJV Onlyism which condemns modern translations specially the NIV, NASB & NKJV. I was convinced by it for a long period of time until one of my friend who is a pastor told me to make some research because this teaching is wrong. I searched thru the internet a found many information and materials that disproved the claims of the KJV only movement. All of these information that took me a lot of time to gather was all compiled on this books including so many other information that will make you understand and appreciate how God preserved His word in our time accurately thru the available Bible translations that we have such as the NASB, NIV, KJV, NKJV, ESV etc.Thanks to James White for doing a great job."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"White writes intelligently in regard to his subject and respectfully in regard to his critics. Two qualities that are often missing in this debate."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":". . .of James White -- but credit must be given where credit is due. In these pages, White completely and thoroughly debunks the research, logic, and method of &quot;King James Only&quot; proponants, especially the &quot;scholarship&quot; of Gail Riplinger.White is not hostile to the King James Version -- indeed, he vaules it -- along with more recent translations which are more critically accurate.The hysteria from certain quarters which has greeted this book is irrational and anti-scholastic. A brief glance at the editorial reviews praising this book -- reviewers who are drawn from a wide variety of scholars representing a wide variety of theological opinions -- will demonstrate the value of White's book.(As an aside, it is fascinating to note some of the criticisms leveled against White -- accusing him, among other things, of being in league with the Catholics when White is, in fact, a staunch anti-Catholic!)Again, while I find myself profoundly out of sympathy with many of White's opinions, I certainly can't fault him for this excellent work."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I know some people still love the KJV Bible, but when they go to church, they should bring their NIV. I believe that the battle has been won by the NIV (and other current versions). The KJV Only movement reminds me of the Japanese soldiers that chose to stay on the Pacific Islands 30 to 40 years after the war had ended. They believed they were still defending the homeland. But unfortunately, the war was long over. They lived in ignorance for so long and wasted so many years of their lives for nothing. The KJV Only movement needs to realize that the war is over and the NIV has clearly won. Obviously if you brainwash people enough, you can get them to do some pretty irrational things.This book is encouraging because it does a good job on making you appreciate how God has preserved His word through all of the 5,300 cataloged manuscripts. The shear number of these manuscripts being so many (5.300) and the varied location of these manuscripts being widespread, and the various dates of these manuscripts being from many different centuries, it really makes you appreciate God preserving His Word. God did not use one English version to preserve His Word. If God had done that it would be too easy for man to pervert the text. Kind of like the Mormon Bible - they had to accept whatever Joseph Smith said was on the golden plates (which they never saw). But like the author says, since we have ALL these manuscripts, it actually makes it hard for anyone to go back and change the text. Having All these manuscript actually helps to show what the original text was. Even with the numerous variants the author shows how these variations can be resolved. It actually is a clear road map to the original. It seems that Ruckman wants to be the Joseph Smith of our Bible.This book is excellent because the author is well prepared to handle the subject. He has clearly well aware of the history and background of the Bible. This book is a mini course in lower criticism and higher criticism. I love his work on Erasmus. He does a great job on showing that Erasmus faced the same opposition when he created his Greek Bible and translation as the people who translated the NIV. I love the history of the Bible and how through the centuries God has raised up men to preserve and translate His Word into the language of the day. The author shows the irony of people who reject the \\"new\\" translations, forgetting how they got their own \\"familiar\\" translation. This is truly history repeating itself.This book is enlightening because he has clearly done his homework. He shows the hysteria and in some cases the meanness of some of the KJV only people. He covers verse after verse showing how KJV people try to scare and deceive people into believing that the NIV and other translations have deleted passages. He has so many examples it is mind-boggling. He does a great job showing the great ignorance and the cruelty of the KJV only movement. This book should be a great encouragement to people who are still in bondage of the KJV Only movement. They no longer have to believe the deception of the KJV Only movement.From reading the many reviews, it is clear that the truth about the KJV Only movement has long been out and people are aware of it."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Norman Geisler's quote on the cover says it all: &quot;This is the best book in print on a topic too often riddled with emotion and ignorance.&quot;Here's the issue with our KJVO brethren: they maintain based on Psalm 12:6-7 that God has provided an inerrent translation of the Bible for all generations. The verses say &quot;The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.&quot; Now I would question their application of this verse, but let's assume for the moment that they are correct. Next, the King James onlyist asserts that for scholars to put out new translations is a violation of Proverbs 30:6 - &quot;Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.&quot;Now, if God has provided an inerrent translation for every generation of Christians, then there arises a serious problem for the King James onlyists. People did not start speaking English in 1611. What translation did God provide for English speaking people before then? The King James onlyist will typically respond that God provided the prior generations with the Wycliffe Bible, the Tyndale Bible, the Geneva Bible, or any one of the other 16 English translations which existed prior to the KJV. But if this is the case, then the own argument can be turned against them: who gave King James the right to add to God's words with another translation (Prov. 30:6)?And of course, if God did NOT provide English speaking people before 1611 with an inerrent translation, then the KJVO interpretation of Psalm 12:6-7 goes out the door. Thus, there is no compelling reason to think that God MUST have provided English speaking people today with an inerrent translation."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"you know a book has to be at least a little interesting if all the reviews are either fives or ones! i have read white's work, as well a quite a few other on this subject. i must first say i am a little disappointed at all the mud flying back and forth! that being said, i found this book to be an interesting, researched, but perhaps slightly partisan work. this is certainly a volatile issue in Christianity today; and i for one would prefer to see this written with a little more objectivity. dr. white expends not a few words specifically addressing ruckman and riplinger (among others), compromising slightly his ability to present a thorough, unbiased review. on the other hand, although i think peter ruckman is a very sagacious fellow (as best i can gather from reading his works and some related websites), the acerbic character of his writings is at times a little hard to take coming from a Christian. i personally prefer the AV to any other english version, but i find the notion that the NIV, NASB, and others are from satan a little hard to swallow. were the NIV authors seeking to subversively remove the name of Jesus from the bible or were they simply trying to make a translation that less educated people can read and understand? the bible DOES say that God will preserve His word, but i think attribution of this to the english text of the AV infers a little too much! anyway enough of my rhetoric! this book is &quot;sound&quot; and thorough with respect to textual issues. indeed the author is quick to address claims of the more vociferous AV only advocates. in addition, this book replete with abundant verse-specific commentary. my criticism would be that this book is really more of a rebuttal to ruckman et al than anything else, although dr. white did do his homework. i would refer the reader to bruce metzger for a more even-handed (but still non-AV only) treatment."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I first purchased this book, shortly after publication, because I had a number of friends who were in the KJV Only camp. It seemed to me that my friends' arguments were not at all solid and I got this book to help me better understand the issues so I could better discuss it with my friends.This book provided me with exceptional information about the controversy, so it surpassed my expectations in that regard.What I didn't know then was that now, in 2004, I would pick up the book to read again. This second reading was not to better understand the KJV Only issue, but to refresh my understanding of the history of the Bible translation in general and the translation to English in particular. Again, my (second set of) expectations were surpassed.This book is an excellent introduction to the history of Bible translation. Prior to the second reading, I had been contemplating which translation of the Bible to purchase for my new Bible as my almost 40 year old eyes are not seeing the print of my old compact (NKJV) Bible as well as they did in my early twenties. I was contemplating purchasing an NASB. I already owned a fairly large print edition of the NIV but wasn't sure I wanted that as my primary Bible.After reading The KJV Only Controversy a second time, it is clear to me that I can, in fact, \\"Trust the Modern Translations\\", even the NIV. James White goes back to the Greek to compare the KJV with the NIV and/or NASB in numerous verses. It is manifestly evident that the NIV and NASB are both good translations of the same Scripture, namely the Word of God. James White has given me a deep respect for those involved in the translation process.If you, or someone you know, want(s) to learn more about the KJV Only issue or Bible translation, I can recommend this book without reservation. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Sorting through and explaining this complicated subject is a difficult thing to do - something that many writers cannot do very clearly.

White is aggressive and pulls no punches throughout the extremely readable volume. He does one of the best jobs at laying out the various strands of belief in the textual debates, and divides his argumentation along the lines of textual and translational differences. White also does an excellent job walking the reader through the historical myths set up by the KJV-Only advocates and through the real (and somewhat disturbing) history of the movement today. All in all, this work is one of the most valuable on the topic, though it is not without its faults. One issue is White's strong argumentation for the superiority of the eclectic text and modern versions. This insistence will most certainly turn off the KJV-Only advocate. Another issue is, as I mentioned at the outset, that White is not a fundamentalist. Although this issue seems of little importance to those who oppose the KJV-Only advocates, this creates the reason for wholesale rejection of the work by the adherents of that viewpoint. Their view is that if you are not from our camp that you dare not speak to its issues. Although I would disagree with their premise, I cannot help but agree that this work will prove to be of little value to the proponents of KJV-Onlyism, but will be of great value to those who wish to refute their claims. If the reader wishes to read a solid book on the topic written from a Fundamentalist perspective, they should consultOne Bible Only?: Examining Exclusive Claims for the King James Bible."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I do not want to enter the raging debate that seems to surround this book and topic. The funny thing is, it is so near and dear to my heart. The timing is also good because I am currently embroiled in the nearly fruitless efforts involved in convincing so many otherwise reasonable people that the KJV is NOT the only Bible to read. I want to thank the author for being so clear and supportive in his narrative. I find him very experienced and reasonably neutral. I honestly have a lot of trouble with the antagonistic attitude of one of the selected 'Negative' opinion reviewers. He referred to the author as condescending. I find him to be anything but that. The author is not being derisive at all. He simply realizes that adhering to a KJV only attitude is dated and misguided as best."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"The \\"King James Controversy\\"--the debate on whether the KJV Bible is the only true Bible or not--is on that is very interesting to me for several reasons. First, I grew up in an area where many churches \\"favor\\" the KJV, and are functionally KJV Onlyists. Second, I am a bit of a translating geek if you haven't been able to tell. I have been wanting to read James White's book for awhile now, and was excited to receive the new second edition in the mail. I haven't read the first edition, so unfortunately, I cannot compare the two, though it seems that a couple of sections were added, and James added the ESV to most of the translations lists throughout the text.White has written an excellent book defending modern translations, such as the T/NIV, ESV, NLT, etc. His arguments are thorough, easy to understand, and devastating to the King James Only (henceforth KJVO) position. He shows, primarily, that the KJVO position is built on circular logic, and that if they were to apply their critiques of translations to the KJV itself, it would fail their tests horrible. Their logic is circular, because they set out to prove what they already assume to be true--the KJV is the only true Bible, therefore all other translations must be false because they disagree with the KJV. There are some major problems here, not the least of which is why should we accept the KJV as the standard? KJVOists can't answer this, outside of \\"because it is.\\"The book is divided into two parts. The first part, which is the main part of the book, focuses on the controversy itself. The second part of the book, about 30 pages, is on \\"The Textual Data.\\" This section dives deeper into the the textual variants and translational differences discussed in the main section of the book. Since White discusses some Greek and textual criticism here, it is somewhat harder than the rest of the book for those who haven't studied either. However, if you are willing to put some work into it, it shouldn't be much of a problem to follow the main arguments, if not the entire section.The first section of the book, containing 10 chapters, is extremely readable however. White does a fantastic job of taking \\"ivory tower\\" information, and making it accessible to everyone.Chapter 1 is a summary of the KJVO movement. White looks to define what KJVOism is, and divides the camp into 5 groups. The first three groups, \\"I like the KJV best,\\" \\"The Textual Argument\\" (The text behind the KJV is the most superior), and \\"Received Text Only\\" are not really KJVO although they are usually lumped in with them. They essentially hold that the KJV is the best translation, either through scholarly assessment of the underlying Greek text or personal preference. These three positions all hold that the KJV can, and when in disagreement with the underlying Greek and Hebrew, should, be changed. It is not infallible, even if (in the case of the last group) they consider the text behind it to be. White says that he has a lot of respect for the people who fall into these groups, and that they are unfairly criticized as KJVO when they are not. The problems come with the last two groups, those who hold that the translation itself is inspired and inerrant, and another group that goes even farther, saying that the KJV was inspired in such a way that it supplants the original Greek and Hebrew. This last group would say that the \\"Greek and Hebrew texts should be changed to fit the readings found in the KJV!\\" (pg 28).Chapter 2 delves into the history of translations and shows that the KJVO movement is really nothing new. The same arguments they use (which is explored here and throughout the rest of the book) were used against Jerome when he began a new translation of the Bible into Latin. Ironically, the same arguments came up in favor of Jerome's translation centuries later when Erasmus wanted to come up with a copy of the Scriptures in their original languages, a mission spurned on the the humanist movement of the Renaissance. We find the arguments springing up again in our day to favor the KJV. White questions \\"Will there someday be an NIV Only movement?\\" (pg 40). While I don't know about NIVO, I wouldn't be surprised to see an ESV Only movement sometime in the future!Chapter 3 is a discussion on the basics of translation and textual criticism, which is how we determine which of the variants in the text most likely reflect the original. This chapter may seem intimidating at first for some, but as I stated before, White does an excellent job taking the material and making it very accessible to the readers. This chapter ends with what I think is a new excursus to the second addition which focuses on the critiques of Bart Ehrman, as well as Islam and the Qur'an.Chapter 4 moves out of the background information, and begins the critique of KJVO proper. It discusses the various editions of the KJV that have come out over the years, as well as quotes from the translator's preface to the original 1611 version which shows that they never considered their translation to be what KJVOers argue it is today.Chapter 5 gives an overview of some of the main KJVO advocates, while carefully distinguishing, again, those who favor the underlying text behind the KJV and those who really push the KJVO ideology. Again, this is an important distinction to make.Chapters 6, 7, and 8 all deal with some of the main arguments put forth by the KJVO camp in greater detail. In these chapters, White expounds on the idea that KJVOism is circular logic, catalogues various differences in the translations and explains why they differ including differing ways of translating the same word/phrase and translations that stem from different variants. These arguments are fleshed out even more in the second part to the book mentioned above. Chapter 8 deals with a very specific argument: the modern translations attempt to remove the deity of Christ. White ably handles this critique, and shows how bad it really is. If we were to posit some grand conspiracy to remove the deity of Christ such as KJVOists do, our only conclusion must be that they did a horrible job of it. They certainly left in far too many verses that speak to his deity.Chapter 9 deals with problems with the KJV translation itself. White emphasizes that he is not being \\"anti-KJV\\" but that it is necessary to engage in this discussion because of the claims made by KJVOists. Because they are claiming the KJV to be inerrant, looking at errors in the translation is necessary. Some of these errors are due to translation errors, but some of them come from the fluidity, the changing nature, of languages in general and English in particular.Chapter 10 is a sort of quick cheat sheet to the whole debate. It is filled with easily understandable answers to some of the most common questions raised in the KJVO discussion.If you are wondering what the debate is all about, or if you struggle with trusting your translation because of what others have said, or if you know someone else who is struggling, White's book is a must-have resource. If you are intimidated because other resources you've read are hard to understand, I can't emphasize enough when it comes to this book, don't be! White writes in a very clear manner, stopping to explain or define anything that might not be commonly known. Get this book! It will only serve to strengthen your trust in the work of translators. The only drawback, and White mentions this several times, is that this book will probably not change the minds of those who fall into the KJVO camp. This is due to the circular nature of their argument. To reject the KJVO movement from within means that one has to change their very presuppositions, and to do so is an almost impossible task. Almost. The information and argumentation that White gives in his book is certainly well-suited for the challenge."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I want to begin by sharing two initial thoughts. Well, actually, one thought and secondly a disclaimer. First, The King James Only Controversy is much more than a simple journalistic account of the \\"King James only\\" debate. It is a primer for the non-scholar who is, even if only casually, interested in Bible translation and the accompanying philosophies and methodologies.Second, my only exposure to the controversy has been on the internet (other than a snide remark here or there by television preachers about \\"watered-down versions\\" ). I live in an NIV-primarily region of the country. I most frequently read the NASB, but my pastor preaches out of the NKJV, so I carry that with me on Sundays. Thus, I incline toward the author's conclusions even before reading the book. It is a bias that I don't think influences my review of the book, but it is a bias I want to disclose.James R. White's treatment of the \\"King James only\\" debate is thorough, well supported by evidence, and written so as to be easily understood by the casual observer or participant. He begins by dividing the King James only advocates into five distinct and increasingly radical camps: 1) \\"I like the KJV Best\\" (which he takes no issue with), 2) \\"The Textual Argument\\" (that the Hebrew and Greek texts used by the KJV translators are superior), 3) \\"Received Text Only\\" (that the Textus Receptus and Hebrew text utilized by the KJV translators are inerrant), 4) \\"The Inspired KJV Group\\" (who believe the KJV is itself an inspired and inerrant translation, the group White identifies as the majority of the KJV only advocates), and 5) \\"The KJV as New Revelation\\" (that the KJV is \\"re-inspired\\" and the English text is an inerrant revelation superior even to the Hebrew and Greek texts).White then gives the reader a brief overview of translation history and the translation process, explaining textual vs. translation disputes, translation methods, textual criticism, and the ancient texts used by translators. Then, very systematically, White explains the irony of the KJV onlyists making the exact arguments that were made against the original KJV translators and against Erasmus (whose Textus Receptus was used by the KJV translators) before that. To put it in polite terms, the argument of the KJV only camp, as well as those who opposed the original King James Version (the Authorized Version everywhere except the U.S.), is an argument for traditionalism.The heart of the book is White's analysis of many of the verses in controversy and his defense of the various translations' renderings. Where there are variations in the ancient manuscripts that lead to different translations, White also provides convincing explanations for the textual variants which include simple scribal error, parallel influence (a scribe's attempt to harmonize scripture), and what White dubs \\"expansion of piety\\" (a scribes attempt to make a passage sound a little better, e.g. expanding \\"the Christ\\" to \\"Jesus the Christ\\").White concludes Part One of The King James Only Controversy with a chapter devoted exclusively to questions and answers. Part Two is a 30-page technical treatment of many of the issues raised in Part One for the reader who is proficient in koine Greek and familiar with ancient Biblical texts, although it is not essential for the casual reader to read and understand Part One.In conclusion, in his effort to counter the KJV only advocates, James R. White is necessarily critical of the King James Version. However, I suspect White would be the first to say to the reader whose preference is the KJV to continue in that preference. White does not advocate for any particular translation, only for an understanding that many modern translation are equally legitimate, and, in some instances, superior to the King James Version with respect to certain translation issues. Whether your particular interest is the \\"King James only\\" debate or not, if you are at all interested in Bible translation or the history thereof, The King James Only Controversy is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"King James Only Controversy, The: Can You Trust Modern Translations? (Paperback)by James R. WhiteISBN-10: 0764206052ISBN-13: 978-0764206054James White has done us a favor by writing this book. The King James Only Controversy addresses most, if not all, of the arguments set forth by those who are believe that the King James Version is the only Bible God wants us to use.Having read a little over the last ten years in favor of the KJVO position, and having accepted some of it, I was surprised to see that the position is riddle with error, logical fallacies, inconsistencies, at times outright falsehood. At the same time, I found that my doubts about the KJVO position were well-founded doubts.White demonstrates that the KJVO position is indefensible. While he does this, White maintains that the King James version is a good translation worthy of our use and respect. He does not denigrate the King James Version.White takes the logic of the KJVO position and proves it to be incorrect. He also takes the textual position of the KJVO advocates and demonstrates that it, too, is an incorrect position due to the fact that Alexandria produced some stalwarts of the faith as well as Antioch.One of the favorite arguments of KJVO advocates is that the modern versions water down fundamental doctrines such as the deity of Christ. White compares other versions with the KJV to demonstrate that the argument will not stand scrutiny.Another argument that KJVO advocates set forth is the argument that other versions \\"leave out\\" many things that should be in the Bible. White demolishes that argument by reminding us that the Bible is translated from the Hebrew and the Greek, and that comparisons should be made, not with the KJV as the standard, but with the original languages as the standard.In the end, White contends that we have some very good modern translations; translations that can be trusted.The book is well written as well as graciously written. I hope it will help many who struggle with this issue."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Outstanding way for any Christian (not just KJV Only folk) to understand how we got our English Bibles. James White is a conservative and caring man who does not try to belittle the KJV. Why? The KJV is an excellent translation. Rather, White responds to those that would have no room for OTHER CHRISTIANS to use the Bible of THEIR choice.This book succeeds in three ways:First, it is written in a non-threatening tone and in respectful words.Now, if you are particularly militant in your view, then you will find anything that leads away from KJV Only philosophy as especially threatening. But if you are that militant, you won't read the book anyway! You will, as does several reviewers on this site, say, \\"I haven't read this book, but one doesn't need to read falsehood to understand...\\" If, on the other hand, you are sincerely looking for good information, then you will find it done exceedingly well with James R. White's fine book. As someone who highly respects the King James Bible (I am from Camp # 2 in White's book, as he describes 6 different types of KJV users, I found this an excellent read, and refreshing in its honest description of what translators did, and how they do it. You can't \\"lose your faith\\" with this book, you can only see the truth of God's word more clearly.Second, it lays out the history of the King James Bible very well. This never attacks the King James Bible. Remember, the author respects the KJV. In addition, you learn of other translations and how they came to be. But, for the KJV Only adherents, it is good to see the history of the KJV Bible. For instance, many who are very strong KJV Only adherents will allow only certain editions of the KJV Bible (and never the original 1611 version). Why will they not allow the original 1611 preface to be printed in their accepted Bibles? Because the translators admit to their imperfect attempt to translate from the Greek, Hebrew, and other languages. This is true for any translator, if they are honest. But some KJV Only adherents would never want their parishioners to realize that translators are indeed human. So, they remove those words. Odd?Finally, this is excellent because it is excellent for anyone, regargless of whether or not you follow this controversy. It will build your faith. James R. White address (in this newest version) the latest Biblical detractors like Bart Ehrman (who questions the authenticity and reliability of the Scriptures). In order to answer those claims, one must understand transmission history and a little about the original Greek and Hebrew manuscripts (and the extant manuscript evidence...which is plentiful). These modern controversies are dissolved simply because once one understands the history, the objections fall away. Faith in God's word is elevated.The only thing that will be attacked in this book is poor theology and poor historical clarity. It will not be like reading a novel, but if you take it chapter by chapter, you will be very glad you read it. It is very readable. And the footnotes (which you can skip, if you want) will bring out some of the most interesting historical details.If you are King James Only, then you are so, most likely, as a position of faith. If so, you are going to be warned against reading this book. Try this: Read this book, and then read one of the books that attacks this book. Then decide for yourself.If you had no idea that there was a \\"controversy,\\" please consider reading this book anyway. You will learn so much about your own translation, about the history, and why we can trust the Bible (be it KJV or ESV, or other versions). To be sure, you will find out what the challenging verses and translations are, which is a GOOD thing. And your faith will be encouraged.I give it only 5 stars because I can not rate it ten!JJ"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I applaud Dr. White for this much-needed gem of a book. It explodes the false theology of the heretical KJV Only Cult. Dr. White is a very learned Christian gentleman who treats the subject with reverence, grace and sound argumentation.It's hard to believe this book would actually have any critics, but sure enough, I see that a few KJV Only Cultists have chosen to make fools of themselves by submitting critical reviews which are full of the same old silly, groundless accusations I've heard time and time again. (Obviously, these goofballs didn't really read this book). For decades the Godly Christian scholars behind the modern translations, as well as their defenders such as Dr. White, have been railed against by KJV Only Cultists who have not a fraction of their learning. Without even attempting to find out for themselves the REAL reasons why the modern versions read as they do, these shameless, ignorant heretics go off half-cocked and throw about wild charges of satanic conspiracy. Their asinine, unfounded and hate-filled accusations clearly reveal a spirit totally at variance with that of Christ. Consequently, these people couldn't be very close to the Lord. How will the KJV Only Cultist be able to stand in the Day of Judgment in light of this?KJV Only Cultists seem to be completely ignorant of the histories of the Biblical text and the venerable King James Version, or if they are not, they shut their eyes to them in favor of fabricated histories appealing to their inane prejudices. They should read the preface to the original KJV 1611 edition written by the translators themselves. It serves as a rebuke to them.KJV Only Cultists should know this: their Final Authority is NOT the Word of God, as is so often proudly claimed by them, but in reality the King James Version TRANSLATORS are their Final Authority (along with nuts like Ruckman, Riplinger and Gipp to name a few). This is a necessary consequence of their theology. The position of historical, evangelical Christianity down through the centuries to the time of Christ has ALWAYS been that Divine inspiration ONLY pertains to the ORIGINAL documents actually written by Moses, the prophets, the apostles, etc., and not to any copies of these documents or translation of copies of these documents. KJV Onlyism is a comparatively new belief system, having only been around for a century or so, and its theology and claims grow increasingly more outlandish as time passes. The next thing you'll hear from these crackpots is that one's salvation requires reading the KJV! It is really nothing more than a cultish system of idolatry.In point of fact, KJV Onlyism is based on assumption and rampant circular reasoning, fueled by extreme ignorance and driven by emotion. It is wholly unworthy of anyone claiming to be Christ-like. So why have so many fallen for this false teaching? The answer, as Dr. White points out in this book, is simply because it preaches well. KJV Onlyism's arguments, as presented by its wacko proponents, seem as if they must be true to the uneducated Christian who is ignorant of the history of the Bible and how translations of it are actually made. The irrational and ignorant Christian is easy prey for this foolishness.If you logically think about it, you'll realize that the ONLY REAL WAY one could hope to prove that the King James Version is alone the inerrant Word Of God is to actually find a verse in it, supported by manuscripts of some weight, that says, in effect, that the KJV is alone the inerrant Word of God. That's laughable, of course - for obvious reasons. Besides, what context would such a verse have? This factor alone would cause any Bible scholar or rational layman to regard the verse as totally spurious. However, while KJV Onlyism is therefore impossible to prove, it is quite easy to DISPROVE in a myriad of different ways. Dr. White amply does just that in this enlightening book.Congratulations, Dr. White!"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I can show you how to be saved with just water baptism from the dumb NIV Acts8:36 As they travelled along the road,they came to some water and the eunuch said, &quot;Look, here is water. Why shouldnt I be baptized? 38 And he ordered the chariot to stop. Then both Phillip and the eunuch went down into the water and Phillip baptized him.39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Phillip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. What happened to verse 37. Verse 37 is the most important verse here it says; And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Again the NIV makes Jesus out to be a sinner. Jesus is angry with the money changers because His house is a house of prayer not of moneychangers. The NIV says if anyone is angry with his brother he is in danger of the judgement.KJV says angry without a cause. Again the NIV when you try to find out who the Morningstar is you will find Lucifer in Isaiah 14 and Jesus in Revelations, both share this title in the NIV.

For example, Matthew 23:14:Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.That's not something that should be taken out of any version.Another example:But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.

If God created the earth and the empty space on day one and then created the firmament on the second day which made two heavens and later Paul mentioned the third heaven then common sense would dictate that there should not be an s after heaven on day one DUH. This is just another bad example of someone trying to condemn a Bible that saw more revivals than any modern version has ever spawned. A Bible that all the Great preachers used and defended.

If you do a comparison between the different \\"Bible\\" versions, you will find that they are not all made equal.

The King James Bible uses the Masoretic Text of the Hebrews for the Old Testament, and the Antiochan Greek text for the New Testament. Most modern alternatives to the Bible have a foundation built on the Samaritan Torah/Pentateuch and the Westcott and Hort (of the Ghostly Guild) Greek Text. This Westcott and Hort Greek text is also the underlying text used by the Jehovah's Witness Bible, the New World Translation (NWT). Alexandria, was the epicenter so to speak for gnosticism in the ancient world, and what came out of it was the Septuagint (LXX). The Septuagint (LXX) has been highly regarded unfortunately in many colleges and seminaries, I've attended two of them. These teachers were nice men, but unfortunately compromised and went the way of Baalam when it came to protecting the Word of God. When it comes to choosing between fearing God and men, fear God.

RSN, RSSV, NASV, NIV, and so on are just tampered with catholic versions, and Rome and the Bible never did and never will mix. People who say that these new versions are from the oldest, more reliable texts, not at all true. There are quotes from the texts that the KJV come from BEFORE the \\"oldest ones\\" existed, and that's impossible then the the Romam bible is the oldest. Also, when they say oldest they mean of COMPLETE TEXTS that were found. What liars and White should know better. No folks, the NIV and all modern translations comes from edited texts where not only were many words and verses left out, but words were also replaced thus changing the meaning. Dean Bergeon \\"The Last 12 Verses Of Mark\\" is a great book and proved the case for the KJV in the 1800's. Dr Chuck Missler has proved it, and Dr Peter Ruckman has some great writings on the subject. Lastly, it is not as hard as many lazy people say it is.

What about the THIRD position that no one is talking about?(David Cloud holds to it). The King James itself is not inspired but is an excellent, accurate translation as is the New American Standard(opposed to- say that abomination, the NIV). The New American Standard was done as well as the King James but the crucial difference was the manuscripts each version was translated from. The New American Standard would have been just as good as the King James but used the same manuscripts ALL the modern versions used- the evil manuscripts corrupted the those two satanic, blasphemous, anti-Christ, UNBELIEVERS- Wescott and Hort- two of the filthiest, UNSAVED, archfiends that EVER lived. Their apostasy, modernism, and unbelief are well documented. So you can have saved, conservative, even fundamentalist translators, but if you build on the past work of DEVILS, it will TAINT the work no matter how well the translation is done, like a good builder building upon either rotten timber or poor quality, crumbly concrete used for a FOUNDATION(or, if the materials are good quality, the foundation was laid INCORRECTLY by the first person or group). When looked at OBJECTIVELY, it is PLAIN that THIS group(the third group)does NOT believe the King James version is inspired or has special powers or is equal(or even superior) to the ACTUAL words and pages penned by the apostles and prophets(the actual KJVO people). This THIRD group and position is NOT King James Only, but TEXTUS RECEPTUS ONLY and WILL say that if the New American Standard translation committee HAD used the TEXTUS RECEPTUS it would have been as good and accurate as the King James- something a King James Only person would NEVER say. The are other versions too, like the Berkley version, that would have been as good as the King James if they had used the TEXTUS RECEPTUS instead of the toilet paper compiled by those VILE servants of hell, Wescott and Hort.The most CASUAL, CURSORY perusal or comparison of the two manuscripts will reveal a TAMPERING with by the Christ-denouncing gutter vermin, Wescott and Hort. There are even textual scholars who DON'T think the King James version was done well but will STILL only use that version because they KNOW the manuscripts used by the modern versions were corrupted. So while the King James Only people are erroneous in their extravagant claims for the King James version they ARE correct(and joined by the TEXTUS RECEPTUS only people) in CORRECTLY saying that the modern versions are filled with satan!!!!!!!If you CARE to know the truth, google \\"call me King James only if David Cloud\\".

These reviewers (some of them) claim that those that espouse the view of KJV superiority are close minded bigots. I find this to be strikingly similar to those charges leveled against Christianity at large for its \\"exclusivist\\" views.Furthermore, not many, if any positive reviewer noted the fact that the straw \\"man\\" (actually, woman, Riplinger) represents an extreme view of KJV ONLYism. Secondarily, it does not concern these reviewers of the nature of the translation errors and outright omissions by the modern translators of vital, doctrinal texts!

They look with disgust upon the poor at the good man's feet, and then look with hatred at the good man. \\"You think you're BETTER than us?\\" they ask him with seething spittle spewing from their lips. \\"You're NOTHING, and we're gonna show you that you are not welcome around here!\\" So they take the good man and they beat him mercilessly, his blood flowing out onto the street. Then the leader turns to the poor, and he berates them as fools and threatens them with abuse if they continue to have anything to do with the good man. \\"He is not better than us!\\" he says; \\"now get out of here or you're next!\\"The Authorized King James Bible is the good man.Those who cherish the Word of God and are persecuted for it are the poor people.The gang members are the new bible versions.The gang leader is James White."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I looked briefly at the very first reviews of this book. How is it that so many of them are only by \\"A Customer\\"? A sensible answer may be that they were truly genuine reviews, but you certainly have to wonder if they were answered by few or a single opposer to this book.The quick and naughty of this book is that the KJV is a translation like all other translations like RSV, NIV, NASB, etc. While the KJV is based on a handful of more recent texts, the NT for the others are based on older (so closer to the time period of Christ) documents numbering well over 5,000. Handful versus 5,000. It's interesting to note that few or no people bothered to address the fact that the original 1611 KJV had a slew of errors and required revisions over the coming years. White makes this argument and its a solid one.The only reason I have this 4/5 is you can certainly feel a bit of arrogance in his writing and all of his aim is against KJV. If you truly want to read the correct text, then no translation will do even the KJV. You'll have to learn Greek for NT and Aramaic & Hebrew for the OT. But for everybody else, the best bet is to read unbiased translations (which would be to avoid translations like the Mormon Bible, Jehovah Witnesses, New Jerusalem Bible, perhaps NRSV). Translations like NLT, NIV, TNIV, HCSB, NASB, ESV, and even RSV are generally good choices depending on what you desire of a literal (and sometimes difficult wording) translation or one that flows with the text better but gives up some of it's literal translation for readability.

It is a perplexing mixture of outright condescension and feigned compassion. This is in painful evidence from the very outset! In the Introduction, for example, White states plainly his mission to exhume the truth without bitterness... and then SUDDENLY launches into a neat categorization of KJV-ers on a sort of &quot;smartest-to-dumbest&quot; scale!!Indeed, this dichotomy-- between playing the &quot;good wise, patient professor&quot; on one hand and trashing those who DARE to think differently on the other-- crops up so often in White it almost becomes a caricature.

The King James Only Controversy exposes the many fallacies, lies, mis-quotes, mis-representations of KJV-only authors: Gail Riplinger's book, New Age Bible Versions; William Grady's, King James The Fianl Authority; and many of Peter Ruckman's bombastic articles. The book is priceless as it opens up explaining the five(5) KJVO camps and positions they take. James White points out one of the biggest problems today in the KJVO camp is that they have no clue as to where the Bible came from and little if no knowledge of the original languages. James White vast research gets detailed into the many different Greek manuscripts and how they ended up with textual variants. He shows how variants came to be and how this relatesto the heart of the KJV-only moment. Another area where James White points out is how the KJV actually came into being, which is detailed in itself. He points out the many probelms that the translators had with the first edition of the 1611. The many revisions the AV went through and how the AV ended being the 1769 edition and not the 1611! Mr. White's detailed explanation behind the process of &quot;Textual Criticism&quot;, one can see the value of importance of knowing the Biblical languages as a pastor. While reading this bok, one could not help but notice the pain-staking process of creating manuscripts copies, and how this process falls into the &quot;Laws of Linguistics&quot;, which James White points out the KJV-only camp ignore. Finally, the crescendo of The King James Only Controvery is when Mr. White actually compared the Translational Diferences from the KJV to the two main English versions: the NASB; and the NIV. In detail one sees that in many instantances the NASB or the NIV were superior in translation, where as in other verses the KJV was.Bottom line, there really was no big difference in Textual differences and a so-called corruption of the English texts&quot;. As you read this book, one thing becomes evidently clear; the bottom falls out of the KJV-only movement and are looked upon by the following: purely unwilling to learn or wanting to know the facts, totally beside itself as a whole, do not base things on fact but on fiction eg..Gail Riplinger's book, New Age Bible Versions; refuse to hear the facts, way the evidence and they cling to their naked appeals of emotion! It is without note that James White goes into great detail explaining how we got our Bible and did it from a very objective standpoint without any bias or prejudice leaning from one English Translation to another.

By way of addressing this issue, hereafter \\"KJV-only,\\" the author provides the reader with an accessible introduction to the basic principles of textual criticism, the academic discipline which endeavors to establish the original text of Scripture. In the context of the issues addressed in this book, the reader comes to understand that textual criticism is not merely an obscure and impractical branch of scholarship, but rather that it is vitally important to our common Christian faith.At the outset the author clarifies what he means by KVJ-only-ism, and what he is, and is not, specifically seeking to refute. He delineates the full range of belief among those who may be classified within the KJV-only camp. First there are those prefer the KJV to other versions because it is what they grew up with, or because of the beauty of its language, or for other reasons of personal preference. Second are those who hold that the Hebrew and Greek texts behind the KJV are superior to the modern critical texts. Third are those who claim that the Textus Receptus, the text behind the KJV, was supernaturally preserved, or even inspired by God. Fourth are those who affirm that the KJV translation itself is inspired by God, and therefore inerrant. Fifth and finally is the group who claims that not only is the KJV inspired by God and therefore authoritative, but that wherever it differs from the Greek and Hebrew texts, it is actually new revelation, and should be used to correct the original Greek and Hebrew texts. It is to the third, fourth and fifth groups, and those who have been troubled by them, that the author addresses his arguments.Much of the impetus behind the KJV-only movement arises from entirely predictable human emotional reactions. We humans are creatures of habit, and therefore will tend to be suspicious of anything novel, especially when it seems to be supplanting something time-honored and viewed as sacred. Since generations of Christians have embraced the KJV as their Bible, it tends often to be perceived as an integral part of our faith, and hence when some upstart \\"new and improved\\" translation comes along, there is a visceral reaction against it, as something that is threatening the faith of our fathers. The history of the church shows that this phenomenon with translations of Scripture has repeated itself from the earliest days of the Church. The Greek translation of the Old Testament, the Septuagint (LXX), was the source for Old Testament translation until Jerome translated from the original Hebrew in the 5th century. When he did so, there were the same kinds of objections that are heard today from the KJV-only camp, because certain passages were so dissimilar to the time-honored and revered Septuagint. Nevertheless, Jerome's Vulgate proceeded to become the Church's standard for the next millennium. What was viewed at first as a radical departure, in time became the norm. Again, in the 16th century Erasmus broke new ground in Bible translation when he completed the Greek text which became known as the Textus Receptus, which would later become the basis of the KJV. Again there were the same outcries, because it departed from the time-honored Vulgate. But again, the new and radical text of Erasmus eventually became the accepted standard for the next 400 years. The irony is evident, namely that arguments which KJV-only advocates propound against new versions today are the same ones that were voiced against their own cherished Textus Receptus centuries ago.With this historical perspective, the author instructs the reader as to the main features of the current Bible translation battlefield. First, there are the differing translational methodologies of formal equivalence vs. dynamic equivalence. The former seeks to the render the original text as precisely and literally as possible from the original tongue: lexically, syntactically and grammatically. The latter seeks to understand the meaning and intent of the author in the original language, and then render into the target language the author's meaning in the most understandable way possible to the reader, without being bound by the linguistic structures of the original tongue. There are pros and cons to each approach, but it is evident that the dynamic equivalence method is inherently more subjective and hence fraught with more peril.Having demonstrated in the KJV-only controversy the practical relevance of textual criticism, the author gives a quick but useful survey of its main points. He outlines the basic facts and principles of which many believers today are unaware, e.g. the original tongues of Scripture, the lack of verses, spaces and punctuation in the original texts, the four major families of New Testament manuscripts, the multiplicity of variant readings and how they arose, the most commonly made scribal errors, et al. Through this presentation the reader is shown that textual criticism is fairly close to an exact science, and that in most cases by following the logical principles of that science, one can confidently determine the original text. In the context of this book, this demonstration is intended to show that the KJV-only claims of a broad conspiracy by \\"liberal\\" scholars to undermine God's Word are wholly unfounded.KJV-only advocates often belittle the science textual criticism, knowledge of the original languages, and scholarship in general, claiming that we are thereby \\"judging the Word of God.\\" Nevertheless Erasmus, the creator of the Textus Receptus was an exceptionally gifted scholar, and he used the same methods of textual criticism that modern scholars use today. The major difference between him and modern scholars is that he had far fewer and far poorer texts with which to do his work. There were in fact some portions of the New Testament for which he had no Greek text, and so he resorted to using the Vulgate and translating it \\"back\\" into Greek. The KJV-only advocate dismisses the mention of variant readings in modern translations as undermining the authority of God's Word. Yet not only do Erasmus's notes for the Textus Receptus include discussions of variant readings just like the modern critical texts, the Authorized Version of 1611 itself had over 6000 such notes printed in its margins. Moreover, though some insist that the AV of 1611 is divinely inspired, there have been many revisions of the KJV since it was first printed, and the KJV of today is quite different from the first edition.It is therefore not surprising to learn that much of the polemic published by KJV-only advocates is laden with illogical and circular argumentation, misrepresentation of opponents' statements, and even what must honestly be called puerile ad hominem invective. Notable among the literature of this sort are the works of Dr. Peter Ruckman and Mrs. Gail Riplinger. The author painstakingly goes through example after example to illustrate the absurdity of their \\"evidence,\\" with the result that the intelligent and fair-minded reader will shake his head in disbelief at how any credence could be given to their writings. But rather than responding in kind, the author goes through their arguments and addresses them on their merits. The objections to the newer translations such as the NASB, the NIV et al. are often made on the basis of their deviation from the KJV, not on whether they are true to the Greek and Hebrew texts. Thus the KJV-only advocates engage in classic circular reasoning, proving what they assert by their a priori assumption: the KJV is the infallible standard, newer translations deviate from it, hence they violate the infallible standard. Through the multitude of examples cited in which the KJV text is presented side by side with a modern translation and compared with the original languages, it is demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no grand conspiracy to subvert the essential truths of the faith by the modern translations, as many KJV-only advocates affirm. Indeed, in not a few cases the modern translation cited is shown to be stronger on the deity of Christ, the sacrificial blood atonement, or other cardinal doctrines than the KJV.The remainder of the book is mainly taken up with an analysis of the actual textual differences between the Textus Receptus and the modern critical texts. With this the reader is taken a bit further into the actual practice of textual criticism, applying its rules to specific textual issues, studying variant readings, understanding how they arose, and why in the end a particular reading was taken. In every case the conclusion is the same. Good-faith scholarship has been applied, and readings have been selected on the basis of their merit according to the verified principles of textual criticism, not because of any hidden agenda or conspiracy.At the end of the day we do well to remember our Lord's words: \\"You shall know them by their fruits.\\" Like the Pharisees of all ages, many of the most strident KJV-only advocates like Ruckman and Riplinger, claim for themselves the high ground in defending God's truth. But they are in fact guilty of slandering good men, bearing false witness against their brothers in Christ, being accusers of the brethren, causing division in churches, and undermining the saints' confidence in God's Word as that which has been providentially preserved for His people. These are not the works of God, but of the devil."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I read one review critical of this book above, and I must say I doubt the reviewer read the book--certainly not the book I read. James White's book is very helpful and informative.It has enough information and history for any scholar or pastor. And yet it is well written so that the average person will have no problem absorbing this fascinating book.It is recommended on so many levels. I will mention two:1) If you want more insight on certain passages of scripture for which there are differences between the translations, James White puts the translations of verses side by side. He then explains why, the NIV, NASB, and the KJV committees translated such and such a verse the way they did.In this respect the book is an EXCELLENT bible study tool.2) Let's you are a seminary graduate who needs to brush up on the history behind the different manuscripts, and why some manuscripts are preferred to others by the different translation committees, or let's say you forgot what the codex sinaiticus, and the codex vaticanus is, and the significance regarding the geographical origin of these manuscripts--this is a great book to fill you in.You may be a beginner studying these things for the first time, to which I can vouch for the blessing you will receive from this book. You will learn why there are differences between the translations, and how you may know the probability of a one certain translation being more correct when they all differ on important passages. You will get a terrific basic understanding as to how and why the scholars arrive at certain conclusions.The book handles the &quot;King James Only&quot; Group in a very mature, scholarly fashion. I have seen criticism of this book by &quot;King James Only&quot; advocates, but it is important to note that they do not (or cannot) provide examples to refute the arguments of Mr. White.James White uses very specific examples to indicate when the King James, NIV, and NASB can and cannot be trusted as the most accurate translation. he also demonstrates how the King James Only defenders are prone to misquote scholars, and take those scholars out of context. He gives point by point rebuttals to certain King James Only arguments, etc.It is also interesting to note that this book has the endorsment of many solid Bible scholars, and teacher including Dr. Norman Geisler, etc.This book is far more valuable than the price for which it is sold.Two words: BY IT!"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Best book I've seen for the layperson to give confidence that modern Bible translations do reflect the original Bible--that remoteness, errors, incompleteness (\\"lost gospels\\"), and alleged bias fail as arguments challenging the accuracy of today's Bibles. It's because of the recent surge of bestselling attacks against the Bible canon and trustworthiness that I'm reviewing this not new book. As the title suggests, White originally wrote the book to correct popular errors promoted by the 1990's KJV-Only Movement, which attacked the increasingly popular modern Bible translations, their underlying Greek texts, and their translators. To rebut the KJV-Only position White goes into the science of \\"textual criticism\\" (how scholars determine what the original Bible actually said) and explains what texts were available when, which translators relied on which texts and why, types of error, and the disputed issue of the significance of the one text-type having more copies but of a late date while another text-type has fewer recent recent copies but relatively more closer to the time of the original writing. This book's title unfortunately does not convey it's broad value, not just for those concerned about the King James Version, but for anyone questioning whether ANY Bible is trustworthy."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"D.A. Carson made the first popular venture into this unpopularand controversial area with his brief but excellent book, TheKing James Only Debate. White, however, surpasses Carson withthe depth of his research and breadth of his survey. This bookis, currently, THE book on the subject. I know of no other thatdeals with the topic so thoroughly, exploring the textual historyof the Bible, particularly the NT, and the various underlyingmanuscripts with reference to Hebrew, Greek and Latin where appropriate.He offers penetrating critiques of the popular KJV Only positionsthat are honest and fair.With recommendations from such lumiaries as Bruce Metzger,Norman Geisler, R.C. Sproul, as well as D.A. Carson, thisbook cannot be ignored by anyone involved in or studying thisdebate."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"White's book performs a service by providing a scholarly review of the problems associated with the KJV Only Debate currently dividing many churches. He clearly reminds the reader that where you begin can determine whether or not something was left out or added in. Nowhere does White condemn the use of the KJV, rather he encourages intelligent reading in a variety of translations. This book will probably not help those who have bought into dogmatic presuppositions, but is insightful for the serious student of the Bible. White presents a well informed picture of textual critical (the word means to read carefully, not negatively) studies and reminds the reader that the Bible in English is a recent innovation that was considered heresy in its own day. 50 million Chinese Christians would be the first to ask the question, &quot;do I have to read KJV English in order to be saved?&quot; White's answer would be a resounding &quot;NO!&quot; Serious Bible scholarship involves addressing such issues only because enough people run around mouthing things about a translation they do not even read but would die defending. White's book provides both answers and questions. Examine this book, pray about the material, asking God to enlighten you. At any rate, read it to be informed, no matter what side of the debate you may take. &quot;Come let us reason together.&quot; Points to consider: The KJV 1611 included alternative wordings in the margins. It had over 35,000 spelling, grammar, printing errors and was revised six times before the 1769 edition which is the one most folks carry. Also, the 1611 edition was printed in two editions. Edition one was recalled and destroyed after leaving &quot;not&quot; out of the commandment &quot;Thou shalt [not] commit adultery&quot;. And, why not claim sole inspiration for any of the prior English translations like the Tyndale, Bishop's, etc. which all predated the KJV 1611 by 50 to 300 years (six translations in all appeared prior to the 1611). And, finally, if we translate the scriptures into foreign languages, why should we not translate the Bible into the &quot;foreign&quot; [American] English of our receptor audience? [By the way, I use the KJV and love it, but I read it intelligently not blindly]. With the average high school graduate only reading at a 5th grade reading level, it seems silly to put a Bible translation in their hands if they cannot read it. Most modern translations have worked diligently to keep up with the gradual loss in literacy in this country and generally follow reading levels as one of their primary guidelines for the vocabulary levels used in simplified translations, i.e. NCV - 3rd grade; NLT 5th - 8th; NIV 8th - 10th; NKJV 10th - 12th; KJV, NASB, NRSV, Young's Literals, etc. are all around 12th - college reading levels. Since faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, how will they have faith if they cannot read what is placed in their hands?"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I intend to keep this review as short and as helpful as possible:Dr James White did an incredibly good job composing this book. The beginning of the book is basically an introduction to the texts used in Bible translations; that is the TR for the KJV as well as other texts such as the Alexandrian manuscripts and the Majority text for modern versions, and explains the difference between thees texts. He provides a brief defense for the Alexandrian texts as KJV Only advocates claim that they were corrupted by a cult down in Alexandria, which, as White clearly demonstrates, has no true grounding whatsoever.He dedicates a portion of the book to answering or refuting the KJV O.'s questions and logical fallacies, as well. He mentions some big names in the KJV Only camp such as Gail Riplinger (and her absolutely abysmal \\"work\\" New Age Bible Versions), Peter Ruckman, and others, and combats their arguments (if you could really call them arguments) using facts, texts, and logic- three things that seem to be missing from the KJV O.'s writings. He also uses part of that portion of the book to point out some of the errors in the KJV and where certain words translated correctly back in 1611 would be an incorrect translation today as the English words themselves have changed their meaning.I think White did a great job a presenting a case for modern translations and not a case against the KJV. He stated over and over that he is perfectly okay with and recommends that people use the KJV in their reading and in their churches if they would like to. He often compliments the KJV for its poetic flow and memorable structure, but he does make the point that it is not the only legitimate translation very clear.I do highly recommend this book. It's easy to read and easy to understand, and is a very helpful asset for one who has dealt, does deal, or will deal with militant (as they commonly are) KJV Onlyists.I pray that this book will be used to edify the church as well speak the truth in love."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"\\"If the King James was good enough for Moses and Jesus, it's good enough for me.\\"I can't believe there are KJO people out there.

Since it appeared, some major translations have appeared on the market, so the book is somewhat outdated. Mr. White is a proponent of the Modern Critical Text. He does discuss the history of the King James Only position, whose proponents can become alarmingly uncharitable, to say the least. However, he makes all proponents of the King James Version/Textus Receptus appear as uninformed dolts. I would recommend the book as it gives a readable look at a very important subject. Remember that such persons as Gail A. Riplinger and Peter Ruckman are the 'lunatic fringe' of the KJVO movement. There are more less shrill voices who exert a more moderating influence. I prefer the ESV, myself. But, all Christians of the evangelical/fundamental persuasion should read this book."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"My files are full of KJV-Only material which I accumulated from about 1976 to about 2002 when I embraced this particular viewpoint.I was a member of the Dean Burgon Society.I subscribed to, and regularly read the literature of Dr. Donald Waite.I met and even interviewed David Otis Fuller in the 1970's.I was dyed-in-the-wool KJV Only.Then, I read White's book & began to examine information objectively. There are several reasons why I no longer embrace King James Only-ism and it really has little to do with his publication. Although, that's not to suggest that White's book lacks sound arguments.What was it that really solidified my decision to change ?It was this: I read \\"THE TRANSLATORS TO THE READER\\".KJV-Only people, by and large, are not aware that this document exists and that it was drafted by the KJV translators themselves. I never even heard of \\"THE TRANSLATORS TO THE READER\\" until White referenced it in his book.This document was the preface to the original King James Version 1611. Probably no human beings either alive today, or since the 1600's, know more about the KJV than those very men who translated it. I suddenly realized after reading THE TRANSLATORS TO THE READER that these guys were not \\"KJV Only\\" even with their own translation. If THEY, the same scholars who gave us the King James Bible, were NOT KJV-Only, well then why was I ?If these brilliant translators were alive today, there is no question that they would reject all notions of this KJV Only-ism position. This fact is deduced from THE TRANSLATORS TO THE READER.If you are teachable and are willing to read THE TRANSLATORS TO THE READER, download it and read it. It is difficult reading so you'll have to go through it several times, but it is liberating !Turning your back on the KJV-only movement does NOT mean you are denying God's Word as they would have you believe.KJV-Only advocates typically are willfully ignorant when it comes to this particular doctrine. They are not interested in any information that clearly contradicts their position. They are not interested in developing a humble, teachable attitude. This demeanor they possess points to a spiritual problem, not an academic one.Practical observations about the KJV-Only teaching:(1) It has caused deep and permanent division amongst Christians. KJV-Only people are exclusivists, meaning that they will tend not to support any person or organization that doesn't share their view... Even if such person or organization is successfully doing God's work. The KJV-Only movement is quickly developing into a cult.Read the \\"one star\\" reviews of White's book (and books like it) and you will encounter mindless, emotionally driven diatribes, mud slinging & name calling. Notice the high level of animosity and personal attacks coming from this crowd. KJV-Only activists regard everyone who disagrees with them to be demonized, liars, apostates, etc.(2) Peter Ruckman is, for all practical purposes, the father of KJV-Only doctrine, although even many KJV-Only activists would distance themselves from him. Study this movement's history, it will be discovered that prior to Ruckman, there really is no definitive, sizable, or noticeable voice holding to KJV-Only that gained momentum.(3) It is primarily held, and promoted by, Independent Fundamental Baptists (IFB) in the United States.So KJV-Only is a movement within a movement.(4) There are different levels of commitment to this view and within the movement. In other words, some KJV-Only advocates would not go as far, or to the extreme as others would... Also, there are those who use the King James Bible as a preference, but who do not embrace or endorse KJV-Only doctrine.[Notice to angry commentors: I will delete this post & then re-post it, so don't waste your time]."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"This is by far one of the most interesting and exciting books available on the history of the New Testament text.

It was easy to read and easy to understand.For anyone interested in the King James Version vs. modern Bible versions debate, this book is essential. However it is also a great way to get introduced to the history of the text of the New Testament.James R. White has been defending the core doctrines of Christianity for a long time, such as the doctrine of the Trinity, the deity of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of Christ, justification by faith alone, the Sovereignty of God, the doctrine of the total depravity of man, irresistible grace, perseverance of the saints, the reliability of the Bible, etc.James White also debated Dr. Bart Ehrman concerning the historical reliability of the text of the New Testament. I highly recommend listening to that debate together with reading this book on the King James Version controversy.Whether or not you have ever been concerned about which Bible versions to use, or more importantly, which Greek manuscripts are reliable for Bible translation, this book is still worth your time to get introduced to a fascinating and essential topic regarding the historic reliability of the New Testament and our translations of it today.King James Only Controversy, The: Can You Trust Modern Translations?"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Dr James White does not \\"crank books out\\" -- this is the real deal.

Skip's issue with White's book is that it supports (or at least does not speak against) those Bible translations that leave out certain verses that are contained within the King James. It is not a matter of being liberal regarding the Word of God to admit that there are words, phrases or even an entire paragraph that are included in some manuscripts but not in all or in the best of manuscripts. None of those words or phrases call into question ANY doctrine of the Christian faith. In each case what is in question has been stated elsewhere in Scripture, given to us in manuscript evidence that is beyond dispute. To acknowledge such omissions (or insertions) in some of the later manuscripts is simply being honest regarding the manuscript evidence. The King James version is not the authority but the autographs written in Hebrew, Aramiac and Greek by the original writers. More than enough manuscript evidence exists to present the Word of God in its veracity. As a Lutheran pastor when I teach my people the truth of God's Word it is verified by the original languages and not by a much revised edition of the King James version."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Over the years I never really understood the whole King James Version Only controversy.

I've read their materials and I find that not only is this statement unsupportable but those in the KJV Only movement affirm the biblical, historical and foundational truths of the Bible.\\"I am no friend of those who would seek to undercut the very foundations of the Christian faith. Indeed, it is a concern for the integrity of the faith that drives this reply to the KJV Only position...\\" Advocates and supporters of the KJV are in no way engaged in a campaign to undercut the foundations of the Christian faith, regardless of what Mr. White may think. Nor does their position in any way compromise the integrity of the faith.\\"It is very common to find the KJV Only advocates dismissing any appeal to the Greek of Hebrew manuscripts.\\" Actually, I have found the opposite to be the case. I have found KJV Only materials are very willing to discuss the Greek and Hebrew when the situation calls for it.Mr. White's contention that KJV Only advocates are \\"fuzzy\\" on the particulars of how we got the Bible should appeal only to those who have failed to read any KJV Only materials.Mr. White contends that \\"Anglican ecclesiology had an impact upon the KJV's translation\\" but failed to provide any examples where any Anglican theology has influenced the translation. Mr. White had every opportunity to make the case in his book but for reasons unknown does not.Mr. White wrote, \\"Misrepresenting others-even those we wrongly feel are in error-is not an option for one who follows Jesus.\\" Yet when reading this book one believes the author is free to make such misrepresentations about KJV Only advocates.The author wrote, \\"And finally, there is no conflict between obedience to Christ and belief in Christ.\\" One does not have to believe in Jesus Christ in order to obey Him. Unfortunately, Christianity is rife with such examples.When discussing an omission or deletion Mr. White wrote, \\"Of course, someone might argue that the omission in such a small number of manuscripts could have been due to single scribal error, and such is, or course, a possibility.\\" But, no doubt, far from certain. This leaves one to wonder why he would write such a statement when on the next page he wrote, \\"The difference between textual criticism done on the basis of facts and evidence, and that done on the basis of conspiracies and prejudgment, is plainly evident.\\" Well, apparently then it's not evident to Mr. White when the proceeding quote is more supposition that factual! What sort of evidence does Mr. White appeal to if all he has is a possibility?On page 174 Mr. White wrote, \\"...including a reading that has fallen out of the majority of Greek manuscripts.\\" I think Mr. White's cause would best be served if he could somehow show that this had actually happened. Mr. White makes the same mistake in discussing Acts 16:7 by writing, \\"The phrase \`of Jesus' has dropped out of the majority of Greek Texts.\\" He again fails to provide us with any objective reason to believe that this is what has actually happened!Words such as probably, could have, most probably, may be, quite certain, possibility, could have been, quite possible and almost certainly are scattered throughout his book and use of words such as these lead to less than definite conclusions and leaves the reader that Mr. White is engaged in guessing.In this book Mr. White has labeled KJV Only advocates as indoctrinated, anti-intellectual, anti-scholarship and anti-freedom and the like. I find it unsettling that one who calls himself a Christian would describe his fellow believers in such a slanderous manner.Mr. White does a great disservice to his cause by displaying his obvious prejudice against those who advocate the KJV and his doing so leads him to make some rather unsupportable claims. Mr. White could have and should have used his book to help bridge the supposed gulf that may or may not have existed between the two but instead uses the opportunity to push the two parties even further apart.In closing Mr. White wrote, \\"Finally, as I said at the beginning, my desire is for the peace of Christ's church.\\" I find it difficult to believe that he is indeed desiring peace if he is willing to mischaracterize his fellow believers as he has done. If he indeed wants peace I can only believe that he will accept it only on his terms.Instead of this book a better treatment on the subject isWhich Bible?

And in Acts 4:27, Jesus is called the &quot;holy servant&quot; rather than the &quot;holy child&quot;. The holy child in that verse refers to a father and son relationship. The word servant refers to familyless wanderer. And in Matthew 5:22 and Mark 3:5, if you read carefully, you will see that these verses make jesus christ look like a guilty sinner. You may ask &quot;how do we know if we have an accurate trnslation&quot;? Just look in Mark 1:1-3. you will see that there is a mistake in these modern translations. In those verses it is said that the prophet isiah had written that prophecy. He has IN PART, according to isiah 40:3 BUT ALSO in Malachi 3:1. In the KJV it says it was written by the prophetS. Which means that both isiah and malachi had written those prophecy's. This is not evident in the modern translations. So, if you want to have an accurate bible use the KJV. and by the way, ALL these modern translations make these mistakes and many more."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"There is nothing new under the sun and this book just adopts the apostate methadology of textual criticism for evangelicals.

It is quite funny because I'll sometimes give people a 4 page tract from the TBS about \\"why we hold to the Authorised Version\\" and then I'll see them a week later with this book (sold cheap at local Christian bookshop) and they'll say they want to read both sides of the debate. As if reading a 4 page tract is comparable to 350 page book.

Bringslid and the unholy trinity that is \\"Bible BELIEVER,\\" \\"Silence Do Good,\\" and \\"Erica Davies,\\" all of whom I am convinced are the same person. Yes, next to the 1599 Geneva Bible, the KJV is satanic blasphemous garbage falsehood distortion deception blah blah freakin' blah. I mean, if the newer translations are garbage, etc., then the newer 1611 KJV must be suspect compared to the older 1599 Geneva, although I suppose one would have to interpolate the timeline to find just how bad the KJV is.Ahem. Okay, rant over. But, really, how many times does one have to report a one-star ad hominem non-review before Amazon will remove it?Anyway, my war on such non-reviews predates my reading of White's book. Now that I have actually read it, I am now positionally qualified to review it. Whether I am intellectually qualified is anybody's guess.First, I did not find White to be condescending or obnoxious in the least. Rather, I found him possessing a significant degree of self-restraint in the face of the rampant name-calling that Riplinger and Ruckman engage in, some of which has been directly aimed at him. What some view as condescension, I see as wry humor.Second, what White has in this book is data. Data until it is coming out of your ears. I felt like I was reading First and Second Chronicles. But, I remind myself, like the Nicene Creed, White's book is defensive in nature. His point is to defend against specific charges, as the Nicene Creed defended against specific heresies. And as sweeping generalizations tend to lead to the very name-calling that his opponents engage in, he must rely instead on facts, facts, and more facts. His conclusions then become almost moot at that point, and White seems to know it, hence his rather wry observations.Third, to anyone who suggests otherwise, White does explain the history behind the KJV and the TR. And in my estimation, his discussions of textual harmonization and expansion of piety to explain how the later Greek texts could be \\"more complete\\" are worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Several weeks ago, I sent a KJV-Only author a list of verses in which the KJV denies the deity of Christ and the modern versions affirm it. He e-mailed back that my list was &quot;highly inaccurate,&quot; without explaining how an open comparison of verses from the two Bibles could possibly be less-than-truthful, and implied that I was a stooge of the diabolical James White. I have to thank him for turning me on to this great author! White does a fine job exposing the false assumptions, innane conduct, and outright lies promulgated by the cultic KJV-Only movement - which is neither Baptist nor Fundamentalist in the true sense. There is absolutely nothing that can be refuted on scholarly or Biblical grounds in this book. This book should be widely read and provided to independent Baptist pastors everywhere. The only complaint I have is that White refrains from going for the jugular in some cases - those of us who use the NASB/NIV are slow to criticize the KJV, but the fact is, the modern Bibles teach the deity of Christ, salvation by faith and the Trinity MORE times than the KJV. In other words, the KJV is INFERIOR. It isn't just &quot;variant,&quot; it's worse! If you doubt that, fetch an NASB and a KJV and flop your Bibles open to John 1:18, Col. 1:19, 2 Pet. 2:1, Jude 4, etc. The Peter Ruckman's and David Cloud's of this world not only want you to use a Bible that's linguistically incomprehensible (does anyone know what &quot;wot&quot; means?), but doctrinally inferior!"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"This will help you to understand the position that the King James only crowd takes.

Among this misinformation comes James White with his masterful book, The King James Only Controversy. In the book, White examines many passages that have been used against modern versions such as 1 John 5:7. White's work explains in detail why the King James Only people have it wrong concerning the verses they cite. He also holds Ruckman, Riplinger, Cloud, Hills, and Waite to account for their various errors. White also does an unexpected thing in the book. He solidifies my belief that the Alexandrian text-form (compared to the Byzantine text-form) is the closest to the originals (which are lost). White also defends the honor of Westcott and Hort and the people involved with the NIV. These people have been smeared by King James Only groups.There are a few flaws. On the surface, there seems to be a whiff of arrogance surrounding White's theses. Also, the are hints of pride beaming from White. This pride in White's own work rains a bit on the good things the book does.Overall, White has provided a service to the Church in debunking the King Jimmy Only nonsense."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I give James White's King James Only Controversy five stars because the book demonstrates just how unreliable and unscriptural modern textual criticism is. The following are what I see as the major errors of Mr. White's book.1. Even though Mr. White mentions and criticizes men such as Dean John W. Burgon, Dr. Edward Freer Hills, Dr. Peter S. Ruckman, etc., he has chose to completely ignore all these men where they have given cold hard facts and a mass amount of evidence that proves that the Greek texts underlying all modern versions of the Bible are extremely corrupt (namely the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, kept in Roman Catholic properties mind you!).Anyone who reads Burgon's 'The Traditional Text\\", \\"The Last 12 Verses of Mark\\" and \\"The Revision Revised', as well as Dr. Hill's 'KJV Defended', \\"Believing Bible Study' and also Dr. Ruckman's \\"The Christian's Handbook of Manuscript Evidence', shouldn't take Mr. White's book seriously for a minute.2. Mr. White totally ignores the activities in Genesis 3 and Matthew and Luke, chapters 4. It should alarm all true Bible believing Christians who read Mr. White's book that he doesn't even mention Satan one time in the entire book! Anyone who knows their Bible knows that Satan has a vested interest in corrupting and omitting God's words and Mr. White doesn't mention this one time! Sometimes you can tell a lot about a Christian by what they don't do and say! Surely, if Mr. White is a true Christian, then he should know these things. Any Christian, scholar or otherwise, who doesn't figure in Satan in the history of Bible manuscripts, textual criticism, scribes etc., is a fool. Mr. White's book has a lot of fancy arguments, smooth words and fair speeches, but it certainly falls way short of being Biblical!3. Mr. White displays a very poor understanding of heresy and Gnostic doctrine in his book as well. If Mr. White truly understood Gnosticism, Docetism and Arianism like he should, he would never defend an Alexandrian reading like the one found in John 1:18 and other verses. However, Mr. White doesn't pay any attention to the Bible regarding these matters. See Genesis 3, Jeremiah 36, Revelation 22:18-19, Proverbs 30:5-6, Galatians 1:4, 2 Corinthians 11, and 2 Corinthians 2:17.As regards John 1:18, it's always funny when you hear these scholars like James White argue about the authors' writing style being important in textual matters, while at the same time ignoring the fact that every other place, in any Greek manuscript, John writes \\"only begotten Son\\", and not \\"only begotten God\\"!Come to think of it, Mr. White is so dishonest when it comes to these verses, that he can't even handle 2 Cor. 2:17 right. He decides to con his readers into believing that \\"peddle\\" is a better reading than \\"corrupt\\". What Mr. White fails miserably to understand, is that to translate the Greek here as \\"peddle\\" would put his croud in trouble, for that's exactly what people like Mr. White, and the Bible publishers of our day, do. They constantly peddle the word of God to make a profit, or should I say trash disguised as the word of God!Furthermore, the Greek word here (2 Cor. 2:17) can also refer to a deceptive merchant who sells products (oh yeah baby! I can read a Greek lexicon too. If a Bible critic like James White can read Hebrew and Greek, so can I) that he has tainted or corrupted, like mixing good wine with water, or the word of God with the devil's leaven. Of course, James White is an expert at hiding evidence from Christians dumb enough to take his word for it. In the Bible, Mr. White's kind are called serpents, hypocrites and liars, but we wouldn't want to be accused of name-calling by Christians who think James White is an angel of light.The reason why folks like him want 2 Corinthians 2:17 changed to read something else is because the reading as it stands in the KJV identifies his kind and it just terrifies them! The word of God is a sword (Ephesians 6:17, Hebrews 4:12) and they're constantly being stabbed with it!4. Mr. White often wrongly defines KJV Onlyism. True KJV ONLY-ism is the belief and conviction that the KJV is the only perfect ENGLISH TRANSLATION!. This does not mean that KJV advocates believe it's the ONLY Bible God ever inspired. Most KJV-ONLY advocates would argue the same for the autographs, the Masoretic Text and Textus Receptus as well. In fact many KJV believers, myself included, would not argue that the KJV is inspired like the autographs were. The KJV is inspired because what the KJV translators worked with was already inspired. There's no such thing as re-inspiration, or double-inspiration. The inspiration of the scriptures never even left. The Bible says the words of God are alive, quick and powerful (Hebrews 4:12), and that they abide forever (Isaiah 40:8). This proves that Mr. James R. White has created a very deceptive straw-man out of his misunderstanding of what defending and believing God's English Bible is all about.5. Mr. White pretends that spelling variations and punctuation variations in the editions of the KJV prove that it cannot be the pure word of God. White then ignores the fact that if this were the case, then even the autographs are in trouble because the way a name is spelled in Hebrew is often different from the way it is spelled in Greek! The Hebrew and Greek doesn't even have any English punctuation! James White is a gnat strainer who would rather swallow the camels of corrupt Greek texts.6. Mr. White compares the criticisms that Erasmus and the KJV translators faced with the criticisms that modern scholars and translators are faced with today. What Mr. White fails to tell you is that, while some of the criticisms may be similar, the products are not. One group was working to faithfully preserve and translate the true words of God, while the other group defends corrupt Greek texts and hoists them upon unsuspecting Christians as the words of God! When the KJV translators wrote about the meanest translation of the Bible being the word of God or of making an old translation better, they were not speaking of trash from Alexandria, Egypt, and they were not speaking of the unscriptural textual criticism of modern day scholarship.7. Mr. White often speaks for the dead with such comments as \\"if Erasmus were alive today, he would...\\", \\"if the KJV translators were alive today, they would...\\", etc. Baseless speculation that proves nothing.8. Mr. White whines about readings in the KJV such as 1 John 5:7 that have very little manuscript support while at the same time arguing in favor of minority Alexandrian readings that are also not found in the great majority of Greek manuscripts! He performs this two-faced tactic because he believes that Sinaiticus and Vaticanus are older, and therefore, more accurate. He ignores the fact that Dean Burgon demonstrated long ago that just because a manuscript is older, does not make it more reliable, but James White specializes in ignoring evidence.I say that where the KJV departs from the majority Greek texts, it is because it has taken the absolute best of all Hebrew and Greek texts, and also vernacular versions such as the Old Latin. If a reading is not found in the majority of Greek MSS, it is because God gave Erasmus, Beza, Stephanus, the KJV translators and their kind far more sense than He gave to men like James White. After all, if a Bible critic like James White can have his minority readings, so can we!9. On page 179, White claims that the KJV is inferior in it's translation of sheol and hades as hell. White claims that hades should be left untranslated and then claims that modern versions that do this are more accurate translations than the KJV! How can a nontranslation be a better translation? He then proceeds to argue that the lake of fire and hell are one and the same even though the Bible doesn't say this anywhere! JOKE: You can even see the word hell in sheol-HEL!Have you ever stopped to consider how stupid all this is? People like James White ask us to believe that modern translations are for the benefit of modern man and to update the language for today. Update the language?! Are you kidding? I've got news for James White. People today do not say Hades, they say Hell. Talk about Hell and people pay attention and take you seriously. Talk about Hades and people snicker and think \\"Greek mythology\\". White's arguments are good for clown college, but not Bible college!10. On pages 180-181 James White defends the translation of Isaiah 14:12 as morning star instead of Lucifer. He asks why he should believe that Jerome was correct in this Vulgate reading since the Vulgate isn't inerrant anyway. JOKE: James White doesn't believe any Bible is inerrant! Here are the issues. James White never proves that Lucifer is not a proper translation (it is). Lucifer, meaning light bearer, is a perfect cross reference to 2 Corinthians 11:14. The Hebrew word for star isn't even in the verse. Even though the KJV translators put \\"day star\\" as an alternate reading in a margin note, they still had more sense than James White to see that Lucifer is the better translation! James White pretends that Isaiah was just being sarcastic when he gave a title of Christ(Revelation 22:16) to Satan. James White is very hush hush about the devil in his book. To some, Satan is their biggest \\"star\\"!11. Mr. White claims that Titus 2:13 and 2 Peter 1:1 is inferior in the KJV because of the KJV translators' failure to comprehend a grammar rule known as the Granville Sharp. Gary Hudson tried to pull this one on Christians in the 1990 King James Bible Debate with Dr. Ruckman and Dr. Ruckman dismantled this whole argument. Get the video from Bible Baptist Bookstore in Pensacola and you'll see just how much of a con artist James R. White is. All I know is that it has to do with a Hebraism called Hendiady, which means \\"one by the means of two, and it is found all over the Old Testament. Paul and Peter, after all, were Jews!. Gary Hudson was as quiet as a turkey farm on Thanksgiving after Dr. Ruckman blew his argument out of the water12. PG. 88 \\"I have engaged in defense of the Christian faith against a wide variety of critics (JOKE: he himself is a Bible critic) and opponents.\\" \\"Those who hold to the King James Only position could never, ever provide this kind of consistent defense of Scripture (like he has). It's leaders have not only declined one debate challenge after another from me, but they also are not the ones giving any kind of meaningful responses...\\"First, I know many Christians who believe the KJV who win souls to Christ and defend Christianity every day (we are called to be soul winners, not debaters). Second, James White is a proud braggert who's upset because he can't get the attention he wants from real Christian men who have better things to do than waste time with the likes of a Bible criticizing fool.This book is a sad and pathetic attempt to rob Bible believers of the word of God and to rob God of His glory by promoting corrupt trash disguised as Holy Bibles!"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"James White does a great job of explaining the variances from the modern translations compared to the KJV. This book helped my knowledge greatly.Thank you"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"This book is thorough yet accessible to a wide non-technical audience. I found that it was a little MORE thorough than I needed at refuting the extremists, which was not my concern. The book claims a more general usefulness beyond refuting extremism: helping people come to a better understanding of the place of translations and an appreciation for the preservation of Bible truth through the centuries. Indeed, it does this, but you have to wade through a lot of specific refutations of specific claims of the extremists like Ruckman, Waite, and Riplinger (these people have penned some pretty vile stuff and are in fact false, heretical teachers to a very serious degree). If this brand of extremism was a problem in my church or in my family, White's book would be just the ticket.In chapter 1, White lists some varieties of KJV onlyists:1. \\"I Like the KJV best.\\" (These people have a general preference for the KJV based often on its familiarity, appreciation for the literary quality, or its long history as \\"tried and true\\". One argument he didn't mention which I have encountered, is the desire to escape the potential confusion of multiple versions by just using the one and arbitrarily making it authoritative.)2. \\"The Textual Argument.\\" (These people believe, for various reasons, that the Greek and Hebrew texts used by the KJV translators are generally better than those used by modern translators.)3. \\"Received Text Only.\\" (This group believes in the supernatural, perhaps inspirational hand of God in preserving or determining the original-language text used by the KJV translators.)4. \\"The Inspired KJV group.\\" (These people believe that the KJV itself is inspired by God and is therefore inerrant. This is the largest group of KJV onlyists, according to White, and is the group on which he focuses most of his refutation. I personally think #1 is larger and that #2 is also very significant, though neither constitutes a heresy.)5. \\"The KJV as New Revelation.\\" These people believe God actually re-inspired an improved Scripture in 1611 that is different from and superior to what was originally written by Moses, Paul, and the other authors of Scripture.I was more interested in considering points #1 and #2 in the previous list. Mr. White did give some helpful material. But you have to wade through a great deal of #3, #4, and #5. If your need is more like mine was, perhaps a different book will make a better choice for you."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"As a biblical scholar, I commend James White for his careful and accurate scholarship. Don't be misled by some of the negative reviews, as well-intended as they may be. James has done his homework well, and he has NOT retaliated against those who differ with him.Many of my ministry colleagues use the King James Version as their primary Bible, and I memorized more than 4,000 verses from the KJV within the first two years of being saved. Hence, my argument is not with the use of the King James but with what James rightly calls King James Onlyism. Living in Pensacola, close to the headquarters of Peter Ruckman, I can testify to two things: 1) His church members are zealous and outspoken about Jesus, completely unashamed. They should be commended for this! 2) They can be downright nasty to the point of using foul language if you challenge them on King James issues -- even with a gentle spirit.The record needed to be set right, and the pseudo-scholarship of the Gail Riplinger's exposed. I have seen many churches deeply hurt by these errors, and James White is to be thanked for taking the issues on in a forthright, irenic, and scholarly fashion."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I had no idea this controversy existed. As an agnostic, it is fascinating to read about it. I wasn't aware that some Christians believe that God only speaks to Americans in Elizabethan English. The reasoning appears to be something like this:(1) The Bible is the one book containing only God's Words, written by God, and therefore inerrant and perfect, because God is perfect and does not speak falsehoods.(2) Since God is eternal and never changes, those Words are eternal: every sentence, every word within every sentence, every meaning of every word and sentence; and those Words as written by God cannot change or become no longer God's Words.(3) Because the Bible cannot be read by all people in the original languages of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, a translation into their native language written by God is given, otherwise God's Actual Words would not be given in a book for God's people to read.(4) The King James Version (KJV) is that God-written Bible in the English language.(5) To say that the KJV needs any correction or improvement, that some words or entire sentences should be amended or don't belong within the Bible in any form whatsoever, is to say by implication that the KJV does not contain only God's unchanging Words, written by God for God's people to read.(6) It is to dispute, disparage and attack the very basis of the holy doctrine of biblical inerrancy and thus that of God's Words given to God's people.(7) Since the Bible is in fact God's Words, it is inerrant, and so must be the KJV.This is, of course, circular reasoning; but the concept of an inerrant text, not simply a God-inspired text (a subtle distinction), is indeed a fundamental doctrine of Fundamentalism. But which text, which collection of texts? How far forward in handwritten copies beyond the very original form of each canonical text is inerrancy retained? (Notice, too, the sidelined question here on the determination of the inerrant canon.) Is it retained all the way through into the modern original language texts? Does inerrancy ever cross over into the translations of those texts into other languages, or does the inerrancy stop at the original language texts?If inerrancy can cross over into a translation, then which translations can it cross over into, and does every language have at least one inerrant translation or do only some languages? Can innerancy be lost through corruption in every text within an original language and yet retained in a translation? If it is retained in a translation and lost in all texts of the the orignal, then should the original language texts yield to the authority of the translation?In the numbered sections, I used the phrase 'God's Words' rather than 'God's Word', knowing my choice is non-standard, to emphasize that the Bible is a collection of words forming sentences which carry meaning. The question then become does the inerrancy reside in the collection of words and sentences or does it reside in the collection of meanings which those sentences carry?These are not idle questions. They are at the center of the \\"King James Version Only\\" (also known as AV 1611) controversy. The KJVO people assert that the KJV is perfectly inerrant: it is fully and without proviso a true and faithful English language edition of God's Words to His people. It is the full exemplar of God's Word in English. Therefore, no other translation is necessary and any translation that disagrees in any sense with the KJV is false, deceitful, and a treachery against the Christian faith. No modern original language text has more authority than the KJV, and where they disagree, the KJV is faultless and correct and shows God's True Words (see footnote, p. 276). Anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool and tool of the devil.It has even been asserted by a KJVO advocate that the KJV is the only inerrant translation anywhere in the world today (see footnote, p. 168). Since the KJV and modern original language texts disagree, it follows that the KJV is the only inerrant book containing only God's Words, period. It is the world's one true Bible.The change in the range of meaning and conventional sense of some English words since 1611, or the difference in how English sentences are structured and understood now compared to then, is not, it seems, taken into account by the KJVO advocates in their reading and understanding of the KJV Bible. Even if the KJV were in fact inerrant, the true meaning of the language itself is not always evident and unmistakable to a modern reader. Surely the KJVO advocates should provide a book or two on how to comprehend Elizabethan English: God's Language on Planet Earth since 1611.What James White (of the Reformed Baptist church) does in this book is argue against the KJVO advocates by showing why modern English translations (principally the NIV and the NASB) differ from the KJV and why they are doctrinally sound. One of the charges made by KJVO advocates is that modern translations change not only the language in modernizing the English, but they change the core doctrinal teachings of the Bible by excluding words, sentences, and even entire paragraphs from the translation and by using words that change the meaning of the sentence in which they occur.Because the KJV was based upon critical editions of Hebrew and Greek testaments that differ from the modern critical editions, White discusses the methods of determining a critical edition of a text and the reasoning behind the differences between the editions used for the KJV and the editions used for modern translations such as the NIV and the NASB. He explains why the modern editions are better.He discusses principles of translation and the many textual variants explicitly referred to in the KJV itself; and he responds to the charge of doctrinal changes by showing they don't exist: if a teaching appears missing in one place in the Bible it is still clearly evident in another. There is no conspiracy by modern translators to distort, corrupt or subvert the overall meaning of God's Word. White doesn't present his case abstractly. He confronts the charges of the KJVO advocates verse by verse, showing translation differences and explaining why they occur and why the accusations of the KJVO advocates are specious.Because the terminology and phrasing of the KJV are so much a part of the English language recollection of the Bible, our linguistically stored memory of it, White's book is illuminating aside from its aim of defending modern translations against the accusations of KJVO advocates. What he shows is how modern translations are more consonant with what modern scholarship has learned about the original language testaments of the Christian Bible. The metaphysical questions of wherein innerancy might reside and whether unschooled faith or modern scholarship can discover it are not explored."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"The controversy regarding the reliability of modern translations of the Bible, especially in comparison to the King James Version, has been incredibly divisive, often splitting churches and even families. A lot has been said, and even more will be said, in the seemingly never-ending debate over Biblical translations and text families. Without a good understanding of the issues involved, a pastor can easily lead his congregation astray; at the very least, he will be uninformed about an issue that has no small importance to his church. The reliability of the Bible that we read is of utmost importance to Protestant Christians, whose faith is based on the Reformation doctrine of sola Scriptura. James White's book The King James Only Controversy, has been one of the key sources for people who are engaged in correcting the error that is King James Version Onlyism (KJVOnlyism).This book is written to be very accessible to anyone who is looking for good information about the debate. White's purpose is not to engage in intellectual discussion of the issue; he is seeking to give the average reader basic knowledge so that they can understand the issue and its implications to Christians. He also makes an effort to refute many of the more popular arguments of the KJVOnly apologists.White goes to great lengths to make this book accessible to lay readers, even including textual criticism information as an Appendix (labeled \`Part 2' in the book) so that readers who want more information on this particular topic can investigate further, but people who do not want this depth of information can enjoy the book without it. I think that this book, if given to the average KJVOnly who really wants to have an open mind about the subject, it will succeed in showing them the flaws of the King James Only position.This book is not without its shortcomings, however. I was disappointed at the very abbreviated treatment of the Comma Johanneum, since this is one of the areas of tremendous conflict in the debate. White does not address the argument that Cyprian quoted the comma, even though this is an argument that is often used - and rather easy to refute. He does not address the presence of the comma in Codex Brittanicus. He ignores the alleged use of the verse by Eugenius at the Council of Carthage in 485. These are all arguments that KJVOnlies can and will use, and readers of White's book will be aware of them - or will be made aware of them.Another flaw in this book is the amount of time taken in refuting Ruckman and Riplinger. Any reader ignorant of the controversy would believe that these two are the only two people who are writing anything about the King James Bible. The charts are geared toward Riplinger's book - even copying the style in some places. White often refers to his debates with both Riplinger and Ruckman. Considering the ease with which these two are dispatched, it is a wonder that there is a KJVO controversy at all! If only all King James Only advocates were this easy to dispatch, this uneducated. Most real KJVOnlies have distanced themselves from both Riplinger and Ruckman. David Cloud is one example, but he is not mentioned in the book. D.A. Waite is mentioned quite a bit, and is refuted quite handily, though he is also one who has been left on the fringe recently by KJVO advocates. The names mentioned most in the index of the book are Westcott and Hort (together), Peter Ruckman, Gail Riplinger, Erasmus, D.A. Waite, and Bruce Metzger. There are many more KJVO writers out there; it would not have been difficult for White to have found some who were more mainstream.The material in the book is very informative, and is useful, especially for someone who is unfamiliar with the controversy. Unfortunately, the information presented in the book - including White's anecdotes concerning Ruckman and Riplinger -- is widely available on the Internet for free. I admit that this information was hard to obtain in 1995 - perhaps White would release an updated version of the book, so that we can all benefit from the past 9 years of scholarship and debate in this field."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I am thoroughly enjoying this book because of the excellent credentials of its author, & his commitment to a very deep, honest, unbiased scrutiny of all translations without ungodly, scathing condemnation of other people or translations.

It is written in a very firm yet loving way. Well done!"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Back in early 2002 when I was still an unbeliever a friend of mine gave me and my then fianc&eacute;e an NIV Couples Devotional Bible. A few months later in August of 2002 I confessed Jesus as Lord and began using that as my primary Bible. But there was a problem; everyone in church had KJVs and none of them were as girly looking as the Bible I had. So what was I to do? Keep showing up with this decidedly feminine styled Bible that offered a translation that differed from the one the pastor read, or go out and get a nice looking bonded leather KJV? The choice was simple: conform!I began to do all of my devotional reading and major studying in the KJV and I soaked it up. The language was so rich, so inviting, so poetic and majestic; in short, the KJV was the Bible for me! I never thought much about it until I had encountered some people in the America Online Christian chat rooms who told me that the NIV and other modern translations were distortions of God's Word. I was alarmed when I heard how these versions added and removed verses at will, all in the name of 'scholarship.' What was I to think about such liberal and harmful translations of the Bible? My initial reaction was to search the matter out for myself, so I turned to the internet. Lo and behold, I came across a number of KJV Only sites which bolstered these claims and showed exactly where the NIV and NASB and other \`perversions' of God's Word had added and removed verses, or seriously altered them. Again, I was alarmed by such a practice. But there was one nagging question that I had: why is the KJV the exemplar? What made the KJV the standard by which all other English translations should be judged? It was this question that ultimately kept me from KJV Onlyism but I realize that it's not a question that KJV Only advocates generally ask themselves.Thankfully, James White has written a book (now in its second edition) that addresses this issue. This is not a book describing in detail the history of KJV Onlyism. It is a book defending the Christian's liberty to read from whatever English translation they choose without being accused of being deceived. White's goal is not to dissuade people from using the KJV. Nor is it to say that people can't have strong opinions about the KJV and prefer it as a superior translation. White's goal here is simply to show that the KJV is one of many valid English translations of the original Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek Scriptures. No translation is perfect, and no translation is inspired! He recognizes that this is a subject that most scholars won't touch because of the sheer ridiculousness of it, but for someone like me who struggled with this issue, even if only briefly, a book like this from someone of competence is more than helpful. If I had a copy of this back in 2003 then I could have saved myself a lot of trouble.White opens the book in chapter 1 by defining various groups that might be thought of in connection to KJV Onlyism (p. 23-8). The first are those who simply prefer the KJV as their English translation. He's not addressing them. The second are those who think that the Majority Text (MT) is to be preferred to modern critical texts and who give good reasons for that belief. He's not addressing them either. The remaining groups are: 3) those who believe that the Textus Receptus (TR) is inspired or has been supernaturally preserved, 4) those who believe that the English of the KJV is inspired and inerrant, and 5) those who view the KJV as new revelation from God that can actually correct the Greek underlying it! It is these three last groups that White is addressing in this volume.Chapter 2 shows that there really isn't anything new under the sun by pointing out that many of the same types of arguments employed by KJV Only advocates were used centuries ago by those who believed that the Septuagint was the standard and Jerome's Vulgate was problematic because it was unfamiliar. Ironically, Jerome's translation would one day become the standard and when Erasmus came on the scene looking to produce a Greek Bible he was viewed with suspicion. In short, traditionalism is nothing new.Chapter 3 offers a little primer on textual transmission and criticism. Nothing new or innovative here, just reference to the original languages of the Bible being Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, and an introduction to the disputes over translation which White says fall into two categories: 1) textual, i.e., disagreements over what was originally written, and 2) translation, i.e., disagreements over how to translate what was originally written. (p. 44) He then discusses the various methods of translation (formal and dynamic/functional) before moving into manuscripts, textual variants, text types and families, etc. It's also here that he's given his first opportunity to really take advantage of the second edition by interacting with Bart Ehrman's Misquoting Jesus as well as tie in some of his current study of Islam and the Qur'an.Chapter 4 provides a brief history of the production of the KJV, showing that not all KJVs are the same (!) while chapter 5 introduces the reader to some of the main KJV Only advocates and the literature that they put out. Names like Gail Riplinger, D. A. Waite, and Peter Ruckman enjoy the spotlight in this chapter. But in the early parts White is careful to note that legitimate scholars who preceded the KJV Only movement such as Dean Burgeon were not KJV Only advocates no matter how their works might be co-opted by people who are! In this chapter Ruckman definitely appears to be the most out of touch with reality but in my estimation Riplinger gets it the worst as White exposes her shoddy scholarship and the deceitfulness with which she uses her sources (see esp. p. 136-150).In chapter 6 White shows the circularity of the argument that other versions have been changed while the KJV is the standard by which all others are to be judged. He does this by discussing different translation possibilities as well as the changes in the target languages. Chapter 7 is focused on textual criticism and the differences that exist in manuscripts which affect different translations while various examples are given of how this works out in practice. Chapter 8 (my personal favorite) debunks the ridiculous claim that modern versions of the Bible diminish the deity of Christ and have been doctrinally distorted in other areas. In fact, he shows that if anything, according to the criteria that KJV Only advocates are using, it's the KJV that diminished the deity of Christ as compared to the NIV or NASB!Chapter 9 addresses various problems in the KJV's translation of the Greek text. White is careful to note that he \\"do[es] not in any way believe these errors were purposeful on the part of the KJV translators. Unlike many AV Alone defenders, [he] do[es] not believe conspiracies are behind every aspect of the translational issue.\\" (p. 278) Throughout the chapter the KJV is compared mostly to the NASB and sometimes to the NKJV or NIV all with attention given to the Greek or Hebrew underlying the passages. At points White concludes that the KJV obscures the meaning while sometimes it is just plain wrong, e.g., on 'Easter' as a translation of 'to pascha' (p. 290-91). Chapter 10 is one of the best features of the book because it provides concise answers to common questions that will aid the reader in those times when they're discussing KJV Onlyism with KJV Only advocates. Reading the questions and answers was like a flashback to my AOL chat room days, with appeals to Psalm 12:6-7 and charges of \\"so you're saying I need to know Hebrew and Greek to know God's Word?\\"Strangely the chapters stop at 10 before part 2 begins, but part 2 is little more than an extra chapter. This chapter is entitled \\"Textual Data\\" and provides a small glossary of terms and specific case studies of textual variants that are relevant to the KJV Only controversy. White says that in this section he's assuming that the reader is familiar with Koine and can follow the discussion, so I suppose that's why it was relegated to its own \`part' of the book. The King James Only Controversy is rounded out with a fairly substantial bibliography and a number of indices to include an index of Greek terms, a Scripture index, and a subject index. This volume is full of tables, charts, and even some photographs of manuscripts. It's also heavily footnoted which is always appreciated. The bottom line is that there isn't a lot of books on the market addressing this issue in as thorough a manner as White has addressed it. Sure, some authors touch on it, and if I'm not mistaken D. A. Carson wrote a book somewhat similar to this one some years back, but in my opinion this volume will serve anyone well who has to engage with KJV Only advocates. And the fact that it's quite easy to read doesn't hurt matters at all. I was able to complete it in less than 5 days which for me is quite fast!"},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I honestly didn't pick this book up for a long time because up here in Seattle we just don't see that much importance placed on this position. We struggle for people to just take interest in any Bible, so to have a controversy over the KJO position is just not seen all that often up here.The reason I decided to finally pick it up was because I wanted some better background of the translation process that our contemporary Bibles use and also the reasoning for all those annoying brackets around verses like Acts 8:37.What I found was a wealth of knowledge of understanding in the translation process and also it taught me what I thought was already laughable and that is the thought that God has inspired and preserved an English translation of the original Greek and Hebrew.Dr. White, like usual, handles this work in a very easy and readable format. He goes through the background of simply the translation process that happen (ed/s) with every translation, the manuscripts used and also their differences and the reasons why.If you are not immersed into the difficulty, as I am not, it becomes quite repetitive in a lot of aspects as Dr. White goes through and breaks down MANY verses and compares different versions with each other, allowing the reader to better understand not only the differences but the reasons why the differences exist.If you are in this controversy and having to fight against it, you will not find it to be repetitive but really an encyclopedia of knowledge and defense against the KJO position.I really commend Dr. White for this work because he made it very interesting even to us who don't have to communicate with such a strange position. I believe he handles this very fairly and gives extensive footnotes to the reader for fuller explanation and directives if needed. I am sure that those who are in the movement will feel attacked but Dr. White continues to give praise for the KJV when needed but also points out its fallacies to just make the point that it is not the KJV that is infallible but the original words of our great and glorious God.I would definitely recommend this book for any who are looking for a deeper explanation of how the Bible they hold in their hand was put together. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Wow what a great book! I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. Since I am attracted to debunking the errors in the The King James Onlyism movement I discovered this book, purchased it, and gave it a read. So far I have not been disappointed! As the director of a web ministry called Church Education Resource Ministries [...] I take a bit of heat from King James Only radicals, mostly because I advertise my ministry as being Fundamentalist (which it is) and I have a article on the King James Only movement. This article has stirred the feathers of some KJVO radicals who have not been hesitant to send me their nasty emails.I wish I could focus on White's entire book, but because of space I will mention only a few of the great points White makes in this book.In the 1st chapter White identifies and explains five KJV groups. The fifth group is mentioned on page 4 and this is the group that believes in the KJV as New Revelation because this group believes that the KJV is superior to the Greek and Hebrew manuscripts, because God re-inspired the Bible in 1611. This group has absolutely no factual data to back up their bogus views. They are known to be very militant, combative, argumentative and very judgmental. Sadly I believe that the many KJVO individuals that have sent my ministry E-mails were a part of this group. The mistake I have made is that I have tried to reason with these people, which White suggests is a mistake. KJVO radicals from the KJV as New revelation group can't be reasoned with. These people worship the KJV over Jesus (White claims) and are so focused on defending their KJV and proving that the NIV, NKJV, NASB and other modern translations are perverted.White makes another good point on page 25 with the KJV's rendering of Amos 4:4. In the KJV and the NIV it reads \\"your tithes after three years.\\" While the NKJV and NASB says \\"Your tithes every three days.\\" Looking at the original Hebrew it is shown that the NKJV and NASB get it right, while the KJV and NIV get it wrong. Its amazing that KJVO radicals won't hesitate to condemn the NIV, yet this verse translates the same in the NIV as in the KJV! If these KJV people actually read the Hebrew they would have discovered that the KJV is not a perfect and flawless translation of the originals.On page 224 White explains the issues with Mark 6:20 in the KJV.The KJV says that Herod \\"observed\\" John, but the NASB states that Herod \\"kept him safe.\\" In the Greek the term does not mean, \\"observe\\" but rather \\"to protect.\\" The KJV again gets it wrong.There are DOZENS AND DOZENS of other examples from this book that I would love to write about, but cannot for lack of space. But please do purchase a copy of this book, as you will not regret it. The book has helped me a great deal understand the flaws and traditionalism in the King James Onlyism movement. KJV Onlyism is all about tradition, and it's so sad that most KJVO are so blinded by their traditions and or the Devil, that they cannot enjoy the modern versions. As for me I read from the KJV, as well as the NIV, NKJV, NASB, etc. All translations have strengths and weaknesses. None are perfect, as only the originals are perfect. Why a KJVO radical cannot understand this is beyond me.I should mail a copy of this book to some KJVO churches in my area."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"This is a good book to read even if you are not interested in the King James issue. The reason is that it goes over the basics of manuscripts which is a fancinating subject in itself. Also it gives you an appreciation of all the hard work that goes into translation and all the work that goes into textual criticism.I am giving it a 5 just to balance lots of the obvious King James Only people who purposely give it a one star (and by some of its comments, I am not sure they even scan the book, let alone read it). Given it has that many 1 star on purpose by the King James Only people, this must be a very good book since why would that many King James Only people try to bring down the rating of this book."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Dr. White's book is a thoughtful, meticulously documented, educated response to the anti-intellectual crowd that ignorantly promotes the destructive false teaching of King James Onlyism. You will find the truth on the KJV controversy in Dr. Whites Book, carefully explained, and well documented for further study. Finally, someone rational enough to actually provide SOLID EVIDENCE for what they believe instead of hot air and rhetoric. His critics have been silenced and shown to be without merit (see aomin.org).The &quot;King James Only Controversy&quot; is a very well written book that shreds every KJV Onlyist argument I've been told by misinformed believers. This book is NOT merely a critique of Riplinger or Ruckman as the detractors would have you believe. Dr. White has responded to Holland's EMBARRASING &quot;review&quot; which was full of misrepresentation, misquoting, and straw man arguments. An honest examination will allow you to quickly realize who is the most honest and convincing.Dr. White's book has really opened my eyes to the wonderful and amazing way in which God inspired and preserved his Word. I learned a great deal about the King James translators, and Erasmus (the Roman Catholic priest and textual critic), who contributed to the Greek manuscripts used for the KJV translation. I have renewed confidence in the accuracy and faithfulness of the excellent, reputable, modern translations: NIV, NKJV, and NASB which uphold all of the same fundamental doctrines of the King James Bible. White shows the folly of forcing a 17th century translation on modern Americans who haven't the foggiest idea what words like astonied, bolled, chapiter, eyeservice, handstaves, hungerbitten, magnifical, nitre, phylacteries, sodpdoiler, winebibber, and wot just to name a few that do not even appear in my dictionary, even mean. Not to mention all of the perplexing phrases (&quot;superfluity of naughtiness,&quot; &quot;at your hand,&quot; &quot;taken with the manner,&quot; and &quot;in the gate&quot;, &quot;compass about&quot;) and even common words that have changed definitions over the last several hundred years (readers, even pastors sometimes THINK they know the definition, but they actually do not).Dr. White has convinced me that God does not want confusion, he wants a clear presentation of the WHOLE truth, from Jesus Christ who died for our sins to Revelation, and all the way back to Genesis. We should learn and love God's Word, giving it to EVERYONE in the LANGUAGE THAT THEY SPEAK TODAY. This is the bottom line."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I read this book many years ago and I think it's the best on this position. I like the fact that Dr. White takes the time out to show you the different kinds of KJV advocates there are. Dr. White starts out with this in his book. He also expose the wrong reasoning among the KJV only guys and the misconception about translating and the greek text that is used by the modern translations. Great Job.Update: I have been going through this book again and there are alot of good things in this book. For one thing is that Dr. White goes into a lot of history about the Greek text and how it came to us. He talks about the \\"Art and Science \\" of textual criticism. Goes into the TR used by the KJV advocates for their arguments for why the KJV is the best text. Yet the KJV only position doesn't give all the fact, misrepresents the other side and history as well. Not only to mention that the KJV that we have now not only differs from the 1611 version but is differs from one another. You can buy a KJV from one PUB and by one from another or the same people and the text might differ. This book is great for those who want to learn about manuscript history and textual criticism in a layman style dealing with the KJV, this is a great start."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"James White has written a meticulous and far reaching book that successfully exposes King James Onlyism for what it is - destructive legalism that is based almost entirely on hysteria.White's book does an outstanding job of treating a number of complex areas that are pertinent to the subject at hand: ancient manuscripts, scribal influences, textual and translational variants, church history relative to Scripture translations, as well as a thorough and level handed examination of the King James Only position. I was very happy to see White compare the current King James Onlyism to the response Erasmus and company received 400 years ago when they embarked on a fresh translation that eventually made up a fair amount of the TR which King James Onlyism today considers sacred. White's treatment of this area compellingly demonstrated that there's nothing new under the sun, and that the translation 'reformers' of 400 years ago have become the traditionalists of today, thus repeating a trend in Scripture translation that goes back to the dawning of the early church.White's analysis of the hysterics of Riplinger and Ruckman eloquently demonstrate that the loudest voices within King James Onlyism provide a rather easy target for level headed refutation. Both Riplinger and Ruckman have very little in the way of sound scholarship to bolster their view, thus, rampant emotionalism and illogic tends to drive their advocacy. If churches across America weren't being divided with believers being pitted against each other, the rantings of Riplinger and Ruckman wouldn't deserve much attention. But because of the destructive wake these folks are carving out within American Christianity, White's excellent and painfully thorough refutation is needed in order to put these damaging tactics and views in their place.I only have two minor complaints about this book, but both are so minor that they do not downgrade the 5 star rating I've given the book. First, I think the book could have benefited from a visual presentation relative to showing how the TR came into existence and its influence upon the 1611 KJV. White explains this verbally, but a visual chart would have been very helpful to more effectively explain the timeline and various documents/translations that ultimately influenced the development of the TR. Secondly, I think White could have been a bit more thorough in his discussion of manuscript variants to better drive home the point that almost all variants are minor and explainable in order to clearly state at the outset that variants among manuscripts do not reflect on the inerrancy of Scripture. He does touch on this, but considering that a major part of his book involves analyzing manuscript variants and scribal errors in those manuscripts, a more forceful discussion on Scriptural inerrancy would have been very appropriate.But overall, this is an outstanding and balanced refutation of King James Onlyism, as well as being a very good resource relative to understanding why we have so many Bible translations today, while at the same time being confident that some of our current translations are perhaps the most faithful to what the apostles actually wrote in the years following Christ's resurrection. So I would recommend this book not only to those who are looking for a level headed refutation of King James Onlyism, but also to those who have always wondered about the art of Biblical translation and why we have so many Biblical translations available today. A very good resource."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"The increase in number of modern translations of the Bible has generated a backlash among many older and less informed bible readers, who feel that the King James Bible, or AV 1611, is the only english translation needed. Indeed, some feel that the KJV is THE Bible, re-inspired by God in 1611, and that therefore not only are modern translations unnecessary, but un-Godly, works of the Devil made to lead the faithful astray. Dr. White uses historical facts to show how this controversy has arisen with other translations (including the KJV), and modern scriptural analysis to demonstrate the soundness (and the flaws) of recent translations. He then addresses the key accusations of the KJV believers scripture by scripture, showing that their position is not only unfounded, but unreasonable. I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing a better understanding of where the english Bible in their hands, whatever the translation, comes from."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"James White is a scholar/author that I trust. This subject is a very emotional one, as you will be able to tell by reading some of the other reviews. If you've ever been troubled by KJV only advocates, and feel that you can't trust your Bible (NKJV, NASB, ESV, HCSB, NIV, etc.) you REALLY need to read this book. It will set you free."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"I have been following the King James Controversy for sometime. I have not been convinced that a certain version is superior to another. While I do prefer reading one version, like others, I often read several version of a verse or chapter to see it from a different perspective. It is better for the bible to be read and understood then for a translation to sit on a shelf unread because the person finds the language archaic.Mr. White does an excellent job of presenting the position of the KJV only group and refuting their objections to other translations without being derogatory to anyone. He gives suggestions on how to choose what version is best for you. If you enjoy the KJV he does recommend you stay with it. He does, however, explain that he is a conservative and does not recommend every bible version out there. I find him sincere in his quest to present his information truthfully. Information is stated clearly and lay people will be able to understand this book. Part two of the book includes an advanced chapter for those familiar with Koine Greek and want a deeper discussion of this topic.Mr. White uses charts and many scriptural comparisons to state his arguments clearly. He also includes a chapter on problems with King James Version translation as no bible scholar know matter how hard they try, is infallible. The history of the bible translations also makes this a very interesting read. This would also be an excellent book for those doing bible translating."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"Those that hold to the King James Version Only generally fall into several categories, according to Dr. White:1. Those who hold to the KJV out of the beauty of the text. It is for those a translation of choice, just as the NIV is for others.2. (and 3) Hold that the Greek and Hebrew which underlie the KJV is inspired3. Inspired KJV Group. They hold that the KJV is the only inspired translation, and the standard by which we must judge all others by. The illogic of this is that for 1500 years previously, the KJV did not exist. The KJV itself as a revision of a revision of a revision, dating back to the first English translation, that of William Tyndale (who we note was burned at the stake for reading a modern translation, namely his own, over the Latin Vulgate.)4. The final group is the logical outcome of the previously mentioned group - those that old that the KJV is the New Revelation, that somehow in 1611, God re-inspired the Bible in the English Language. Further, they proclaim that the KJV is more inspired than the Hebrew/Greek originals. For them, God waited until 1611 to correct the mistakes that the Apostles made.Dr. White notes that Ruckman, in his book, \`The Christian's Handbook of Manuscript Evidence\\" states that \\"Mistakes (against the Greek) in the A.V. 1611 are advanced revelation.\\" He further calls for any Greek of the Received Text that does not disagree with the KJV to be \`placed in file 13.' People in Dr. Ruckman's camp generally hold to:* The Eternal Existence of the KJV - written in heaven and used by God* This is the Book that we will be judged out of as mentioned in Revelation 20:12The first and foremost problem that we have is that this view is wholly unbiblical, and if taught, becomes more than an error, or a mistake, but a false doctrine. It allows the Word of God to be corrected by humanity. Further, it disallows initial inspiration of the Scriptures requiring us to believe that God Himself uses the KJV, and before all Eternity settled the KJV in Heaven (which might be possible in the extreme forms of Calvinism). It requires us, as well, to suspended Reason and believe that the Prophets spoke Elizabethan English, as well as the Apostles, and that English is alone the language of the heavens.Further, in light of Paul's statement in Galatians - if we can trust that he and truly not the Anglicans which translated the KJV in 1611 - we know that the Apostle was against anything new introduced into the Faith. Jude (1.3) also makes the rather bold claim that the Faith given to the Apostles was the Faith once for all delivered - with no new changes, no new revelation, no new thoughts to be added. To say that suddenly, in the year of our Lord, 1611, that a new revelation in the form of the KJV descended is to stand against what the Apostles taught.Note especially that the KJV in use today is not the KJV in 1611, but I will cover that later.I will continue with my review for a while, but Dr. White has opened the discussion, not with the salvos common from the KJVO camp, but with a calm tenor. He is not criticizing those that use the KJV but questions those that demand that this translation alone is the either standard or a new revelation from God Himself.In chapter 2, (If It Ain't Broke...) the author tackles several of the issues of those who hold tot he KJVO position (as a reminder, these people believe that ONLY the KJV is the Word of God.), one of which is the fact that many in the KJVO field hold to the idea that somehow the KJV is the standard to test all others buy.He cites two examples:* In the 5th century, the Roman Bishop commissioned a new translation of the bible into Latin. Previously, the Septuagint had been the bible of the Church, a hold over from a time when Greek was the lingua franca of the day. Jerome, as scholars are apt to do, went to the source text of the Old Testament, the Hebrew MSS. In encountering this story, we are reminded that for a while, the LXX was held to be the inspired translation of the Old Testament, with permission to discard the Hebrew. (There was, I believe, antisemitism involved). The story goes is that 70(2) scholars in meeting to translate the OT, retired to secluded rooms, but when they re-emerged, they each had translated the passages exactly the same. Originally, this applied to the Torah, but eventually this story came to rest up the entire OT. For the early Church, the Septuagint held the place which the KJV does today - it alone was the corrector to the Word of God. When Jerome brought forth the Latin, Augustine, the bishop of Hippo in Northern Africa, nearly led a revolt. The problems were eventually settled, with Jerome's Latin Vulgate becoming the translation of the West.* 500 years after the Great Schism, a Catholic priest names Erasmus, attempted to correct the corrupt Latin manuscripts which predominated Catholic Christiandom. In doing so, he, like scholars are apt to do, went to the original source of the NT, the Greek. Working from fiver or six manuscripts, he produced several editions of his Greek New Testament. When he lacked something in Greek, he backwards translated the Latin, and used that to supplement his work. In doing so, he provided a manuscript for what became the basis for the Greek text use by the Reformation era translators.Let me add that it was one William Tyndale who was burned at the stake for taking Erasmus' work and translating the Hebrew and Greek into English so that everyone who could read English, a backwater language of the day, could read the Gospel. He was met with resistance because it was only the Latin which should be used, so said Rome. So says the KJVOnlyist today.Moving to the next chapter, the author starts to explain the idea of textual variants and the different MSS traditions - and makes the point in no uncertain terms, that \`99 percent of the four hundred thousand variations are irrelevant to the proper translation and understanding of the Greek text.' He also highlights the futility of abandoning one MSS tradition for other based on the location of that MSS, such as the preference of the Alexandrian Text over that of the Byzantine Text. He notes that it was the great Athanasius of Alexandria who defended the deity of Jesus Christ while it was those of Antioch who supported the terrible doctrines of Arius and his followers.He also attempts to explain the various excuses for the variants - including scribal errors and a reference of sacred names.He does make a solid point, in that in determining the the original text, we find a tenacity of the text - in that variant readings do not disappear; meaning that the original readings are still there as well. He makes the observation that unlike the KJVO group, because of his believe in the Scriptures, he has been able to defend against much more liberal voices and even Islamic voices. It is true, I think, that the KJVO doctrine cripples apologetics - for them, God lost His word for 1500 years, only to have it reappear in 17th English. They cannot provide a defense of Scripture beyond pointing to the KJV. For the KJVO crowd, it is the the KJV which corrects all other MSS, while for others, the word of God is found, defended, and never lost due to wars, persecutions, conspiracies, or simply the fallacy of humanity.Let's continue with chapters 4, 5 and 6. I will not rehash every argument that he has - that is not my place as a reviewer. Let me go ahead and thank Bethany House for the courtesy copy of The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust Modern Translations? (2nd ed.) by James R. White. This is an excellent resource for anyone - especially those still in the myth of the KJVO. It is challenging to say the least to read White and not be offended at his position, if one is a KJVO, but he raises the exact points which helped to open my own eyes to that position.In Chapter 4 (Putting it Together) the author begins to discuss the 'specifics' of the KJVO argument, and does so quite well. He takes us through there early attacks on Erasmus, who first assembled the Greek Text which underlies (for the most part) the King James Version. He focus on the most famous of all verses, 1st John 5.7. In modern versions it is not found - nor is it found among the debates of the Church Fathers regarding the Godhead. While I use to dismiss this argument out of hand - no good Catholics that the Church Fathers were and all - the point is well made while I explored the 4th Century Controversy.From there, he takes us through the history of the Textus Recptus, including the revisions made to it over the years. He aligns the textual criticism of the Textual Fathers with the Textual Critics of today. Remarkably, the goal and intent, and methods are nearly the same.His next stop are the words of the translators themselves - in which they acknowledge their own humanity, and encourage the use of many translations. He counters several of the myths that surround the translations, calling to mind the use of the same traditions applied to the translators of the KJV.He then moves the KJV-1611 itself, and highlights the changes in style, form, and grammer. Further, he points out the direct revisions to the text itself. (Again, if you want to know the finer points, buy the book.) It is worthy pointing out, however, that no one used the KJV-1611 anymore. The majority of KJV users use the Oxford 1769. More of that, in the book.In Chapter 4 (The KJVO Camp) the author examines the arguments of three people* Dr. Edward F. hills, who White remarks that he is the least offensive KJVO'er.* Gail Riplinger, who White seems to devote a large amount of time debating* Dr. Peter Ruckman, who is one of the worse \`misinformationists' today.Both Riplinger and Ruckman fill a large number of footnotes, and indeed the main text, which is perhaps one of the few down sides to White's work. To me, he spends too much time giving them the floor - and although he answers them, it makes it seem more like a personal conflict between White and Riplinger/Ruckman than an informative book.There is no doubt that these two people have personally attacked White (and indeed they have). Their positions are filled with purposed misinformation, geared to those who read only their writings, as if they write with an inspired pen as well. While everything that White answers them with is dead on, it would have been better to answer them without either mentioning them directly or perhaps detailing their arguments.In Chapter 6 (Translational Differences) White deals with the conspiracy theories which spew from the camp of the KJVO, that the modern versions defile, change, pervert, and murder the word of God. Of course, for them, the Word of God is still the KJV. They hold this as a standard - never really thinking why this alone is the standard.Be briefly discusses several passages used by the KJVO camp in showing that the modern versions dilute the word of God - including the use of the word \`peculiar' which White points out is believed by the KJVO camp to mean \`odd' because that's how Peter and Paul meant it, and \`and Moses 4,000 years earlier.'I want to stress that those in the KJV movement take the time to read this book. It helps to highlight many inconsistencies in the KJVO crown, and will help you to come to a better appreciation, I believe, of the bible.In looking over the reviews on Amazon, I noticed a good many of the negatives (1-star) are those made by anonymous reviews. If defending the KJV is such a righteous cause, why do so in such a manner - not just the anonymous postings, but also the strong negatively leveled James White?In chapters 7, White discusses the textual differences between the KJV and the modern translations. While many times, the rules are the same, the outcomes are indeed different. Why? Because the very few who put together the Greek which underlies the KJV NT, had very little to work with while those that help with the UBS and the NA have much older MSS. The author takes the reader through the methods of determining readings, and makes a strong case that modern variants rarely, if ever, change important doctrines. He highlights different arguments from the KJVO crowd and shows them as hypocritical to their own words.Moving to chapter 8, White delivers a power understanding of the preservation of the deity of Christ in the modern translations, sometimes strengthening it when compared to the KJV. Taking us through several important, and key doctrinal passages on the deity of Christ, including Titus 2.13 and 2nd Peter 1.1, White shows that the translation of the KJV hinders the advocacy of the Godhood of Christ. Further, he effectively deals with the counterattacks by the KJVO crowd concerning 'omits' and 'loose translations,' quoting from their works in which they condemn, often times without sound merit, the modern versions.In chapter 9, White moves to the problems with the KJV. He writes about the archaic language found in the KJV and the translation method. While attempting to maintain that he is not anti-KJV, White demonstrates the need for updated language, especially in light of our own updating of English. Further, he shows that many times, due to the method in which the KJV was translated, words and phrases wound up meaning completely different things, depending upon the translator.In the final chapter of the first part of the book, White attempts to answer several questions, which I assume that he, like others who defend the bible, has been asked over the years.Part 2 of the book deals with textual data, and is not for the feint of heart.Conclusion:James White has updated and expanded his first work to deal with new material and the added attacks by the KJVO crown. While at times he drifts into a directed response against certain authors, he does attempt to maintain a conversation about the KJVO doctrine and defends the modern versions. He allows that not all modern versions are recommendable, but that all doctrine should be well founded upon Scripture."},{"Title":"The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?","review":"This book provides a biblical look at the issues involved.

Dent swore that the war wouldn't separate them long. Sure of a quick victory, as many on both sides were an the spring of 1861, Dent vowed to come to Washington to claim Deborah as soon as he'd finished defeating the Union Army. Meanhwhil, though, as this book opens, there is a battle to fight, volunteers to recruit, and social events in Richmond to cheer the new Confederate troops before they go off to their first taste of war.At a recruiting rally at her uncle Stephen's factory, Deborah encourages a young man named Noel to enlist in the Union Army. Noel's big concern is what will happen to his mother and siblings, who can't count on support from his drunkard father. Deborah offers the family personal aid in Noel's absence.At the same time, down in Richmond, Dent atends a ball at which he agrees to dance with wallflower Raimie Reed, a young woman whose criticism of the Confederate cause offends Dent but who nevertheless soon intrigues him. To give part of the reason why she catches his attention would ruin the effect of the scene.In July, the Battle of Bull Run holds suprises for both Dent and Deborah and brings their separate plot threads twisting closer together, as each fights to pull something good out of the battle's consequences. In the background, the plot concerning Dent's father, Clay, continues through this book, as he struggles with competing feelings: a lack of belief in the Confederate cause and the strong desire to reconcile with the sons now serving in the southern army who still resent his long absence while they were growing up. As for clay's married life, it will take several more books to unfold, which is one thing that kept me reading further in the series. I would definitely recommend this book and the next two, WHERE HONOR DWELLS and LAND OF THE SHADOW, which had real character growth and tense plots that kept me up late more than one night."},{"Title":"Gate of His Enemies (The Appomattox Saga, Book 2)","review":"This book was a great book to read all at once.

Even for those who think global warming is \\"junk science,\\" this book provides tips on how to lower gas and electric bills-and how can that be a bad thing?You can Prevent Global Warming provides 51 tips for lowering carbon emissions and conserving energy. Almost every tip presented is completely free and every tip saves money. Many of the suggestions are not new-putting a milk jug full of water into the toilet tank to reduce the flow of water, lowering the thermostat just a bit-however, the authors also include exactly how much money and energy it saves by doing something simple. They also provide tips for people with varying levels of commitment. Already doing the toilet tank thing? They give you links to reviews of low-flow toilets. Is that still not enough for you? They explain composting toilets!There were a few features I particularly enjoyed and appreciated with this book. First, I liked the list at the end of the book that placed each suggestion in an easy-to-follow format of which tips to do first and how often. I also really liked the useful links included. Rather than actually getting bogged down in science and mechanics, they provide web links to [...] and other useful sites. A major barrier in me doing some of the suggestions before (like vacuuming heater and fridge coils) is that I had no idea how to do these things and was (frankly) too lazy to look it up. The authors provide a link with pictures on how to do these things. Some of the links also take you to sites on how to contact Congress if an issue is important to you if the way you want to lower man's impact on nature is to become politically involved.I was walking around my house implementing many of these suggestions as I was reading because of how simple they are. The authors never take a strong-armed tone, never guilt you into trying something they suggest. Every suggestion felt like they were saying \\"Good for you for doing so much! Want to try more? Keep reading!\\"I strongly recommend this book to any home-owner (though it also has awesome suggestions for renters!). I have a number of family members who are always trying to be as green as possible without seriously changing their lifestyles, a few who cringe (or cuss) at the very mention of Al Gore but who are still committed to the Biblical mandate to be stewards of the Earth, and a few who are trying to do more and more-and they are all on the receiving list for this book."},{"Title":"You Can Prevent Global Warming (and Save Money!): 51 Easy Ways","review":"A pretty comprehensive book of tips to help prevent global warming. There are also definitions of terms one hears in the news and in other venues about global warming. Many of the tips were ones I had already heard about or were steps I had already taken so there was not a lot of new information for me. But, it is very nicely organized and easy to read. This is an update from the 2003 version, however, there were a couple of tips that were not updated such as the section on reusing old floppy disks. You most definitely can reuse floppy disks, but I don't know anyone who uses those anymore.

Each tip is only a few pages long, so it is easy to read in small pieces or out-of-order. The information it presents is very practical, listing a wide array of energy-saving tips ranging from the more obvious (changing light bulbs and using programmable thermostats) to a good selection of not-so-obvious (getting off of junk mail lists, making green investments, identifying appliances which burn a lot of electricity even when they are turned off, cleaning your refrigerator coils, using carbon offsets, and many more). Overall, I was very impressed with the breadth of ideas represented here, which encompassed much more than I expected or could have ever thought of on my own.Each tip provides interesting background as well as hard numbers so you can gauge the impact and determine if the tip makes sense for you.Having read this book and implemented a number of the key tips, I have learned a lot and also cut my monthly electric bill roughly in half. I would strongly recommend this for anybody who is interested in saving money or sustainable living.

It not only rates each action as to whether it's no-cost, low-cost, or an investment item, but also provides financial savings info and - most important - the amount of CO2 emissions prevented by taking the action. Considering the huge financial savings possible by implementing these tips, the book is a bargain. But considering what's at stake, the financial savings are irrelevant.

On some of the calculations, they state assumptions. Some are left on faith. This is OK. There were a few subtle details that may have been a bit overstated, however their estimates on how much can be saved are not exaggerations. If anything, they are conservative, especially given the cost of gas, heating and electricity...If only water were more expensive...alas!This book inspired a Weatherstripping party at my apartment complex and has helped me have even more footholds into discussions about conservation and how much difference it can make.Thanks to the Authors.

They eventually merged, but not in 1630. The main group of the Massachusetts Bay Colony didn't even arrive until 1630 when this story supposedly takes place. The logistics are also bad. I find it unbelievable that two men from the Blue Ridge in Carolina (can't find any history of white men on the Blue Ridge in 1630) could have been found and have made their way to Massachusetts overland to help rescue kidnap victims.

The author helps us see in Sr. Ignatia's own spiritual and personal biography how uniquely prepared and how providentially generous she was to be able to facilitate Dr. Bob's and A.A.'s program at St. Thomas Hospital in Akron, Ohio. I was intrigued with the seriousness that Sr. Ignatia, the doctors at St. Thomas and the Sisters of Charity in recognizing and attending to the underlying spiritual dimension of alcoholism. They were not the only ones to do this, as the book relates, but they helped bridge the moral/clinical gap that so many professionals and others, then as today, refuse(d) to accept.I found Sr. Ignatia's life journey very instructive. She was a very diligent teacher of music, professional, and in a sense driven. She had her Waterloo experience in a near nervous breakdown. The doctor asked her if she wanted to be a dead music teacher or a live nun? Thence, began her service as Admissions Director at St. Thomas. She had learned first hand that living life involved ups and downs and that a \\"mysterious-to-us-at-times\\" Providence, Power Greater Than Ourselves, God would lead when we were ready to surrender. Living in that awareness allows one to take risks for the good. The story of Sr. Ignatia, Dr. Bob and early A.A. in Akron and Cleveland is a story of risk and fulfillment."},{"Title":"Sister Ignatia: Angel of Alcoholics Anonymous","review":"In the early days of Alcoholics Anonymous, the recovery rate was about seventy five per cent. Today, the recovery rate is less than one per cent. In the early days of AA, 1935 to 1945, the founders of AA (Bill Wilson, Dr. Bob Smith and Sister Ignatia) operated under the concept that alcoholism was the indication of a spiritual illness. You first took away the alcohol, let the patient go through the withdrawal, and then they trained the alcoholic to be a spiritual person, both by learning to pray, (any religion would do) and then to pass your victory on to other suffering alcoholics. As AA grew, it began to be accepted in government run hospitals. And anything to do with the government has to have nothing to do with religion. So they began to treat alcoholics with psychiatry and downplayed the religious angle, hence the much lower recovery rate. Groups that use religion to treat alcoholics, like Teen Challenge, have an 80% recovery rate. When Sister Ignatia was helping to steer the recovery boat, along with Bill Wilson, Dr. Bob and the assent to Grace, recovery from alcoholism was possible for the first time on this planet. The other influence working against AA's religious methods was the birth, in the late 50's, of political correctness which fears surrender to religion (of ALL kinds) Reading this book about Sr. Ignatia has strenghthened my spirituality in AA.

I had a hard time understanding most of what was being said. I believe that there are better books in the PHIL department.You decide"},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"Plato's Republic is the fount from which nearly all Western thought flows. Pretty much everything written in that tradition either borrows from Plato or refutes him, and the Republic articulates his philosophies more fully than any of his other works(although the Timaeus is more mature and the Symposium is an amazing discussion on a single point). I must disagree with both of the main camps on this site; it is neither just a work of political philosophy NOR just a work of moral psychology(how to order your mind). Plato thought that all things should reflect the ultimate good, so that the ideal society would be ordered in the exact same way that the ideal human being would be. Thus, every part of one's psyche would correspond to a part of society(it's a microcosm!), and the &quot;higher&quot; parts of one's mind would be mirrored in the Guardians, the &quot;higher&quot; parts of society.With that said, it is easy to see that the Republic proposes many things that disgust most modern human beings: censorship for political stability, ostracism of those with &quot;weak&quot; (read: human, sensitive, or some equivalent) emotions, killing young children, government regulation of sexual activity, and such. Even when Plato tries to give women equal rights, an _extremely_ radical idea in Ancient Greece, his ancient prejudices show up when he calls them &quot;equal but weaker in all ways(morally, intellectually, and physically)&quot;.Despite all of its shortcomings, the Republic was the work that singlehandedly separated the real from the ideal in Western civilization, and it also defined the kinds of questions that Western philosophers would try to answer until the 20th century. Pick up a book of Western philosophy at random, and I guarantee you that some issue introduced in the Republic will hit you within the first five pages. Even the Communist Manifesto rips off his discourse on women and his notion of work defining human beings. The Republic was the first work of real philosophy in the conversation of ideals that continues to this very day in fields as diverse as politics, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, and religion. (PS: If you think Plato's an idealistic fool, read Aristotle. So did he.)"},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"It has been said that all philosophic work of the past 2400 years stands as footnotes to Plato's writings. 'Do the ends justify the means? What is justice? Whom does it serve? Who should serve as its guardians? Is it absolute or relative?'Plato's protagonist is his old teacher, Socrates. The arguments are presented as dialogues and thus embody a literary aspect different from many, although certainly not all, subsequent philosophical writings. His object is \\"no trivial question, but the manner in which a man ought to live.\\" The answers are seen to point to the manner in which a utopian society should be operated.As a storied mountain calls to a climber from afar, Plato calls to the student of the art of thinking. This is why we read Plato, for the \\"neo-Platonists\\" -- Plotinus, Augustine, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Whitehead, G&ouml;del, and others -- have certainly propounded improved philosophy. But it is Plato on whom they improve. Most thinkers (perhaps especially most mathematicians and logicians) yet agree with Plato, at least insofar as his understanding of \\"form\\" -- often adapted or restated as: ideas / perfection / consciousness / mind / or, 'the thing in itself'.Plato's realm of [what he calls] \\"forms\\" acknowledges the mysterious, yet logically necessary, existence of non-material reality. In Republic he views this as the realm of reference in constructing his understanding of an ideal society. We find in the work of subsequent thinkers (and within Plato's Republic as well) that this non-material reality is perhaps more easily recognized in purer considerations of reason, aesthetics, mathematics, music, love, spiritual experience, and ultimately in consciousness itself, than in idealized human social institutions. Mathematics, for example, although readily practiced in material ways, is not itself material. Thus the understanding of the purity of reason as opposed to the synthetic (and uncertain) nature of empiricism, arises from the work of Plato (and is particularly well developed in Descartes' existentialism).Modern readers should rightly find that Plato regards the State too highly; in pursuit of an ideal State his supposedly improved citizen is highly restricted and censored. His \\"utopian\\" citizens are automatons, bred by the State; unsanctioned infants are \\"disposed of.\\" Where his ideas are wrongly developed, they are in fact important ideas, i.e., they are issues deserving serious examination. Should the ruling class be restricted to philosophers? Plato says yes, that wisdom and intellectual insight are more desirable in leaders than are either birthright or popularity. Of course we, in the democratic West, tend to see this idea as totalitarianism, but it remains an interesting argument.Although the product of polytheistic culture, Plato is leery of the tangled accounts of the gods received from the poets, Homer, Hesiod, etc. His view of the divine -- that \\"the chief good\\" has one eternal, unchanging and surpassingly superior form -- which he also calls \\"Providence\\", hints strongly of the common ground which was to emerge between neo-Platonism and monotheism. Like Plato's proverbial cave dwellers, we perceive this transcendent entity through poorly understood \\"shadows\\" of the actual truth. Beside its philosophical, literary, political, and theological aspects, Republic is also important as a treatise on psychology, in fact the science of mind seems to have progressed very little beyond Plato's insights. Books 5-7 are particularly fascinating."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"Sir Desmond Lee's second edition of this, the translation of Plato's Republic, misses the mark it seeks to strike. By using too much contemporary (for the 1970's) English, we lose the feel for what Plato was actually trying to say. This translation would have read much better had it followed the original text more faithfully. This, though, is one of the pitfalls of writing for Penguin: if it's a translated work, it better sound modern--no matter that it was written two millenia ago.But The Republic itself? Stunningly simple. Beautifully wrought. Criticized as a bone thrown to totalitarianism, this work still remains the core of all modern political, social and philosophical thought. Most powerful is the opening Book, where Socrates definitively refutes the common herd's definition of justice. The masterful reasoning he employs to demolish Thrasymachus's argument that justice is that which is in the interest of the stronger party will enlighten as well as refresh: might does not make right, then or now. The later Books pack comparatively less punch, but nonetheless will give any thoughtful person plenty to sink his teeth into. The philosophical section on the Line, the Sun and the Cave cannot be understood without supplemental reading, as they form an integral part of Plato's theory of Forms, an idea he never fleshed out concretely in any one tract. Modern philosophy departments have consigned this book to the trash heap, to which the objective reader can only say this: If The Republic is trash, then our own generation's literary legacy looks bleak indeed."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"\\"If an ass peers into a book, do not expect a saint to peer out.\\" (Augustine) If Lee had biased his choice of words, or his explanatory notes toward any one interpretation of this complex work, then he would have been as foolish as most of the reviewers posting polemics here.The strength of this rendering is that Lee is sufficiently accurate and balanced in his approach to allow for reasonable debate even among first-time readers. He -- for the most part --makes Plato approachable, and opens the door to the many issues raised by this book.Lee does a good job of presenting oft-misconstrued arguments, noting important shades of difference between the English words he has chosen and the original Greek, pointing out ambiguities of meaning, and important issues that may not be apparent to a modern reader. Lee also handles the poetic passages with sufficient grace that many of my own students have found them inspiring.Whether or not you like Plato, Lee has done his job, and for the most part lets the work speak for itself."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"There probably isn't much I can add in a scholarly vein to what people have already said about Plato. So I thought I would make a few personal observations from the standpoint of a somewhat philosophically literate, 21st century man who is reading such an august classic in middle age.I came to this book with more of a background in modern epistemology and the philosophy of science than in classical philosophy. So political philosophy isn't exactly my strong suit, but nevertheless I found the book interesting reading in a way I hadn't really thought of before.Actually, I had read portions of this book 20 years ago when I was a young student first studying philosophy, and I have to say, there is something to be said for having a more mature outlook in approaching such a venerable work. At the time I thought political philosophy pretty dull stuff, and besides, I felt there was no real way to answer any of the important political questions that get debated here, despite the easy way Socrates disposes of everybody else's half-baked opinions and theories.The fact is, if you move ahead 2400 years and read something like Karl Popper's \\"The Open Society and Its Enemies,\\" an advanced modern work, you can see how much, or how little, political philosophy has progressed in the last 24 centuries.Well, that may be true, but at least with this book you know where it basically all started. The best way to decide this issue is to read the book and decide for yourself.Although entitled \\"The Republic,\\" this society isn't like any republic you've probably ever read about. Plato proposes an ant-like communism where there is no private ownership of property, philosophers are kings, kings are philosophers, people cultivate physical, moral, and ethical qualities, and the idea of the good takes the place of political and social virtues.Another odd facet is that the bravest citizens are permitted more wives than those less brave in battle. And then there is the infamous proposition that all poets and artists are to be banished since they are harmful purveyors of false illusions.I find the Socratic method as a way of moving along the dialogue between the participants sort of interesting, and it is certainly an effective device. However, none of these people, even the Sophist Thrasymachus, are really Socrates' intellectual equal, so he really doesn't have much competition here.If ancient Athens disproportionately had so many towering intellects, relative to its small population (about 20,000 people, most of whom were slaves anyway), you'd think they would show up in Plato's dialogues more. But all we seem to get are second-raters who are really no match for the clever Socrates.Yet I would say this is still a great book. Classical scholars say there are more perfect, less flawed dialogues than Plato's Republic, but none that are as profound, wide-ranging, and as influential and important for later philosophy.

Written in dialogue form (i.e. like a discussion between many characters), the main exponent of the argument is Socrates, Plato's friend and mentor who was executed by the Athenian government - an event which led Plato to effectively denounce democracy as an impractical system. The Republic is the result of this denouncement: beginning with the philosophical question 'What is justice?', it proceeds to lay out the nature of the ideal state. Along the way, we are given Plato's legandary Theory of Forms, including the fantastically simple Simile of the Cave - a brilliant philosophical exposition of the difference between this world and the 'proper', 'real' world of which Earth is only a shadow. Desmond Lee's translation makes the very best of a particularly tricky task, and compromises on several key passages with effective authority. The main problem for the modern layman is in getting used to the Socratic form of argument in textual form - seeing Glaucon and Adeimantus answering with &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;I agree&quot; and &quot;That's quite right&quot; for 350-odd pages will drive anybody a little crazy after a while!

This is an appealing idea if one believes in a perfectly functioning political system characterized by eternal balance. However, the actual attainment of this goal is only plausible if one grants Plato both his moral conception of human nature and his conception of the existence of \\"pure forms\\" of earthly things in heaven. In other words, Platonic justice rests on platonic psychology and platonic theology. Take away these arguments, and his case for justice is pure rhetoric, based on inaccurate descriptions of political reality and a dangerous defense of elitism by emphasizing men's \\"roles\\" and \\"crafts\\" over their free will and liberty. But even this elitist rhetoric must be taken seriously, for it has attracted numerous adherents and affected society in dramatically positive ways over the last 2000 years. Negative liberties and mutual Hobbesian suspicion alone cannot build a society. Furthermore, elitist criticisms can be made of any society, including any of our nominally democratic modern regimes.

One reviewer made the comment: &quot;I want answers! I can get more answers from a Teen Magazine&quot; What an ignorant statement, I think. Because Socrates says that the best knowledge comes from knowing that we know nothing. The problem with the Bible, is that people think it is all the answers. It isn't to be expected to be the answer for everything, just as this book isn't suppose to be the answer for everything. These are merely theories.What I like about the book is how Socrates thinks we should be good for the sake of it, rather than for what it gets us. For example, why do we tell our children to be just? Does being just mean being cruel and cunning underneath, while they are financially successful and appear to be honest? Socrates claims that the truly just person will be good even though he doesn't always get what he wants in life. Basically that justice is it's own reward.One thing I agree is that artists, as Socrates says, is that they tend to create illusions. But, I don't agree that they need to be censored; that's just hogwash. Nor do I think that a village should raise a child, or that a man should stick to one career his whole life.

It is interesting to compare Xenaphon on Socrates, as the only other surviving work by Socrates' students. Xenaphon is far less sophisticated, and as an exile from Athens, has a different point of view.Throughout, the speaker in The Republic builds on assumptions from an ancient world view, with which I disagree in many instances. E.g. marriage is based on an established, middle-aged man taking on a malliable bride and training her in household management. E.g. no one person can do two things well (except, of course, the philosopher-king). E.g. the city's leadership can make the best breeding choices for the people.

A more accurate translation of the ancient Greek would have been \\"The State\\".Readers who would like to know more should go to my profile and read my guide to totalitarianism in the ancient world."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"In this work of Plato, the author greatly strives to define justice. He tries to put forth what would be a perfect society. The problem with Plato is that he left Jehovah, the true God, out of his philosophy. Jehovah is the center of everything, and without Him, there is no truth. Since Plato rejected belief in the true God, and whole, intact truth is only found in that true God, Plato's philosophy is understandably flawed. Of course, as THE REPUBLIC is a popularly recongnized classic, one may find it useful to read it, in order to understand the viewpoint of the masses who accept it, provided one compares it with the truth of God's word, the Bible."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is a fascinating piece of literature because it gives us an intimate look at Socrates who was Plato's mentor. The book is broken up into 10 different sections or books. In this work we get a clear picture of Socrates' idea of an ideal state, and it is remarkable how timely a lot of Socrates' thoughts are to modern day problems, considering that this work was written by Plato in the mid-400's. B.C. A lot of the ideas that are expounded in this massive work are Plato's own. The work is set out in a series of dialogues with two men where Socrates is supposed to be visiting. It begins with a philosophic argument as to what is justice and what is injustice, and from there a whole state is set out. The state includes three main groups of people - The Guardians who rule and advise the rest; the soldiers who defend the state and the workers such as husbandmen or farmers, cobblers, etc. who provide all the useful materials used by the citizens of the state. I found this work pretty tough going as it is long and detailed, but I managed to slog through it all, and actually found the work quite insightful, and certainly interesting."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"After reading this book I realized why it remains so popular more than two thousand years after it was written. It has some memorable phrases, those worth knowing by heart and if possible living a life in accordance to the direction they point. I rejoiced at how the dialogue is conducted and how Plato arrives at his conclusion, going step by step. The way it is written make it easy to follow, in fact we feel as if we were in the same room as the author. It is also amazing how actual the content is (seems like it was written yesterday) in both subjects and questionings.The book is also not too abstract to a point that one can't grasp the concepts, but is philosophically palpable. The topics range from day-to-day actions to the immortality of the soul; from justice to happiness; from Timarchy to Democracy... Although not all conclusions should be taken too seriously or meticulously, his ideas are worth reading and most important - thought about. Plato and his ideal state (the form) will probably never become a reality, but from this ideal we can judge how far we are, and perhaps realize that \\"shadows\\" are all we see.The Republic is an excellent book and should be read as such, and not as a manuscript of the TRUTH. It is though a guide, and a direction pointer towards the ultimate...realm!? Or as Plato perhaps would put it: towards the exit of the cave."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is a very interesting book. I enjoyed reading the discourse between these great philosophers. The political philosophy in this book is very interesting, especially when dealing with the issue of justice. The concept of traversing from darkness into the light is revealing. Socrates (469-399 BC) is the Athens teacher of wisdom, virtue, justice and goodness. He believes that truth hidden in the soul must be brought to consciousness. His philosophy is that the search for the real truth, goodness, virtue, knowledge and justice are of value to the mind and soul. In the book Aristotle (384-322 BC), a student of Plato (428 - 347 BC) who tutored Alexander the Great, equates metaphysics with law and nature; truth and knowledge with the senses and epistemology; value with discipline and order; and what's right with axiology. Finally, Plato believes that the journey of the souls is towards the light which is an ideal path of learning, and he outlines that individuals should strive for perfection. The book is very interesting to read, and is very enlightening. This book was of value in the writing of poetic verses."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is my first Plato piece, and I am exceptionally happy I chose Penguin Classics. The introduction it provides is quite helpful in laying a base line for someone such as myself, who having never read Plato before was able to benefit by the insights. With no knowledge on Plato, my only interest are to expound upon how great Penguin Editions does with their books."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"If you can only have five books on your library shelf, this book has to be one of them. Plato argues against democracy and total freedom and does such an amazing job. You may not agree with him, but after reading the book you will have so much respect for someone that is seeking the absolute truth no matter what it turns out to be."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"Although this book is heavy reading and tends to be overlooked by the average reader it is a good book for any person to read. This was the first book that I had ever read on the topic of philosophy but I didn't find the topic too hard to digest.Like all philosophy the point of this book is not to absorb fact after fact but break down the meaning of the topic and analyze it. Most people will find that some of the parts in the book are a bit obscure but the point is that it gets you thinking! If you learn nothing from Plato and Socrates then at the very least they will have challenged you form your own theories and opinions.Therein lies the beauty of Plato and all good philosophical works.I also recommend Symposium by Plato which is lighter and more accessable."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"I read this book in conjunction with Utopia for my Senior Thesis and was expecting it to be very difficult. Thank god it wasn't. Through dialogue, Socrates proves many interesting philosophical ideas that are easy enough to understand by most high school students yet complex enough to have entire college courses dedicated to their study. It seems to me that there are few books written that have had such profound impact on their field. Plato's Repulic is the defining book on the philosophical field, and is the beginnings for all Utopian literature. Any student or avid reader who is interested in understanding where modern thought started should read The Republic before anything else."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"To disagree with &quot;seth,&quot; this is one of the best translations of Plato's greatest work I have ever read. The Penguin Classics translations make the works accessible to the modern reader because at the time they were written they were accessible to the average educated person. Plato did not write his &quot;Republic&quot; in an obscure, confusing style, and it should certainly not be read in a translation of that type. Of course, to be ultimately truthful, one should always read the original. As most cannot do that, I suggest taking an easy-to-read prose translation of all the great works, which the Penguin Classics series provides."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"Plato's Republic may be the most influential book ever; its importance is simply impossible to exaggerate. Its impact on philosophy, ethics, science, politics, and almost everything else is incalculable. It is in a very real sense the foundation on which Western society rests; countless later writings or actions would have been extremely unlikely or impossible without it. The work is famously touted as Plato's ideal state vision, and every subsequent look at this all-important question has had to deal with it. Its scope is so wide that people of every persuasion have taken something from it, and negative reactions have in many ways been at least as important as positive. Plato's thoughts here are so far-reaching that they have vital practical importance even now, and his sweeping historical and philosophical overview is the ideal place to start exploring the subject. However, saying The Republic is about this only sells it rather short; some have indeed suggested that this is only a metaphor for the soul's purification. The book in fact explores nearly every subject of importance: the nature of justice, the difference between good and evil and how to aim for the former, the question of the soul's immortality, etc. Plato unfortunately has a reputation as hopelessly idealistic and/or impenetrable, but this is highly unfortunate because The Republic specifically goes to pains to make all this practically applicable. For further proof, we need only look at its comments on many issues - not least class and gender - that seem to have become preeminent only very recently. Like all geniuses, Plato both epitomized and was far ahead of his era; it is impossible to think of Greece without him, yet in some ways - e.g., female equality - we still have not caught up.It goes without saying that anyone interested in any of these issues must know The Republic. We can without hyperbole go further by saying anyone who cares about intellectual issues, especially applied ones, must also, as should anyone who wants to be even basically well-read. However, this is far easier said than done for most; Plato is so different from what now passes for literature, to say nothing of pop culture, that he is virtually inaccessible to general readers. Yet the importance of persevering cannot be overemphasized; the payoff is well worth the effort. As nearly always in such cases, reading him becomes far easier after the initial difficulty; no attentive reader will ever think Plato easy reading, but he is utterly absorbing once we get used to his style. He has a near-poetic beauty that all agree has never even been remotely approached in philosophy, and such mesmerizing prose is rare in any genre. His dialogues are an incredible form at once intellectually and aesthetically pleasing - an inspired combination that has perhaps never been bettered; many have appropriated it, but none have matched it. All this means that picking the right translation is probably more important with Plato than any other writer. For the average reader, the more recent, the better is generally true, though older versions like W. H. D. Rouse's and Benjamin Jowett's are still very accessible. The important thing is to read The Republic in some form, and those who happen on a translation that does not work for them should keep trying until their mind opens in a truly new way - and once done, it will never close again."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"Written over 2300 years ago, this cornerstone of political philosophy retains an astonishing degree of relevancy and applicability to the modern world. The prose takes the form of a friendly debate (with occasional humorous excursions into antagonism when Thrasymachus takes offense a few times) between four or five men, ostensibly on elucidating the nature of justice. Well, besides discussing justice, Plato launches into a description of his ideal state along with a somewhat comprehensive analysis of the various forms of government known to the ancient Greeks: the Spartan timarchy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny. I found these sections of the work to be lucid and educational.In addition, Plato lays the groundwork for his philosophy of the \\"forms\\", which are fleshed out in some of his later works. This bit gets heavy and at times incomprehensible; I skimmed some of it.There are certain assumptions that Socrates (the primary mouthpiece in The Republic) makes that I suppose were taken for granted to the ancient Greeks, such as how weather was assumed to be at the whim of the gods or the importance of animal sacrifice. These assumptions are used to further some logical arguments and arrive at a conclusion, which of course wouldn't pass muster today.Overall, a very readable and well-written treatise that serves the secondary purpose of proving to the layman how advanced the ancient Greek world was in its thinking."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"Though by the look of it Plato's masterwork appears daunting I devoured it from the start. Though his idea's about government may seem to many beyong the pale Plato knew very well that his ideal government was just that, an ideal. Even if you don't agree with him he will start you on a train of thought to a higher plain."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"For God's sake, Amazon, don't you ever look at Kindle products before putting them for sale?

Perfect example of good people with great intentions, but how such a world will never exist in our imperfect world. Clearly the ideas of this book has been used within the 20 century."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Republic, by Plato, is a very thoughtful and explorative writing about the perfect state, the role of justice in it, and how it could be materialized. Plato explores how a state should function, in terms of justice, and he discusses what justice is, how it governs human actions, and why it is so important.The society, according to him, has 3 classes, workers, warriors, and rulers, who must all coexist and work together. They are governed by appetite, spirit(honor), and thought, respectively. Someone who is governed by one thing, say appetite, but holds a position that should be governed by another idea(say ruler), becomes a bad thing for society, in this case a tyrant. Who should hold each postitions, how they should be trained, and what types of things should be allowed in the society, and in their lives are all discussed by Plato, but he does come to the conclusion, that although money can satisfy the appetite, it cannot satisfy the mind, and thought and understanding brings true happiness, and justice brings true good. Education should ensure that good rules the minds of society, for great knowlege combined with evil intentions causes trouble. The world inself has a visible and mental form, and Thinkers and Philosophers are those who access most the mental world. Justice however, is inherently good, and brings the most true good to a society.Plato's analysis of the state is quite a profound and interesting one, and this book is a simple translation to read and understand and is recommendable to anyone. It is truly a must read, especially in greek literature, as Plato is one of the great thinkers of all time."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"I got this book as a gift when I was thirteen or so. Desmond Lee's translation, while not the most scholarly, is very accessible.

I love some of Plato's other works - Philebus, Apology, etc. This just didn't do much for me. There are definitely some great points in the book, and it is written pretty well, but at the beginning of book 9 it started to get a little boring, and more than anything I just really couldn't take Plato's philosophical babble anymore. He is in another world in this book (La-La Land). I agree with Aristotle that it is a joke in that it was meant by Plato to be taken seriously (at least politically). I liked it for its writing style as well as individual philosophy. My advice is to read it simply for enjoyment and to pick out the useful philosophical points."},{"Title":"The Republic (Penguin Classics)","review":"The dialogue in the book provides an excellent forum for introspection into one's own political and moralistic values.

By trying to describe the ideal state, Plato creates the first &quot;Utopia&quot; and in the meantime questions our perceptions of reality, the idea of justice and reality.

It is unique in a sense that it was written by a non-Romanian (?) but still author's view is perfectly matching with the nationalistic view of the Romanian historians. The book plays a close attention how the Hungarian repressed the Romanians in the middle age, although nationalism did not existed until the french revolution (XIX century). Beside that between the fifteenth and the early nineteenth centuries Transylvania was ruled by either the Ottoman or by the Hasburgs indirectly.The book almost disregards the Saxons (German ethnic group) who played also an important role in history of Transylvania, but after the second world war they were fully expelled from the country.

Finger won the John Newbery Award in 1925. I didn't know anything about the book when I picked it up other than it's Newbery, but I must say, I was quite pleasantly surprised by what I found.I have always loved Fairy Tales. Like, a lot. If you remember, a few weeks ago I talked about my first experience reading Grimm's Fairy Tales, which helped cement my love for reading them as well. (If you are really interested, click here, and you can go back and read it.) So, imagine my delight when I realized this was a collection of 19 fairy tales recorded by Finger from South America. Although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about other countries and their rich cultural histories as I'd like to be, I'm always open to learning more. And I think you can learn a lot about a society from their fairy tales and children's stories.This was a real treat for me to read, and one I'm definitely looking forward to adding to my shelves and rereading, not only for myself but also to read to kids. I used to read some of the Grimm's fairy tales to my little brothers as a bedtime story, and I'd love to be able to add these tales to stories I can read/tell to young kids.Although some of these stories might be classified as more mythology than fairy tale, I felt the same way reading these as I did reading the classic fairy tales. There's that sense of magic and possibility, where you know anything can happen, and although things might get a little rough along the way, and there probably won't be super happy ending, the good guys do win in the end.I also noticed that the emphasis of each tale was placed on the struggles of each character rather than the resolution. The ending is always over so quickly. Normally, this is something that is a major no-no in writing, I mean, seriously. Who wants to read a 400 pg. build up to a 4 paragraph resolution?! But it seems to work in fairy tales. The stories aren't about what happens, it's about learning how to get there. We see their struggles, know their challenges and then we get to know they end up relatively alright in the end.This is definitely a book I would recommend. The writing is a little older, but to anyone who is a fan of fairy tales in their original setting (or people who want to write a fairy tale retelling but are wanting new material) this is a great book to read and one that I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"i enjoy folk/fairytales in general, and this collection is esp. interesting as a comparison to the more well-known european ones (the magic dog is eerily similar to the famous french fairy tale donkeyskin). there are some great images and situations, and although more than a few sort of meander and fizzle out there were enough uniques ones to keep you reading to the end. not the best, but not the worst either."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America.

This book not only met my expectations as determined by the &quot;book description&quot; on the amazon listing of this book, but far exceeded them.The book description states that it &quot;is the first book of its kind detailing the specific step-by-step approach author Robert Dirgo took to reverse his hashimoto's thyroiditis hypothyroidism.&quot; Not only is it the first book; it is the only one that I'm aware of. Within the book, the author clearly identifies what he did, personally, between being diagnosed and his recovery. The author is obviously sharing his &quot;personal&quot; story as the title not so subtly suggests and as the description clearly states in the following line; &quot;the author shares his impelling personal story from diagnosis to reversal&quot;.The author maintains a consistent theme throughout his book. That theme is to take responsibility for your own health. He advocates working with a medical doctor who respects you and is willing to work with you to improve your health.His example is a beautiful example of this doctor-patient relationship. In fact his approach is not something out in left field that he dreamed up, but rather it was the treatment plan prescribed to him by his medical doctor.The author clearly has the ability to perform a rigid statistical analysis as is evident from his background and from the strength of his reasoning in the text. However, this book is not a rigid clinical study nor was it presented as such. No where in the book does the author offer statistical arguments for his results. In fact on page 36 he states that any cause-effect relationship would have to be determined in a controlled scientific experiment.This book is not the documentation of a controlled experiment, but rather, as advertised, it is the author's personal story. A successful personal story in which severely high anti-bodies have vanished.At the very least, this book should arouse an interest in researcher and patient as to what caused the author's success.He suggests that the various things he did applied in a disciplined manner contributed to his success. To emphasize this, he provides in the book a personal health diary for monitoring and maintaining progress.Perhaps the most unexpected thing I found in his book was his phone number. This author is easily accessible and as I found out, is willing to go the extra mile, by giving freely of his time and resources to answer any questions about his personal story.Sometimes we can be lulled into a sense of complacency and acceptance of the status quo because that's the way it has always been. Change can be frightening and unwelcome, because it doesn't fit our &quot;view&quot; of how things should be.I applaud you Mr. Dirgo for not falling into this trap and for having the courage to do what you did. Thank you Mr. Dirgo for your thought provoking contribution."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"I would give this book 0 stars if that were an option. While there are some interesting resources identified in the book, they could have been made available on a one or two page pamphlet or on a web site at no cost. The remainder of the book is annecdotal, inconsistant and a good deal of blank pages, to be used by the reader in writing down what he/she has done to change their habits. The author gives his perspective, in some cases in detail and in others by a mere mention of a concept, of a variety of steps he took or thought about taking while in denial of the seriousness of his disease. He mentions other factors, such as bad fish for a meal on an airplane and parasites, that he thinks might have contributed to the disease, and provides surprisingly inconsistant statistical arguements, in view of the authors redundantly self-described academic training, to suggest that his efforts to change diet and exercise regimens contributed to changes in the autoimmune antibody titers that were observed over time in his bloodwork. A major component of his dietary changes, which seem to have focused on some commercial dietary supplements, remains unexplained and the reader is directed to buy a different book to learn those details. Within the realm of pseudoscience that plagues self-help literature for human disease, this ranks near the bottom and no one should waste their time or money on it...."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"Before I begin this review, I want to say for the record that I am a big believer in the benefits of alternative medicine. I have benefitted from many alternative therapies such as massage therapy and acupuncture. Hence, I am extremely open to the possiblities that treatments exist outside the realm of traditional medical care. That being said, this book really stinks. In some case, Dirgo's inflamatory and unfounded theories go past just being stupid to being wrong. As a specific example, he rails against the drug Synthroid by noting that it \\"increases the rate of bone loss.\\" Well guess what...our natural thyroid does the same thing. It is the excess of (rather than the presence of) the synthroid hormone that could result in bone loss. So it's not the substance that's problematic, it's simply the dosage. Hypothyroid sufferers don't overdose on the hormone, but rather take it until their lab readings are within normal limits. Inflammatory and unscientific statements such as these permeate the book. His comments on diet and exercise are good...everyone knows that exceptional health practices can lead to exceptional health. But I don't need to pay ...[money] for this book to tell me that."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"This book has less than a handful of pages of information followed by pages and pages of his personal lab results and blank diaries.

With lots of fear, I started on a synthroid regimen and have remained on it; however, since diagnosis, I have gained 30 pounds and I am constantly tired.One night, out of desperation, I searched Hashimoto's Disease over the internet and found Bob Dirgo's book. The title alone gave me hope! Thanks to Mary Dirgo's editing talents, this book is so easy to read. I studied how Hashimoto's effects my body and started applying Bob's methods to my own life. I feel amazing.I love the personal health journal in the book and use it to track my progress. This is what helped me to get off of the sugar I was consuming. I am even enjoying \\"Protein Power\\" as recommended by Bob in the book. This is the first diet I have been able to stay on. I am so grateful for the author for sharing his story.If you are suffering from Hashimoto's, this book is a must. It will enlighten you, give you peace and hope, and in the end, it will help your body to heal. Buying this book was the best investment I have made toward my health. I am getting off of synthroid and I am healing! and they said it couldn't be done.While God is the ultimate healer, this book is a great tool to help you on your journey. Way to go Bob and thanks!!!!"},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"This book by Robert T. Dirgo is an outstanding example of how the author resolved a serious medical problem through determined research and alternative medicine.Dirgo was diagnosed with hashimoto's thyroiditis hypothyroidism, and advised to begin taking the prescription drug synthroid, which has been reported to be problematic and unsafe. According to the FDA, as reported in a June 1, 2001 article in the Wall Street Journal, synthroid has a &quot;history of problems&quot; and &quot;cannot be recognized as safe and effective&quot;.Dirgo opted to pursue a course of action incorporating extensive research to address and uncover the root cause of the problem, and then define the methods required to reverse the problem without drugs.Through extensive research and under the direction of a homeopathic Medical Doctor, Dirgo discovered an alternative medicine approach that reversed his hashi's.I consider Dirgo's recent publication a most informative book. This is must reading for anyone diagnosed with hashi's, for those seeking information on the subject, and for those seeking information relative to diet, exercise, and diet supplements.This is a &quot;break through&quot; book, and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"I read about a gluten free diet and hashimotos' and i tried it for 2 months.

But, if we can find healthy natural alternatives, without the harmful chemical side effects, then I applaud anyone who is dedicated to taking an holistic approach to their health. Taking complete care of our bodies is, for me, like running. One has to be committed and disciplined in order to win. Thank you, Mr. Dirgo, for reminding us that there is hope for sufferers of autoimmune disease. Instead of being cynical, like so many people I have encountered in my own struggle for a healthy functioning body, you have taken the initiative to solve your own physiological challenge.

To start, there is not much too it. The main chapters of the book comprise a total of 42 pages. Pages 43-102 are a personal health diary which the reader is supposed to fill in. The remaining pages, all 18 of them, are a conclusion, resources and a chapter about the author.There is very little information in the book that can't be found on most web sights about hypothyroidism.

Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"When I first discovered my husband had Hashimotos, this was the first book I bought. To help cure or ameliorate the symptoms of any disease in my opinion you need to work with your traditional doctor, in this case, his endocrinologist observed the inflamed thyroid and after doing the normal tests that of course came back normal, she decided to do the Hashimoto's test. He had an inflamed thyroid and has 80% of the symptoms like fatigue, joint pain, hair loss, always cold, dry skin, muscle cramps, slow thinking etc for years. Reading this book helped me to figure out a number of things. I eliminated all soy from his diet. There is soy in everything including vitamins...you wouldn't believe it. I had had him tested for about 150 food allergies (ALCAT test), he had a severe allegy to whey (but not to casein), so I eliminated all milk products. Using a veggie non-soy protein drink for breakfast (Lifetime lifebasic w greens) and add fruit and a raw egg, cut out all the foods that are anti-thyroid (amazingly broccoli, spinach, etc can find this info online), and started feeding him more foods that are pro-thyroid (shrimp, crab, etc). Cut out flouride toothpaste (Tom's makes a toothpaste w/o flouride). Important, started giving him Selenium, which I buy from the store at hopeforhashimotos.com Dr. Haskell has a blood test on this site too, that I'm going to have done. He has several informative videos that you can watch. I believe he think's Hashimotos is a condition and not a disease, which I agree with. I give him other supplements that you can also find recommended for Hashimotos online (do not supplement iodine). Bob Dirgo recommended CoQ10, acidophilous bifidus, blue green algea, I cook with lots of garlic all the time,and digestive enzymes...all good recommendations. My huband started getting up before 8 in the morning and today (don't remember when he did that), after about 4-5 days of this new regimen, he actually said he felt great, didn't have any pain in his joints, etc. Plus he seems to be thinking much more clearly and like I said, all of his symptoms have shown improvement, and I believe they'll probably continue to improve for several months. So, in conclusion, there is no book that is going to be a panacea for you to fix some disease. You need information from your own common sense, information from several sources, input from a traditional doctor (would have never guessed Hashimoto's if it wasn't for the doc), and consulting with alternative practicioners if you can find them.

The worst thing anyone can do is to lose hope, hope is what keeps us alive and without it well, we might as well just commit suicide.So just a short message to all the negative people out there suffering from this illness, I do understand your pain because I have it myself, but I refuse to give in to it.

Two things I do agree with from the book are 1) Primary care physicians on the whole have no idea how to treat hashimoto's and 2) Managing hashimoto's does not require drugs in many cases.If this were a long blog post it would have been more accessible and more useful."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"Anyone who is newly diagnosed with Hashimoto's MUST READ this book!

I paid no attention to how much I ate but a lot of attention to what I DID and did NOT eat to take care of my thyroid. Today I am FREE of any kind of thyroid supplementation, prescription or natural.

His doctor didn't take all test's that needs to be taken to give a diagnos as Hashimotos.I mean, I didn't buy this book from the US, to be sent to me in Scandinavia, just to have 60 empty pages? I thougt I bought a book with a lot of new interesting information!? Suprise! There was nothing I didn't knew since before.Most of the things he recommended I already did myself regarding nutrition and garlic, Omega oils. The discription above about this book and other peoples reviews, can give a false impression that it is a thick book or at least thick in that meaning, it contains a lot of essential information. I'm sorry I can't agree. In the end it's 2 blank pages and in the beginning it also has repeating pages with the title. Like they want to fill the book up with empty blank pages just to make it look thicker.Another thing is that you can't give a diagnos like Hashimotos without doing biopsy. The lab needs to use a needle and take out material, cells, from the thyroid to see if it's really is a inflammation or not. He's gland was not swollen either so they couldn't see it that way. The antibodies test were maybe wrong, cause he only have antibodies once. Most of the people have a small amount even if they alright. And no one knows what the man's normal TSH is!? Maybe he is some of those that feel good in a higher level.I have Hashimotos myself and if I wrote a book about it this diesease, I really couldn't neclect describing how I felt when I got it. He didn't seem to be affected at all! He continued with he's life and went to the gym and run marathon...forget it. That's impossible if you have untreated Hashimotos and really really have 700-something in antibodies. I don't buy this.

There are, in fact, obvious scientific deficiencies and a lack of depth that many of the criticisms discuss.Prior to reading this book, I read most of the other books on Hashimoto's Hypothyroidism. All of them focused on identifying undiagnosed cases and living as well as possible with this \\"incurable\\" disease. This supported the view of my endocrinologist and for 2 years I accepted western medicine's inaccurate approach to hypothyroidism by adhering to a daily regimen of synthroid.I read this book with skepticism. I have a degree in engineering and a business degree from an Ivy League university. However, Mr. Dirgo fully achieves his purpose in writing this book. He got me to consider other possibilities and that led me to research Homeopathic medicine, Chinese medicine, and Ayurveda. All three systems are similar in that they treat the underlying cause rather than the symptoms of Hashimoto's, but there are pro's and cons to each. I was surprised to find the incurability of hypothyroidism is only accepted by the \\"experts\\" of western medicine.I chose to treat my Hashimoto's Hypothyroidism through Ayurvedic medicine. The results were astonishing and the benefits went well beyond reversing hypothyroidism. I have not taken synthroid (or any other thyroid hormone supplement)since July 2001. Since then my TSH level has not varied from the middle of the normal range and the antibodies went from extremely high to high to slightly positive. An interesting note on antibody tests: The results include this caveat \\"Although a positive result indicates Hashimoto's Disease, some people without the disease also test positive for thyroid antibodies\\". So much for the scientific rigidity of western medicine!Read this book, do your homework, and take action. While you are treating the symptoms of this disease with hormone supplements your thyroid is slowly being destroyed. Using the veil of modern science, western medicine feigns knowledge of a disease it in fact knows very little about. Thank you Mr. Dirgo for exposing this charade. I would not have saved my thyroid if I had not read your book.ANOTHER UPDATE August 5, 2005: Still free of Hashimoto's and thyroid normal 4 years later. The reviewers who are trashing this book are missing the point and doing a disservice to those who may skip the book and unnecessarily endure a lifetime of thyroid disease. The whole point of the book is to emphasize that thyroid disease is not incurable. I went to 2 endocrinologists including one professor in the endocrinology department of UCLA and got the same diagnosis and treatment - Hashimoto's, 1 synthroid/day forever. The book has severe shortcomings in depth and scientific method, but the purpose of the book is not to be a medical textbook. Once again I will respond to the negative reviews with the simple statement that IF I HAD NOT READ THIS BOOK, I WOULD STILL BE TAKING SYNTHROID!UPDATE NOV. 10, 2006: ANOTHER YEAR WITHOUT SYNTHROID. I continue to be amazed by the negative reviewers who completely miss the point of the book. Let me repeat once again. If you are looking for well documented medical research, look elsewhere! But please do not hinder other people's health by reviewing this book as if it was supposed to be a medical textbook. The author makes it very clear that his purpose is to inform readers about the medical community's lack of knowledge of thyroid disease and the fact that other treatments are effective. As described earlier, I did not follow the same treatment as the author. But it was his book that got me to research alternative methods and find a cure that worked for me. Maybe some people will not respond to alternative treatments for thyroid disease - just as not everyone with the same cancer responds to the same chemotherapy.The worst case is you spend $11 and an hour of reading and continue to take synthroid. The best case is you're cured, don't take synthroid, and every year get to thumb your nose at the negative reviewers whining because the material doesn't qualify for the New England Journal of Medicine.UPDATE NOVEMBER 17, 2008: 7 YEARS WITHOUT SYNTHROIDAgain I am astounded by the negative reviews. But I have noticed a common thread in these reviewers. Not one of them claims to have even tried any treatment other than that prescribed by western medicine.The facts speak for themselves:1. The tests diagnosing my Hashimoto's were all conclusively positive.2. I took synthroid every day for 2 years.3. I followed treatment prescribed by an Ayurvedic physician on June 6, 2001.4. I stopped taking synthroid late July 2001.5. The tests have been conclusively negative for the past 7 years.Call it a misdiagnosis. Call it a miracle. Call it a statistical anomaly. The fact is I sought an alternative cure only after reading this book - shortcomings and all.UPDATE DECEMBER 28, 2010: 9 YEARS WITHOUT SYNTHROID and SOME NEW INFOApologies to those leaving comments asking for information. I haven't checked this in a long time and rarely even think about hypothyroidism anymore. To answer the questions about which practitioner I saw and what herbs - I moved several years ago, but the doctor I saw was in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, CA and associated with Maharishi Ayurveda, website MAPI.com. She was also a medical doctor which was one of the reasons I chose her. She was of Indian descent with an Indian name. I think her last name is Rau, but I am not certain and couldn't find a listing under that name.It has been many years and I don't remember the names of the herbs I took, but I did get them through MAPI and some of them were not available on the website. They had to be ordered through MAPI as directed by the Ayurvedic doctor. Two of the herbs were not available from MAPI in the United States and had to be ordered from MAPI in Holland. The treatment also included diet and other lifestyle changes which were considered as important as the herbs. The treatment was not covered by insurance (at least not when I did it) and was not cheap. I now do not take any herbs on a regular basis; only for specific occasional needs like cleansing, colds, etc. Although I do still check MAPI.com, I now use Dr. John Douillard's site Lifespa.com as my primary source.About a year or so ago I read an article on adverse health effects of soy milk. The article indicated that soy milk may be harmful to the thyroid function in some people. The article was posted on an information board in the lobby of a massage therapist, so I do not know how credible it is. I note this because at the time I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's, I was using soy milk with cereal at breakfast as a way to cut down on dairy products. It did not associate harmful effects to other soy products - only soy milk; Interestingly, I stopped using soy milk because Ayurveda doesn't take as dim a view of dairy products as western culture does.However, the diagnosis and my opinion stand - two endocrinologists independently diagnosed me with Hashimoto's Disease and prescribed synthroid for the rest of my life. I read Mr. Dirgo's book and immediately sought a solution. Maybe I would have found a cure without reading the book; maybe not."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"Almost nothing in this book.

Since he doesn't give much in the way of sources to prove or support his claims of why his life style changes will work, I'm a bit skeptical of his claims. Still.. like many of us who would like to get off synthroid, I thought, ok .. I'll give it a shot.I have to agree with the other reviewers who criticized him for not giving dosage amounts for the suppliments etc., and for the 'diary pages'.

Who knows if it will work or not if you don't tell readers what dosages to take. I realize he is not a doctor, but he could still have provided more detail about his own treatment.

This is a really bad book--I agree with the person who said that they would give it zero stars if they could (half the book IS empty blank pages for your journaling). There is not much that's helpful in this book. Much better and thorough are (1) The Thyroid Solution by Ridha Arem, (2) Living with Autoimmune Disease by Mary J.

He went to a natural doctor who prescribed an eating plan and nutritional supplements that helped him regain his health. I also have Hashimoto's, but I believe that my illness began from a yeast infection. The yeast infection became extensive since I am a new diabetic who is having blood sugar problems. (Yeast thrive in a high blood sugar environment.) I am following the plan in the book, but I have also added 2000 IU of Vitamin D and 200 mcg of selenium to my diet. I do feel better and my throat inflammation has started to settle down. I do not know if I can be cured of my Hashimoto's yet.Some people have criticized the book because it is not a long book and contains a journal at the end for you to fill in so you can monitor your progress. That is totally irrelevant. The author provides all the information that was relevant to him being cured of Hashimoto's. He writes clearly and concisely.March 20, 2010 - UpdateI think there are different causes for Hashimoto's. My endocrinologist has told me that Hashimoto's is genetic and there is no cure. I do not believe that because some people have been able to reverse their Hashimoto's. In my case and in the author's case, we believe that our Hashimoto's was started by an infection. A natural oriented-doctor has told me that in many cases, people with Hashimoto's have a sensitivity to gluten. There is a gluten stool test that can show whether you have a sensitivity to gluten. He said that once these people eliminated gluten from their diet, their Hashimoto's went away. If, on the other hand, your Hashimoto's was caused by an infection that still lingers in your body, then you need to get rid of your infection entirely. The medical concepts outlined in the author's book improve your immunity, and therefore can fight an infection."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"I highly recommend this book. As one afflicted with hashimoto's, I was inspired and encouraged by Mr. Dirgo's success. It's the first book I've found that provides me with some practical suggestions on how I can improve my condition, and not just live with it. Since being diagnosed, I've been tempted by the easy acceptance of defeat. I applaud Mr. Dirgo for the courage to fight this disease and not accept defeat. His battle reminds me of Christopher Reeve's conviction that he will walk again. A voice crying out in the wilderness of passive acceptance. I hope that in the not too distant future, the reversal of hashimoto's will be a common occurance, not a rarity. I will be one who, like Mr. Dirgo, has overcome this disease.

His was the ONLY book that actually showed a way. And his \\"title\\" was appropriate in the sense that it told me this book might have a solution. I am a staunch believer of alternative medicine however in the wide world of alternative medicine there is always a key that works and I found that through the book of Robert Dirgo. It was like talking to a patient who recovered and who was willing to share his experiences and struggles with another patient. He must have spent a lot of effort and time in finding the cure and I think it is commendable for him to share it with us stangers. I have also followed the path that he showed and I am grateful for his details which included the list of diverse supplements and their benefits in detail. He even went into details about a natural toothpaste and solution to drinking tap water etc.This is my dream book and I believe its going to be the path of my treatment. He has a site which I also visited and found other patients who are on their way to recovery and some who have recovered through the advice he provided. Coming across his book is a gift from the angels because it has alleviated some other health problems that I have had which have come as a bonus to me in addition to showing me a way to cure my thyroid which was my biggest concern.

This book sets itself apart from all of those other books out there on hashimoto's that basically say the same thing. That is, that combating the disease is futile and the only course of action is to treat the symptom with synthetic or natural hormone therapy.On the other hand, &quot;How I Reversed My Hashimoto's...&quot; provides an excellent example of how to overcome rather than succumb to the disease. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that treating the symptom rather that the cause of the disease will get you no where. However, it's unfortunate that many aspire to that theory.Dirgo obviously supports the premise that it is more effective to treat and eradicate the cause of a disease in order to alleviate it. This seems like common sense and indeed it is. I applaud you Mr. Dirgo for your efforts and whole-heatedly endorse this book."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"I felt totally ripped-off by this book. Over half of it is blank with 59 pages of space for the reader to record her or his personal health diary. We get advice such as eating some health foods and supplements, drinking lots of pure water, exercise, sleeping and managing stress. Duh. One of the worst problems with Hashimoto's Disease is the alternation between over-production under-production of the thyroid hormone until the devastating health results until the disease finally settles into under-production of the hormone. I found no mention of this in Dirgo's book. If there was, I didn't see it before I tossed the book into the garbage. In doing so, I noticed that it is a thinly disguised self-published book from iUniverse.com."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"As mentioned in other reviews, this book has no more info on Hashimoto's than you can find anywhere on the internet for free.

I suppose this is a testament to digital publishing; low cost and low standards. I'm sure the author had a desire to share and help, but I found it unhelpful and disappointing. As I reached the middle of the book, I was surprised to see that after several disorganized repetitions in the first 50 pages, the final 50 were a fraud in the form of a repeated \\"journal\\" template, repeated for ~50 pages.Recommendation: Look elsewhere and apply your time and money to something useful."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"Very hopeful book for those of us who suffer from Hashimoto's. Unfortunately, there are several different sets of manifestations of thyroiditis that get the name Hashimoto's, and I couldnt tell if his symptoms were the same as mine. As I said, it is hopeful in that the author returned his thyroid health back to normal and does not take any synthetic hormone. Many of us probably will not be so fortunate. Good book, if you are fighting this condition and want to hear of something that worked for someone."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"I learned a lot from reading about Robert Dirgo's experience with Hashimoto's. He named four potential contributors to a spiraling down into disease: low fat-high carb diet, excessive levels of exercise, high intake of soy, and parasites. This is something I can relate to and believe my disease was a result of a history of bad diet and parasites. I give the book 4 stars because it motivated me to think beyond the prognosis handed out by conventional medicine, and the confidence to look elsewhere for treatment. I consulted with an ayurvedic doctor who prescribed some herbs and modified diet. I also started searching for modes of healing through various spiritual and wellness practices. My blood work is not perfect today but it's better and I feel better. I have been off Synthroid and Armour for over a year and feeling stronger all the time. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the book is becoming a bit dated. I feel that a lot has changed in the treatment of Hashimoto's since 2001 and I would love to hear more from the author - how he's doing and possibly an updated version of the book. His website has pretty much been untouched since 2002."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"Since I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis 15 years ago, I was excited when I came across this book since I was searching for new information; something that might help reverse the disorder. Unfortunately my excitement was short-lived as the book contains little substance. It is obvious that the author was wrongly diagnosed. It's hard to take him seriously when he says he felt like running a marathon! What??? If you have untreated Hashimoto's, you surely do not feel like running a marathon! The author had none of the classic symptoms: fatigue, weight gain, thinning hair, cold intolerence, etc. Also disappointing is the 40-50 blank diary contained in the book. The one positive: the author points to alternative and Ayurvedic treatments which do help."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"Bob Dirgo has demonstrated in his book the three pillars of nutritional healing; balanced gastrointestinal bacteria, proper enzymatic breakdown of food particles and consumption of whole organic food. If most patients would follow these basic principles when approaching their health they would achieve great success in preventing and curing disease. Bob is blessed to have one personal virtue that most people do not have and that is perseverance. I pray that more of my patients and all people throughout the world who are ill may persevere in faith with the hope that one day they too may be relieved of their afflictions. Bob has pointed out a definite path to success.Dr. Jeffrey Starre, M.D."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"Although there are some weaknesses in this book, it is a must read for anyone diagnosed with Hypothyroidism and/or Hashimoto's disease. The book provides a much needed public service by alerting readers to the fact that the medical community lacks a clear understanding of Hypothyroidism and focuses only on treating the symptoms of this disease. It is written in clear, concise, layman's terms. The author does not have a medical background and therefore is able to make the discussion of the disease and his treatment easy to understand. There is also an excellent section on resources for obtaining additional information.The primary weakness of the book is that it lacks depth. About 60 of the 136 pages are blank diary pages for tracking progress. The author discusses what he did to reverse Hashimoto's, but does not discuss alternatives that did not work or that he decided against trying. Also, Mr. Dirgo simultaneously treated the disease with different methods and can't isolate exactly what worked.Despite the lack of scientific rigidity, the book is well worth the price. It provides valuable information you won't get from your doctor. Mr. Dirgo proves that the cause of the disease can be treated as well as the symptoms. I highly recommend this book as a starting point.Update October 25, 2003: Off synthroid since July 2001. All tests normal. I have a regular yoga and meditation practice and follow Ayurvedic nutrition and health principles. I believe this is what worked, but I can't prove it and my endocrinologist is at a loss for words. All I know for certain is that if I had listened to my doctors and not read this book, I would still be taking synthroid every day. Also, I can't help but comment on some of the more recent negative reviews. The book's shortcomings are so thoroughly documented, that no one should be shocked to find blank pages and lack of scientific method. The book is what it is: An alert to question the need for hormone replacement every day for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"I followed this book's recommendations to the T, It really works.

And I've been fascinated with the German use of the half track configuration.This book answered all of my questions. The German half tracks, which came in a wide range of sizes had much better tracks than did the American M2/M3 (It was said that the American machines had rubber bands for tracks), but the German units were not four wheel drive. The little motorcycle looking halftrack was not a tracked motorcycle, but a small prime mover used to do things like haul aircraft around the field. And I've decided that what I really want is a Volkswagon Schwimmwagon, the four wheel drive amphibious vehicle (You can see of these at the Heartland Museum of Military Vehicles just off I-80 at Lexington, Nebraska.)This book has more photographos of German military vehicles than I would have thought existed. Of course it covers all their tanks, but you find these in lots of books. Here are the rest of the vehicles - trucks, motorcycles, prime movers, everything that the Germans produced during World War II.If these kinds of vehicles are your thing, this is a book you can't do without."},{"Title":"Standard Catalog of German Military Vehicles","review":"What a fantastic book, what a labour of love by David Doyle. However it's ruined by the terrible treatment of the photographs. Any one who uses a digial camera or has done some scanning will know what I mean. Basically a picture consists of a white point at one end and a black point at the other. Older photos often have no information at the start or end and the black and white point start a little way in. Left like that you get a muddy unclear picture. But if you draw the white and black points into the point at the start of the information then you end up with a clear picture with detail all throug the range. A black and white picture. Any old photo will look twice as good if this is done to it. Clearly no one could be bothered to do that here. Which mean we end up with grey to grey pictures with no white points and no clear black points. So on page 114 we are asked to notice the use of all-steel and rubber-tired return rollars,...well all you can see is a shape of a tank with very little detail. On page 80 we are told to notice the jack at the back of the tank,...I'm sure it's there but I can discern no details on the back at all, just a dark grey back of a tank with faint shadows.Sadly all the photos are like this, ever stuff from museums is lacking in detail and is just plain muddy looking. What a difference could have been made with just a little more care.David you book is a classic and is fantastic, but please find a publisher who can take the care to get the photogaphy side right, until then it's like listening to the best group ever through the phone, or looking at a masterpiece painting through a a piece of tracing paper."},{"Title":"Standard Catalog of German Military Vehicles","review":"This book has every vehicle the German Army used during the war.A must for every modeler.Execellent pictures!!!"},{"Title":"Standard Catalog of German Military Vehicles","review":"This book is a must for anyone interested in weaponry of WWII.

Maybe so, but most of the photos are good enough to get a good view of the vehicle being mentioned. Only a few are in bad shape but considering this book is chalked full of unique photos, it's well worth it. Besides, that's not what this book is about. It's not a pretty picture book, it's a book of reference and info about all the German armored vehicles in WWII. That's a huge bit of reference work Mr. Doyle had to do and it is greatly appreciated.

As a psychologist who has administered thousands of IQ tests, I was intrigued (and disappointed) by the skewed nature of the IQ distribution used in this book. The standard deviation of most commercial IQ tests is 15. Thus, an IQ of 130 is two standard deviations above the mean, which falls at the 98th percentile and qualifies the examinee for membership in Mensa. The IQ scale used in CHALLENGE YOUR IQ is grossly inflated. The standard deviation appears to be 24! Thus, a person who scores 115 on a commerical IQ test would get an equivalent IQ of 124 in this book. This is a whopping difference and is bound to make readers think they are far smarter than is actually the case."},{"Title":"Mensa Challenge Your IQ (Mensa Word Games for Kids)","review":"The problem with most IQ like books is that they either are too easy{to sort of boost your ego] or teach irrelevent suff.This book is one of the best of these kinds of books.made by Mensa, and is keeping to every thing you need to boost your IQ"},{"Title":"Mensa Challenge Your IQ (Mensa Word Games for Kids)","review":"as per previous reviews, the only fault I have with the book is that it does tend to get repetitive and, as far as challenging goes - well, some of the problems are a measure of sheer tediousness rather than smarts.

Mensa tends to put out a lot of repetitive material, but this set of tests is different. My only complaint is that the tests within the set are very similar. As to the complaint that the scores are inflated, in my version of this book, the percentiles are mentioned next to each score, with the 98th percentile highlighted, meaning it would be a qualifying score for Mensa. Therefore, there should be no confusion about your performance. Even the complaint that a standard deviation of 24 is not valid isn't a good one. Some tests have such a standard deviation, including the Catell scales, a commonly used IQ test."},{"Title":"Mensa Challenge Your IQ (Mensa Word Games for Kids)","review":"First of all, its rather &quot;stupid&quot; to buy a book that appeals by offering the reader that it'll &quot;boost their IQ&quot;. Your IQ doesn't simply skyrocket (or go up) by doing a book full of foolish exercises, in fact doing these exercises will do either of the following to you: 1) make you feel rather confident and elite OR 2) make you feel stupid and throw away the book because you feel IQ doesn't prove anything. In either case the reader has a right to feel that way, however, one should be aware that an IQ test simply serve as a rather easy way to determine a person's abilities because there are no better way to do so. If there were better, complex and accurate ways to determine intelligence abilities we wouldn't be wasting time and money and screwy pictures. Nevertheless, buy this book to amuse yourself with screwy pictures and exercises and feel insecure about your abilities OR laugh at others and feel good about yourself. In either case if the book has made you feel superior for the day then it is certainly worth your time and money, else don't buy it."},{"Title":"Making Callaloo: 25 Years of Black Literature","review":"On the dinner table, Callaloo is a stew rich in spices that is made from the leaves of the African dasheen plant. On the bookshelf, Callaloo is a literary journal that has highlighted work from the African Diaspora for the past 25 years. Edited by Charles Henry Rowell, it has provided the literary community with the profound authorship of its contributers. Making Callaloo, a compilation, celebrates these 25 years by showcasing some of the best pieces of prose and poetry that have appeared in the journal during this time.Included in the compilation are works by talented authors such as Ralph Ellison, Helen Elaine Lee, Percival Everett, Leon Forrest, and Terry McMillan. One of the works of short fiction that I thought was particulary compelling is Octavia Butler's &quot;The Morning and the Evening and the Night.&quot; In this short story Butler tells the tale of a diseased group of people, known as &quot;the DGD's&quot;. The existence of the DGD's is heartwrenching, and the story lingers long after the last word has been digested.The poetic voices of Alice Walker, Cyrus Cassells, Rita Dove, and Sonia Sanchez are heard loud and clear in Making Callaloo. Cassells' piece &quot;Sally Hemmings to Thomas Jefferson&quot; paints a vivid picture of the taboo love the two struggled with. Cassels' verse is deep and rhythmic, digging a virtual trench, penetrating the readers' very being.Just like the Caribbean stew callaloo satiates the body's hunger, Making Callaloo is a collection of work and authors that enriches the mind and spirit. This is art. This is literature. This is Callaloo.Reviewed by Candace K"},{"Title":"Making Callaloo: 25 Years of Black Literature","review":"CALLALOO is to be congratulated. Its tiny beginning, practically a mimeo magazine, blossomed into the most important journal of African-American writing ever published, and 25 years later it is still going strong, although perhaps it's not quite as exciting as it once was. The anthology, unfortunately, doesn't give you a good picture of what the magazine is like, by eliminating all traces of its critical edge, its portfolio of visual artists, and any sampling of the drama, which right now is its strong point, all serve to remove some of the \\"ingredients\\" to the \\"Callaloo\\" which makes it such a tasty stew.Nevertheless in the poetry and fiction departments, which are all that are represented in this anthology, Rowell has selected some classic tales and poems, including Ralph Ellison and Alice Walker. We don't get much of a sense of progression, however, because Rowell has unaccountably ordered his contributors by alphabetical order rather than chronology, so we have no sense of Harryette Mullen growing out of Sonia Sanchez or whoever, indeed it's pretty much the reverse. That caveat aside, the book is exemplary in every way."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"Venerable Thubten Chodron is a wonderful writer - she explains things simply and sometimes humorously, and always holds the reader's interest.

It is the perfect book to give to friends or family members who are not familiar with Buddhism but want to understand your newfound spirituality."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"I read this book after I finished a more scholarly book on Buddhism. It was quite refreshing to read &quot;Buddhism For Beginners&quot;, as it is an easy read. The book is full of questions and answers from cover to cover. You can pick up the book, read it for an hour or so, or just read it for 5 minutes with ease. You can thumb through it looking for subjects that interest you, or you can go from cover to cover. Either way, it is a nicely written book, with clear and simple text. For one who actually wants to begin studying and practicing Buddhism I also suggest they read &quot;Buddhism Plain and Simple&quot; by Steven Hagen. These are both very good books!"},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"This is a great book for beginners with a little bit of knowledge about Buddhism already. If I knew nothing at all I think it would be very overwhelming because of the amount of information presented so quickly.

My only advice is that if you do get overwhelmed and you really are just beginning, don't give up learning about Buddhism- it is a wonderful practice!"},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"Great Introduction to BuddhismThis book was written in response to many - \\"can I ask you a question about Buddhism?\\"I really enjoyed the question and answer style that this is written in - for example in chapter one the question is asked - \\"What is the essence of Buddha's teachings?\\" and an excellent and easy to understand answer given. \\"What is the goal of the Buddhist path?\\" and again another easy to understand and terrific answer given etc -These and other great questions throughout the book are questions that someone looking into Buddhism would be asking.Some of the questions I hadn't really considered before, but was really glad they were asked and fully interested in the answers and learned new things.This is an easy and enjoyable book to read. Great for the beginner or someone just curious about Buddhism. Great for someone further along the path to sit, smile and enjoy."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"This book grew out of a smaller work entitled \\"I Wonder Why;\\" it \\"is not designed to be a comprehensive introduction to Buddhism, but to clarify points, provide Buddhist perspectives on modern issues, and stimulate the curiosity and questioning minds of the readers\\" (p. 10). The author makes some profound statements about questions: p. 7: \\"In the beginning one should remain skeptical and rely on questioning and checking the teachings based on one's understanding\\" and p. 9: \\"I believe that spiritual practice is more about holding questions than finding answers. Seeking one correct answer often comes from a wish to make life-which is basically fluid-into something certain and fixed.\\" The latter applies directly to Buddhism itself: p. 77-8: \\"As the Buddha's teachings spread from one country to another, they adapted to the culture and mentality of the people in each place without changing the essential meaning...The external forms and ways of doing things are not the Dharma.\\" Thus, she differentiates between true practitioners and p. 118: \\"joss stick Buddhists.\\" Needless to say, this book is for people truly interested in or at least honestly curious about Buddhism. The author corrects many incorrect views: p. 42: \\"There is nothing inherently wrong with the world; the real problem lies in our disturbing attitudes\\" and p. 63: to set reachable short-term goals as well as long-term resolve when purifying negative traits and actions. In addition to considerable information on helping the dying, a mantra to say when about to eat meat (p. 109: \\"Om Ahbirakay tsara hung\\" said 7 times & pray for animal to have fortunate rebirth), types of Buddhist nuns and robes, and especially children (p. 132: \\"When children see an adult sitting peacefully, they get the idea that they can as well\\" and p. 134: \\"Love is more important to children than material possessions. Choosing to earn more money at the expense of good family relations may mean later having to spend that extra income on therapy and counseling for both parents and children!\\"). Her words are worth considerable thought though they are quite basic and virtually nonsectarian.

Each chapter deals with a general topic and has several questions relating to that topic. The answers are concise and well thought out and are excellent introductions to some of the more weighty thinking Buddhism has. The questions range from the sublime (the nature of the mind) to the mundane (lay ordained monks were asked to wear a white strip on their shawl to distinguish themselves from the other ordained). All of the answers are insightful, even to those more advanced beginners out there.I think this book is best for people that have read some other Buddhist influenced books (perhaps something like The Art of Happiness where the author uses the Dalai Lama&#8217;s answers to form some general advice on dealing with life). To those &#8220;advanced&#8221; beginners, they might have formulated many of those questions contained in the book.

A great book for the basics of Buddhism."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"Lately, I've been noticing Buddhist influences around me more and more frequently. From prints and candleholders of the Buddha at Target, to everyone threatening with Karmic repercussion for any wrongdoing, Buddhism seems to be everywhere. Many times, especially during existential crises, I would get a bit curious as to what Buddhism really entails, but every time I perused the aisles of my local alternative bookstore in search of a life-changing Buddhist book, I usually got a little overwhelmed and ended up leaving the store with incense and candles instead. That is, until I got my hands on this book.If you're like me, or just don't know where to begin, then this would be a good start. Don't be fooled by the slimness of this book, Buddhism for Beginners is definitely not the kind that you get through in one sitting. Not because it probes deeply into the subject, but mainly because it covers a lot of information, even while only skimming the surface. The book is in the form of question and answer, creating a dialogue between reader and author. The topics range from the basics of Buddhism, to what the Buddha's view on controversial topics is (abortion, death penalty, the environment), to women in Buddhism and even parenting. It can be rather repetitive at times, and a lot of the answers are rather ambiguous. More than once you will find the answer begins with \\"it depends.\\" At times, the author oversimplifies and statements like \\"If you show people how patient you've become they will think Buddhism is a good thing and will be curious too\\" appear more than once in the book. If anything, this book leaves the door wide open for those interested in Buddhism to do further reading in the subject.Criticism aside, I'd recommend this book not just for people interested in Buddhism, but really for everyone. A lot of what is mentioned is really common sense: be compassionate, tolerant, truly enjoy things, ask questions, which, in this day and age, we sometimes tend to forget. Consider this a \\"refresher course in life,\\" the kind of book you keep around and pick up from time to time. The author's voice is nonjudgmental, serene and optimistic without being clich&eacute;. I read this book after a notoriously low point in my life, and after pondering many of the ideas in it, I was left feeling hopeful, motivated not to take life too seriously; after all, I could always come back and try again."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"This is a really bad place to start for those new to Buddhism. The title should have been \\"Tibetan Buddhism for Beginners.\\" There is so much emphasis on the very mystical, literal interpretation of reincarnation that is specific to the Tibetan tradition, and this is not a good way to start. Details such as \\"it takes 4 minutes for the transmigration of the soul... I don't know why, but it just does\\" (not a literal quote, but she basically says this), is really ridiculous.A better place to start would be \\"What the Buddha Taught\\" by Walpola Rahula or \\"What Makes you Not a Buddhist\\" by Jamyang Khyentse."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"This is a great book for beginners interested in the basics of Buddhism.

For some reason, the books written by the Dali Lhama are hard for me to stick with, and they didn't answer my questions about Buddhism. This book, however, takes one common question at a time and clearly answers it - all of my questions were in there, plus a few more. I plan on buying more books about Buddhism by this author."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"While this book does provide an overview of all Buddhist traditions, it clearly has a Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayana) bent.I was hoping for a book that gave all traditions equal treatment thus allowing me to pick the tradition that suited me best.This book simply isn't that.As such, the title is misleading (it should be called \\"Tibetan Buddhism for Beginners\\") and the fact that the content doesn't really cover the other traditions in much detail."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"Buddhism for Beginners is a good book for those with questions about Buddhism, specifically a Tibetan form of Buddhism, unfortunately for me I was looking for a books on Zen Buddhism and didn't look closely enough at this book. Anyway, it really is a well written and thorough book it deserves 5 stars, it just wasn't what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"For most Westerners, gaining a confident foothold on just what Buddhism entails can pose significant challenges. Enough variety in traditions, opinions and permutations of this religion - that some call a \\"philosophy\\" but others think comprises a mere practice or \\"way of life\\" - exist to utterly confound the initiate. Where to begin? To make matters more head-scratching, one can take multiple entry points into this 2,500 year old collection of beliefs and practices. No one definitive beginner's book seems to exist, but some come extremely close. \\"Buddhism for Beginners\\" does come close, and it definitely stands as a book that any newcomer to Buddhism should study. Its simple format, presented as an enormous FAQ repository, makes comprehension and reference easy. Twenty-one short chapters organize the questions into handy topics and provide a nearly exhaustive overview. For example, chapter one, \\"The Essence of Buddhism,\\" contains the following questions: \\"What is the essence of the Buddha's teachings?\\" \\"What is the goal of the Buddhist path?\\" \\"What are the Three Jewels? How do we relate to them? What does it mean to take refuge in the Three Jewels?\\" and \\"Must we be a Buddhist to practice what the Buddha taught?\\" Each one receives a page or two answer in turn and the entire book continues in this format. Some of the questions clear up potential misunderstandings, such as \\"Do Buddhists worship idols?\\" which receives an immediate answer of \\"Not at all!\\" and then offers adequate explanations. The topics range from basic precepts (the Four Noble Truths, The Eightfold Path) and practices (compassion, meditation) to social awareness, daily life and activism. This way beginners also learn the ways Buddhism gets applied in daily life.Other important misunderstandings receive attention. For example, some people may find Buddhism's focus on \\"suffering\\" depressing or nihilistic. After all, following something that claims \\"life is suffering\\" seems like eating at a restaurant that claims \\"our food is lousy.\\" Chapter five addresses this with the question \\"Buddhism talks a lot about impermanence, death and suffering. Isn't such an approach to life unhealthy and pessimistic?\\" The author points out that what often gets translated as \\"suffering\\" in English, the word \\"duhka\\" in Pali or Sanskrit, really means something closer to \\"unsatisfactory\\" or \\"imperfect.\\" Unfortunately, this translation has left a sour taste in many Western mouths. In a similar manner, the book discusses Buddhist notions of \\"emptiness,\\" \\"Karma\\" and \\"selflessness.\\"One particularly interesting chapter analyzes the role of women in Buddhism. Some may find the answers surprising. Many Buddhist countries have cultural traditions that the West has rejected involving the status of women. These have apparently crept into some Buddhist traditions as well. The author, a Buddhist nun, gives some examples and argues that as Buddhism comes to the west such traditions inevitably get dropped. This may in turn change global Buddhist beliefs and practices. She also adds that early Buddhism, after some hesitation, allowed the ordination of women. Only Jainsism shared this early tolerance.So, given the seemingly exhaustive nature of this book, why not consider it the \\"definitive beginner's book to Buddhism?\\" The answer lies in the many ways Buddhism has manifested itself and one book doesn't seem capable of encapsulating all of them. This book's author comes from the Tibetan tradition. As such, it contains some subjects that would likely not appear in, say, an introduction to Zen Buddhism, such as Vajrayana or the more deity-centered approach associated with Tibetan Buddhism - the deities Avalokiteshvara and Manjushri appear as early as chapter two. In other words, other traditions of Buddhism exist and though this book recognizes them it has a distinctly Tibetan flavor in places. That's not a bad thing, it's just something to be aware of. Plus, the Dalai Lama's introduction emphasizes one of Buddhism's strengths: the idea that, especially in the beginning, one should remain skeptical and ask questions when discovering Buddhism. The book's format follows in this spirit. And beginners will find much to question, such as notions of rebirth, creation, views on death, clairvoyance and infinite consciousness. Again, other traditions approach such topics in varying ways, so don't take the views espoused here as the definitive gospel of all Buddhism. Read more. Question more. Learn more. Ultimately, those seeking such knowledge will find that this book provides one great starting point for studying this quickly spreading religion, philosophy or way of life. But don't bother too much about the label, focus on the practice."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Beginners","review":"This book is hard to comprehend for the lay person.

Ven. Chodron is entertaining and delivers the credo of Buddhism without boring the reader with too many complex terms or concepts.

The 21 chapters cover Buddhist beliefs and scriptures, rituals, the role of women, modern social issues like abortion, and practical tips for raising children and dealing with non-Buddhist relatives. The author attempts to fairly represent a variety of Buddhist traditions in a positive light. As a non-Buddhist I found it to be occasionally jargon-y but probably about as clear and straightforward as a \\"believer\\" can present their own religion. I think this book would be especially helpful for people who have already decided to embrace Buddhism or who grew up in Buddhist homes but don't really understand the religion they wish to practice.

This book inspired me to dig deeper. I already knew that this book may have a Tibetan twist to Buddhism because it says outright that the author is a Buddhist nun that follows the Tibetan tradition. Simply put, I was not surprised nor disappointed to find out that I was right. What's wrong with that, though? It is not designed to answer every question that can be asked, the goal is to provide information for someone that is new to Buddhism. This book did exactly that.Anyone that knows absolutely nothing about Buddhism should start here. There is a lot to learn and this is a great place to start. Just do not make it your last stop. I started here and moved on to Budhism Plain & Simple by Steve Hagen, personally.Expect to have a few questions when you're done. Expect to feel like there is more to learn. The truth is, there is.

As far as evidence, it is all around us, you are part of it. It does take a fool to believe that the Earth and all it's life forms came in to being from \\"billions and billions\\" of years of fortuitous occurrences of accidental circumstances. ALL life forms show evidence of intelligent design. Therefore there must be a Designer. \\"The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament shows His handiwork.\\"- Psalm 19:1 \\"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\\"- Psalm 14:1; 53:1. There IS billions upon billions of coded information (DNA) in a single cell of your body to fill thousands of volumes of books the size of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

Have you ever wondered if there is a God that created everything or if it was all by random chance? This book makes it very clear that all science and knowledge really points to an intelligent designer and shows without question that the account of creation from the Bible is the accurate account of what really happened."},{"Title":"The Evidence for Creation: Examining the Origin of Planet Earth","review":"My aim here is not to debunk creationism but rather to discredit this particular book, which consists chiefly of misinformation, unsupported assertions, and exceedingly poor arguments. The authors also unwittingly demolish their own position, ironically making the entire book a catastrophe of Biblical proportions. If you are interested in creationism, this would be an awful place to start. While I cannot in good conscience recommend a single book on the topic, I will simply point out that this one is exceedingly poor.While my criticism is harsh, I feel it is completely warranted, particularly in view of the author's vindictiveness toward those who disagree with them. For example, they assert: \\"A person who accepts the evolution premise as valid can not be convinced through intellectual reasoning that he is wrong.\\" And, \\"To any honest open-minded observer, the vast fossil evidence from all over the world confirms the Bible record of creation.\\" [p. 75] Evidently the authors believe that anyone who finds the preponderance of the evidence to support evolution is, by that criterion alone, both dishonest and closed-minded. Such ad hominem attacks are not only uncalled for, they are fallacious. Arguments with genuine substance needn't employ such tactics.There are far too many egregious errors in this book to list in a short review, so I will merely select a few random quotes: \\"The majority of the methods for determining the age of the earth indicate the earth is young. Only a few questionable methods of geochronology support the evolutionary concept of billions of years of age.\\" As harsh as it may sound, this is a great example of the fallacy known as \\"invincible ignorance\\"; the authors simply refuse to acknowledge the colossal mountain of evidence against them. It hardly warrants further comment.Here is another: \\"[Water] is one of the few compounds which does not follow the natural laws of chemistry. Instead of contracting when it is frozen, water expands to create ice.\\" To say that water \\"does not follow the natural laws of chemistry\\" is precisely like saying that helium balloons do not obey the law of gravitation. The somewhat unusual (but not unique) property of expanding when frozen is an immediate consequence of its crystalline structure, which follows from its bond angles, which follows from quantum mechanics; Laws of chemistry, all the way down.But the authors make the most spectacular blunder I have ever seen in print. Here is what they have to say about a world-wide deluge (Noah's flood): \\"All manner of life would be mixed and scrambled together and quickly buried.\\" [p. 82] \\"Vegetation and animal life would be scrambled together, torn, and buried in the layers of the earth in no particular order.\\" [p. 83] \\"According to the biblical model of the flood, all kinds of life would have been caught and destroyed in the layers of the earth. Fossils should not be found in a sequential order of simple to complex.\\" [p.86]The authors spell out what Biblical creationism predicts and correctly observe that it is dramatically different from what evolution predicts. After setting up this most appropriate test, which unequivocally distinguishes between two rival hypotheses, the authors simply abandon the entire argument and move on to a new topic, never once taking a close look at what we actually find in the geological record. While the authors do inject some odd statements later on (p. 165) about fossils everywhere appearing to have been formed by a sudden catastrophe, these are unsupported, wildly misleading, and evasive. The most relevant question is how (or whether) the fossils are ordered in the geological record.Here is what we find: The fossils of the geological column are ordered according to phylogeny (relatedness) and not homology (similarity of form), revealing world-wide strata corresponding to epochs of immense duration, unerringly separating both flora and fauna into hundreds of distinct groups, and showing an unmistakable progression from simple organisms in the Precambrian era to complex multicellular organisms in the Cambrian era and beyond. Creatures are layered according to the most minute anatomical differences, such as the number of bones in the ear, the number of toes, or the number of lenses in a compound eye. Flowering plants (angiosperms) diversified in the mid-Cretaceous, as did insects, so the types of plants and insects that we find are quite different on either side of the Cretaceous strata. Not a single reptile or mammal has ever been found among the countless fossils of the Cambrian strata. Primates are found first in the Cretaceous era, never in strata below. On and on it goes. Few things in science are as spectacularly clear or well-documented as that. The words \\"slam dunk\\" come to mind.Infer what you will about why the authors failed to mention any of that. Also, please consider again what the authors had to say about honest observers. Enough said."},{"Title":"Out Of The Sugar Rut: No Sugar, No White Flour, No Additives, No Preservatives","review":"Out of the Sugar RutA dentist gave this to me YEARS ago - like 1984 - and I love this book.

I have bought other books in this series (Thailand &amp; Belize) and have found them extremely helpful and informative. This book on Cuba is severely lacking in any useful diving information.For example under the Cayo Largo section, the author writes &quot;Cayo Largo has around 30 sites. 3 described below....&quot; What about the rest?

And the shorter the dialogue, the bigger the picture which takes up the rest of the page.Of course the underwater pictures are all of typical Caribbean flora and fauna and the many species of available are almost all mentioned (somewhere!) in order to pad out the text.In short, could have done much better!NM"},{"Title":"The Odyssey of Homer,","review":"The book in the picture which has Buckley's name on the cover is not his fine translation but Pope's inaccurate one.

The two should be regarded almost as a single (very long) book: only someone already expert on the history of the period would read the second one without the first.The book opens with Charles I having been on the throne for thirteen years. England and Scotland have been one united Kingdom for only twenty years longer than that. There is religious sectarianism of multiple kinds. There is financial pressure from the King's taxes. The King believes he rules by divine right. Parliament, when the King is willing to call it together, disagrees, and will not cooperate with the King. These threads, and others, will inevitably lead the kingdom to war over the next ten years.Wedgwood starts with almost two hundred pages of setting the stage: what was Britain like in 1637? The survey is thorough--science, taxation policy, religion, economics, court politics, education, social conditions, health, trade, the Church, the state of Ireland--and is well enough written. It does feel a bit like doing one's homework so as to be ready for the rest of the book, but it pays off amply in aiding comprehension of the later events.After this opening section, Wedgwood starts the story, beginning in mid-1637. In both books, she takes the slightly unusual approach of sticking very closely to a linear narrative of the events, instead of providing an overview and filling in details. She doesn't jump ahead and tell you how an intrigue is going to turn out, and this greatly increases the interest of the innumerable political twists and turns. Charles was not the cleverest British King, and had a weakness for over-complication and multiple plots; Wedgwood recounts them and the counters to them from Parliament as they happen, day by day, and it makes for fascinating reading.Wedgwood writes clearly and without too much ornamentation, though her style is not at all simplified. It is plain throughout that she loves her subject and knows all the characters intimately, and this enthusiasm and insight easily transmits itself to the reader."},{"Title":"The King's Peace 1637-1641","review":"Dame Veronica Wedgwood was history's third woman to gain membership in the British Order of Merit.To sample examples of her celebrated, if old fashioned, style look inside amazon reader reviews for \\"The Thirty Years War\\".This title from the 1950's was her most important work. Like all her biographies, we have here a sensual narrative of a sympathetically portrayed political and military captain leading men through bloody awful warfare.This volume is the early rule of Charles.The next in the great two part series concerns Charles at arms: _The King's War_.Not in this series is the close up portrait of Charles at the bar: _The Trial of Charles I_.Nor is her positive portrayal of Charles' great opponent in the English Civil War: _Oliver Cromwell_.Because of such like these, Wedgwood also became a member of the Dutch Order of Orange Nassau and received the German Goethe Medal."},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard.

Killing the Fatted Calf and Arming the Aware in the Cornbelt. SIGNED","review":"Written with a unique narrative resembling Steinbeck's East of Eden. It's the story of one John Kaltenbrunner, a kid, possibly autistic, who is as much of an outcast as possible, but brilliant in his own way, absorbed in his own busy life of meticulous details in running a farm after his father has deceased and breaking down every general rule of his backward country community. The entire thing has more caricatures than characters: a vibrant cast of a gun toting leather jacket wearing pissed off kid (Kaltenbrunner), wetbacks (Mexicans working the worst jobs), trolls (the general population of Baker - the town everything takes place in), the River Rat people (a population of Neandertal-like inbred forest people), evil theiving Methodists driving MethodistMobiles, a chicken slaughterhouse, and finally the city garbage collectors, whom Kaltenbrunner eventually leads in a strike against the town, and against the persecution of outcasts in general. It's an engrossing, wildly vivid account told with a dead serious manner even through much of the bizarre, unrealistic, even grossly loophole ridden story. But much of it is quite believable, because of the depths which the narrator takes you through to explain each step of the way. The book eventually becomes the decomposition, breakdown and destruction of an entire community, narrated through the actions of it's main perpetrator and our protagonist, John Kaltenbrunner. A sweeping, epic tale told through a simple narrative, it's biggest flaw is some of the unrealism, such as the account of the basketball game at the end. For all of Egolf's talents, it is out of pure laziness and not ignorance that the end of the story unravels to the dead end that it does. The end of the story is, literally, a flop, when considering the prose preceding it. The basketball game in particular is insulting not only in its blatant disregard for actual basketball language (there are penalties and 'red flags' instead of fouls, interceptions instead of steals, clocks counting upward instead of down, measurement in yards instead of feet - to which, the only reason I can understand is that Egolf put this in here mockingly, as a personal statement to show his disdain for professional sports) but also its narrative tongue (poorly written) and placement (poor, poor climax.) It's strange, but some of the best storytelling, including both language and events, happens during a twenty page stretch immediately preceding this. Anyways, if reworked a bit it was a potential classic, and still is on my bookshelf, but the problems are a few too blatant."},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard.

I found this book to be only a good story. I was desperately wanting to see him expose more of the characters hearts, and feelings. Although this book is creative and interesting, and is written in a style that is fresh in today's fiction, I was constantly wishing that he wouldn't have made it so cold."},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard.

You want to tag along with them. See what they'll do. Sure, there are grand themes and existential angst, but it's filtered through how people would experience them. Egolf says more than any &quot;ism&quot; writer by being clear. And yes folks, being witty and still accesible is a greater sign of intelligence than trying to write for the sake of being &quot;wacky&quot;. The book is not post-modern. It does not follow any &quot;ism&quot;. It is simply a well told story and a spectacle of creativity.

Killing the Fatted Calf and Arming the Aware in the Cornbelt. SIGNED","review":"The tragic hero, devastated by society's treatment of his idiosyncratic nature, is a time honored figure in literature. The struggle of John Kaltenbrunner is an attempt to add to this genre, an attempt that ultimately proves to be unsuccessful. Tristan Egolf has created a compelling character, but leaves him a cipher amidst all the obvious vitriol the author has towards many of the institutions he condemns in the course of this book. Many of Egolf's criticisms are valid, but so much time is spent on attacking these institutions that there is little room for any character development. By constantly introducing chaotic situations that reach no natural conclusions, Egolf loses control of the novel and it becomes too much imagery and not enough story. All the characters here are relatively interchangeable and Kaltenbrunner's valiant efforts to bring down said institutions lead to an inexorable and predictable end. This probably would be more forgivable if there weren't so many other poor choices on the author's part, particularly the lack of any dialogue which turns the book into one long storytelling exercise without any direct character interaction. You end up feeling like you are hearing someone tell you the very long story of someone's life, interrupted by descriptions of garbage mounds and barroom brawls that could have ended pages earlier. It ends up becoming boring and predictable. The shame of it is that underneath all this verbiage there is a good story; it's just so much work to pull it out that it's hard to recommend this."},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard. Killing the Fatted Calf and Arming the Aware in the Cornbelt. SIGNED","review":"Tristan Egolf, Lord of the Barnyard: Killing the Fatted Calf and Arming the Aware in the Corn Belt (Grove, 1998)Few books published in the last decade have garnered as much attention and as many favorable reviews as tristan Egolf's epic debut novel. It has achieved endless comparisons to John Kennedy Toole and William Faulkner, made ten-best lists the world over, and been lauded as the book most overlooked by all the major literary awards. Needless to say, after all that, it's roughly the literary equivalent of the 1963 shock film The Tingler (no pun intended); with all that buildup, someone's bound to get let down.First, to address the Toole comparisons: putting Lord of the Barnyard side-by-side with the unreadable piece of dreck that is A Confederacy of Dunces is to compare a Mozart sonata to a six-year-old plinking out Chopsticks on a toy piano for the first time. Everything Toole tried to do, Egolf succeeded in doing. That said, Lord of the Barnyard confirms what I have been saying for years; even if Toole's godawful tripe had succeeded in its lamebrained effort, it still would have sucked. Lord of the Barnyard doesn't, but that's less a factor of the personages and situations therein than it is indicative of Egolf's narrative style (hence the Faulkner comparisons).The difference between Egolf and Faulkner is much more subtle, and the comparisons therein are more understandable. Where Egolf fails and Faulkner succeeded is in the subtleties of character development. Egolf falls into the same trap many modern authors do where his characters are concerned; he mistakes event + event + event + event = accurate picture of character's psychological profile, and then goes on to point out the dysfunctionality of the events in question, assuming that those events will go on to fully explain the character's adult (to use the term loosely) behavior. This sort of thing is acceptable, even to be encouraged, in genre writing, where the plot is usually far more important than the characters within it anyway (and which is what makes someone like Stephen King so refreshing). But if you're going to write capital-L literature, where characters are equal in importance to (or greater in importance than) the plot, the author needs to understand that the whole is more than the sum of its parts; character development is as much in what you don't say as in what you do. Faulkner was a master at figuring out the art of putting together the whole. Egolf has a bit more work to do in that regard. He could also take a few pages from Faulkner's abilities with spare writing; what might have barely cleared a hundred fifty pages as a Faulkner piece soars to over four hundred in Egolf's hands.And that is the book's main failing. While there are certainly a number of chuckle-inducing scenes in the book, they're tied together with seemingly endless streams of explicatory prose that exist for little reason. Egolf doesn't seem to want the reader to work for anything here, and the result is almost unbearable logorrhea. Nothing would have been lost, and much gained, by editing this manuscript down another hundred or so pages.In short, there's nothing about this novel that doesn't correspond to the majority of first-novel failings; one just expects to see them less with such a universally-lauded book. It's entirely possible that Egolf's next work will live up to the standards the press set him for this one. We'll have to wait and see. **"},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard.

What made me sick was the fact that Egolf wrote this at the ripe old age of 27. His grasp of the human condition gives the impression that he is wizened to be 3 times that age.The story is centered around a down and out poor creature named John Kaltenbrunner. Egolf masterfully weaves tale after tale of John's misfortunes and poetic justices. With Egolf's skill however, it could have been about anything at all and you would still enjoy the book on its comical merit alone. It has a few minor problems such as Egolf's unwillingness to end the story (you'll see what I mean), but the faults are few and far between.

Only towards the end of the work did I comprehend that the protagonist, John Kaltenbrunner, represents a modern day Christ-like figure.I suspect that in coming years this will become required reading in upper division university literature, conceptual history, and sociology courses.
