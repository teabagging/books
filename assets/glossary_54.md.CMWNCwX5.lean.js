My parents bought this for me went I was just very little. The book is about Grover from the show Sesame Street. Grover, being a wimp, is scared because he thinks the monster at the end of the book will hurt him. I loved the book because the book builds suspense throughout the book, as Grover gets more scared as the book goes on. In the book Grover actually tries telling you not to turn the pages. He even tries funny things like tying pages together and building a brick wall to stop you from turning the page. All in all I thinks this is a great book for any one in elementary, maybe not so much as 4th or 5th. I recommend it because its funny and it goes to show you not to be afraid of all monsters."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I had this book when I was young so I just HAD to buy it for my daughter!

I so clearly remember reading, reading, and re-reading this book as a kid in the 80s, finding myself fascinated over and over again with the interactive nature of the plot. What an intriguing concept for a child - to feel that they are controlling the progression of the story, and to share in Grover's anxiety and excitement about what - WHAT - lies at the end of the pages. How funny to watch Grover try to literally tie the pages up with rope, to lock them down, to even build a brick wall, all to keep you from getting closer to the \\"monster\\" at the end. I read a lot as a child, and this was one of my first favorites.Now, as an expecting mom, I started creating a wish list of books that I want to make sure to share with my own children. This was one of the first to come to mind. I can't wait to share the thrills of this story with them. And now as an adult, I appreciate the little lessons I learned by reading this book as a child - that things aren't always what they seem, and that your fears are much scarier in your imagination than in reality.

The Sesame Street books were favorites when I was a kid so I know they will be for my son too.

Yet, page after page, while your impressionable child watches, you ignore Grover cruelly and turn the page. Again and again. Sure, there's no SCARY monster at the end.

(I have to check sometimes to make sure they aren't REALLY nudging each other and giggling when no one's looking.) Never has the physical act of reading a text been so hilariously rendered - nor so visually. And the biggest surprise, as the reader gets ever nearer the terrible Monster at the end of the book (against loveable furry ol' Grover's increasingly frantic advice), is surely ... well, that would be telling. But let's just say that the motion of Time - which whirls a kid from one change to the next in all other contexts of her life - is, while she reads this book, put into HER control to an unparalleled degree. And while the child sees herself collaborating - ambivalently but irresistably - with the destructiveness of Time, the end result is revelation, not loss.

My mom read me the same book when I was his age, and I love, LOVE this book.Not only does it teach you that sometimes the answer to all of your questions is right in front of you, but it does so by giving you pages of Grover, one of the most hysterical, lovable Muppets. The rattling of Grover's nerves, and the actual building of suspense in a picture book, keep the reader turning the book's pages -- even though Grover BEGS you not to do so. The reader is actually included in the narrative, for the book involves only Grover talking to the reader. The book thus becomes involving very quickly and entertaining throughout it.Plus, the final punchline is a great payoff.If you have children, this is an absolute must. Unlike other books from children's shows, this one's intelligent, maintains proper values and isn't beat-me-over-the-head annoying."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"_The Monster At The End Of This Book_ (henceforth &quot;TMATEOTB&quot;) is a fascinating treatise on several of the philosophical problems lurking at the core of modern and classical thought. The premise -- that, with the turn of each page, the reader brings self-described &quot;lovable, furry Grover&quot; closer to danger at the hands of the title monster -- allows one to question the very nature of free will and destiny. Is Grover doomed to encounter the monster? The conceit that it is the act of turning pages -- the literal act of reading itself -- that causes the ending to come about inevitably leads to the question: Would the book end differently if one _didn't_ finish reading it? On another level, TMATEOTB addresses one of the paradoxes of contemporary physics: The equality of space and time. The &quot;end of the book&quot; is an event in the future, but the monster is not spoken of as &quot;arriving&quot;, but as _already being there_. Thus, turning pages moves the reader and Grover not only forward in time, as in most traditional literature, but also forward in space, leading to the perilous End of the Book. Lastly, TMATEOTB is about how we are ultimately at the whim of the cosmic forces that shape our lives. The hapless protagonist tries again and again to stop the reader from turning pages by erecting brick walls and nailing one page to the other. His efforts are futile, but he remains unaware of his essential helplessness in the face of a Reader. Perhaps, the book says, we are ultimately doomed to fail, trapped within the pages of cosmic irony, but unable to prevent or even perceive the inevitability of our encounter with the monster. The shocking twist ending wraps up the disparate threads of the text, presenting issues of self-knowledge, the nature of fear, and the question of what it truly means to be a monster. Perhaps the failure of our quests for safety in an uncertain world isn't so bad, it argues, if it leads to a confrontation like the one depicted in _The Monster At The End Of This Book_."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"first, I should make it clear that I love this book, it was one of my favorites growing up.

This one is so cute and adorable, just like &quot;Lovable, Furry, Old Grover&quot; himself!As the adult you open the first page and instantly know the conclusion but looking at it from a child's viewpoint it is suspensefully entertaining. If you have a child that pushes books away alot I promise you he or she will NOT do that with THIS BOOK!I highly recommend this book up to age 100! It is simply hiliarious! (When I first read it in the store I cracked up laughing and people were looking at me and I didn't care!) BUY THIS BOOK! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED--I PROMISE!

We still had to read it when he came over and his parents read it to him every night(no skipping pages allowed, no matter how many times we had read it !). Both copies were completely worn out.

This book seems to be written for children, and no doubt they will enjoy it. But this is, hands down, one of the greatest, most lucid and simple books on post-modern angst I can think of. The message: We always have a fear of a painful and uncertain end, and we do whatever we can to avoid the inevitable. But, in the end, the monster is ourselves.

It's the best bucks you'll ever spend. My 17 year old high school senior daughter's class was asked to bring their favorite book from childhood to class. They had to read the books to the entire class. Of course she took this book. The entire class voted this book their favorite. Imagine an entire class of 16 & 17 year olds giggling and laughing over something they normally wouldn't be caught dead looking at. She told how her mommy would act out the voices and plead and beg them to not turn the page, and how they would beg to be allowed their turn to turn the page and see how upset Grover got with them. They would giggle and laugh and always act surprised with Grover when they found out who the monster was. As they got older they would try to comfort Grover cause he was so afraid, and reassure him the monster wouldn't hurt him. Later when my daughter imagined monsters under her bed, and for three nights in a row I couldn't get her to sleep by herself, I remembered the book and got it out and read it for her. She was actually smiling when she went to bed and looked under her bed hoping to find a monster! There's only one problem ,you need to buy several books, because we went thru three while they were growing up, and I bought four more for future grandchildren.

All the other positive reviews are correct: this is a brilliant children's book, every bit as fresh and inventive as the Sesame Street program itself.What's best about this version, as opposed to the board-book or pop-up editions, is the part on the title page, where Grover glances at the indices and mutters, \\"this is a very dull page...\\" and rushes us to the beginning.

The barriers are, of course, virtual (as even the most backward student can perceive at once). Pages are turned; barriers are shattered. The Grover feigns increased agitation: it shouts, it pleads, it issues renewed warnings of the monster. It is a calculated enticement, at once ingenious and disingenuous. Indeed the Grover is nothing less than a huckster for the apocalyptic strip-tease.But suddenly the end is reached, and the promised monster is--aha! what's this?--the Grover itself, through a trick of semiotics.No more pages lie ahead. This is a time for reflection. Behind us is still visible a trail of destroyed pages--broken lumber and scattered bricks, the remains of what turns out to be our dojo, a reminder of our recent destructive desires. And before us, hovering in the void, our previously agitated guide has been replaced by a becalmed, compassionate master.Its work is done; enlightenment is achieved. The monster and the guide have become one; the monster was us; the monster was nothing at all.

I recommend this book to all sesame street lovers."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This was one of my favourite books when I was younger. Although I am not 28 years old, I still own my copy. I've read it over the years to various children I've babysat and to my 2 boys. They ALL love the book. It's funny and makes you laugh. It also is suspenseful for the first-time reader. Great book!"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"You will never find a better book to read aloud to your toddler.The Monster at the End of This Book is an interactive adventure with Grover, who knows that something is wrong as soon as he sees the title on the cover page. \\"What did that say?\\" he asks. \\"On the first page, what did that say? Did that say there will be a MONSTER at the end of this book??? It did? Oh, I am so scared of Monsters!!!\\"As the book progresses, Grover does everything he can to prevent you from turning the page, from tying the pages down with ropes to begging. Your child will love the feeling of empowerment as he or she steamrolls Grover's objections time and time again.In the end, of course, it turns out that Grover has forgotten that he, himself is a monster, and so has nothing to fear.I've read hundreds and hundreds of picture books for children, and nothing has beaten this magical formula for laughter and interaction. You must read this book to your child."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I owned this book as a child and I still remember and cherish it.

A must have!"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I was born in 1980 and was fortunate to be around when Sesame Street was still in its prime. I, like all other 4 and 5 year olds, loved the show and had Sesame Street books, lunchboxes, and other merchandise. But this book I will always remember as being the most creative and safely suspenseful book for a young child. My mother would always read this book to my brother and I before going to bed and all three of us delighted in Grover and his precocious antics of being so scared of the monster that was awaiting him and us, the reader, at the end. And the book never got old, my mom read the story to us millions of time and it was still just as creative, fun, fresh, and a bit scary each time. I highly recommend this book to any parent with young children."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I loved this book when I was little! It stars Sesame Street's lovable blue monster Grover who has heard a rumor of a monster being at the end of this book.

But the reader will soon find out thet Grover can't stop the pages from being turned. A very enjoyable book to read."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"A classic and still completely relevant for today's Grover fan. It's one of the few books that I don't mind reading over and over and over again."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This is a fantastic book, and my favorite as a child. Its a great combination of humor and suspense followed by a happy ending. Grover spends the entire book trying to protect the reader from the monster lurking at the end of the book. He builds walls, etc and the reader just keeps on pushing... and of course, grover himself is the monster at the end. You won't be disappointed, this book is fun for adults and kids! (There's another version out there for \\"older\\" kids which is interactive, with wheels, things to pull and flip (all made of strong paper--nothing high-tech) which may make it even more fun for your child.)"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"We purchased this book to give to a friend struggling with cancer. There is so much fear about what is going to happen. The message of this book, that we are the monster at the end, seems to fit so well.

What a great memory!"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"Much to my parent's dismay, I spent hours and hours having them re-read this story to me. To their credit, they did it without a fuss- or without missing a beat on giving Grover an appropriate voice, yelling and screaming \\"YOU TURNED THE PAGE!!!\\" It's definitely one of the things that helped me learn how fun reading could be, and what has made me love reading so much today.Now, I've got a beautiful little girl of my own, and I only hope she enjoys it as much as I."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"My MIL recently gave us a few books from my husband's childhood and this book was among them.

I was so glad to find it so that my son can read it."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"We have lots of fun reading this book. I like to emphasize the strength it takes to turn the page and topple the brick wall, for instance. It's probably better to read this during the day. At night you want quiet, calm-me-down books. This book is not that.The only reason I docked it a star is because some of the pages are a little harder to read aloud because of the extra pleading and begging that Grover is doing. Not a great reason, but it's not a story so much as a monologue.I loved it as a kid and my children definitely like it now. It's filled with interesting plot obstacles (which might make a post-modernist thrilled, by the way) and the artwork is bright and colorful. Some of the words are very comic-booky.All in all, a fun romp!"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"....my parents did! I requested this book every night before I went to bed. I didn't realize at the time that my parents were not actually reading the book, but telling it by memory. Now that I have a child of my own, I remember all of the words too. My son thought he could read at 2 years old because he also had the book memorized from reading it so often. It is really that good...especially when read with feeling as if you really are Grover. Grover hears the name of the book and gets scared because there is a monster at the end of the book. He begs and pleads for you to not turn another page....but of course you have to because your child will tell you to (even if it does make Grover scared). The ending is a bit of a surprise and even young children will understand the twist."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"In a lot of ways, this is one of the most disturbing books for children ever written. First, as other reviewers have said, as even the title says, there is a monster at the end of this book.Grover, who is one of my favorite Muppets, finds out there is a monster at the end of the story, and justifiably, does not want to go there.The story unfolds, as he begs, pleads and does everything in his sweet illustrated power to stop you from turning the page.Lesson 1.- Adults don't listen to avatars of children or children. Because as much as he begs, they keep turning the pages to read the stories to their young ones. Maybe their young ones want them to completely disregard the strong feelings of lovable Grover to get to the end, maybe they don't. But it is with an illuminating callous disregard for feelings that anyone continues to read this story.The other lessons need to be learned in the reading. But I suspect that most readers miss the subtlety of one lesson. That at the end of the book, there is the monster, and you who read the book. Who's really the monster?As a look at free will, personal responsibility and how the id can easily convince the superego it's doing the right thing because it's what the reader wants to do, it's a more important book than it's given credit for being.Recommended as a start in learning about Objectivism."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I recently read The Monster at the End of This Book, by Lovable Furry Old Grover. I picked it up on a lark, figuring it would by a typical horror/thriller throwaway. It followed a pretty obvious course through the old cliches of the genre most of the way through, but the ending threw me for a shock that had me catatonic in existential malaise for weeks afterwards.NOTE: DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT IT TO BE SPOILED!!!When I found out that the monster in the book was indeed Grover I thought, \\"My god... it could be any of us.\\" Yes that's right, the narrator of the book, the kindly and gentle guide through this thrill-ride, was indeed the monster of which he spoke.This raised many, many questions. It seems from reflection that Grover himself was unaware that he was the monster. However, in the modern and postmodern likelihood of unreliable narration, it seems that it could just of easily been a clever deception by the monster, to lure the reader into his confidence before springing his trap. But the question remains. Does a monster know he is a monster? Or does his twisted logic somehow rationalize his monstrosity and allow it run rampant? Also, if this physically harmless appearance could harbor the monster of the book, doesn't that mean that anyone could be a monster? That \\"evil has no face\\" as they say?Ultimately, it brought me to reflect that one may be a monster and not even be full conscious of the fact. That one may be revealed to be monstrous, but only at the end of a mysterious and terrible life of lies."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"Don't like the fact that it's forcing me to give a review.

He's pretty \\"human\\" in that regard and I think that's why this character is so appealing to readers of all ages.If you have access to the same title in your app store, I recommend the interactive version too, it brings the pages of this book to life and Grover's voice is authentic.

This book set me up for life.)I remember turning the final page, past Grover's final adorable plea, to discover...What, you think I'm going to TELL you?!

Now I teach high school and I have some seniors who can become paralyzed by their fear of graduating and \\"turning the page.\\" I used this book to help one student see that the monster at the end of his book is only himself.

I had the Little Golden Books version, and I read it (or had it read to me) so many times, that in my first clear memories of it, it was already in tatters (real tatters, not just the drawn-on ones in the artwork). It's great to see it in now a sturdy board-book version, and I look forward to reading it to my little one."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I loved this book so much when I was little! It was the first book I was able to read on my own. One of my favorite parts is the inside cover where Grover says \\"This is a very dull page. Let us see what is on the next page\\" and then he flips out on the next page when he realizes what the name of the book means! The first time I read this book I was so scared that there would be this big scary monster at the end of the book, and now that I'm older I laugh thinking about who the 'monster' actually was how scared I was along with Grover!I love how creative and interactive this book is, with Grover trying to stop you from getting to the end of the book by building brick walls, and using rope to tie the pages together. And I remember how much I laughed whenever I turned to the next page and all of Grover's hard work would be in shambles, with Grover buried in the wreckage. I get so nostalgic thinking about this book, my favorite as a child, and still one of my favorites today! I'm 18 now and I still love this book so much!

Children will delight in Grover's growing anticipation and fear of coming into contact with the \\"monster\\" at the end of the book as well as his Herculean efforts (building brick walls, etc.) to keep the reader from continuing on. I challenge you to find the child who does not laugh hysterically while gleefully defying Grover's repeated command \\"Don't turn the page!!!\\" This timeless little story is an absolute joy for parents and children to read together."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"When we had our daughter last year, my parents gave me a box of MY childhood books, to share with her.

The book is sturdy and colorful and is a great addition to any library!"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I read this book expecting a simple children's book, buy instead found an allegorical tale of the effects of unreasonable fear run out of control in society.Grover is a blue monster, who knows there is a monster at the end of the book. He urges the reader not to turn the page, because he fears the monster that is waiting at the conclusion. His anxiety builds on every page, and the cresendo reaches a climax just before the last page. Then on the last page he discover the truth about the monster, but I do not want to give away the ending.The author does a masterful job of building suspense, and I would not be surprised to find out that the ghost writer for this book might be a famous author of some renown. The book is beautifully illustrated with full color paintings of Grover and his Sesame Steet surroundings. Some of the book's symbolism escapes me, but I've only read it once. When I have the time, I would love to read this book again."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"It's hard to trace one's love of reading to any one book, but The Monster at the End of This Book is at least, in my case, the prime suspect. It was my favorite bedtime story when I was five, a fact only partly attributable to my father's hysterical impression of Grover. It's definitely the kind of book that makes you want to have children just so you can read it to them."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"Kids love it.

Now, I don't know if you've ever had to read a book to a group of energetic kindergardeners.... but it's hard to find one that will keep them all interested. Well, last year we discovered this book, and we read it so many times that by the end of the year it had fallen apart! A truly amusing book that will keep all the kids interested and not make the reader want to vomit from saccharine sweetness or corny plots as many children's book do."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"Grover was always my favorite Sesame Street character and I always loved this book as a child.

I'm sure as she gets older and has a better understanding of what's actually going on she'll find it as funny and engaging as I do!I agree that the board book could be a bit bigger, but I don't see it as a big issue to be honest.

I read it so often that I wore it out !!!"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"My grandmother read this book to me when I was a child and I liked it a lot. Grover tries roping the pages together to keep you from flipping it, and tries to convince you not to turn the pages so you don't get to the monster. Not to spoil it -- I assume this is an adult audience -- but the monster at the end is Grover himself.If your child is five years-old or older, I recommend saying, &#34;Well, he says not to turn the page! I guess we can't finish!&#34; Then the child should turn the page anyway.

Grover reacts to each turn of the page.

BUY IT NOW!!"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"In all honesty I don't like Grover from Sesame Street. I can't really say why but he really irks me. However I love this book! From the fact that he is on the copy write page urging young readers to turn away from the boring part to his (over) reactions to each page turn. This book is best read doing sound effects and pretending to have trouble turning the pages as Grover chains and bricks up the pages. I wish the board book was exactly like the thin paper version but other than that this book is a great but for your money."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"Grover is more than a little nervous - after all, there's a MONSTER at the end of the book. So, he enacts all kinds of zaniness like gluing the pages together in order to keep (protect) YOU (not him!!) from the monster at the end of the book.This is the only book I remember my dad reading to me - EVER. (Probably because I asked for it a million times!!) He would act the parts out and change his voice and I would roll on the floor with laughter. When it came to Grover's antics, my dad would pretend that the pages really *were* stuck together. He'd grunt and groan and s-l-o-w-l-y turn the pages.I read it to my kids - my children and students alike - in the same manner. And you know what? Everyone rolls on the floor giggling. Everyone has a good time.I highly recommend this one - it is a great story about the wacky ways we devise to avoid what we think we fear. BUT, it is also a great way to build memories that will last forever with your children."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"Grover is one of the cutest characters in the Seasme Street gang and this proves to be his best showing ever. I read this book over and over again as a child, and I still find it amusing to read now. Being 18, this would not seem like a book high on my reading list, but it is. There is a great suspense for any child, and to see who the monster is at the end of this book, you'll just have to read it for yourself!"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This book is in some of my earliest memories!

Children of all ages will enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"My English students in Korea enjoy the change of pace from the usual drudgery of learning English as a foreign language. The passages printed in large type are relatively easy for them, so they are quite willing to spend five or ten minutes being tested on those passages.The book also supplies comic relief. The middle school students find it mildly amusing, the elementary school students find it moderately amusing, and the preschool students roll on the floor."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This book combines three elements that make for a great children's book: suspense, a loveable character, and audience participation. Kids love the wacky situations Grover ends up in as he tries at all costs to avoid the MONSTER AT THE END OF THIS BOOK. A great addition to any picture book collection."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"What a wonderful book! As I expect my first child, I am remembering the best stories and experiences of my own childhood. This is definitely one of them! I can remember my aunts reading this book to me over and over again and reading it to my younger brothers. Teaches kids in a fun way that fear of the unknown nearly always ends up being self manufactured and nothing to worry about. Maybe that's why we all love it."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This is a great book. My dad was reading it to me for as long as I can rembember.

I loved it as a child, and still get excited as I read it (aloud of course!) It was the first book I ever bought for my younger cousins, and they loved having me read it to them. My friends in Argentina also got a kick out of having me read it to them, even though it was in english... my excitement was enough to make it worth while! A definite must have for anyone's library.

Makes for lots of extra giggles."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This has always been my favorite childrens book!!

I bought it 20 years ago for my son. Sesame Street isn't as popular as it was then, too many other options, but my grandchildren do know Kermit, Big Bird, Miss Piggy & now they know who Grover is. This book is one of those great books, like The Little Engine That Could, that you, the reader can vocalize as much as you want - it is best when you let yourself be silly and show expression in your voice - especially for the young who may be afraid of a monster, at first. I also appreciated the board book as opposed to the paper one I bought long ago and was read so many times, even after the pages tore. They still can't go in the tub, but hopefully this book will last through Logan's baby brother and still be readable when Logan can read it to him!"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"It's great to get them to try and turn the page, since Grover keeps saying not to...There are far too few self-referential books of this quality.

It is a great metaphor for the journey inward. It is also SUPER fun to read to kids. You can play with the pages and act like they are really hard to turn or have the kids decide if we should listen to Grover's pleas or forge ahead. And bonus points with the kids if you can do a good Grover voice. I always get hoarse because the kids want to read it over and over.

When I first tried to show it to him, he was I think about 3 or 4 months old - he wasn't very interested. However, once at 6 months, he started to show more interest & would look at the pages as I turned them - within a few weeks, he was clearly listening to me telling the story, looking at the pictures & turning the pages himself.

If you read to groups of small children, this is a must-have in your collection. On our first read, they were a little apprehensive about what they would find at the end of the book but after they discover who it is, they love it and love having the book reread to them knowing the ending. I couldn't recommend this book more highly."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"my kids absolutely love this book. i have to say that i love it too because it's easy to imitate grover's voice and my kids just crack up. i feel like a great mother for making my kids laugh and sending them to bed with such wonderful thoughts of us together."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I can remember sitting around and having this book read to me as a child.

The surprise ending is still AWESOME!! :) even to this day."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"The Monster at the End of This Book is a fun, engaging book that will be read over and over. Although I am usually skeptical of any book with a brand-name character in it, this book really pulls off something great.The key element that makes this book fun to read is the interaction between the reader/listener and Grover. Grover is terrified of the monster at the end of the book and is prepared to do anything to keep you from getting there. Any child reading this book is going to be dying to turn the page.This book also teaches a great message for kids. Sometimes, we get really scared of the monster we think is waiting for us, but then it turns out that the monster isn't so bad after all. This would be a great book for any child dealing with a monster-under-the-bed phobia, or even any kind of unjustified fears.This book gets a solid 5 stars from me for it's fun and creative illustrations, great plot, great message, and engaging humor. I would highly recommend this as an addition to any home library."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I read this as a child, and now I'm reading it to my child.

I try to use the Grover voice and get all intense like him, which sends them over the top. As for me, I do get bored sometimes with the repetition. But it is actually worth it in the end. It's also fun to see kids grow up and start to understand it better."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I remember reading this to my son when he was 4 yrs old, now he's 41. It's a wonderful book, and if you can make your voice sound like Grover's, it's something a child will remember."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This book is an absolute \\"hoot.\\" There isn't a ton of text, but what is there has been printed in a way to give intonation so when the child has the book memorized, he/she can simply turn the page, glance at the text, and know exactly if the words should be shouted out or whispered. Also, the illustrations are great as Grover's face tells exactly how he feels. It diminishes the fear of a \\"Monster\\" while keeping the listeners giggling. It is a short story, so it easily keeps the interest of preschoolers and early primary students. This is definitely a favorite at our house."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I got this book from the library for my 3yr daughter along with a bunch of other books.

Similar concept to Monsters, Inc. movie - teaches children not to be afraid of monsters. Helps with the 'afraid of the dark' phase. Only thing is it's a small Goldenbook.

Spend a couple dollars more and buy the big version."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"Yes, I had to buy two of these.

Utterly Adorable!

For years I looked for this book. I finally gave up a few years ago. Well, a couple of weeks ago I found a copy in my cousin's toy box! I was so excited I decided to look for it again. Now I've found it. I would reccommend this book for every child (and even a few adults) It is a wonderful story with a wonderful surprise ending"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This is one of my favorite books from childhood. I recently bought a copy at a yard sale and discovered that some of the details of the story were missing. Little golden books come in 32 page varieties (rarely anymore) and the more common 24 page variety. I suspected that the one I had as a child was a 32 page version. I promptly began searching for other people that remembered the missing details. I was delighted to find several people that agreed with me. (YAY! That means I'm not crazy! LOL) I then started searching for a copy of the story with the missing pages included. This listing claimed to have 32 pages! I was thrilled!! But, alas, it only had 24. :(I'm still delighted with the book. Since the little boy that I babysit has discovered it, and loves it, I sent this copy home with him. :)I'm still looking for a 32 page version (There was a steel door in it). But I was still happy to be able to share this adorable story with my new little friend. :)"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"Normally I steer clear of books about TV characters because of their low story quality. This story, however, is a hilarious page-by-page running joke, in which Grover, after reading the title, begs the reader not to turn the pages because he is afraid of meeting the monster. He erects barriers to page-turning which are destroyed as pages are turned, and when the last page is turned he discovers that he is the monster referred to in the title.The humor turns on the fact that the author draws attention to the book context of interaction by having Grover directly address the reader, and by depicting physical objects ostensibly intended to block the pages from turning. Children will tremendously enjoy the feeling of knowing something Grover doesn't know, and will savor the situation comedy of Grover's failed attempts to resist their overwhelming page-turning force. The story ends with a moment of delicious irony in which Grover claims \\"I told you and told you there was nothing to be afraid of,\\" but then his thought bubble appears: \\"Oh, I am so embarrassed.\\"This book does come in a board book format, but by the time a child is ready for this level of humor they will have outgrown board books, so I recommend the paper version."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"True story - at the preschool I attended someone had ripped out the last page (a secret so good they couldn't share it? too much excitement over the build up and resolution? I guess I'll never know). So for years and years I never knew how this book ended. To tell the truth I had completely forgotten all about it until one day I was out picking up some books and I saw Grover's happy little blue face and wide eyes staring out at me from across the room where he had been wedged in among the other LGBs. Picking it up I started flipping through the pages again and finally, finally, 20 long years later, found out what surprise had been waiting for me all along.I'm not sure what kind of reaction I should have expected, but what I got was pure joy. Looking down at the last picture of my favorite blue monster, hearing it in my head just as he would have said it, filled me with a kind of pure, giddiness that I haven't felt in a long time. Sesame Street to me will always be the perfect place of happiness and harmony and I want to share that with my own kids. I just made sure to buy multiple copies this time lest something unspeakable befall the last page again."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I think this is the 5th copy \\"I\\" have had, if you count the copies shared with brothers and cousins growing up. They were all loved to death. When I received this as a gift for my children, I was so pleased to see the binding is so much more durable than the other copies I have had. Let the squeals of delight and head shaking at Grover's silliness roll; we will be reading this one over and over for years."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This was my favorite book as a child. I loved it so much, I thought the standard Little Golden Book would make a nice stocking stuffer at 4 bucks a pop, for friends and family of any age. Then I stumbled on this... the BIG Little Golden Book. I did buy a \\"backup\\" copy of my original a while back, but had no idea there was a BIG version. So, in my 40's, I am here to say I bought this for myself, my big hands, and any time a monster in my life scares me, I will have this riveting resource at hand."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This really is a classic. I remember buying this book from the supermarket over 35 years ago and it was one of my favorite early readers. I bought this a few years ago and my toddler and pre-schooler both love the book (especially when I talk like Grover). The book has nearly perfect English grammar and it covers the subject of unsubstantiated fears.It is good silly fun, but well written and well loved in our family."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"Being the father of five children (my wife pregnant with twins), we have many books that rotate in and out of their lives; however, there is only one book that is continually requested at bedtime. To date this book, which was also mine as a child, is barely holding together. The pages are frail and the back cover is missing from years of enjoyment and use. The timeless book is called, \\"The Monster at the End of this Book\\" written by Jon Stone and stars lovable, furry old Grover from Sesame Street.As stated previously there are many children's books in our library; but, this one seems to have captured their hearts the most. I believe this is the case because the book does an exceptional job of breaking the fourth wall and bringing the reader into the story.Upon opening the beginning of the story Grover asks the question, \\"What did that say? On the first page (referring to the book title), what did that say? Did that say there will be a Monster at the end of this book??? IT DID? Oh I am so scared of Monsters!!!\\" Already the reader is captivated; feeling like Grover is speaking directly to you. From the first page the fourth wall is immediately broken and Grover has invited us into his world instead of readers being mere observers of his story.The following page Grover exclaims his fear of monsters and pleads the reader not to turn any more pages. He determines that if pages stop being turned then it will be impossible to reach the end of the book; not bad problem solving for a Muppet. After his plea you reach what is now the third page in the book. Here Grover is in a shouting stance, arms over his eyes and the words YOU TURNED THE PAGE; are largely written with multiple exclamations. This is the moment in the story where my children giggle with laughter that Grover is so distraught over the book being read. The remainder of the book continues this formula. He pleads with the reader not to continue and does everything from tying pages together with rope to building a brick wall to stop the reader from continuing. With each turn of pages poor Grover shouts in fear that the end of the book will be reached and the children laugh harder and enjoy seeing his typical over-the-top reactions with each failure to stop the book from being read.When the end of the book is finally reached after all of Grover's antics.....well I guess you will have to discover that on your own.The Monster at the End of this Book is a captivating story. It has a unique plot and focus of writing. The banter that happens between Grover and the reader is unlike anything that has been written before or since. It keeps readers wondering what really is at the end of the book and furthermore it is fun to watch Grover come up with new schemes to stop the reader from continuing. His reactions are typical of his character on the television show and the ways words are written when he is frustrated are smart. For example, Grover cries out, \\"YOU TURNED ANOTHER PAGE! You do not know what you are doing to me! Now STOP TURNING PAGES!\\" This text alone conveys his frustration coupled with fear; however, the choice to add large yellow and orange colors to his words with lightning bolts stemming from his dialogue cloud truly show the children his anxiety in reaching the end of the book.On the other hand, this book is not much of a read. Totaling 12 pages (most being large font), one will find the book will fly through in less than five minutes. What I have personally discovered is that the children who know how to read, find the book disinteresting once they acquire the reading skill. However, children who cannot read find it hilarious and the pages eye catching, this also means an adult is needed to read the story for them. Again, this means the book is completed in a matter of minutes. My four year old son adores this book the most. He and I usually do two to three readings of it in a single setting. Again because of the shortness of the book he enjoys reciting the book back to me on the third go around, all from memory.The other downside is that the book has challenging words in it which deter young readers. Words such as embarrassed, terrible and understand are used. It proves that the book is written for entertainment purposes only and is not written to educate or meet its reader's level of comprehension. When a young reader gets to an age of finally being confident in their reading (around age six) those words used frequently in the book become too difficult and it makes them not want to continue the story. It also causes the book to come to a sudden halt when the large eleven character words arrive. This makes the reader pause, try to sound out the words and eventually results in asking a parent what that particular word is.Overall, this is a very unique and entertaining book. It has captured hundreds of children (such as myself) since it was originally authored more than 20 years ago. The book does an amazing job of pulling the reader in by making them feel the story is progressed by their hand. It is a very smart and a very fun book to read with children, especially if you can master a Grover voice. The downside is the larger words and duration. Truth be told, I am not sure there is anything I would specifically change because although intimidating to younger readers it really is a lot of fun to experience. It may not be a book that has the educational seal of approval; but, it is a perfect book to show children the joy and value books can bring. It is remarkable at capturing imagination and letting the readers be the ones to experience Grover's world. From the first page, one can't help ask the protruding question, what is the monster at the end of the book?"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I don't want to ruin the ending of the book for anyone, but I'm just going to say two words and leave it alone.\\"Shutter Island\\".Mind BLOWN."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"This Grover, this fine avatar of sublime enthusiasm, this sincerely furred monster, speaks to the reader in fine artistic print drawn by Jon Stone of his delight in reading; of the danger of turning pages; of his raw emotional response to the approaching end of the book. I read; I reread; I am undone.The fact that this book has been continuously in print for three decades is testament to the secret that children know: turning pages is a tactile delight. Monster at the end of this book? We do not want to see it, because we have been told that monsters are bad. And yet. And yet.The page is delicious, Grover appearing both near and far, his words rendered in impossible unrestrained fonts that the artist, not the computer, has spread into and outside the margins of this stiff little book. The plot, the metaplot, rely on our participation as readers, and as parents (as readers-to-nonreaders) to construct the experience of overcoming fear. This is a bildungsroman that we the parent ask our child to write anew every night.As an artefact of the lurid seventies book-macher culture, Monster persists on the plane of \\"book\\" because it has germinated autodidactic readers-as-readers-to. Workers in the literary genre of bed, bedtime, bedroom and juvenile fiction were influenced by Stone's work and have in the majority of cases reproduced (biologically and in their own works) solely for the purpose of rereading this book to their own children. This is biology as \\"beard\\", a self-replicating viral meme that influences our species to replicate so that this book may catapault to one more metalevel of cultural influence and conquer the dimension of time; incubated in the restrictive zone of \\"bedtime\\" this metameme has demolished the project of the deconstructionists, eliding the impossibility of communication from the de facto reality of the presomnial ritual.That said, I love this book."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I was delighted to see this book still in print.

Each time Grover begs the reader not to turn the page because that will bring us closer to the monster at the end of the book, my granddaughter has a big smile when I ask whether we should turn the page, and she enthusiastically turns it.The ending of the book teaches children a valuable lesson, namely, that sometimes they are afraid of things that really turn out not to be scary at all.

If you are looking for a small board book, I recommend the Eye Book or Mr. Brown Can Moo instead.Update...Around 19 months he got into this one and at 20 months it was his fav.

We wore out at least 2 copies, possibly 3! Now my grandsons are loving it just like their mom!The rule was whomever read it had to read \\"expressively.\\" The child is in charge of turning pages. Grover must sound exasperated (in a LOUD voice) when the child turns the page against his orders. Hearing your child laughing each time is joyful music!In contrast on the last page of the book Grover must sound very embarassed & speak more & more quiet until the very last word.Every child I've ever read it to wants it read repeatedly. They end up knowing the story by heart & help tell the story. It's delightful to see a preschooler with the book (sometimes upside down:) ) telling his version of the story.If the reader didn't read it properly the child would, with a similar Grover exasperated tone, take the book away & find someone who would!I see it's available as an E-book. I will never own this book in any format but print. An E-book cannot effectively substitute the effect you get from turning the printed paper page.I highly recommend this book to anyone with children in their life or in need of a child's gift."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"My girls and I love this book.

She is at that stage right now where everything is scary and a Monster issue.But because you are able to read this story with so much heart and in typical Grover excitable fashion, it is easy to turn the meaing of the words into something fun.Each child is different. Mine was not thrilled with the ending.She was worried that Grover is THE monster.Was he okay? She wanted to know. Is he still scared?But now having read this book more then one time and showing my own excitment about it and telling her that it is a joke, a sweet story, it does put her at easte some.Guess she will appreciate it when she is a bit older.Till then I am excited to readEnjoy"},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"The story is engaging and my daughter really enjoys the anticipation of what will happen next."},{"Title":"The monster at the end of this book (A little golden book)","review":"I had this book when I was growing up,I bought it for my son when he was young and now I have bought another for my daughter.

It gives one a great overview of what the internet is and how it works. The book then proceeds to explain the basics of HTML and how to plan out a website in very comprehensive and understandable language. After the first three chapters, you have to skip ahead to find out how to effectively prepare and add graphics to your pages. In between, there are chapters dealing with building websites on Geocities or using Yahoo PageBuilder or Netscape Composer to actually build your site. The problem I had is that everything is really geared to PC - Window based users. I have a MAC and there is really nothing in the author's approach to show that things change and that there are differences between the MAC and PC platforms and how pages may appear.The last third of the book deals with eBay listings and Blogs. The section about eBay is pretty extensive, giving the reader all sorts of helpful information about everything from finding items to sell to preparing effective graphics to post to pricing and effective ad copy writing. If interested in opening an eBay store, this is a great resource to turn to. Again, the authors explain things thoroughly and in an easy to read manner.Finally, there is a section about Blogs, which was interesting, since I have never really had a clear understanding of what a Blog was. So while helpful, not something I am interested in creating.Overall, the book is good for a beginner with a PC. It is excellent if you want to sell on eBay. If you are a MAC user, I'd recommend finding another book."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This book wasn't bad, but it wasnt as good as \\"Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging.\\" This book was lacking some character development, but other than that it was great..."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This is the best book for any teenagers or adults who thought Bridget Jones's Diary was boring as a book, but funny as a movie.

She's clueless sometimes. She's cranky much of the time. She thinks her parents are from another planet and gets fed up with her friends, whom she thinks are unbelievably selfish--though they are just like her.The twist here is that Georgia's parents have decided to move from England to New Zealand. Tragedy! Not when she's just gotten a boyfriend! The book follows Georgia's efforts to try to dissuade her parents, keep her sister out of her room, get her wacko cat Angus off her leg, and maintain a beautifully rendered teenage relationship with the hunkalicious Robbie.

Like the first one, I read the entire novel, which is written as a series of diary entries from Georgia, in a few hours, frequently laughing out loud as a I did so.A sort of junior &quot;Bridgett Jones' Diary,&quot; &quot;On The Bright Side,&quot; picks up where &quot;Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging&quot; left off, with Georgia the girlfriend of a &quot;sex god&quot; (17-year-old Robbie) with whom she's gone to &quot;number six on the snogging scale&quot; (French kissing). But Georgia's romantic bliss doesn't last long as Robbie promptly decides his new love is too young for him and takes up with his ex, &quot;Wet Lindsay.&quot;Desperate to get Robbie back, while avoiding a dreaded move to New Zealand and keeping her Mum from falling for the new &quot;young George Clooney&quot; look-alike doctor at the surgery, Georgia consults &quot;Men Are From Mars and Women Are From Venus&quot; for advice as well as her friend Jas.If you are now or ever have been a teenage girl, you'll love this terrifically funny book!

It follows the diary of 14-year-old Georgia Nicolson, the average British teen. Well, if you call a girl who carries her lunch in her beret, has a cat who holds up the neighbors in their greenhouse, and a little sister who leaves her dirty nappies in her bed average.

I read it in less than 3 hours from the moment it arrived on my front step from the UPS man. It's the continuation of Georgia's struggles with life and love and the threat of moving to New Zealand due to the fact that her &quot;Vati&quot; can't get a job in England. There is more snogging, more of Wet Lindsay's thongs, and way more Angus. Anyone who loved the first one will devour this one just as fast. It is the sequel of sequels."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This has to be among the worst books I have read- sorry to say it, but it is...I enjoyed 'Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging', so I figured that it would be fun to read this sequel. Boy, was I wrong. In the first book in the series, Georgia was a pleasantly quirky, self-involved teenage girl. She reminded me of several girls I knew in middle school. In that book she was actually fairly realistic and interesting.The Georgia in this book is exactly the same, except she isn't as quirky and is 150% more self-involved. I found her to be a complete brat and if she was someone I knew in real life, I would avoid her at all costs.While this book is pretty funny and amusing, it is definitely not a great piece of literature. The characters are one-dimensional and I really did not care about any of them except for Georgia's cat, Angus, who reminded me of a dog I used to have. And, the plot was thin and unrealistic.Maybe it's just me, but a good book needs to have a strong, interesting plotline. It must also have characters the reader can relate to and care about. But, then again maybe that's just me.Ok, I'm done. Sorry if this didn't make sense, it was pretty much just a collection of my scattered thoughts on the book. Feel free to call this 'unhelpful' if you couldn't understand it or are a huge fan of the book. ;)"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Georgia is like a typical 14 year old who likes someone so much that they cant tell the difference between lust and love. She likes the SG (Sex God a.k.a Robbie). Her friend Jan likes the SG's brother and, Jan tells him how Georgia likes Robbie. She cant tell if she has love for him of if it is another crush. When Robbie decides that he is too old for her, Robbie breaks up with Georgia. She did not like it to much so, Georgia's way of making the SG jealous she goes out with a guy named Dave. In which she calls him \\"Dave the laugh\\". Well when she finds out that it really does not bother Robbie and that he is talking to his ex girlfriend, she gets mad a dumps Dave. Dave did not take it really well. Well we cant forget to mention Georgia's little sister Libby, who shoves Barbie and other things in Georgia's' bed. The cat Angus, is still causing trouble with the neighbors and their poodles. Angus supposedly had the neighbors held up in their green house, and the neighbors had the cops come and get the cat. Her dad Vati, is coming back home from New Zealand. In the end she does not move to New Zealand, what Georgia calls Kiwi - a - Gogo.I liked the book it seemed really original and it used a lot of British terms so I learned new words and it describes what really goes on in a teenagers mind. It also captures the real drama that is in a teenager's life also."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"A book review by Megan Seeds onOn the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex Godby Louise Rennisonfor the seventh hour English class of Mr. Tom FeltieGeorgia Nicolson seems to be just another normal protagonist from yet another diary-style book. She's got a mom, dad, sister, uncle and cat who all seem to be parts of this teenage, English girl's life. But, this family isn't so close to standard after all. Considering her language and vocabulary are all authentic British aphorisms, her sister is near 'mad,' her uncle is 'bald as an egg in leather pants' (in fact Libby calls him 'Eggy' at one point), her cat (Angus) has the body and 'ferociocity' of a large bulldog (he tries to eat Mr. and Mrs. Next Door's poodles and yet he lets Libby drag him around with out mauling her hand), and her parents are... well...you know, they're perfectly stereotypical parents.All this adds up to make a book of confessions full of 'hilariocity.' To me, at least. Because of the type of humor in On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God, it would not be very suitable for any audience over the age of eighteen, under the age of ten and not of the female gender. This fact makes the book less desirable to me. That fact also discourages me to encourage others to read it.I feel that at my age, I should be reading novels that will help me on the path to the great schools I hope to attend; this book wouldn't really help me in that area. Although it would help one who needed to know about teenage life in the united kingdom, it doesn't help many others. After I read it I felt less mature because of some of the scatological humor that the book includes.Overall, it was a very fun book and a good read. But, it is not apropos for a very diverse audience. If you want to learn something out of what you read, On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God is not for you. (Sorry!) But if you want a quickly moving book that will make you laugh (and you are a 10 to 17 year old girl) you are sure to enjoy On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God. (Did I mention I liked the book?)"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This sequel leaves off exactly where the first book left us.

Not quite as funny as the first one; I got the impression that the author tried a tad to hard. However, it still has all the charms of Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging. Very good, and, still, very funny. Worth reading, trust me."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Georgia is back and this time she is finally dating the Sex God.... She is happy with her life to a point but freaking out because in just a few week she and her family is suppose to be moving to what Georgia calls Kiwi-a-gogo or New Zealand.From the start Georgia is trying to figure out any possible way to stay back home and be around Robbie or her friends, but she starts to realize that it won't be a possiblity. That is till things take a twist. She loses something importment to her, but she also finds out that she isn't moving away.From here Georgia trys everything in her ways to get the one things she wants more in life back. The ways she trys things is funny and made me laugh because I can actullly see a young girl doing these things in order to get the one thing in life they want back.Overall I can't wait for the next book about Georgia."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"I personally enjoyed this book a great deal. It has so many emotions that many teenagers go through crammed into one little book. A lot of it was hilarious and real. I could kind of relate to Georgia, the main character.There were numerous parts that I thought were the best. I especially liked how Georgia and Robbie got back together in the end. I also like the creativity of Georgia's plan to make Robbie notice her. And her attempt to get back together with him.Throughout the book I could picture everything. It was all so vivid, and I had my own idea of what everything looked like. The characters were described really well according to Georgia's eye, and I knew the plot was well thought of. The conflict was definately believable, and how she tries to solve it is funny."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Even as a 40+ year old, I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging. I read the first before placing it in a middle school library and knew right away it would be a hit with the teen crowd, but I also recommended it to several adults. As soon as I knew the next installment was available, I ordered it immediately. The sequel manages to maintain the originality and charm of the first. Georgia's quite a girl--a typical teen, but with a dry sense of humor and an ability to poke fun at herself. The supporting cast returns in full force--Robbie,AKA the Sex God, her friends, family, and of course, Angus who, in this book, suffers along with Georgia through the throes of love. Just as in the first, I found myself laughing out loud, finally giving way to tears. All in all, this is a delightful book that can be enjoyed, certainly by its' intended teen audience, but also by a slightly older crowd."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Oh, to be young again! Reading On the Bright Side had much the same effect on me as its predecessor, Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging. It was totally reminiscient of my by-gone days; if fact, I pulled out my old high school diaries and laughed myself silly. Georgia is the epitome of a typical 14-year-old high school student, British or otherwise, and readers of all ages will most definitely relate to this wonderful character.This time around, Georgia has landed the Sex God, aka Robbie, boy of her dreams. But with his being almost 18, the relationship is short-lived and he breaks up with her via letter. Well, of all things! Georgia just will NOT stand for this. Thus ensues Operation Elastic Band, Georgia's no-fail plan to get Robbie back. The results are, as expected, spectacularly funny as only Georgia can offer.Readers will no doubt have a great time with this novel - it's just plain, harmless fun. Complete with hilarious observations and sparking with classic British humor, On the Bright Side is unforgettable. I cannot say enough good things. Clear a space on your bookshelf for this one."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Georgia is like any other 14 year old - which is why I realized that this author had practically written a book about me! Louise Rennison's writing is easy to read and she presents the characters in such a way that you can relate to them instantly. After I read Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging, I went on amazon.com every day to see when the second one was coming out and waited in anguish for a week for my book to come. All I can say is read this book! I thought it was even funnier than the first one, and my only complaint is that it should have taken place over a whole year, like the first one. Georgia's further adventures with the Sex God, wet Lindsay, Jas, etc. will make you laugh so hard that you'll cry. If you laugh a lot, don't read it in school - I had to bite my hand to keep from laughing, and in my next class I fell off my chair. So, just read this hilarious sequel and try not to roll off the bed, get in trouble, or experience any other side effects of the book."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"For those who do not understand the simple importance of my title, let me educate and elaborate.'On the Bright Side' is the second installment of Louise Rennison's series, which is centred on the fifteen year old Georgia Nicolson, a British girl who can't help but have a less than ordinary existence. Written diary-style, the book chronicles all her problems with her mother and father, Mutti and Vati, her slightly mad sister Libby, her half wildcat half...something cat Angus, and everyone in between. It starts off exactly where the first book ended, with her parents telling her their moving plans to Whangamata (New Zealand), her Sex God boyfriend's dumping her because she was too young, and her 'basooma' issues, just to name a few.5:35 p.m.Oh yippee.This is my gorgeous life.1) I haven't been kissed for a month;my snogging skills will soon be gone.2)I have a HUGE nose that means I have to live for ever in the Ugly Home.

While Georgia is not with Robbie the Sex God, she is with Dave the Laugh, who is totally sweet and likes her a lot. She dumps him because she thinks her \\"red herring\\" plan is failing. He is totally heart- broken, but, of course, she gets back with Robbie the Sex God, who sounds really hot. While all this is happening, her very large and insane cat Angus is trying to eat the poodle next door, her three year old sister Libby is hiding her knickers in Georgia's bed, and her dad (Vati) is returning from Kiwi- a -Gogo land (New Zealand).

Well, I wasn't too impressed. Sure, the book is charming like its predecessor, but I just didn't find myself laughing as hard this time. What made the difference?First, I think the novelty wore off. You can only hear so much of this strange teenage slang before it begins to sound forced and silly. Second, I wasn't pleased with the way the whole New Zealand issue was handled. I would have liked to see Georgia's adventures in \\"Kiwi-a-gogo\\" land, as she calls it. However, I can see why the family never went. The author obviously didn't know enough about New Zealand to properly write about it; this is evident in the continuous stereotypes about New Zealand: people sitting around eating bugs, geothermal vents that apparently burst from the ground and injure people on a regular basis. Give me a break. Third, Georgia is unlikeable in this book. She's rather mean to her friends, and seems to be getting dumber as she progresses through school (one would expect that a British teenager her age would know that Sweden is not on the other side of the world). Did I miss something? She doesn't seem to be quite the same character she was before.I'm still planning on reading the third book in the series, but I can only hope that it is better than this second foray into Georgia Nicolson's life."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"&quot;On the Bright Side&quot; is the daily diary of the (mis)adventures of Georgia Nicholson, typical teenage girl.

Life isn't always easy for Georgia, with a &quot;half-girl, half-turnip&quot; best friend who is dating the SG's younger brother.....a sister who embarrasses her on every occasion....a mom who repeatedly takes Georgia to the george-clooney-like doctor even though she isn't sick....and a school where a little prank means a lot of trouble! In this book you'll meet Dave the Laugh, a funny and charming guy who is JUST a red herring to Georgia...or is he more?"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"I read the book On the Brightside I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God. When my teacher first recommended the book to me, I was a little skeptical because I thought it would be a bit too girlish, and I was right! As they say in the book, \\"What in the name of pantyhose\\" was I doing reading On the Brightside, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God.The book is about a girl, Georgia Nicolson, and her adventures trying to stay/get back with Robbie AKA the Sex God. Meanwhile, Georgia is dealing with having to move to New Zealand, trying to make Robbie jealous, and her conversion to Buddhism after G-d wouldn't give her what she wanted.Although I didn't like the book very much, some parts were very comical and entertaining. My favorite part was the first 50 pages because i found them very funny. When I read this part, I thought I would like the book, but I became tired of Georgia's girlish ways and her constant thinking of boys. Another thing I liked about the book was when I didn't know some English English \\"lingo\\", I could refer to the glossary at the back of the book. The glossary contains words such as nuddy-pants,(nude colored pants)fag, (cigarette of course)and snogging.(kissing)I give this book two stars out of five because nunga-nungas, gorgy boys, and the snogging of a Sex God are just not my bag. However, I do recommend this book to all girls because I think they'll \\"fancy\\" it!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This book really bugged me. Yes, I giggled at some of the funny stuff (Angus and Libby are great), but come on--the plot is thin to nonexistent, the parent-kid relationships are appalling, the way the supposed friends treat each other is awful, and worst of all, the obsession with sexual activity is scary.Do people really think it's OK for a 14-year old girl to be sneaking out to clubs, parks, friend's homes, so she can make out with boys??!?I think Georgia is shallow, dim-witted, and self-centered. She has made the classic mistake of thinking that just because boys like to kiss her and feel her up, they like *her*.Georgia is every stereotype about girls we don't want kept alive: nasty to her friends, stupid, and convinced that sex with boys is the most important thing in her life.C'mon, girls, there are a million other books to read with *real* girls as main characters.Parents: talk with your daughters about the attitudes in this book. Just because it says it's for 12 year-olds doesn't mean it's what you want your 12-year old thinking she could be."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This book is good. Its fun and an easy read. Its by far pretty entertaning, i even found myself laughing out loud through out the book. And the dictionary in the back is alotta fun. I recomend the whole series to just about everyone. The only think i could of done with out, was the level off maturaty i found in Georgia but then again she was about what... 13/14? i think in this book, but it tends to get a litle annoying. but over all i think this is a great book, and i had alotta fun reading this one along with the whole series."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"I have read some reviews in which the reviewers said they couldn't relate to the lifestyle of Georgia. As a genuine Brit-chick I can confirm that, in my experience, this is very true to life. Me and my friends do so many of the things that are written about in this book, it's like it was written about us. So it's not some insane tale written by a deluded mad-woman - unfortunately, people like this do exist. But whether or not you are living the full frontal dream in real life, this book is hilarious. It's just so funny. Nothing has ever been as funny as this book. Nothing ever will be.But I have one complaint. This title is fiendishly bad. In the U of K, we like to call it 'It's OK, I'm Wearing Really Big Knickers'. On returning from an American holiday, one of my pals reported to us the shocking title-changing that had occured. If I were you, I'd import a copy, because the title is part of the beauty of the book. But basically, just read it."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Another hilarious book continuing the story begun with Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging. The British have always been great with humor (or should I say humour) and this is no exception. A Bridget Jones with a teenage protaganist.

It only gets better as the series continues!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Georgia's back again, manic and self-obsessed as ever, but this time, it seems like things are actually going to work for her.

Then, out of the blue, Robbie dumps her because \\"she's too young for him,\\" and Georgia finds herself back at square one.This is a fine book, and Georgia is certainly a memorable and distinct character, though not always the most likeable one. She's not particularly the best friend she could be to Jas, whom Georgia likes to enjoy baiting more than anything. And in both this and the first book, there's some disturbing activities happening in the background with Georgia's mom and doctors/interior decorators while dear old dad's out of the country. But hey, how could Georgia concentrate on things like that when she's got to convince Robbie she's mature enough to date??! An easy to read, realistic, funny book."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read -- I couldn't stop laughing.

Georgia has started dating the Sex God (a.k.a Robbie) and her parents are planning to move to New Zealand (which she has aptly named \\"Kiwi a go-go Land\\").The story kicks off with Gee (Georgia) arguing with her mum about moving and the police stopping by in the middle of the night because Angus (their cat; the horror of the neighborhood, approx. the size of a small labrador) was terrorizing next door's poodles.Georgia can get no peace. With a move that doesn't happen and the Sex God braking it off. Gee creates \\"Plan Herring\\" to get the SG back.

There's really not any better way to describe it. as a teenager, you feel you can identify with her or feel her pain. it's just a really good book."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"For my English class book project, I chose \\"On The Bright Side...\\" by Louise Rennison to read. The main character in this book is a teenage girl named Georgia Nicholson who lives in England. Georgia is a semi-popular at her private school (Stalg 14 as she calls it), and has very funny and supportive friends which she calls the \\"Fabs\\". The Fab Gang includes: Rosie, Ellen, Jools, and Georgia's best friend Jas. The girls make trouble and many memeories throughout the book, and provide lots of comic releif for the reader. The plot of this book is for Georgia to snag her dream guy Robbie,A.K.A the \\"Sex God\\". The only problem is, the \\"Sex God\\" is 18, and not interested in girls who are 4 years younger than him. In this book, Georgia must make herslef irresistible and attractive to get back together with Robbie. She uses a boy named \\"Dave the Laugh\\" as a red herring to make Robbie jeaulous. And of course, you'll have to read the book to find out how this hilarious sequel turns out!!By Mariquita Reese"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"I thought that this book was a great book. Some of my likes were that she always had a different point of view on everything. Another like about this book was that she seems so real, as if she was a real live human being. You never know she could be real or just an image in a lot of people's heads. Some of my dislikes were that she used her own different language and I know a lot of people tend to speak in there own languages. Her's was very confusing until you get to the end of the book where it gives the definition of all of her different words."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This has way more laughs and is more entertaining then the first! You have to buy it!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"I absolutley adore this book!! It's so awesome! First of all Georgia Nicolson is so cool, (just not when she's around Robbie (a.k.a Mr. Sex God)) she's so funny, and she has the wierdest cat known to man (actually it's not just a cat it's also...lol exactly what Georgia says when someone starts complaining about it). This cat literally attacks Georgia and is this crazy mountain lion around Georgia, but as soon as Libby (Georgia's crazy little sister) wants to play tea-party with \\"kitty cat\\" the cat is as sweet as can be. Well, anyways what I'm trying to explain is that this book ROCKS!! (and is perfect for 7th graders and up and even 6th graders if they're mature enough)."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"... But it did have a lot to live up to. Yes the second instalment of the series is full of laughs, but its just not as good/funny as the first. This one is only over the span of two months (the first is a whole year - this isnt a problem, just thought Id bring it up). A few days are repeated from the last book - however our heroine Georgia seems to have done different things!One of the things I didn't like about this one is the words the 'Ace gang' pick up from Ellan's brother, like \\"Poo Parlor Devision\\" or \\"Nippy Noodles\\", they just seemed immature - even for them. Most other 'funny' things Georgia said had something inteligent about them. Unfortunately the same thing can-not be said about these phrases.Also the first book talks about Georgia showing \\"promise\\" in tennis, however in this one she is all about hockey! What happened there?The mother storyline in this one was VERY simmilar to in the first book, and the book on a whole ended in a simmilar way.Having said that I laughed out loud MANY times while reading this book and highly recomend it for anyone hoping for a laugh."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Georgia is a 14 year old who is on summer break from school. This is the 2nd in a series that follows Georgia's trials and tribulations. Georgia was kissed by the man of her dreams Robbie aka. Sex God at the end of the last book. Now just as her dreams are answered she is going to have to go to New Zealand to see her father, unless she can figure out how to get out of the trip.Georgia receives a letter from Robbie stating that there is just too much of an age difference between them (he is 17) and that she should date one of his brothers friends. Well after much heartache Georgia embarks on the project of making Robbie jealous, and dates \\"Dave the Laugh\\".The book is written as diary and you follow the life of this 14 year old. You will read how she feels about her sister, her best friend, boys, psychotic cat, parents and a considerable amount about how she feels about her body.This is a quick and hilarous read!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"It was so gutsy and british, I loved all the language and the characters in this book are not ur basic brit teens.

Georgia keeps you laughing with her hilarious quirks and british lingo. She reminds you how life there is the same everywhere. Her typical teen problems keep you amused constantly. I would definitley recomend!!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Georgia Nicholson's life is spilled to its readers once again in: On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God. Many teenagers, both British and American can relate to some part of Georgia's life, while other parts seem very much like fantasy. Although some language is hard to understand, the over-dramatic Georgia gets many points, both funny and serious across to the readers of her diary. I like how Louise Rennison, ( the REAL author of Georgia's diary), leaves the reader hanging. It makes you want to read the next book. ( Which I will as soon as I get to Borders!)"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"On the Bright Side, I'm now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicholson (also known as \\"It's Ok I'm Wearing Really Big Knickers\\" in Australia) is no disappointment for all the Georgia fans. This hilarious book will once again have you howling with laughter! WARNING- Do not read this book in public or you may embarrass yourself with all your laughing! Like the first book you will want to read it over and over, but if you have sisters then you'll have to compete with them. The series is so good it should be publicly acknowledged so that all teenagers know to read them.If you haven't read this yet or the next two in the series then you are seriously missing out. I can't rave about them enough. The funniest books ever written!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"It is now official! This series of Georgia Nicolson's confessions by Louise Rennison, are by far the best comedy books I have ever read! I absolutely loved the second book, On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God; it was just as good, maybe better than the first book, and I could NOT stand to put it down!Georgia Nicolson is a fourteen-year-old British girl who lives in England. She attends an all-girls school and has four best friends: Jas, Jools, Ellen, and Rosie, who go to the same school as Georgia. Georgia has a little sister, Libby and a cat, Angus. Fortunately for the readers, Georgia's little three-year-old sister Libby, is still unknowingly \\"torturing\\" Georgia with her regular routine of secretly hiding the dirty nappies at the foot of Georgia's bed, peeing in corners of Georgia's room, and bringing all of her dolls, lifeless creatures made of food, as well as herself to sleep in Georgia's bed. What a life! Georgia's psychotic half-Scottish, half-domestic beast of a cat, Angus, continues his proud parade of teasing and taunting the next-door neighbor's two poodles and occasionally digs holes in their yard too. He still continues to think he is a dog - he might as well be, as he already is the size of a small Labrador.This book starts exactly where the first book left off - Georgia's great-bosomed mother telling Georgia the worst thing she could possibly hear after working so hard to become the girlfriend of a sex god: she and the family are moving to New Zealand as soon as possible, where Georgia's father is currently working.After an incident the family does not have to leave for New Zealand; however, Georgia manages to land herself into a great deal of trouble because of some small, childish prank: suspension. What perfect timing too - right before her father returns home from New Zealand. Great. It's quite comical how Georgia's mother tells Georgia to fake sick for the first couple of days her father is home, and then to make a great and unexplainable recovery.Later in the book, something awful happens to Georgia and to undo what happened to her, she must use her former boyfriend, Dave the Laugh, as a \\"red-herring.\\" Her plan doesn't go as accordingly, though. What happens is she becomes attracted to Dave again and has to constantly remind herself that she is not doing this to get Dave, but to get someone else. Even though she always reminds herself of this, she and Dave end up snogging and she isn't one bit regretful!One thing that I really enjoyed and thought was wicked funny in this book was that Georgia was constantly asking God for help and to fulfill her wishes (a.k.a. make the sex god go out with her again). When the man upstairs doesn't \\"grant\\" her anything she asked for, she resorts to asking Buddha for help, and considers becoming a monk so that maybe her wishes will be more likely to be granted.I can't say one thing I didn't like about this book - it was great all around!!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"After getting experience with the great first book, Louise pulls off an amazing tale of...nothing. Once again, no plot, so for those of you who enjoy 1000-page books with depth, this isn't for you. However, it you're not a tight-pants, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"this book was great! i cant wait for the next one...

I am 14 years old and it is very appropriate for a teenager!!! In fact, this is EXACTLY what goes through a teens' brain, only this puts it all in words. From Angus meeting the Sex Kitten Naomi to dreading the thought of moving to New Zealand, this diary is awesum. i recommend it to anyone who has been, is, or can't wait to become a teenager. (the little ones might not want to hear this one out loud.) As soon as you read these books, you'll fall in love. I cant wait to get the next one!!!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"ok so here i go--first off...if you have not yet read this book, i beg of you...PLEASE read it...NOW!!!! not only is this, 'On the Bright Side..' one of the funniest books around, it also has two others in the series (and a 4th, 'Dancing in my Nuddy-Pants,' to come out march of this year)!!!!!! In this installment of the fabbity-fab-fab trio, Georgia is back with tons of, er...fun stuff and whatsit. She's now totally, \\"in love\\" with the SG(robbie), but she feels she must become like a rubber band, which elaborates in to her plan of glaciosity (i.e. like a glacier)...long story...anywhoo........if your one to be thinking.......\\"my life is so incredibly boring...what could possibly spice it up?????\\" this book, and the others in its series, are the answer to your prayers......read it!!!you'll be glad you did!!!!!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"The narrator's witty use of words and unexpected schemes definetely crack you up, but perhaps what is more to be laughed at is the narrowness of the kind of life she lives. Boys, clothes, thick friends, and is there much more to it? I admit reading this book really does make you feel good - if you can laugh at Georgia's problems, what are your own in comparison? The cover plainly suggests the story is not at all serious and the book remains true to that. So if you're looking for a light read to break you free of a ho-hum mood, this book oughta do it; just beware that the shallowness can get pretty frustrating."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Who would like this book? Anyone who finds humor in the everyday, ordinary human ridiculousness that goes on around the globe and is accepted as the \\"norm.\\" If laughter truly is the best medicine, then all hospitals should carry copies of Georgia's adventures. This irrepressible teen has got a mouth that won't quit and an attitude to match. Her tongue-in-cheek humor and no-fear approach to life will inspire the meek and outgoing alike. Are there life lessons to be learned from this book? Well, perhaps that none of us should take ourselves so seriously that we miss out on the joys of lipstick, crushes, attack cats, and just plain being female. (If the reader is female, naturallement. Men might enjoy seeing how some teen girls think.) Ms. Rennison has the skill to keep up not just Georgia's character, but the distinct charcters of her friends and family through Georgia's point of view, a not-to-be-shrugged-off talent. Her writing voice has a natural, true-to-thought effervescence. Ms. Rennison has teenage girls' number, and experiencing this book is yet another chance to relive those awkward high-school days and feel you've come out a winner. Warning--if you read this in public, you will snicker and snort and get stared at. Might as well just laugh out loud and make everyone wish they were reading something so cool."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This book is extremeley funny and gives you an overview of a real teenage girls love life; the ups and downs. I loved this book and I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Georgia is your typical 14-year-old Brit teen growing up with parents(Vati and Mutti)she can't stand, a cat named Angus(whose the size of a small horse), and a sister named Libby...who might have peeed in Georgia's room. In her self written diary we learn of the ongoing diaster of Georgia's life and all her misadventures.Taking straight off from Angus, Thongs and Full-frontal snogging, Georgia is in havoc with her parents on the thought that they might be moving to Kiwi-a-gogo land(Better known as New Zealand) right after she manages to start dating the Sex God Robbie. Good thing for Georgia through more of her misadventures she finally pulls out of the havoc and ends up not going to New Zealand. Just when things seem right for once in Georgia's life Robbie writes a note telling her she is too young for him! TOO YOUNG! Plus he tells her she would be better off with a guy Georgia calls Dave the Laugh! Georgia can't believe it and hatches a plan called Operation Elasticity or also known as Operation Red Herring to get Robbie back. and..the Red Herring just happens to be Dave the Laugh. Can Georgia get Robbie back and survive another year in her wild life?I was really looking forward to this book after I loved Angus. However I am disappointed to say that I didn't like it as much as Angus. I found all the old character to be very enjoyable but I found Georgia in this book to have lost some of her spark and at times is really very self-centered and very inconsiderated of her best friend Jas. She is just flat out mean. However I stil anticipated futher adventures in her life in the next book coming out in May 2002 in the U.S. called Knocked Out by My Nunga-Nungas. It is already out in Britain. Hey but the American addition will have another fun glossary to read of all the word we American chums don't know about."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. I read it on the train and I laughed out loud and people were staring at me.I actually was very sad before I read this book because I was on my way to some foster family.

You MUST read this book...GEORGIA ROCKS!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Ok Ok, and I thought the first one was hillarious. Now this girl has issues. I literally had to stop myself from laughing in class.

Remeber those days when all you talked about were boys,makeup, and clothes. But this isn't one of those non-sensical teenage romance books. The main character has a great sense of humor and the book is written with a hint of sarcasm about the teenage human condition. An extremely humorous book, and you don't have to be a teenager to read it. Not as good as Angus,Thong,and Full Frontal Snogging but definitely satisfying as a sequel."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Funny and ironic, &quot;On the Bright Side&quot; was a great follow-up to &quot;Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging.&quot; &quot;On the Bright Side&quot; chronicles the furthur throes and adventures of teen Georgia Nicolson, as she battles the ups and downs of school, friendships, and relationships. I found the British humor of the book refreshing and enjoyable, and was able to sympathize with several of Georgia's frustrations. While the novel's ending was not as satisfying as its predecessor's, it was still a great read. Georgia's methods of dealing with her ferocious cat, boy-crazy best friend (not that she isn't a bit boy crazy herself), and parents who just do not understand her are fun, comical, and pure teenager. A great book for laugh-out-loud reading."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"wonderful light reading. any teen looking for a good laugh should read this book, along with the other two in the series."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"I haven't read this book yet (because my liabrary doesn't have it and I need to buy it) but \\"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging\\" was one of the funniest books Ive read about teenage problems.

She is originally from New Zealand, and now is living in the United States. She is fourteen years old, and is going out with an eighteen year old boy. She has a special nickname for him. He broke up with her, by writing her a letter saying that said he wanted to break up with her. Then, Georgia started going out with his younger brother, named Dave the laugh. She broke up with Dave, because she is still heartbroken over her ex-boyfriend. You will have to read this book to see if Georgia and her ex-boyfriend get back together.I liked this book, because every time I started to read this book I couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what happened next. I think that this book is so hilarious. The one thing that I didn't like about this book is that it uses words that are sort of Britain-like. The words are not our ordinary American words.You would love this book, if you like the t.v. series called, \\"One Tree Hill.\\" They are not both exactly alike, but most of it is. People break up, and people gossip a lot. In both of them, there is some drama. I would recommend this book to girl teenagers. Boys wouldn't like this book so much. The main charters are all girls."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This is a really great book. I would not read it in a public place, honestly; my sister and I were reading it and we got kicked out of the library for laughing and stuff. Really. It's very good and funny, and all of the characters are really amusing.

I bought Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging one day for a laugh - and got FAR more than I bargained for. I laughed until I cried. On The Bright Side was no different. I consider these books as a version of my life if told by my utterly hilarious best friend - somehow, Georia is achingly funny, but still very real. I love it. Love it, love it. It is my firm (and highly bossy ;) ) opinion that ANYONE who reads ANY GENRE will, so long as they are actually BREATHING and capable of LAUGHING, ADORE these books. Just... read them."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"I loved this book! It was so incredibly funny, even more so than the amazingly funny first one! It was a nice break from the hard, serious books I usually read. This book is really great, though I would say people shouldn't take it too seriously. Though the characters in it have little depth, you'll still fall in love with them. This book is written in diary form, which, at first, I thought I wouldn't like, but it couldn't have been this wonderful if it weren't written like that. I can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"At first, I was a little hesitant to read the second book. My friend, Isabelle, told me \\"Oh, you'll love it Kitten!\\" But then again... So I picked it up and low and behold, I enjoyed every bit of it! I read it so quick that I had to read it again to actually get most of it. Yet Georgia is now like a sister to me. The thousands of ways we're alike surprises me and every time she gets into trouble, I always feel for her. It's a grippy book that you'll be able to read over and over. Then you get to read the next one... how i can't wait!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This was a really good book!

Georgia's going through normal teen stuff, except for the fact that the rest of her family is anything but normal. Her mother and father are making her move to New Zealand with them, she has to put up with her best friend(Jas) talking about her boyfriend(Tom) all the time, and she's got a crazy younger sister(Libby). Not only that, but her mother is going back into her teenage years and flirting with the new doctor. Things couldn't get any worse.This is an excellent book for anyone who loved Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging, or The Princess Diaries."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This book was excellent and I couldn't put it down because I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. Georgia has a life similar to mine and I go through alot of the same problems with boys, school, sports, and life at home.

I was slightly disappointed. Georgia was always a bit on the selfish side in the first book, but it took on all new meaning in the second. I no longer felt I could relate with Georgia, she became the annoying, self-centered, never-was-all-that-close-anyway friend that always hangs around and ruins all the fun for everyone else. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the book and even laughed out loud at some points (like the nose comfy or Angus' new love interest), but I've always found that a book is much more enjoyable if the reader is able to relate to the main character and I lost that somehow in this sequel."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Georgia Nicolsen is so blunt and funny and real, that you just can't help laugh at her funny outlook on life and feel like you know her. About half the eighth grade has read my copy of this book (and the first one...also great) anda can't stop telling me how much they like it! Yes, the price is a little steep, but it's not worth it to wait till next year when the cheaper paperback copy comes out. Besides, you'll need the hard cover because a paperback would wear out when you read it over and over and over..."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"..or maybe I just wish I had these books when I was a 14 year old American girl? Georgia is an absolute hoot, and so are her mates. Every character is well-developed (as seen from Georgia's perspective, though), and the journal-entry style just sucks the reader in until suddenly the book is finished. Georgia herself is extremely realistic, completely self-centered, but also marvelously lovable. Much appreciated is the British slang glossary at the end, which Georgia has written herself, in her own unique style. Excellent book for teens and pre-teens and a nice break from reading depressing things for 28-year-old me."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"I am far from a teen, but I absolutely love Georgia. I was surprised that I liked the first book, but this one I knew I would love as well, especially having stalked the sex god and aquiring him :) Georgia's diary is such a good read. funny and very entertaining."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"If you don't enjoy laughing hysterically until your sides hurt, do not read On the Bright Side, I'm now the Girlfriend of a Sex God. Even when your \\"sheer desperadoes,\\" it will have you bursting into laughter regardless of whether or not you're in a public place.I've noticed some of the reviews indicate not to purchase this book, because \\"Georgia [the main character] is every stereotype about girls we don't want to keep alive.\\" Should we notify the author of her moral indignity of publishing such trashy material? Could she be oblivious to the fact? Is she implying that young girls should act this way? Of course not. Anyone who believes such ridiculous statements has apparently never studied literature and has certainly never studied satire, which finds its humor in holding up to ridicule the vices and follies of mankind.I read this novel as a fourteen-year-old, like Georgia herself. I did not feel at all compelled to attempt to create a lunchbox out of my hair beret, and I wasn't convinced that I was going to be knocked out by my own \\"nunga-nungas.\\" Likewise, I recognized that \\"snogging\\" boys does not bring happiness. This book showed me how silly some of the teenage fads were, and after reading it, I was less inclined to be a part of them.I entirely recommend buying this book either for yourself or your teenage daughters. Rather than encouraging stereotypical behavior, I believe this book discourages it, and in the process, it brings a smile to your face."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"The only thing I am going to say here is that Dave the Laugh is the best boyfriend ever.

As Georgia continues her diary, she is very disillusioned by the prospect of going to visit her father in New Zealand on \\"the other (useless) side of the universe\\" instead of having time to spend (snogging) with Robbie--the Sex God.Like the first book in this series, this one basically just follows a few months in Georgia's life. Mayhem continues to follow Georgia as she and her friend devise new Beret-wearing methods at school among other kinds of mischief. This includes some chaos on the hockey field (the first book featured a rather disastrous tennis match). Rennison writes Georgia as a bit of a spaz--always thinking about herself and her appearance, heaping scorn upon Robbie's more studious ex--so it's nice to see her being athletic without really trying and without any ulterior motive.Meanwhile, Georgia also has to figure out how to get back in Robbie's good graces when he once again decides that she is too young for him. Part of her plan? Maturiosity and Glaceriosity. Yes.Basically anything funny that came up in the first book has been revisited in this one. A personal favorite: Georgia's continued bewilderment when faced with the phrase \\"see you later.\\" (Does it mean \\"see you later\\" or something else? No one knows.) There are a lot of developments in this volume in terms of inter-character relations (Georgia, her friends, Robbie, and so on). But there isn't as much intra-character development. Again. By the end of the book, Georgia does have some new quandaries to think about (is it a problem that the SG doesn't make her laugh for instance), but it's still too early to tell if her new introspection will lead to a bit of enlightenment.By the time I read this book (in a day), I was basically over my qualms about liking Georgia but feeling like I shouldn't. The plots are simple and fun, Georgia makes me laugh. It's fine.That said, I have noticed that, like a few other laugh-out-loud funny books for teens, this one gets a lot of the humor from Georgia having kind of low self-esteem. A running theme in both books is Georgia bemoaning her ugliness as a result of her large nose. It doesn't really impact the story, or send any message about beauty ideals or anything, I just wish Georgia could be a little more sure of herself. All of her friends (and snogging partners) seem to indicate that people think Georgia is pretty cool. I wish that she would figure that out as well. Maybe in the next book . . ."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This book is just as funny as the first and all of these books are amazing"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Poor Georgia!

Angus is the Nicholson's over grown cat. This book is about Georgia's life with her family and the sex god Robbie. Robbie is Georgia's, former, boyfriend. Georgia is on a race to get Robbie back, but with Georgia it is no easy task. With her family planning to move to Australia (in other words known as Kiwi-a-go-go land) and Jas, (her best friend) being dimly dumb Georgia's plans aren't going according to plan. This is truly the life of a young teenage girl.On the bright side I'm now the girlfriend of a sex god is one of the most hilarious books I have ever had the chance to read. Louise Renison who writes the book is also the author of the rest of the books in the series. Renison takes a look into the life of a young girl going through adolescence. I really like how Renison keeps you laughing throughout the whole book. She truly captures a young girl's life in the process from child to woman hood. The characters are so real! It sounds like a girl's diary...wait it is. I love how it is in diary form so the author can use words that are more slang than formal. In the back of the book there is a glossary of all the words that Georgia uses that we Americans wouldn't necessarily know.If you loved Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging you'll absolutely love the further confessions of it, On the bright side I'm now the girl friend of a sex god."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"This book was just an awesome sequel.It is totally up there with the first book.While these books may not have much depth or meaning, they're not meant to.They're all about laughs,laughs,laughs x1000, and just feel-good girly fun.Every girl needs to have these babies!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"My 11 y/o daughter picked this out and I thought I had better \\"preview\\" it.

Jas is once again her best friend/dim witted side kick, and Georgie &quot;might as well be talking to a duck&quot; when she talks to her. While the book IS funny it's not as funny as the first, though it comes very close. You'll still laugh an insane amount at the tragic life of Georgie (I suggest you read it in private, no one likes a mad laugher in a library). I'd recommend this book, and it's partner to anyone, and excitedly await the next book!!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Just when Georgia thinks her life is going great... everything goes wrong!

The books are consecutive, but they are a bit confusing. When I read the book, I felt a bit older, and I was in Georgia's life. Georgia's life is isolated except with her friends.

The characters are pretty shallow, the plot is not TERRIBLY engaging, and (as others have said) the attitudes are certainly bad.

What kind of person would name a book this? Mothers, how can you let your daughters read these books? Don't you have any values? This has no moral value whatsoever. This is the handbook for teenage pregnancy. 13 years old is underage for all of this.

I loved reading about Georgia Nicolson's experiences as a teenager, including issues from snagging the &quot;Sex God&quot; to having her sister Libby leaving &quot;wet nappies&quot; in her bed. Written in diary format, this book shows you how to keep a happy face in the toughest situations. No matter what happens to Georgia, she takes it in stride-even the looming move to the &quot;less important side of the world&quot; (New Zealand).

I'm 13 years old and I can very well relate to the main character, Georgia. Rennison does a fantastic job remembering how it was like when you are a teenager. I recomend this book for anyone 12-18!!!

You should buy this book and the prequel, too!!!!"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"I was very unsure how this one would set up against it's predesessor but it's brilliant.

Louise Rennison's writing is easy to read and she presents the characters in such a way that you can relate to them instantly. After I read Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging, I went on amazon.com every day to see when the second one was coming out and waited in anguish for a week for my book to come. All I can say is read this book! I thought it was even funnier than the first one, and my only complaint is that it should have taken place over a whole year, like the first one. Georgia's further adventures with the Sex God, wet Lindsay, Jas, etc. will make you laugh so hard that you'll cry. If you laugh a lot, don't read it in school - I had to bite my hand to keep from laughing, and in my next class I fell off my chair. Rennison's books are destined to become teen girl classics. So, just read this hilarious sequel and try not to roll off the bed, get in trouble, or experience any other side effects of the book."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"After reading ANGUS, THONGS and FULL-FRONTAL SNOGGING I couldn't wait to read this book, and I am very happy to announce that I was not in the least bit disappointed. Georgia Nicholson is just as entertaining as before, and her diary is just as much fun to read. She has to deal with being forced to go to &quot;Kiwi-a-Gogo Land&quot; (aka New Zeland), executing &quot;Operation Rubberband&quot;, being around her crazy friend Jas, and a number of other things, while also being back at school under the tyrannical tutleage of Slim &amp; co., and at the mercy of the &quot;Bummer Twins.&quot;The writing is excellent, since, unlike in most books that are supposed to be the diary of a teenager, the style of writing is kept realistic. Georgia is neither profoundly deep nor repulsively shallow. She's pretty normal, if there is such a thing. The one real problem that I have with this book is that I can't really relate to any of the characters because their way of life seems so completely different. Maybe it's because I'm from the USA and this is a very British story. It doesn't bother me all that much, but it is a little weird, and is the reason that I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5.Anyone who read and enjoyed ANGUS, THONGS AND FULL-FRONTAL SNOGGING will definitely get a kick out of reading this book. Probably teenage girls will enjoy this and AT+FFS more than any other group of people. The only thing left to say is thank goodness Louise Rennison is already working on two more installments of Georgia's diary, because after all:&quot;What in the name of pantyhose is going to happen next?&quot;"},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"I really liked this book.I liked it because, Georgia has problems that most 13 year old girls go through.I understand everything thats going on in it. I didnt really like it because,it had some big words in it,and it also had words that they made up like \\"snogging\\" and \\"wet\\".The main charecters are Georgia,Jools,mutti,vatti,and libbs. I would recomend this book for kids ages 12 and up. You could really learn alot,of what teenage girls are going through. This book is about a Girl named Georgia and how she is ubsessed with a guy,and he leaves her for another girl. Her best friend Jools is really annoying and is ubsessed with school and her boyfriend.

That's what the main character, Georgia Nicolson, has to try and get through. Georgia is a 14 year old girl living in England (in the present day). The book starts out with Georgia living out her perfect dream. She is he girlfriend of a SEX GOD. But soon, she loses him o her enemy, Wet Lindsey. In an effort to get him back, she starts dating one of the Sex God's friends, David the Laugh. Throughout the confusion of that she has to deal with her poodle attacking cat, her (married) mother flirting with Dr. \\"George Clooney\\", and some definitely air-headed friends.This is my favorite book I have ever read. But, I do have a favorite part in particular. You have to understand though, I had been laid over in the Kansas City Airport for 6 hours and I was completely sleep deprived. Anyways, my favorite part is when Georgia described how her little sister was sitting on her lap and she \\"let off the smelliest, loudest fart known to humanity. It came out of her bum-oly with such force that she lifted off my knee. Like a hovercraft\\".After reading this book, it is clear to see that the main idea of this book is just learning how to deal with growing up and moving past the obstacles that life throws at you. You have to make all the wrong choices to finally see why the good choice is the best choice.I loved how the problems Georgia went through were not only hysterical, but could also be recognized by all. The only thing that I would change about the book would be the format. I don't really like the whole diary-entry format. I believe that girls between the ages of 11-17 should read this book. They would relate to the trials and triumphs of Georgia the best."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"On the Bright Side, I'm now the Girlfriend of a Sex God:further confessions of Georgia Nicolson is a book about a teenager named Georgia Nicolson.

Georgia has a rather large cat, Angus, a bestfriend who overly obsesses over her boyfriend Tom, and a Sex God (a.k.a Robbie Tom's older brother). All in all Georgia lives an exciting life which makes for a terrific book.My favorite part of this book is when Georgia is running out to the field and she just lets everything go. She wasn't worrying about how her nose looked or who could see her. I loved this part because she was finally just being herself. Also, she didn't care about what people thought about her anymore.I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a good laugh. However, if you're looking to read a little at a time I wouldnt read this book. This book is the kind of book that once you start reading you can't stop. It is a hilarious teenager reality and no one can go wrong by choosing this book."},{"Title":"ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD","review":"Pretty much the same basic premiss as _Angus_ but spanning a shorter period of time.

Its about a teenage girl from England who is obseesed with this guy [the sex god] but he is much older then her. Along her journey to get him to notice her, she runs into a few other problems with her friends, family, school, and just life.My favorite part of the book is when Georgia is goingb out with \\"Dave the laugh\\". Se seems like she wants to impress him and go out with him, but whenever Robbie [the sex god] comes up, she acts as if she doesn't have boyfriend.I like this book for many reasons. One reason is because this girl is about the same as I am, but since she lives in a different country it seems like we have nothing in common, yet we do. I also like this book because Georgia uses all these funny \\"s;ang\\" terms. It's funny to read the book and understand it but then a word like \\"tosser\\" or \\"lurgy\\" can totally throw you off.

This wasn't my favorite book but it was pretty good. What I dislike about the book it is kind of confusing because the story takes place in Britain and they use words that are confusing and hard to understand.

She described her exactly. This would also be a good way to describe this book. Georgia is a fourteen year old girl who becomes the girlfriend of a popular 17 year old boy named Robbie. She stresses horribly over the so called relationship and when he's going to call her because she has unfortunate news, she and her family must visit her dad in Whangamata, New Zealand for the summer. She reacts like any teenager would and throws a tantrum. Just when I became annoyed with this melodrama (wanting the book to progress further), the author Louise Rennison sets up another scene. Robbie breaks up with her because she's too young. Enter Operation Red Herring. Georgia makes it her mission to a)show him that she is not immature and b)spark his intrigue, curiosity, and interest in her to want her back. Will operation Red Herring work? You must read it to find out. This is an enjoyable book written especially for preteen or teen girls. It is beautifully written in a moment by moment form as if you're reading her diary. Although difficult to read at times due to British cultural language and made up language, there's a handy glosary in the back of the book to keep you up to par. I think it's handy to pass on this tip since I read the book all the way through and didn't find it till the end. In fact, anyone might appreciate reading Georgia's adventures. Her melodrama, after all, was engaging and one really wants to know if she gets the SG aka Sex God (Robbie) in the end.

I went into a laughing hyena fit that sent my sister jumping six feet in the air when I first read it! Georgia Nicholson is very vapid, very, very shallow and very, very, very cruel to others. That is what makes her so funny along with her general outlook on the universe that it is designed to plauge her life of squeaking, peeing sisters, parents who just don't understand and friends who always have boyfriends. A lot of fourteen-year-olds--boys and girls, but mostly girls--can identify with at least a fraction of Georgia's character--I know I can. In a way, Geogia's tales are a story of how not to act.

I would keep to the South Beach or the Carbohydrate diet programs."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"I have spent a lot of time reading and researching low carb diets. While this does not make me an expert, I have learned a lot over the years. I've studied Atkins, South Beach Diet, the Zone Diet, Protein Power, and others. I've posted hundreds of messages upon bulliten boards discussing the best way to eat healthy, exercise and lose weight.Rob Thompson's Glycemic Load Diet book takes the most effective parts of the various low carb and low starch diets and puts it together in a clear and concise manner. This book does not necessarily define a diet as it does describe a way of eating that is easy to follow and effective for weight loss.The Glycemic Index ranks foods by their effects upon your blood sugar. However it is only the glycemic load that takes into account the serving size when measuring the effects of foods on our bodies. Rob Thompson's book explains the importance of glycemic load and how it can be used to ensure your blood sugar levels remain stable.The simple fact is that most low carbohydrate plans go too far in restricting foods. This book simply advises that you refrain from eating starchy food such as breads, potatoes, and rice. The book advocates eating proteins, vegetables and fruits as staples of your meals and even gives practical advice on how to have dessert without sabatoging your blood sugar.Who should read this book? Everyone. Literally everyone can benefit from the practical knowledge of the effects of various foods and how to temper them. Rob Thompson's advice is simple yet powerful: avoid foods that will make you fat, exercise at least once every 48 hours (walking for 40 minutes is ideal), and see how over time your body will become healthy. The weight will come off slowly but surely; anywhere from 1 to 2 pounds a week can be expected.I am personally following this way of life and love how easy and satisfying it is to follow. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. It may not be magic, but it could save your life."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"I've read this book 5 times, cover to cover. No other book makes so much sense, no other way of eating made me feel so good. I have been a fan of Dr. Atkins since 1972 and thought his diet was the only one that would work for me.Dr. Thompson gives Dr. Atkins his well-deserved credit, but uses further research into insulin resistance to create a way of eating that incorporates fruits, most vegetables and nuts from the first day to the end of your life. All you want. No counting of anything. Did you get that? NO COUNTING OF ANYTHING.And you can eat chocolate and sugar in small quatities, and after a meal. I thought I could never eat my beloved chocolate covered almonds again. Now I eat two or three every night.I feel free. I don't have to worry about where I go to eat. I don't have to spend time feeling guilty about my every little mis-step and how it will set me back a week. I don't worry that carbs snuck out of the potatoes into the juice of that wonderful pot roast! I don't measure portions diligently and more precisely than a scientist measuring his chemicals.This book is probably the most important I will ever read in my life."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"I do not give evaluations of books very often, but this is an exception. Dr. Thompson has written a very easy to read and understand book that clarifies the Glycemic Index/Load and provides a sensible plan for weight loss based on the glycemic load and moderate exercise. His formula for determining the GL is a bit different from most other sources, but if you just remember to multiply other's figures by 10 or divide his by 10 you will be real close. In addition to a very readable book, Dr. Thompson is a very approachable author. I, and several others on a website that I frequent, have sent him emails to ask questions. Guess What!! He actually responds to our emails and answers our questions. Truly remarkable. A great book, a great plan that works for the present and the long term."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"Now that the media has jumped off the low-carb bandwagon and has resorted to bashing it to no end, they are desperately looking for another diet plan to embrace. What's interesting is that most of these \\"new\\" diet plans are nothing more than just an advanced look at the low-carb lifestyle.From the glycemic index to the glycemic load of foods, it can all be very confusing. That's where Dr. Rob Thompson's \\"The Glycemic Load Diet\\" book comes into play.Dr. Thompson, a board-certified cardiologist for nearly three decades and author of \\"The New Low Carb Way Of Life\\", believes that too many of the diet books focus heavily on the glycemic index while all but ignoring the glycemic load.The glycemic load does more than look at what is in the foods you eat, but also in the serving size that it comes in. As Dr. Thompson puts it, \\"Low carb dieting suddenly becomes a pleasure\\" when you take into account the glycemic load.\\"The Glycemic Load Diet\\" does something very important for any effective and permanent weight loss plan -- the book encourages exercise at least every other day that will not harm your body and will keep your insulin levels stablized and ultimately get you slim and trim. Too many other diet plans out there brag about not needing any exercise, but that is a sure-fire way to sabotage your weight loss plan.The crux of \\"The Glycemic Load Diet\\" is around hormonal imbalance and how it causes people to crave foods they just don't need to eat. Dr. Thompson identifies what those \\"toxic\\" foods are that cause the cravings (HINT: sugar, white flour, starchy and processed foods -- sound familiar anyone?) and shows you how to eliminate those foods forever so the cravings go away.\\"The Glycemic Load Diet\\" is divided into three distinct parts focusing on various aspects of your plan for success: Understanding Insulin Resistance, The Glycemic Load Diet And The Slow-Twitch Muscle Activation Plan (very interesting concept!), and Proven Strategies To Balance Your Metabolism And Stay On Track.While what you read about in \\"The Glycemic Load Diet\\" is certainly friendly to people who are livin' la vida low-carb, Dr. Thompson believes the science behind insulin resistance has moved beyond what Dr. Robert C. Atkins has previously written about. That's why he believes people should pay attention to the glycemic load.Dr. Thompson contends that people who reduce their glycemic load will not only lose weight, but will also lose their desire for starchy and sugary carbohydrates which cause spikes in your blood glucose and ultimately weight gain. However, he contends that \\"sugar can be your ally\\" in weight loss because it can stimulate your tastebuds. I don't think so! Sugar is very addictive and can lead some people who cannot control their urge to eat more and more of it to go overboard. With all due respect to Dr. Thompson, that part of his diet is not very wise.Finally, \\"The Glycemic Load Diet\\" discusses fat, cholesterol, and other factors in keeping your metabolism in check for permanent weight control. Of course, Dr. Thompson shares a few of his favorite recipes to get you off on the right foot to begin this new way of eating. There's even a glycemic load food chart in the back of the book so you can follow your progress in your lifestyle change.In the end, Dr. Thompson says it may not be your fault if you are overweight because of your family history of insulin resistance. But he did say \\"The Glycemic Load Diet\\" is \\"something you CAN do\\" to change that now.If you've tried every other low-carb diet plan and none of them made sense, then perhaps the glycemic load concept will be just what you need to lose weight and get healthy. I'm sure Dr. Thompson would agree with me that there is hope for you as long as you apply sound scientific research to your life. That's what \\"The Glycemic Load Diet\\" is all about."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"I never thought I would deviate from the good Dr Atkins, but when a friend who was dropping weight through this plan recommendeded this book, I broke down and bought it.I haven't looked back since.It's not *really* a diet (it's honestly a life-long way of eating), and there are no 'phases'. There is little to no chance for failure because the common sense in the book makes it extremely user-friendly. He doesn't promise a low-carb plan, but he promises one which has kept even a person like me with goofy blood sugar from starving or feeling restricted in what I can have. I can stick to this because it is easy and makes sense. And that is saying something!There are no cheats on this way of eating because you don't need them. You don't miss them.I appreciate Dr Thompson writing this book. After being an Atkins fan for two decades, I've found something I like just as much, but for different reasons.I also want to point out that Dr Thompson, unlike many other low carb borrowers of existing wisdom, gives kudos to Dr Atkins in his book, and that is something I appreciate as well, being an Atkins fan.Also, having done Atkins for so long, I can attest that it is extremely difficult to cook for a family on that plan (sometimes harder than others). On this way of eating, it's easy for everyone to follow, kids and adults. He even includes some wonderful recipes to get us started.In my opinion, this book is especially worth it for those who felt hungry on South Beach and who felt deprived on Atkins. It is the culmination of all that is good in wholesome and decadent eating while remaining true to blood sugar, and those needing to lose weight."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"Thanks to THE GLYCEMIC LOAD DIET, I am comfortably wearing clothes that I haven't been able to wear in ages! It's been painless to lose what now amounts to 15 pounds and keep it off -- and keep going. Dr. Thompson's book is very readable with just enough science to explain what makes the plan work. It's not a big deal -- more like a tune-up of your eating habits. Beyond the simple basic eating plan, there are practical strategies on how to balance your metabolism to stay on track, especially when eating out in restaurants. Beware of the bread basket! I love his explanation of the slow-twitch muscles, how to activate them, and the role they play in weight loss. The book has about 100 pages of unbelievably good low glycemic load recipes. My favorites (so far) are Molly's Chicken Tonnato Salad, Asian Asparagus Vinaigrette, and Raspberry Studded Mini Cheesecakes with Pignoli Crust. Obviously I highly recommend THE GLYCEMIC LOAD DIET!"},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"There is nothing new under the sun here. Avoid starches and sweet drinks is the primary message of the book. There is some helpful information regarding exercise. I was happy to see that small amounts of dark chocolate are recommended for satisfying your sweet tooth. The title led me to believe that the diet was based on glycemic loads, and would encourage foods with low GL's. All grains are given the thumbs down, with no mention of rolled oats and barley as low GL. Even more surprisingly, beans/lentils were not mentioned or promoted even though they have low glycemic loads and are healthy and filling. And the author doesn't even use the standard GL numbers, but seems to have invented his own system for determining GL. The tables are nearly illegible in the Kindle version. My advice is to skip this one. As for what does work, The Insulin Resistance Diet is easy to follow and has worked well for me."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"When I found this book I felt desperate after years of metabolic and digestive problems, finding that the high protein diet left me weak, and The Great American Everyday Diet left me ill. Thompson's explanation of the glycemic load as distinguished from the glycemic index is easily understood and very helpful. I haven't had this book for long, but since I have used the types of recipes presented, I feel much better, have more energy, and am very encouraged. Its ideas are simple: Eliminate the \\"white stuff\\"--sugar, refined flours, starches, cereals--and eat almost all you want of the rest; then walk 30 minutes every other day. You will stabilize your metabolism, feel better and probably lose weight. I'm still striving to get my act together and make this plan automatic, but seeing light at the end of the tunnel, I'm not going to give it up. Buy the book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"Having metabolic syndrome, I bought several books about this and sent everything back accept the Glycemic-Load Diet. I am an avid reader and want to know the science before I can accept something. It is ALL HERE! Dr. Thompson explains it all clearly and in such an interesting way. I cannot believe how easy it is and how fast it works. My daughter is forensic scientist and was very impressed with it. This is already changing my life. I have been losing and gaining the same five pounds for the last six months. Now I know why. Now I am on top of it. Finally. Thank you, Dr. Thompson."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"While there are now many books out on the so-called glycemic index (GI), most of these pretty much miss the point that the low-GI approach to eating, while better than the usual, is still inadequate. By itself, the glycemic index misses the point of what portions of carbs people \\"really eat\\", vs. a merely theoretical level. This is an important weakness. Just looking at the GI level of carrots, for instance, puts them at a higher level than spaghetti noodles. That's why you'll still find some nutrition authors, unaware of the weaknesses of the GI concept alone, advising you to leave out items like carrots. Fortunately, nobody really eats more than a carrot or two at a time, which has a minimal impact on blood sugar; but people easily over-indulge on pasta. Nobody ever got fat eating carrots, but they certainly can eating a lot of pasta...So the real-world portion amounts of carbs people consume is crucial when attempting to do quantitative comparative assessments. Which is why Harvard researchers invented the \\"load\\" concept in the first place. Dr. Thompson has done his research homework and explains the scientific rationale for the GL approach to controlling postprandial insulin spikes, and does so probably better than anyone else I've read. That's why readers here are so enthusiastic about the book. They should be; the low-GL approach to (lifelong) eating not only produces good results in terms of blood sugar, it balances some of the blandness of a purely low-carb approach to eating. Although a strict low-carb diet is probably optimal for reducing insulin resistance, many carb-conscious folks might prefer a less-strict diet that allows for more variety of foods which are low on the glycemic-load index, but who are afraid of \\"carbs\\" in general. Probably the best part, though, is that if you choose your food choices wisely (and limit the portions of carbs that spike your postprandial blood sugar), you don't need to reduce your overall calorie intake. There's no need to go hungry eating this way. In fact, severe calorie-restricted \\"diets\\" don't work long-term anyway; they quickly send the body into a self-protecting starvation-survival mode that makes it almost impossible to lose weight long-term...Eating heartily-but correctly- while still taking the weight off is a novel concept to many but it has been proven in the research.Dr. Rob's low-GL conclusions here echo the work of researchers Mary Gannon PhD and Frank Nuttall MD et al., whose clinical interests have focused on the influence of various type of carbohydrates on blood sugar. When Dr. Rob talks about \\"starch toxicity\\" being rampant around the world today, he is not exaggerating. Yes, some cultures where starches are a large part of the diet have fared fairly well until recently, but we need to take into account the traditional work ethic in these countries- putting 16 hours a day in the field farming tends to balance out any excess rice consumption, whereas sitting in front of the TV 6 hours a night won't :-). When Asians, for example, adopt modern sedentary lifestyles while maintaining the same level of starch consumption, they quickly head toward diabetes and cardiovascular problems just as surely as their Western counterparts. Fact is, starch IS toxic, and researchers Gannon and Nuttall tell us why. Their research has shown that it is specifically the glucose content in a carbohydrate that is important in determining postprandial spikes. Starches (wheat, rice, potatos, pasta, breads, cereals, etc.) break down quickly into almost 100% glucose, which is bad for your overall blood sugar control. Dr. Rob terms this phenomenon \\"starch shock\\", and how true it is... Fact is, human evolutionary history shows us our paleo ancestors consumed very little of this type of carbohydrate, and our physiology is STILL ill-prepared to take on this task. Humans tend not to do well when they continue to bombard their systems with these \\"glucose bombs\\"- witness our current health problems, very heavily tied to the high-starch diets we eat. In fact, this sad state of affairs could well be our theme song of the 20th and 21st centuries :-).Gannon and Nuttall et al have demonstrated that carbs which contain less glucose produce less than half the postprandial spikes than starches do. Why? Simply because one should take into account vastly different postprandial effects of various types of sugars, such as galactose or fructose, when compared to almost pure glucose (excess consumption of fructose has its own problems, however, which I won't get into here...suffice it to say we're not talking about juices and high-fructose corn syrup as wise choices). Alas, the majority of health organizations, much more the nutritionists who follow their advice, are bent on staying in a familiar peer-approval-zone for making generous starch (i.e., \\"complex carbs\\") recommendations. This makes a mockery of numerous clinical studies revealing these \\"high-carb\\" diets inevitably produce inferior blood-lipid results compared to diets lower in carb totals (especially starches), but health organization \\"position-statements\\" always have an eye toward peer approval. And what does current peer consensus think? Sadly, nutrition is still dominated by an outdated paradigm which seems to be this: \\"Ancel Keys showed us back before 1960 that 'fats are bad' and should therefore be replaced by carbohydrates\\"... Yes, reader, you are correct- the current mentality of your favorite health organizations is STILL dominated by this terribly outdated (read: flawed) analysis from the 1950s; and indeed, the \\"high-carb, low-fat\\" mantra continues to exert a vise-like grip over conventional medical thinking. But how do we know if I am making a fair assessment here? One doesn't have to look far- just ponder why multiple servings of grains are always the predominant recommendation on various \\"food pyramids\\" put out by orthodox organizations...or read the constant enthusiastic advice for \\"complex carbs\\" and \\"whole grains\\" from your typical health-professional author...fact is, starches continue to rank high in the consciousness of the health community, even to this day.The situation is actually highly ironic, in that these organizations are supposed to be our health \\"experts\\", but remain helpless to counteract the rising health epidemics the country faces - even after decades of funding... And their recommedations on \\"lifestyle choices\\" generally are too bland to exert much of a change in somebody's health problems. But it's important to recommend \\"safe\\" advice that doesn't raise the hackles of one's peers, isn't it? :-). Reader, do you think I'm exaggerating the problem? Maybe you haven't had a chance to read the weak advice these organizations put out in pamplets and website guidelines for the public.It gets worse. As one on-target cardiologist prominent on the web remarks, whose name I won't give here, if you want to increase your chances of getting diabetes, just follow the generic carb advice still given by the American Diabetes Association; and if you want to increase your chances of getting heart attacks, just follow the current dietary advice of the American Heart Association. Would you like to know, just out of curiosity, what types of foods meet the AHA stamp of approval? Try myriads of items such as Honey Bunches of Oats, Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats, Cocoa Puffs cereal...and numerous other junk foods. And why are products like these getting the AHA heart-check approval? Let's go back to the mentality fostered by Ancel Keys decades ago...ka-chink! That's right - they're \\"low fat\\"! Nevermind the damaging sugars and the fact they are mostly pure junk, they're approved by the AHA because they meet the AHA's requirements for low saturated (and total) fat! Gee, isn't that wonderful....talk about a screwed-up way of looking at nutrition... And let's not forget these companies also pay a fee for the AHA's endorsement, so we are looking at a substantial souce of revenue for our beloved AHA...It should be obvious to anyone interested in effective nutrition these drug-company-dominated groups aren't exactly following the Hippocratic Oath very well (\\"first, do no harm\\"), but then again, it's hard to give up perks like free fancy hotels, fine dining, and other extravagant perks enjoyed by MDs attending seminars given by the big drug companies... Hence, woe is you if you rely on these organizations for your own unbiased health information.But hey, let's put aside that soapbox for now :-).So the best research has important implications on choosing the least-damaging carbs...and we see starches- yes, even \\"whole grains\\"- at the higher end of the glycemic load. Gannon and Nuttall et al. term their dietary approach a \\"LoBAG\\" (as in \\"low-biologically-available-glucose\\") diet, and it seems to parallel nicely what the glycemic-load index tells us. Want to be healthier? Try knocking off the starches and choose some lower-glucose, low-GL options instead.The low-GL approach to eating (no, not a temporary \\"diet\\") is the middle road between extreme low-carb and extreme low-fat advice, and it's a reasonable way for most people to go unless one has a severe insulin-resistance condition. Since adult-onset diabetes and metabolic syndrome are reaching epidemic proportions nowadays, folks need to pay close attention to what they eat. Pretty much everybody has decreased ability to handle dietary sugars as we age throughout life; it's one of the unavoidable physiological negatives of getting older. Hence, the low-GL way of life not only makes sense for the insulin-resistant folks, it makes sense for everyone.A brief note on the exercise chapter in the book. This is really one of the book's strong points, and NOT because it lays out a strenuous program that challenges your will-power. We assume here the book is primarily (but not exclusively) aimed at the beyond-30 crowd, maybe somewhat inactive and who may be interested in a plan that will help them control creeping insulin resistance as they get older. With this group in mind, Dr. Thompson understands the physiology of insulin resistance - at the mitochondrial level- better than most fitness authors. Therefore he recommends an exercise program a bit different than most fitness books. His strength is in recognizing that folks who tend to be insulin-resistant have unique needs for targeting certain muscle fibers, i.e., the \\"slow-twitch\\" fibers. These fibers tend to lie \\"dormant\\" in folks having trouble processing carbs (which includes a large section of the general population), and so MODERATE exercise, of longer duration, hits these slow-twitch fibers more effectively than high-intensity training. In view of high-intensity protocols like HIIT (i.e., interval training) becoming popular because they promise big results in minimal time, something should be said to balance out the tendency to exclude lower-intensity, longer-duration exercise.I won't say too much here about Dr. Thompson's advice for weight training; his suggestions leave out the important large muscles of the upper body such as the chest and the back, so his advice on resistance training is pretty lame. Resistance training isn't a field documented nearly as well as aerobics in the literature and relying on many of the ridiculous strength training protocols typically found in the exercise literature can be hazardous to one's common sense :-). One would do better to look elsewhere than books like this for a good strength training routine (while still taking the author's suggestions for including moderate-intensity exercise to heart).The only thing I would add here to Dr. Thompson's book is that one can tweak this plan in various ways he doesn't mention much of. Various supplements can be helpful, and some enjoyable items like a glass of red wine daily with lunch or dinner can boost one's insulin sensitivity (alcohol is rather glossed over in the book). Moderate amounts of alcohol are good for the heart, as massive amounts of research shows. It's not necessary to begin drinking, per se, but if one has no issues with it, alcohol in itself (in very moderate doses) seems to be good for relaxing the nervous system and lowering levels of insulin, nevermind the added benefits of polyphenols such as resveratrol and quercetin in wines. I suppose the (slight) benefits may be one reason you see some cardiologists waxing enthusiastic about vino in some of the newer \\"diet\\" books. Oh well.

But the author glosses over a few things and totally eliminates others. For one, he raves on about how good statin drugs are. Now, of course, we know they may indeed have a link to diabetes. That likely was not known when he wrote the book.Moreover, he says that Dr. Atkins died of an accident. He has not reason to say why he died other than to defend him against his own diet. I'm not sure we know why Dr. Atkins died but the author wants us to believe it was an accident.On the surface, this sounds like a good eating program. But there's not enough science to back it up. I personally tend to agree with most of it. But, there are flaws in light of recent studies.I certainly think that we know (at least at this time in our evolution) that sugar/carbs are not good when consumed to excess. In ten years that theory may change like everything else in medicine and fitness does. But as diets go, this one is good and I think would work. But, I still think that a person would have to restrict his calorie intake if he wants to lose weight.He also expresses his belief in \\"aerobics\\" and we now know that aerobics are not all that great.

Love, love, love it!"},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"This book is almost great and groundbreaking, but it contains some glaring errors that cannot be overlooked. I'm thinking that the errors may have to do with when the book was released (2006). I would buy this book again, and I would recommend it to anyone seeking help with type II diabetes. I found the information about slow-twitch muscle disorder and exercise to be especially helpful in understanding why my body created the condition of diabetes and why I must exercise every 24 to 48 hours. This book lays some important groundwork in understanding Glycemic Load, but here are some errors that I found in the book that are fundamental:**ERROR 1: OUTDATED GLYCEMIC INDEX NUMBERS**According to the book, carrots have a Glycemic Index (GI) of 68 (see page 42). However, several sources on the Internet list carrots with a Glycemic Index between 16 and 92, depending on whether the carrots are raw or cooked. The University of Sydney lists carrots with an average from four studies with GI of 47 +/- 16. I suppose in 2006, the GI of carrots had not been tested enough and the initial data indicated a 68 GI, but still the book lists the GI of carrots at 68, which is not the latest. I spot checked several other foods in the book, and I would recommend using a source other than this book for your GI values. There are many sources on the Internet such as University of Sydney, Montignac Method, and Carb-Information.**ERROR 2: NO GLYCEMIC LOAD FORMULA**This is the most aggravating of all the errors. First, the book does not even give you the formula for Glycemic Load (GL). I suppose the author and/or publisher thought that the formula might be too complicated to include the actual GL calculation, but I think it is essential for understanding GL and for being able to apply it to your life. The folks at Harvard took the Glycemic Index concept and made it more usable by converting it to Glycemic Load. Glycemic Index only provides the impact of food based on a 50g portion. However, going back to carrots, it would take 10.2 carrots to provide 50g of net carbs. Who eats 10.2 whole raw carrots at a sitting? Not me. So what the Harvard folks did is created a formula that can convert the Glycemic Index into a usable number called the Glycemic Load. The author kind of mentions this fact, but he fails to provide the actual formula. Here is the formula:(Net Carbs X Glycemic Index) / 100 = Glycemic Load. So, if you eat 1 raw carot, which is a reasonable amount, the Glycemic Load is (4.9g x 16) / 100 = 0.8 GL. A GL of 0.8 is very, very low, and from my experience will help you get control of your blood glucose. So eat your carrots. One final comment is that the author list the GL of some foods in a table in the appendix, but it appears that he divided by 10 instead of 100.**ERROR 3: NO CALCULATION FOR GLYCEMIC LOAD FOR AN ENTIRE MEAL**The book does not tell you how to calculate the GL for an entire meal. The simple formula is to calculate the Glycemic Load of each individual food in your meal and then add them up. For example, one raw carrot has a GL of 0.8, and 3 Tablespoons of Almond Butter has a GL of approx. 1.2, (8g Net Carbs x 15 Glycemic Index)/100 = 1.2 GL, so the GL for the meal is 0.8 + 1.2 = 2.0 GL. The book also fails to tell you that a total meal GL of &lt;=10 is LOW, 11-19 is INTERMEDIATE, and 20+ is HIGH. I try to keep the GL for each meal at &lt;=10, and I have found that I have great control of blood glucose by so doing. To the author's credit, he does suggest keeping the combined GL of all meals for the day at &lt;=500. However, he should have divided by 100 instead of 10. So you should keep your total GL for the day at &lt;=50 using the correct formula. If you have 3 meals and 2 snacks per day at around 10 GL each, you should be good to go.I have found that the GL of a meal is a better predictor of my postprandial blood glucose than any other variable. This book goes a long way in helping diabetics to gain control and reverse diabetes, but it needs a revision and some additional information to make it completely usable."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"Having been recently diagnosed as \\"pre-diabetic\\", I learned I need to make lifestyle changes immediately.

I've had Type 2 Diabetes since 1965. Last year I found myself at a high of 265 pounds, with blood sugars in the mid 300's most of the time. I was taking more than 100 units of insulin a day, and still could not get my sugars down. Also, taking that much insulin meant there was no chance I could lose weight. On this program my insulin dose dropped dramatically, and I've lost 40 pounds. I'm astonished and delighted. I follow the food plan guidelines pretty faithfully and exercise 30 minutes about 5 days a week. My blood pressure has had a nice drop too. I would have thought that this diet would be more difficult to stay with than it is. I don't crave the forbidden white food groups, sugar, flour, rice and potatoes, nearly as much as I expected to. The foods allowed are so many and so varied that I seldom feel deprived of foods I must avoid. Once you understand the principles of the diet it's easy to find recipes that meet the requirements. Though I bought the Glycemic Load Cookbook and cook from it, I also use recipes from other sources.

Then we found this wonderful book by Rob Thompson; The Glycemic Load Diet. And in a couple of months of stopping the starch- no bread, no potatoes and no rice, I started shedding the weight. I also followed his advice to walk 40 minutes at least every other day. I now try to walk every day if my schedule permits. I went to see my doctor the other day. He took me off of one of my medications. He complimented me; first time ever! My blood work was perfect! Dr. Thompson I can't thank you enough. I hope you sell millions of books. People this is the answer we all have been looking for. This is a diet for life and it makes so much sense. Why do we want to eat something like a potato that slams our system with so much carbohydrate that it literally sends the body into a kind of shock?

Every one should read it"},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"I've been reading quite a few books focusing on low carb eating and have to say this one has the most common sense approach I've encountered so far. The author doesn't act like he's some all knowing diet god who has found the only way to eat. He tells why he started looking for a different way to eat...he has diabetes. He acknowledges that for years we've been told to eat low fat, low cholesterol, whole wheat, high fiber and now when we add to it low sugar, low flour. That leaves very little to eat other than grass and meat. Not something that can be sustained for a very long time. Besides, now we are learning that low fat and cholesterol diets do not necessarily result in low cholesterol counts. He explains why starchy foods are bad but not in a way that is so technical that the reader's eyes glaze over. He even tells you that small amounts of sugar can be consumed but it needs to be at the end of a low carb meal so that the food prevents the sugar from releasing glucose into the blood stream too quickly.The author acknowledges that there are many occasions when pharmaceutical intervention is a valid treatment. Many other diet gurus seem to think that we should never need to take medicine. According to this author, you should take medicine to control what it can, and use diet for the things that medicine might not control so easily.My major complaint with the book is that the list of glycemic values for food is really too brief, and there is very little about the values when a variety of foods are put together,for example in a casserole."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"The book is very easy to understand...it is simple, and clear.

It explains why so many people have problems such as gluten intolerance, PCOS, Syndrome X (especially obesity!), and that's just to mention a few. I have been following the Paleo diet for the past 2 years, but felt that improvements could still be made with my PCOS symptoms. Then I stumbled across the Low GL idea (as opposed to low GI), and all the pieces are now coming together. I was eating way too much fruit on the Paleo diet and not allowing for the quantity (i.e. loading) that is so crucial. The book makes you realize that we have deviated so much from our ancestral roots and our bodies have not had the time to evolve and adapt - hence our health problems. It is written by a doctor and the information appears to be very valid, supported by plenty of referenced sources. I would almost guarantee weight loss if you follow these guidelines and it's really not a diet, it's a new way of life.

I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes about two years ago at age 57. After an initial committed start to managing the condition, I backslid so badly that I never was able to regain the initiative and had not lost much weight at all, just a few pounds (have weighed as much as 228 and am 5 feet 5 inches tall). Also have been addicted to bread and crackers and similar foods plus doing a lot of night eating. After an evening of overeating, I was waking up feeling groggy and terrible and had slowly increasing neuropathy in my toes. I have been very depressed and feeling guilty about my inability to get control of my eating behavior and very fearful of the future of complications and possible early death.During all this time, I have been ordering and reading numerous books from this site on Type 2 Diabetes and weight-loss diets and have been unmoved by all of them except Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Diet Solution, which is very convincing, but also very, very strict low-carb and pretty hard to stay on. I never accepted the diet I was given at the doctor's office after my diagnosis. It was simply too high-carb and too low-fat and low-protein. I think it was the standard ADA diet which is inexcusably and inexplicably dreadful, IMO. I can't imagine what their excuse is.I had almost given up hope of ever finding a convincing and workable solution to my dilemma when, in yet another search of Diabetes books on Amazon, I finally ran into Dr. Thompson's books. The reviews seemed generally quite positive, so I thought I would take another chance on another author.Well I have all three books by Dr. Thompson, and have read the two informational books but not the cookbook. I have been off of starch, table sugar, and trans-fats for three days, now. Not very much time, I know, but my bread/crackers/potatoes/pasta cravings are gone due largely to Dr. Thompson's compelling explanation of the dangers of starch and sugar for diabetics. It means a lot to me that he also has Type 2 Diabetes so he has personal experience along with professional. He is also board-certified in both cardiology and internal medicine which is impressive.I weighed myself for the first time in a long time, and I weighed 217 three days ago the day I started on Dr. Thompson's plan, and this morning weighed 212.6. Obviously the weight loss will slow way down, but I am very happy so far and also have been waking up feeling MUCH better in the mornings, not sluggish, depressed, and hopeless as before.Just stay away from flour, sugar, corn, potatoes, and rice (obviously this includes pasta which is a flour product). There is more to the diet that you will need to know, but that's the basics. What an easy diet to follow! This evening I went to a Mongolian Grill place and had small amounts of beef, chicken, calamari, plus vegetables, vegetables, vegetables, no noodles, no rice. Delicious!At last, I have found my workable and convincing plan, after so long and so much discouragement with all the other books I had been reading! I truly feel better already and, as you can see, I have already lost weight. God bless Dr. Thompson!"},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"My wife and I bought this book a little over a month ago and started a week later after reading it thoroughly. This book explains the basic truth about why so many of us are overweight. In a word - starches! If we each take the time to inspect our cupboards and refrigerators we'll see that our diets are flooded with white and over-processed starches. Because of this we are paying the hard dues of obesity and other related illnesses and injuries.Being completely honest, my wife and I have tried many diets (Atkins, Six-Week Body Makeover, South Beach, Vegetarian, etc...). All provided some weight loss, but ultimately failed in the end because the level of deprivation was too steep for any human being to maintain an honest commitment. More importantly, too many diets ask you to sacrifice salts, sugars, and fats. In other words, those diets ask you to sacrifice flavor. When you give up flavor it is inevitable that your dieting efforts will fail.My wife and I have both lost approximately six pounds in the first month and we have done nothing more than cut out potatoes, rice and wheat products while increasing our intake of meats and vegetables. Have we been 100% perfect - never straying from the path? No. But I can honesty say that we have never missed a meal, never felt hungry, and never felt deprived of flavor. Our stomachs don't even make that all too familiar growl that comes with other dietary approaches. Before we started this approach I will admit that I often struggled to push myself away from the table when I was eating starch heavy meals. I just couldn't get that feeling of fullness or I was hungry all over agin shortly after my meals. Now I am satisfied after one single serving and I no longer feel the need to go back to the refrigerator for more. As for exercise, the only form I get is the mile walk to work and again in the evening when I walk back to my car. My job is a sedentary one, as I spend the majority of my day in a cubicle with a computer.This is not a gimmick diet nor is it difficult. You'll enjoy tasty food and will no longer need to count calories or figure out exchange points or any other form of nonsense. You simply eat your meats and vegetables and do your best to avoid starches (potatoes, rice, and bread) and other high-sugar foods like soda pop. Notice that I said avoid and not eradicate. The whole point of the book is that some starches can be consumed, but you should do your best to ensure that the starches that you eat are better low-glycemic load foods. Glycemic loading information is similar to the glycemic index (GI), but it goes one step further and factors in serving size - which the GI does'nt.Don't worry, My wife and I still enjoy small pieces of dark chocolate candy or a glass of almond or coconut milk after dinner just to satisfy our sweet tooth. And yet we still lose weight. Does it come off quickly? No. Is it supposed to? Once again, no. This is a lifestyle change and you need to think of it in that manner. Some weeks I have lost two pounds and others I have lost only a fraction of a pound, but I have always lost weight. Do not get hung up how much you're losing. If you're honest you will admit that it took you years of abuse to get overweight and you should be prepared to spend some time in losing the weight.The book is well written and divided into two basic groups. The first half makes the case for the approach and the second half of the book is glycemic load data and other appendices with related information. This book is an easy read and should take you no longer than a few days to read. The author presents the information in a friendly manner and share's his own experiences with weight loss. The fact that Mr. Thompson is also a doctor adds credibility to his assessment of the American diet since 1970. This book will open your eyes and expose a lot of the half-truths and misconceptions that are floating around in the dietary literature.I have since given this book to my mother and I am hopeful that she too will enjoy some of the many benefits that both my wife and I have enjoyed. Imagine this: never feeling bloated anymore, never felling hungry anymore, never turning down food because it has fat or other supposedly bad ingredients.Good Luck with Your Weight Loss Goals."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"Excellent explanations of glycemic index in foods, but this book takes it to the next step: how quantity and type of food affect the 'load', the glycemic burnden, on the body.

Eat healthy foods, feel satisfied and still loose weight."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"About two years ago, I discovered that I'm intolerant to gluten. I was working with a personal trainer and was having a hard time reaching my goal weight. I was happy to find out because eliminating wheat and gluten from my diet made me feel so much better and helped me *almost* hit my desired body fat percentage of 22%. At first, just eliminating gluten really helped cause I wasn't adding anything else back IN to replace the wheat.I finished my program a few pounds short of realizing my goal. In \\"maintenance,\\" I found out that potatoes, rice, and corn chips were all gluten free...and when I discovered an amazing array of gluten free products...like gluten free mac and cheese, gluten free brownies, and gluten free cupcakes...I started to slowly gain weight. A pound here. A pound there. And two years from meeting my goal, I made myself step on the scale and found myself up about a pound for almost every month since I ended my program and started \\"maintaining.\\" I saw myself in a dressing room mirror one night and realized that it wasn't just the scale giving me bad news...I was truly *fatter* again (as opposed to the leaner me I'd glimpsed two years ago.)In the search for an answer, I picked up the book Wheat Belly (another GREAT read) and had a light bulb moment: I'd gained the weight because my diet was very high in carbs. Not just any carbs, either. Some of the highest glycemic carbs around, like rice flour and tapioca flour. Then, a friend reminded me of the Glycemic Load Diet, and I re-read it on Monday of this week. There they were again...all of my old favorite \\"gluten free\\" products in the category of highest glycemic load. And I thought I was eating a healthy diet.I'm recommitting to the GL approach after hitting the age of 45 and realizing that very low carb diets no longer work quickly for me (yes, I did try meat, veggies, and healthy oils only...and all I could think about was binge eating gluten free cupcakes...) If I'm going to lose slowly, I want my diet to be as varied as possible.For now, I'm eating meats, eggs, good fats, fruits (one or two a day), vegetables, dairy, nuts, and a piece or two of dark chocolate for desert after dinner. I don't use the charts in the book (which are hard to read in the Kindle) because I'm not big into counting anything. Just making choices that I know will keep my glycemic load low for now. When I hit my goal weight, I will experiment with adding a small serving of potatoes or a couple of corn tortillas to my menus. These items CAN be incorporated into the GLD as written, but I'm not ready to bring them back yet. They are still too familiar and too alluring.The exercise part of the book was exciting for me. There's a trend in the diet world right now that says exercise doesn't matter for weight loss...all that matters is your diet. I knew this couldn't be true for me personally because the times of my life when I maintained my weight most easily where when I was walking to school and/or working a job when I was on my feet all day long. The book's discussion of \\"slow twitch muscle fibers\\" validated my recent purchase of a Fitdesk (exercise bike with a \\"desk\\" platform attached, one of the best things I've ever bought from Amazon), which I ride at a slow steady pace for 45-60 minutes a day.I've been eating a low glycemic load diet since right after Christmas and riding my exercise bike daily for about three weeks now. I'm down about 6 pounds total, but my body shape is changing. I bought a skirt in a size up at Christmas so that I'd have something to wear that wasn't tight, and when I put it on this week, it slipped down from my waist and landed on my hips. That validated my break-up with \\"gluten free\\" foods and my decision to add slow and steady exercise back into my life.If you're struggling with weight gain after adopting a \\"gluten free\\" diet, I highly suggest picking up copies of Wheat Belly and this book to give yourself an understanding of how wheat substitutes may be causing problems for you.P.S. I'm not sure why this review is listing the date as May 2006...that was probably when I originally bought this book. It's now February 2012, and I just recently purchased this again on my Kindle."},{"Title":"The Glycemic-Load Diet: A powerful new program for losing weight and reversing insulin resistance","review":"One of the reasons I bought this book was for the list of foods. I can make no sense of his values for glycemic load because they are different from all others I have seen by a factor of 10!

The book is otherwise fine for someone who has not been obsessively researching this topic as I have been for the last month. If you are already conversant on the topic, save your money.

The author explains many of the important things regarding a low-carb lifestyle, but not that well and in a rather bland way. Also the glycemic load table in the book was pretty limited and riddled with product plugs for some obscure brand.If you're looking to learn about low-carb diets I would highly recommend, \\"Living Low Carb\\" by Jonny Bowden.

Recent research has lauded the benefits of a low glycemic diet. Easy to understand principles to apply to eating (e.g. limit starches to one serving a day). But don't look to this book for quick and dramatic weight loss. It's a new way of eating that has a positive impact on your weight and overall health. You don't get \\"points\\" or an easy way to calculate or track your GL intake. I hope the author or someone else will follow up with something like that a la Weight Watchers.I'm losing weight slowly following this way of eating. I think I'd see more dramatic results if I increased my exercise quite a bit. I do feel \\"lighter\\" and less fatigued. I don't crave bread, rice or potatoes like I thought I would. I made a chocolate chip cookie from the bakery last for three days! You do have to watch portion size, though that's not overly emphasized in the book.Echoing a few errors that someone else pointed out in the Appendix - the GL numbers are wrong; should have been divided by 100. I wish the author would have included the GL of the recipes in the book. Overall, though, a good guide to a sensible diet.The accompanying cookbook by this author and another author is so-so.

If that is so then poetry must be food for the soul and this book a feast for the spirit. Where literature deals with ideas, fantasies and the human condition, poetry deals with the emotions, the spirit; the very qualities that raise us above the lower animals (no comments from PETA, Please!).Poetry reaches into each of us and touches that elemental being that many of us deny exists. The Legend of Light by Bob Hicok reaches in and not only touches but pokes, prods and grabs. This, his second book, is the result of winning the Felix Pollack Prize in Poetry administered by the University of Wisconsin.His writing style is deceptively simple. He does not try to fry your brain cells with polysyllabic words or convoluted conceptual phrasings or make you tap a rythym. Instead he speaks to you using common vocabulary but painting such vivid imagery that your hackles rise and you shake to settle your fur.Much of his work has a dark side or, rather, addresses the dark side we would rather ignore. Some poems are equipped with claws that dig into your heart and squeeze till tears come, tears not of pain but of empathy, of compassion. I could not finish his poem Visiting the Wall until the third attempt, his descriptive phrasing affecting me the same as if I had been there. I don't think Mr. Hicok was old enough to be a brother of mine from the 'Nam but he let me once again cry.Another favorite of mine (actually, all but about two are favorites) is Surgery. If memory serves, this was written after his own surgery. If you have ever been undrer hte knife, you can feel as he speaks.&quot;Masked, they cut you, peel backyour skin for the legend of lightto enter your body. In this momentthey love you.......&quot;In AIDS, Mr. Hicok manages to convey nothing of being a homosexual, a drug addict or a maligned lover; He does not rail at the injustice of it all. What he does very well is impart the feeling of loss, the joy of love, of needing and being needed. His poetry deals with the frustration of not being able to communicate these things, of being blocked out and locked in. In the end, as the narrator leaves home, his last thought wasBut all I can think ofis that you love as you have toand die the best you can.In the end, that's all that any of us can hope for.This slim volume (79 pages) has affected me more than most books I've read in the past year. Much of the work, as I said earlier, deals with the dark. The dark in us, the dark around us. From Neighbor, about a man living under the bridge to Dogfish Mother all are guaranteed to open the your spirit-eyes and make you feel again.It has taken me most of a year to read, re-read digest and accept what he was trying to tell me. I understood and felt everything but I also had to accept it. I have at last and encourage all of you to do the same.Thank you for joining me.Joe Zucatti"},{"Title":"The Legend of Light (Felix Pollak Prize in Poetry)","review":"The book arrived in excellent condition within scheduled delivery time.Thank you,Francine Keehnel"},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"Some reviewers comment that this book has &quot;a conservative bias.&quot; Nothing could be further from the truth. This book is written in the great classical-liberal tradition that motivated the American revolution and the drafting of America's 1787 Constitution. Buchanan and Tullock saw themselves as putting into modern economic language the insights and wisdom of James Madison and Co. The book does indeed counsel skepticism of big government, and it is no great fan of unlimited democracy. But the authors come to this position because they understand that even democratic governments can be tyrannical and that a depoliticized society -- governed largely by private property rights -- promises peace, prosperity, and cultural flourishing. Few books on economics are as original and insightful as is The Calculus of Consent -- and it remains as fresh in 1999 as it was when first published in 1962."},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"The Calculus of Consent, written by James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, is one of the founding publications of what has since become known as the subdiscipline of public choice, which is the application of tools of economic analysis to the domain of political decision making. In theory, political decisions are made by elected officials in their pursuit of the \\"general interest\\" or the \\"common good\\", however defined. In reality, however, political decisions reflect the outcome of the workings of a number of interested parties, which includes voters, politicians, career government officials (bureaucrats), special-interest groups, lobbyists, etc., each of whom have their own agendas and interests. When someone appeals to the public interest while making a political argument, more often than not the underlying motive is a matter of self-interest (e.g. teachers' unions angling for larger teacher salaries under the pretext of improving public education). Public choice theory does not mean to be critical or cynical about this. Instead, it is merely intended to be descriptive: that's simply the way the political decision-making process works, and we need to understand this first before we try and improve the world through politics. For his central role in the development of public choice theory, professor Buchanan would go on to earn the 1986 Nobel prize in economics.The book's main contribution lies in its development of the analysis of political behavior, particularly so-called logrolling (i.e. vote-trading, or political exchange). The Founding Fathers set up our political system in order for the general interest to be served rather than interests that only benefit specific groups at the expense of the rest of the population. But elected officials have learned to circumvent that intent by happily trading their vote on issues on which they don't care one way or the other in exchange for votes on issues about which they do care. All members of the legislature end up voting for each other's pet projects, which all get enacted at taxpayers' expense.The authors propose that one solution would be to distinguish between legislative rules and constitutional rules. Legislative (statutory) rules may be adopted by simple majority coalitions pursuing their own interests. Constitutional rules, on the other hand, are supposed to be decided on without regard for short-term individual consequences (\\"what is right in the long run?\\" instead of \\"what's good for me today?\\"). Legislative rules are substantive, constitutional rules are procedural. Constitutional rules are meant to restrict abuse of the legislative process by majority coalitions. The difference between legislative and constitutional rules is perhaps somewhat idealistic. After all, what's to prevent people from voting for or against constitutional rules based on their short-term interest. In theory, people are thought to realize that \\"what's right\\" will also benefit them, as everyone else will be bound by the same rules, but in practice it doesn't always quite work that way (e.g. people may be aware that a constitutional balanced budget amendment is the morally right thing to do to prevent saddling their descendants with public debt, but as of yet no such amendment has been enacted). Still, the legislative-constitutional distinction is at least helpful as an analytical device.As the authors acknowledge, in real life things aren't always quite as black-and-white as they have here been described. Sometimes people--yes, even some politicians--vote according to their conscience rather than according to their own self-interest. But the insights and analysis offered by the book and by public-choice theory more often than not do apply. The book is highly persuasive in demonstrating that democracy's simple-majority voting rule (50 percent plus one vote) does not inherently lead to superior decisions. For example, it offers a convincing explanation for why even in majoritarian democracy, taxes and government spending, whether on public services or on redistribution, are clearly \\"too large\\", i.e. larger than the vast majority of Americans would agree to if they were to redesign and rebuild government all over again from scratch today.Stylistically, the book is light on math and the authors have an elegant writing style. But it is somewhat on the academic side and rather heavy on preliminaries. More comprehensive and more easily digestible treatments of issues of political decision making in a democratic context do exist, but even now, some four decades after its initial publication, the book is still considered a classic work in the history of economics and political organization. Its central section is \\"a simple logrolling model\\" (pp. 136-142 in the Buchanan Collected Works edition)."},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"This is probably one of the most rewarding books anyone can read. If you care about government and what it does (or doesn't) do to (or for) you, read this book. It requires patience and concentration, but it's well worth the effort. The authors succeed in showing how it is wrong to assume that government has always the best of intentions. They put a human face on politics and explain with impressive reasoning why government and politics produce unreasonable outcomes. The explanatory power of this book is unmatched. Anyone who cares about what this country is and what it could be should read it. Despite what you may have heard, their agenda is not conservative, it is individualistic, treating each person with dignity. The outcomes may surprise you, but you can't help but be moved by the force of their logic."},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"In this landmark work, Buchanan and Tullock work through the basic principles of public choice theory. They reject the political scientists' conception of the political process in which policy decisions are viewed as a private interest vs. public interest struggle. They replace that with a theory that the public interest is simply the aggregation of private decision makers. They further point out that in the political science view, the \\"public interest\\" is always the correct choice with the same appeal to all voters, which may or may not be thwarted by \\"special interests\\", when in fact most choices appeal to many different \\"law consumers\\" with different strengths.That is to say, given a choice to fund road improvements or not, some voters will have very strong feelings for, some strong feelings against, but many voters may not have strong feelings either way. In a market transaction, the voters strongly desiring the road could purchase the acceptance of the opposition and uninterested voters with concessions, resulting in an efficient allocation of resources (everyone is happy). The analog to this in the political realm is that politicians buy the votes of other politicians by promising to vote for their issues. Thus, in the Buchanan/Tullock view, such log-rolling is to be expected, while in the traditional political science view, it is anomalous. Their model explains things that the standard view of politics previously could not.They also make distinctions between constitutional rules and voting made in the context of existing constitutional rules. As part of the constitution making process, they point out that the traditional political science approach views simple majority voting as the standard, and question why unanimity is not. There is a tradeoff to be considered: a unanimity-based system results in no external costs, but considerable decision-making costs, whereas a simple majority-based system imposes some of both. They conclude that many more decisions should be made on at least a super-majority system, especially those decisions that potentially impose significant external costs.The biggest problem I had with this book is that the prose is somewhat dense, though not as bad as Ricardo. They tend to write almost exclusively in the passive tense. One description I have seen of this work is that it essentially applies the science of economics to the ideas described in Federalist X. It would be nice to see an update of the contents in a more user-friendly style; their ideas would find a much broader audience and a better understanding of Madison's thesis on majority rule and the \\"violence of faction\\"."},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"The Calculus of Consent was a pioneering book when it was first published in 1962. While this book does have some overlap with the slightly earlier work of Anthony Downs and Duncan Black, Buchanan and Tullock took the economic analysis of democracy into new territory: constitutions. Chapter six is the core of this book. Here the authors specify the logic behind cost minimizing constitutional rules concerning public choices. The ensuing chapters sort out many details regarding the workings of democracy. This book is highly abstract, but it also contains much common sense and realism.Buchanan and Tullock make a strong case for constitutionally limited government. In some respects this is an uncontroversial assertion. Who wants unlimited government in the strict sense? Who wants totalitarianism? Well, nobody does, when you put it that way. However, many people do want to disregard constitutional limitations when it suites them (both welfare state liberals and conservatives are guilty of evading American constitutional laws). Buchanan and Tullock make you think about where \\"we\\" should draw the line between the private and public sectors. Buchanan and Tullock make you think about how \\"we\\" can draw a line between the private and public sectors. These are the big questions of political economy. Whether you agree with them or not, they will make you rethink your position (provided you keep an open mind).My main beef with this book concerns \`political opportunity costs'. How do we know the value of forgone political alternatives? Can we know the value of forgone political alternatives? My own take on this last question is rarely. I was lucky enough to take classes with Buchanan and Tullock, so they have read my work on political opportunity costs (and commented on it favorably). Well, enough self promotion (my policy conclusions differ little from theirs anyway). The Calculus of Consent is a classic in modern political economy. All political science students should read it, especially at the graduate level."},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"I understand the contribution this book made to public choice theory (basically inventing the field of study). I enjoyed some of the insights in the book, particularly the simple yet powerful argument about the size of government. Also, Buchanan and Tullock are refreshingly bold - and unrealistic - in their policy prescriptions for redistribution.Nonetheless, I can't give this book a full five stars. First of all, as a read, it's quite a slog. Saying that Buchanan and Tullock weren't wordsmiths is an understatement. Their writing at times is obtuse and they rarely take the time to provide a proper introduction and conclusion to their arguments. I feel compelled to stress this because I constantly tell my students that good writing means the reader doesn't have to work hard to understand your argument. I feel in this case, too many of the authors' key points were hidden in overly long paragraphs.Another critique of Calculus of Consent is that the book sometimes diverges from reality. There's very little empirical testing and only a few scattered examples. The policy implications of the book are even interesting or relevant to the real world. The authors seem to prefer small government and unanimous decision rules, but that just isn't practical. There are reasons why a unanimous decision rule would not work and the authors don't address some of the more interesting implications (such as income inequality). The policy proposals, such as having some states pay for federal spending in other states, strike me as laughable.Overall, there's some great public choice theory to be gleamed from this text, but you'll have to work harder than you should to find it."},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"The main contribution of this pathbreaking book is by providing a rationale for the \\"counter-majoritarian difficulty\\": Why does society tolerate the \\"dead hand\\" of the constitutional framers to limit the freedom of choice of living individuals who wish to undo the constitution? The authors muse that in some previous stage, where individuals cannot identify their future preferences, each individual is threatened by two kinds of risk: The first is that others will attempt to take something that belongs to her and achieve their purpose by popular vote. From this prespective each individual desires that such a popular vote will not be made effectual unless supported by the largest number of participants. The second concern is that individuals might wish, in the future, to appropriate something that belongs to others, and may be thwarted by a popular vote, inimical to their cause. From this second perspective they wish to institute a rule that allows the appropriation to take place with only a minimal number of supportets. Each one of these two perils can be represented by a cost function, where the cost is a function of the number of voters necessary to carry the proposed measure; adding up the two functions generates an aggregate cost schedule for all rational players. The minimum of the aggregate function indicates the optimal number of individuals, as a portion of the voting population, necessary for carrying the proposed measure. If this number is greater than 50% of the population, this fact justifies the entrenchment of entitlements in a constitution. The grain of salt that must be added to this analysis is that the authors do not provide an explanation why that number might be greater than 50% of the population, or what might be the conditions that must be satisfied for the generation of that number."},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"The book contains exposition of important insights. Constitutional rules of decision produce political parties as a byproduct. Representative legislatures reduce the cost of collective decision processes. Logrolling is trade in the political context, and so the participants in logrolling benefit from it. When decision authority arises fundamentally from individuals, logrolling will occur. In liberal democracies, the government will tax all persons at a fairly high rate, and the tax law will stipulate numerous special exceptions granting lower rates or exemptions.On the other hand, the book is difficult to read. The authors mercifully avoid the mathematics that frequently obscures economic thought and creates a facade of ersatz logic. However, wading through the prose is a hard slog, tending to make the concepts unreachable.We can't be hard on the authors, though. That they articulated the ideas at all is more than the entirety of humanity did in the preceding millenia.Still one hopes some determined disciple will lucidly render the ideas. Both opportunity and need exist for the story better told."},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"This is truly a fascinating book. Few books have had a greater influence on my political thought. The initial assumptions have a libertarian bent, but the construction of the argument from there is brilliant. As for an overview of the book, I feel that Mr. Templeman's review below was just about perfect."},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"The Calculus of consent attempts to answer two questions through the locus of an economic decision model; what should be a public decision, and how are these decisions made. The authors answer these questions with a simple but surprisingly powerful model. They discuss all possible actions in terms of costs. Only actions whose costs are minimized through collective provision should be considered to be handled in the public sector. Once a service is determined to be 'cost-minimized' through collective provision, decision rules must be established to determine what proportion of individuals need to agree in order to take public action. These decision rules are based on two types of costs, external costs - or the costs others could impose on an individual's liberty and property if group action is taken, and decision costs - the costs of putting together a decision making coalition. The closer to unanimous approval the lower the risks of high external costs, but the less number of people needed to make a decision, the lower the decision costs. Buchanan and Tullock argue that the proportion of the population's approval needed to make a public decision is at the number of people where the combined decision and external costs are minimized.This model in itself is robust, however in application, it is clear that Buchanan and Tullock would prefer to error on the side of minimizing what they call threats to 'liberty and property'. Therefore, they forward a strongly conservative agenda in which a small propertied minority can, in this axiom legitimately, block the collectivization of activities which a majority of the population supports."},{"Title":"The calculus of consent,: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"The authors claim to be 'scientific', 'rational', 'empirical', 'economic' in their assessment of the public decision making process and the role of public choice, but there are clearly several normative value judgements embedded in their framework. In discussing their choice of optimal rules, the authors state that an assumption of their model is that all votes are considered equal, and that if this assumption is not valid then there model will fail to function properly. They continue in stating that this is not a very large constraint as one vote is only one vote whether or not the individual uses it or cares about it or not. However, a hundred pages later, the author's apply their model to representational democracy, an area where a very compelling argument can be made that all votes are not equal, yet they fail to address this fairly basic flaw in their thinking, or how it effects the functioning of their model. The authors also repeatedly give the same importance to the protection of property that they do to the protection of liberty, another normative assumption that influences their model, as they seem to egg the reader on in thinking that greater decision costs can be tolerated if the stake is Liberty and property. This piggy-backing of the property rights of the wealthy on the civil rights of the working class seems pretty disingenuous as the end result of this piggy-backing is that the workers get screwed while the rich are free to get richer. However the weakest aspect of the text from an 'empirical' perspective, is that the authors leave their definition of costs largely undefined. In other words they can, and indeed do, shift the 'contract locus' at will to ensure that a conservative ideology will prevail no matter the given situation. That the authors oppose the enlargement of government is clear, as is the fact they justify this position by advocating what they call personal liberty, which is in reality the protection of the private property of the few. Those may or may not be convincing arguments depending on the readers own perspective (and pocketbook). However, the authors do not claim to be offering a perspective. They are offering a 'calculus of consent', a scientific method by which to divine our political choices free of the nasty constraints of opinion and values. Put it this way, as passionate intellectual forefathers of slippery right wing rationalizations for greed and inequality, these authors score major points, as dispassionate scientists merely describing the way 'things are' they are merely majorly hilarious."},{"Title":"Status Seekers","review":"A previous reviewer notes that the book is dated. It's true that comments about televisions (When you next see Oliver Stone's Wall Street, check out the tv in Bud Fox's NYC penthouse...) and ranch houses are a bit dated, but the book shows that the craving for status and acceptance simply doesn't change. The book was published in 1949, and with a little imagination one can easily replaced dated status symbols with contemporary ones. The author's findings regarding ethnic and religious groups is interesting, too, but I won't spoil the surprise. Funny to view these observations 61 years after they were published. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Status Seekers","review":"I was not entirely startled by how important a role class played in the 50s (two decades before my birth) but this was eye-opening in some ways - it seems that status played a larger role in peoples' lives then. Packard does a wonderful job of documenting all of this and it is certainly more interesting than your average sociological research book. Some of it is quite dated, some is still relevant, but overall it presents a good look at how life was 40 years ago. Recommended, if you can track down a copy."},{"Title":"Status Seekers","review":"The author explores the workings of American society's opportunity structure, specifically, how social class, status striving, and social mobility (upward, static, and downward) influence the behavior of people who live in and compete for resources in our stratified, free-market social system. The significance of, and impact of social class is not generally acknowledged in the U.S., thus Packard's book offers insights uncovered by way of surveys, polls, interviews, and in-depth investigations from various social science fields; in addition, for source material about the impact of class on social situations, he made several of his own informal, intensive investigations and brought together the findings of 150 American social scientists, primarily from the fields of sociology, psychology, and marketing research. In various parts of the book, he often refers to work done by the Lynds in their famous study, \\"Middletown,\\" and by sociologist William Foote Whyte. Some of the investigated social situations, and how they are influenced by social class, include the following: how class differences form an invisible wall; how one's family origins influence or determine one's life chances; conspicuous consumption as a status signifier; the significance of dress codes; interplay of class with race and gender; how religious and political persuasion influence voting propensities; how received imagery (such as today's slick political TV ads), rather than careful thought, determines voting decisions; how appearance and image, rather than construction quality, determine the value of a house; some societal sources of marriage and family stresses; wives are more class-conscious than husbands; clubs and other social organizations; impact of class on stress and mental illness; school and educational attainment; upper-class college students and the \\"gentleman's C\\"; the ideal of American individualism versus team-player reality; cliques and snobbery in school; the upper class; the diploma elite; the working class(es); social hierarchy in corporate bureaucracies; occupational prestige; and social factors which determine who are likely to be friends. Although there have been some fundamental cultural shifts since the late 1950s - such as the effects of deindustrialization - I think most of Packard's insightful findings involving social class, status-striving, job specialization, and the increasingly caste-like class stratification of American society are as applicable today, perhaps more so, as they were in the 1950s. The book is reader-friendly and should be suitable for high school students as well as adults."},{"Title":"Status Seekers","review":"I read this because Tobias Wolff mentioned it in This Boy's Life. He was exactly right about it. It is a manual for changing your class.Since social class is basically a secret in the United States, it doesn't change very much -- the basic structure is pretty well intact since 1960. The list of prep schools he names, the hierarchy of religions; they're still valid.He has some pretty powerful inights. For example, he predicted that, in the future (today) the major qualification for wage jobs would be the ability to endure boredom. GOOD CALL.He says things about some groups (women, Jews...) that are a bit appalling in a modern context, but do paint a picture of the fifties that's worth pondering (this is not that long ago, after all).His observations about the changing nature of business are very interesting."},{"Title":"Status Seekers","review":"I read this with interest not because it describes today's society, but it certainly gives some background to why things are the way they are in America today.

It's astonishing to see the differences between the 1950s and now, but more astonishing were the similarities. Society is as stratified as it was back then, and although the status symbols themselves are different, the spirit of social division still remains. This book also shows the real reason why many never rise from the lower ranks to even the middle class, and why \\"rags to riches\\" is the exception and not the rule. Although some of the book is outdated (including some terminology), and we have made some progress since then (Federal Student Loans, the Civil Rights Act, and far less racial apartheid than existed in the 1950s), there is still much work to be done to give all people equal opportunities."},{"Title":"Brain","review":"I haven't read Cook since Coma.

It held my interest to the end, but I felt like it ended abruptly with no real finish to the story. BRAIN left me dangling in the air and hoping that I wouldn't be this disappointed in the next one"},{"Title":"Brain","review":"Like many of his other books, &quot;Brain&quot; starts out with a rather good story that can hold readers' attention until the end. The core message is human experimentation, and in this case the brain's functions as an example. The beginning of the story fills with mysterious deaths that slowly draw our good doctors into a trap. Cook has the talent to explain medical technicality in simple terms, to discuss medical and ethical issues that are relevant to the society, and to display the day-to-day life of the medical professionals. Unfortunately, most of his novels suffer from abrupt and bizzare endings that read more like a sci-fi movie script: In &quot;Brain&quot;, the human brain and spinal cord can be kept alive and functioning in a jar of liquid (remember RoboCop 2?). In &quot;Chromosome 6&quot;, a jungle turns into &quot;Planet Apes&quot;. In &quot;Toxin&quot;, the final investigation of the meat factory reads like a James Bond movie. So, despite the wonderful starts and the real messages carried by the stories, there is always somewhat a letdown in the end. I have been hoping to find a good ending in Cook's novel. If the readers are interested in human experimentation, I highly recommend the book &quot;The Plutonium Files&quot;, which are real stories about the nuclear research and experimentation conducted by the US military during and after WWII."},{"Title":"Brain","review":"From the back of the book \\"Martin Philips and Denise Sanger were Doctors, Lovers-and desperately afraid. Both of them suspected that something was wrong - terribly wrong - in the great medical research center where they worked.\\" What is causing so many patients to die on the operating table? Why is it only females? Read this book to find out. However; don't be disappointed, as this is not one of the better works by Robin Cook.Being an avid fan of Robin Cook, this book was definitely not his best work. Though enjoyable, I didn't find it as gripping as some of his other works and can only give this an average rating. Normally once I start a Cook novel I have a hard time putting it down but I didn't have that problem with this one. Not boring, but not as gripping and fast paced as some of his other works. In his usual manner, Mr. Cook is successful in describing the characters and setting the scenes with minimal words and doesn't drag it out as many authors do.I found this book to be plausible yet was able to see through the plot from the very beginning. However, like most of his novels, this book will have you thinking hard about some of the goings on in the medical world today. When I hear or see something on the news regarding a medical breakthrough, I immediately begin thinking about the many Cook novels I have read.For all of you Cook fans, like his many other novels, keep the dictionary handy for looking up those various medical terms. If you are new to Mr. Cook, I recommend starting with one of his other novels; but the same holds true for you as well about the dictionary. If I had to list one thing about the works of Robin Cook that drive me crazy, it would be that he has a tendency to forget that many of us are only lay people who are not familiar with much of the medical jargon he uses. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy his novels greatly.My favorite novels and I have read many by Mr. Cook and the ones I would recommend for new comers to his works are:OutbreakBlind SightContagionHarmful IntentThe one I don't recommend for those new to Mr. Cook is:Godplayer"},{"Title":"Brain","review":"I know some people have found it too technical but for me it was the best ever. For someone on the medical field who understands the terminology, the book is great. I was very surprised at the end since I had no idea who was behind all that was happening. I have read several of Cook's books as well as other medical thrillers but I think this was one of the best that I had ever read!"},{"Title":"Brain","review":"This book is about a medical center that goes from saving lives to taking lives, like one of Cook's other books, Godplayer, only this one is about brain surgery. It may have been done before, but this book makes the plot of removing unsuspecting surgical patient's brains to make a supercomputer and is very disturbing. If you don't like to read descriptions of people's brains being disposed of and removed in the most gut-wrenching ways or if you can't understand complicated scientific jargon about how the brain interacts with computers, don't read this.

Eager to test his new program, Philips begins to try it out on a series of x-rays, and soon discovers some strange abnormalities in several patients, some whom have recently expired, and one who went missing. Soon, Dr. Philips begins to suspect that something very strange and unethical is taking place at Hobson Medical Center.

As well, see Eileen Welsome's THE PLUTONIUM FILES: AMERICA'S SECRET MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS DURING THE COLD WAR. If you believe Robin Cook's comments at the end of this book are fictional, think again! It took Eileen Welsome 10 years to research and write her book and she received the Pulitzer for her work. Robin Cook's information in this book should make you ponder what you sign when you visit a doctor's office...read it carefully and make sure you aren't another government experiment as there have been countless experiments besides the ones I've mentioned here."},{"Title":"Brain","review":"Brain by Robin Cook is a nice little book that is easy to read and quite interesting for most of the book. If you're looking to be blown away, this is not the book for you, but nonetheless, I did enjoy reading it.

The story dates back to 4000 years ago to Akkaia, Babylon, and Sumeria. The best known tablets were known to have been preserved in 7th century B.C. The epic that was translated from 12 tablets tells about two heros that face a beast and one dies. It also is the first recorded story of the flood.This version starts out well but ends up being compared too much to the bible for my tastes. There are many stories of the flood other than the bible to compare it to.I commend the author for not filling in the missing parts and only suggesting what they thought had happend. All in all this tale or heroism, beasts, and the flood is admirable but not much more.In my opinion the art work in the book is one of the most horrid that I had ever seen. If the art was so bad, they could have just left it out. Our imaginations are much, much better. The serpent is simply a small snake and the Great Goddess Ishtar is ugly and ridiculous. We should have been spared the art work, if that's what you want to call it."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"I a Francis fan. He took on a hard subject and he did a good job.

BOLT and BREAK IN are companions, which can stand alone, but are much more savory together.Kit has more problems as he may lose his new love to a young prince from her own world \\"who doesn't have the courtesy to be bad looking.\\"The killer is always known in this story, but proving who is killing Kit's best rides is another question.Enjoy, Bolt is anything but humane.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"Kit Fielding, scion of an old family, thwarts a fiendish Frenchman who seeks to force the proud but ailing husband of a racehorse owner to trade in guns.

The first one, the predecessor of this one, is Break In. As always, he has great characters. The main character this time is a jockey.

My third time to read so glad I have it on Kindle."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"I am always pleased after I finish a Dick Francis novel. Kit Fielding is the leading man Francis loves to give us. He's charming, unflappable, and a little out of place in his profession, yet isn't invincible, and isn't the luckiest in love. We have three storylines here that are woven together expertly and in unexpected ways. Kit is asked by his friend that he rides for, Princess Casilia, to help them fend off an over-exuberant business partner who says he'll do anything to get what he wants. As if that weren't enough, a racing rival is out to get him, and he's pretty sure his fianc&eacute; is going to leave him for the Princess's nephew. Just when we are sure the story is going one way, everything takes a left turn. This is an author that will always be on my to-read list."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"This sequel to BREAK IN has steeplechase jockey Kit Fielding, the princess, the pretty girl, the twin, and the baddies but it's darker. Still a great read, I never would have guessed who done it."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"Bolt is the sequel to Break In, and they should be read in order for greatest enjoyment.Both these books contain amazing descriptions of races. Dick Francis portrays so beautifully the ability of Kit Fielding, an inspired jump jockey, to tune into the moods and idiosyncrasies of his mount - and the challenges of the course.Riding to win at breakneck speed, Kit throws caution to the winds, thinking joyfully to himself, \\"This is living.\\"Kit's patron, the elegant Princess Casilia, stands in need of Kit's drive to win. Her husband Roland de Brescon is in partnership with the Nanterre family, and their venerable old company in France has a high reputation for integrity. When Louis Nanterre dies, their new partner is Henri Nanterre, who turns out to be an unscrupulous money-grubber. He wants to manufacture plastic guns.Roland de Brescon refuses to give his consent to an expansion into gun manufacture. Plastic guns, favored by terrorists, are especially abhorrent. To force his partner's consent, Nanterre begins to wage a terrorist campaign of his own. He will not hesitate to maim or kill to achieve his ends. The princess and her family turn for help to Kit, who has demonstrated his ability to out-maneuver thugs.In the course of the story some of the Princess's horses are killed with a bolt gun (thus the title of the book). Kit is kept pretty busy trying to protect both people and horses, while competing in multiple races and struggling to win back his fianc&eacute;e's wavering affections.I recommend this book for its lively plot, perfect dialog, admirable protagonist, out-of-control villains - and the life lessons just below the surface."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"The book was in excellent condition as listed which was significantly better than I expected. Besides being a great read, the book resides proudly in my library."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"I am searching for large print hard cover books by my favorite authors. This book was in very good condition. The seller described it accurately, priced it reasonably and I am pleased to have found it."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"Dick Francis books read as if they came directly from the pages of the racing review. This book especially must be considered one of his best in both storyline and character. One reviewer said there was no mystery here, maybe so maybe not, but there certainly is suspense.To bolt: that is what a horse can do when throwing its rider; that is what Kit Fielding's girlfriend is in the process of doing, and a bolt is what has been used to kill 3 prime racing steeds.We learn from this book that a horse's brain is about the size of a person's fist, and that to kill one quickly one needs only draw a line from the right ear to the left eye and from the left ear to the right eye and where the X meets is the exact point to shoot the bolt. If true to aim, the horse will go down immediately with no loss of blood, it will just die. Grim business this book.In BOLT Dick Francis has included just about as much racing action as any other of his books that I can recall. Several stories are taking place at various times throughout this novel and the reader's attention is captivated throughout. Racing injuries are mentioned too with some racing lore and strategy spread about also. This book has the feel of the track taking the reader along.Starting on page 160 we receive several pages of information on the internation gun traffic with types of guns mentioned, especially the new plastic type that can go undetected through airports. And this background ties directly to the main plot of the story. Granted this information is dated by the book being published in 1987, but much of these statements would yet today hold truth.On page 169 Kit Fielding sums up his thoughts on today's justice: \\"The law doesn't always deliver justice. The victim mostly loses. Too often the law can only punish, it can't put things right.\\" Great statement Mr. Francis and alas only too true.To go on and on would make this review longer than my arm, however, suffice it to say that this is one of more interesting and thought provoking Dick Francis books I've read. It ranks up there with the best. Read it and see if you don't agree.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"With its companion volume, Break In, Bolt is one of Dick Francis' best! Kit Fielding, a hero with depth, who has recently become engaged to Danielle, is struggling to understand why her feelings for him seem to have cooled. At the same time, the Princess' horses are being killed, apparently by a bombastic and violent Frenchman who wants to take control of a business still half-owned by the Princess' husband. How Kit thwarts the evidoer, as well as the apricot-haired and very funny Beatrice, while re-winning his love and riding his races, is an involving and well-plotted story. I love Dick Francis' work anyway, but this book starts with a bang and doesn't slow down, unlike some others which are a bit slow to get going. Definitely read Bolt, but read Break In first. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"I have to say that out of all of the Dick Francis books that I've read this one really made an impact on me. I enjoyed the plot so much in Break In, which featured Kit Fielding, that I immediately picked up a copy of this book which once again had him as the main character.Kit Fielding is a steeplechase jockey, who's a little too tall and a little too old to continue racing, but he has his own agenda. Kit's friend, Princess Cassilia, has always been there for him and she's very much involved with the racing world as an owner of a very large horse farm. When she's threatened and her racehorses begin turning up dead, Kit takes it on himself to investigate, even with her personal life in turmoil. As he investigates, it seems as if everyone in the wealthy class of racing is a suspect and this puts Kit in danger himself.Stretching the boundaries of his writing style, Francis has written a great \\"who dun it\\" and created a variety of possible villains along the way. There is the unknown enemy who is determined to ruin Kit's family, a rival in the romantic arena, a weapons dealer who is the King of the underworld black market, and then the horse murderer who uses a bolt to kill horses.For those who have little knowledge of horses, a bolt is a weapon that is similar to a gun, but instead of a bullet being fired, it shoots a heavy metal slide (bolt) against the horse's head which immediately kills it. I'm told that this is a humane way to put down horses and usually administered by a veterinarian in extreme cases. Just the thought of such a weapon left chills up and down my spine, and leave it to Francis to use such a weapon in one of his books.Bolt left me feeling uneasy about the method in which these horses were destroyed, but I guess murder of any kind should never be viewed with complacency! The character of Kit Fielding is one with which many can easily identify and the action is non-stop until the last page. There are even a few twists and turns along the way, just so you don't get over confident that you have figured out the murderer's true identity.Bolt is definitely not for the faint of heart, but an excellent mystery with lots of adventure and wonderful descriptions of the English countryside."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"I really did enjoy it - and I own all of Francis's books. They're like old friends to me - I visit all of them about every 5th year. The only disappointment I've ever had with Dick Francis is Shattered - his last novel. It seemed hurried and the characters not as well developed in comparison to his others."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"In Bolt, Dick Francis continues the misadventures of Kit Fielding, jockey and all-round good guy. Francis' heroes are nearly always good and honest and brave, but never boring. They're the sort of men women would love to love and men should want to be like.This time, however, Kit seems on the verge of losing, Danielle, his fiance and the love of his life. As he wrestles with these feelings, he is struck with the murder of the Princess' horses, first one, then two, then one more. Henri Nonterre is out to make the Princess and her husband turn to gun manufacturing, but Kit will do anything in his power to keep that from happening, as long as the family chooses to resist.Meantime, Kit's old enemy, Maynard Allerdeck, looms in the background with renewed malice. What can possibly have increased his hatred for this particular Fielding? Fully occupied in helping the Princess and her family (which includes Danielle)avoid Nonterre's machinations, Kit merely tries to avoid any adverse contact with Maynard. But that may not be possible.In typically honest, straight forward fashion, Kit strives to protect his employers and friends, and the horses he loves so much. In the meantime, he waits for Danielle to make up her mind about whether she wants to spend the rest of her life with him. A first rate story and most pleasant narrator."},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"This book was so good I can't even think of words to describe it. The characters were so well developed and the plot was full of intrigue and surprise! It is one of the best! Once you start reading this book, you won't be able to put it down.

I would suggest reading this book to anyone who hasn't read it yet! It is so good!"},{"Title":"Bolt","review":"This was a really good book!

Forty four authors represent many Occidental countries, thus providing useful comparisons among ways of thinking about psychological problems and treatments chosen. Even tough all articles are originally written for this publication, one criticism could be that too many authors are from the USA, implying perhaps a superior knowledge in the field of cognitive-behavioral therapy. I interpret this differently: because this therapeutic method developed and grew in the US, a great amount of studies were first started and published here. The American authors selected by the editor are proven authorities in the field and thus, good representatives of the cognitive-behavioral method. The authors who use the DSM cleaverly do so without subscribing to its purely medical dogma and, on the contrary, stressing psychotherapy. The articles that mention de psychiatric DSM Holy Bible accept the fact that medication often clears the mind to make it possible for the individual to correct the problem with the aid of psychotherapy. In other words, the message comes across clearly that psychothropic medication is not the cure in most cases but facilitates psychotherapy. By emphasizing the &quot;cognitive-behavioral&quot; approach,the book integrates the totality of mental activity, including imagery. Chapters on social phobia, sexual dysfunctions, general anxiety, to mention just a few, make important use of visualization or what I have called &quot;new self- hypnosis.&quot; This book presents the cognitive-hebavioral method seriously for those who are not familiar with it. For those who are, it provides scientific evidence and practical technics to tackle some of the most difficult problems faced by the psychotherapist.

A &quot;roper&quot; tries to befriend the subject in a casual way to gain their confidence. The &quot;roper&quot; will admit to illegal or unethical acts in order to draw out a similar confidence from the subject. [You may encounter this in your workplace.] Selma is friendly with a wealthy man; some of his nephews and nieces regard Selma as a fortune hunter! The shadow is the boyfrined of the niece who dislikes Selma. The complication is that Selma's husband Bill died a year ago of food poisoning, and some gossip that his wife took advantage of this to poison him!Selma's deceased husband is exhumed; test show arsenic. Selma also had been buying arsenic until her husband died. A bottle of this arsenic was found hidden by the barbecue grill where Selma's husband got sick. &quot;The prosecution's evidence always seems convincing,&quot; Mason said. Who else could have a motive to murder except the spouse?Perry's client listens to bad advice, and acts foolishly by flying to El Paso. Perry arrives, and is able to salvage her mistake, and turn it around (Chapters 9 & 10). Chapter 13 tells how Perry uses a polygraph expert to prove Selma's innocence. One example of this was in the Sam Sheppard case; family members proved they had never heard Dr. Sam Sheppard say anything indicative of guilt. [Erle Stanley Gardner kept up with current events.] But courts won't allow a polygraph test to determin guilt. &quot;It's very, very possible to frame a person for murder,&quot; Mason said.On the last day of the trial we learn that Selma Anson has just married Delane Arlington, who found the bottle of poison. A spouse cannot testify against another spouse. But Perry says Delane will testify voluntarily! Lt. Tragg testifies that the police found no bottle of poison (clearly marked) when they previously searched the whole area of the barbecue grill. The manufacturer of this poison (used in taxidermy) testified it was freshly manufactured within three months. The owner of the taxidermy supply store identifies the customer who bought this poison.

Those who run antique fire engines usually are members of established volunteer companies who paticipates in rallies known as musters and compete in fire fighter skills.Most buffs (those who are professional hiatorians and curators as well as the otherwise employed) think often about their subjects in the hours they are not eating, sleeping, doing other life activites or making a living.You might well ask, how does a buff differ from a fan? Iit is a continuum. Most fans are content to go rah rah when their temams win but think of other things mostly. Those football attendees who get drunk, paint themselves up and go half-naked in cold weather, are way beyond buffery.Buffery mesns thinking constantly of a favorite subject, devoting most of their spare time to the neglect of household chores, and lots of money on trips, activities, and memoribilia.Most collect bookss on their favorite subjects and willingly spend beaucoup bucks. You have to f0cus or specialize on a place, an activity, or a particular railroad.The publishers who serve these niche markets mostly strive to turn out definitive accurate and complete works. But they are often private groups, museums, or private individuals who can't afford large press runs which end up in remainder. Instead, usually often when produced by subscription, they go out of print almost immediately. Railroad books, especially are expensive itmems to produce; photograde coated paper, quarto size ans landscape format are deriguer, while hard bindings are aleays desired.When I first began collecting railroad books some forty years ago, the average hardback novel or history then sold for two or three dollars: railroad books were over ten dollars and were printed on non glossy paper. Fans buy everything on their favorite line. But since the short-run books soon go out of print, (If they were ever sold to specialist dealers at all) in contrast to the general market trade book, there is no drop in price, instead it keeps going up. The book here is one good example.It has to be useful and well made or it would not be so high in the market. High demand and short supply, a basic rule of economics.I don't have this one, though I am a buff in many respects, my railroad buffery is down in third or fourth priority. The Santa Fe is my focus and the B&O; comes a distant secondOne must regret the demise of Bonanza Books which forty some years ago would reprint many small runs and hobby books. Only Dover seems to still be in the game, and they stick mostly to public domain titles."},{"Title":"On Dialogue (Routledge Classics)","review":"Bohm has a certain style in his writing which makes him stand out from others who write on similar topics. One aspect is his willingness to suspend his own viewpoint, at least to some degree, by introducing his approach to communication on an intimate level. This does not mean the kind of intimacy between lovers but it is of the same kind. What does this mean ? It means that it is communication without the presence of walls/barriers which interfere with the ability of one person to give rise to the same meaning in the mind of the other. This is the essence of communication at its most basic. The 'normal' mode of cummunication which takes place between people nowadays is way short of this ideal. The social barriers and thought constructions which are firmly embedded in the mind of most induce various automatic or reflex reactions when questions or comments are made which are in some way outside of the &quot;allowed&quot; list. These reactions can vary from fear, the most common, to anger and eventually in extreme cases to violence. How do they arise ? Through purely reflex reactions generated from countless experiences which promote a protective response because of the &quot;existence&quot; of the self. I say existence in inverted commas because Bohm denies this has any reality. Bohm uses his dialogue mode of communication to let people face their thought reflexes and stay with them ie staying aware while their mind and body undergoes its automatic reactions. Only this allows the mind to go beyond these usually unconscious reactions and proceed into a place where creation can occur. This means the creations of new ideas rather than a fallback into the old ones. This form of communication is far from easy to undergo and reactions of fear would be common as would eventual anger and frustrations as the self attempts to dominate in some way by either trying to control the dialogue or hide from it. This is overcome by staying with the discomfort until it dissipates by itself.Dialogue offers much more than the current ways of communication such as discussions or negotiations which never face the serious issues. Bohm stresses the pathless approach, ie one where no direct goal is provided and no leader selected. This has some similarity to tribal councils practised by native Americans for example.In this book Bohm through examples and ideas develops this mode to something useful for all of society. Bohm always leaves room for ideas to be generated from his own beginnings. As usual a superb book."},{"Title":"On Dialogue (Routledge Classics)","review":"Author Bohm, David. Year (1996) Title On Dialogue, Publisher Routledge: New York, NY Pages 95 Comments On Dialogue provides the reader with the feeling of dialogue. The effect while reading is akin to the movement from alpha to beta brain waves. An aura develops around one's thinking and experience that is qualitatively different than usual. It has the feel of the deep night dialogues round the campfire. It engenders thinking on a different level. Read this book if you are interested in the story behind the story on dialogue as mentioned by Senge and if you are attracted to exploring ideas on thinking about thinking. Do not read this book if you are looking for a quick, easy, step by step requiring no egagement process for developing dialogue. The writing style is a flowing narrative. The complexity lies in the topic not in the language usage. Highligts: A clear understanding of suspending assumptions. Experiencing the mood of dialogue for self dialogue.

The increased understanding of the concept of the implicate order"},{"Title":"On Dialogue (Routledge Classics)","review":"I read this book from two perspectives (1) is it useful for business? (2) Does it present some innovations in modern Buddhist thinking?Every substantial business holds innumerable internal meetings. The participants will all say that they waste a lot of time in those meetings. Why do they waste so much time? Jack Welch in his book \\"Winning\\", in chapter two, \\"The biggest dirty little secret in business\\", writes that the problem is LACK OF CANDOR. \\"People do not express themselves with frankness\\". \\"They just don't open up; instead they withhold comments or criticism\\". \\"It is absolutely damaging\\". \\"Yet, lack of candour permeates almost every aspect of business.\\"David Bohm explains why this is the case and what you can do about it. The cause is that people hold opinions to which they are attached and when another person expresses another opinion and criticises the opinion of the first person, the instant reaction of the criticised person is to defend his opinion. This leads to an incredible waste of time and emotional energy. Instead the person whose opinion is criticised should suspend immediate reaction and try to understand what the assumptions are on which the opinion of the other person is based and suspend judgement and reaction. Before reacting he should also examine the assumptions on which he based his different opinion. This does require control over one's emotions and thought process.David Bohm, being a great scientist, includes an amusing story about scientists. Max Planck a German Nobel Prize winning physicist, said about dialogues between scientists: \\"New ideas don't win, really\\". \\"What happens is that the old scientists die and new ones come along with new ideas\\". If that happens in business, that is no innovation, the company dies sooner rather than later.This is one of the best books to understand and learn about creating candid dialogues.Buddhism and new ideas.The Dalai Lama refers to David Bohm as his guru. They met many times. Some useful ideas you can not easily find in Buddhism are the following.Buddhism emphasises that you must try to reduce negative thoughts and emotions like, anger, jealousy and greed. Bohm emphasises that you must learn to observe your thinking process including the influence of emotions. Observing the thought process is a step beyond reducing negative thoughts and emotions. Another insight is that thoughts are from the past and so are feelings for which there is no word, he suggests the word \\"felts\\". Thinking is a current process that is influenced by thoughts and \\"felts\\". Also something you have to watch.Bohm recommends that that if you talk and listen to other people you have to observe their body language, people do not communicate only with their voice. Candid dialogue depends on the ability to listen, to ask questions, almost more than on what you say.Bohm explains the importance of coherence. Incoherence means that your intention and your results do not agree. Ordinary light is incoherent, the light goes in all sorts of directions, and if it is coherent it becomes a laser that is very powerful. Most groups are incoherent; the thinking of the members goes also all over the place. If they can think coherently and constructively the group develops enormous power. The power of coherent thinking in a group is an important concept. Coherent does not mean that all follow the leader. It means the group of many thinks creatively as one.The book actually concentrates on dialogue on the level of society, so you have to modify some of the ideas to fit in a business environment."},{"Title":"On Dialogue (Routledge Classics)","review":"The book titled \\"On Dialogue\\", by David Bohm,is an important read for anyone who has the interest to learn and understand the many causes affecting humankind. First, by understanding how our mind has become so conditioned and is so full of preconceptions that we are unable to listen and learn from others through an honest, open and unbiased process. We have become so fixated in our opinions and points of view and in our argumentative thinking that we are simply unable to learn by discovering through a process of sharing meaning with others.It is written in very simple terms but it gets to the core issues impeding a true process of dialogue. Worthwhile reading and re-reading to help us be more cognizant of the need of suspending judment and beliefs when others do not think like us and how we may learn from others by all being opened and discovering together the essential needs and elements to function towards the betterment of humanity. One could say that the message is perhaps too naive in a world where the motto is driven by personal or national interests first before anything else. This does not take away the fact that we have become so sophisticated in constructing all sorts of arguments, which we use as pretexts to hide some essential truths that lie at the core of not wanting to forego our personal interests in favor of our common good. No wonder we are where we are."},{"Title":"On Dialogue (Routledge Classics)","review":"David Bohm (1996), wrote about proprioception, which is the basically the self-awareness that allows us to realize that our bodies our wired to know when we move them versus being moved by something else. In other words, we know when we have moved our arm or when someone else has moved it. Not so with thoughts and emotions, he said:\\"You may get a feeling that you don't like from a thought, and then a second later say, \\"I've got to get rid of that feeling,\\" but your thought is still there working, especially if it's a thought that you take to be absolutely necessary. . . .\\"We could say that practically all of the problems of the human race are due to the fact that thought is not proprioceptive. Thought is constantly creating problems that way and then trying to solve them. But as it tries to solve them it makes it worse because it doesn't notice that it's creating them, and the more it thinks, the more problems it creates--because it's not proprioceptive of wht it's doing. If your body were that way you would very quickly come to grief and you wouldn't last very long. And it may be said that if our culture were that way, our civilization would not last all that long, either\\" (p. 25).Bohm's contribution to servant-leadership is his resonance with Greenleaf (2002) on the topics of awareness and responsibility. The latter said that the \\"servant views any problem in the world as in here, inside oneself, not out there\\" and that it is not just problems that the self generates and is responsible for because \\"So it is with joy\\" as well as trouble (p. 57)."},{"Title":"On Dialogue (Routledge Classics)","review":"David Bohm was a thought leader of most noble principles.

I also liked the thorough bibliography."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks British Columbia, Sixth Edition","review":"This is indeed a terrific guidebook for B.C. Previous editions, however, included Banff and Jasper National Parks, which admittedly are in Alberta, not B.C., but are usually included in Canadian Rockies travel itineraries. There's no excuse including Yoho (which is just over the border) but not Banff and Jasper, except to sell more books. So this is not an improvement."},{"Title":"Thoth: Architect of the Universe","review":"I found this book to be a fascinating publication.Mr Ellis certainly has done an enormous amount of research, both in the libraries, and in the field.I found that the central theme of the book ties in very closely with arguments put forward in publications by Robert Bauval, Robert Temple, Graham Hancock, Maurice Cotterell, and others. In fact, it is very believable, unless one is unable to discard the dogma of centuries of archaeological and religious indoctrination.The central theme (theory) certainly gives us a different view of the possible meaning of the Pyramids, and StonehengeIt is a great shame though, that the proofreaders seem to have &quot;slipped up&quot;, and enjoyment of the book is marred by a plethora of spelling and grammatical mistakes.Perhaps in the reprinted edition......?All in all, a good read if you have an open mind."},{"Title":"Thoth: Architect of the Universe","review":"By Fractal, I mean that Thoth the architect could be Thoth a person, or a highly advanced civilization represented by the name Thoth.The author ties the measurements and mathematics of the pyramids, Stonehenge and Avebury with the myth of Thoth, who educated mankind in math and the mysteries of the heavens, leaving repositories of knowledge throughout the Earth. Those repositories may not be \\"inside\\" these megalithic structures, but instead the fundamental mathematics encoded in the architecture of these structures themselves. The author, a computer professional, solved these mysteries as a mathematical puzzle.The similarities are absolutely astounding. All have been linked to the dimensions of the earth, but the author take this even further. Stonehenge Trilithons were based on Pi, as were the gates to the temple of Horus, the temple of karnac, and the pillars of Solomon, even though they were continents away. Pi, a letter in the Greek alphabet, also means gateway. Coincidence?All three site measurements also connect to the Earth's precession, which imply that all were using a circle based on 360 degrees. Coincidence?Even the different measuring systems (the Zil yard and Thoth cubit) used in their construction resulted in whole numbers. Coincidence?The author concludes that Avebury is a representation of the planet Earth, with the small circles being Sonehenge as it appears in the northern hemisphere; Stonehenge was a precessional clock; and the pyramids connect the heavens with Earth and the continents, which is one of Spiritual truths found in the Hermetic: as is above, so below. The writing of the Hermetic was also credited to Thoth. Coincidence?It all points to one set of \\"blueprints\\" by an ancient, highly technologically advanced civilization....Atlantis?There are just too many coincidences for this to be overlooked. The book has a lot of math, but it is hard to make these points without it.If you still think the Egyptologists are correct, and primitive civilizations that didn't have the wheel built megaliths like the pyramids, or Stonehenge, so they could dance around a cool looking burial ground, you're not going to like this book."},{"Title":"Thoth: Architect of the Universe","review":"This book is not an entertainment subject, unless you are engineeringly inclined. The author takes his time to fill the pages, but the information contained within may change your understanding of religion, history and culture as we know it. Don't get me wrong, the book is not about new age or occult. He casts light upon the reason these world wonders were built, what type of messages they carry, some speculations about their functions and ultimately, some decrypting theories in mathematics which connect the historic achievements like Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid to a profound goal. Not discarding the indifferent judgement of Occam's Razor, the author is very frank about his speculations. If you think anything unknown must be subject to objective consideration, this book might provide you with serious thoughts to consider. In contrast to pegging these monuments as &quot;built with religious thoughts&quot;, which by the way, is the official explanation evading the Razor; he is not afraid to test his ideas under the Razor. If you think our technology would be considered as magic earlier, you might apply the same state of mind to the discoveries and assertations contained in this book. Very satisfying!"},{"Title":"Thoth: Architect of the Universe","review":"I'm a serious student of alternative history and was looking in earnest to read Ellis' book, because it has been footnoted by some big names in the field.What a disappointment! This book might be of some interest to engineers and people who love to play with numbers, but it makes zero sense historically. Not only is Ellis' final concluclusion absurd, but the length of time it takes to get there is far too long. The writing is clumsy and the thoughts convolulted.This is one time I'm sorry I spent the money."},{"Title":"Thoth: Architect of the Universe","review":"I have read many authors on the subjects of Egyptology, Creation vs. Evolution, and of course the mighty Bible. Ralph Ellis's books are the one's worth the taking time to read. I do not say this lightly. Ellis has done the research and even though his writing style sometimes bogs down, he is the authority of our times. I have read others as I say. Osman's books were a good beginner into these subjects, but they are not the place to stop at and consider that the subject has been fulfilled in explanation. Budge is a favorite, but of course his information is out of date. Nedless to say, if you want current information, and the stuff that sticks to the ribs, then Ralph Ellis is your author. Start with \\"Jesus: Last of the Pharoahs\\" or \\"Thoth: Architect of the Universe\\", and don't just stop there!!! Read his whole series. You'll be glad that you did. Still even so, there are critics of Ellis, as usually comes from the more ignorant crowd or the religious bigot. Take a deep breath and let the pests fly off and just read these books for what they are worth and with an open mind, without the critical nature that has been pablum fed into us since childhood. Indeed, for those who keep their priorities straight, and an open mind, these books are worth their weight in gold.Yori"},{"Title":"Thoth: Architect of the Universe","review":"A great read for those who are interested in ancient Egyptian history. Ellis is to be applauded for his research that sheds a new light on Thoth.

Read it now."},{"Title":"Thoth: Architect of the Universe","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this book due to my interest in the Egyptian God Thoth who some think was a form of the Christ spirit.However when I got to around page 100 he starts talking about these \\"legends\\" that Christ had a kid with Mary Magdalene.He presents this as fact but a lot of discussion has gone on about these stories recently due to the Da Vinci Code. There is no basis in reality in those legends.As soon as I read this I felt like I had been punched in the gut. I suspected the evil spirits would start attacking me.Sure enough around 4:00 AM I could hear them chanting.I figured I would wait until the morning to throw the book away but they kept making these weird sounds so I had to throw it away immediately.So I never got past around page 100.Anyway this guy talks about these legends like they are facts. So I have to assume he does this with other information of questionable value.For example how likely is it that someone saved the spear that was used to stab Christ on the cross and they still have it ?About as likely as a snowball in hell.Jeff MarzanoThe Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient EgyptThe Giza Death StarThe Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and FutureInitiationInitiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)"},{"Title":"Halloween Crafts: Eerily Elegant Decor","review":"Last year I stopped into the our local bookstore and came across this wonderful book for Halloween! Most Halloween books really come across as chitchy and more for the kids, but this one really stood heads above the crowd! Since I'm not into the kid element, this book really can make or break your Halloween party! Just great stuff in here! I used a few of the recepies for the Spider punch, and the cookies. Also did the stone pumpkins. They were a hit at my party! I didn't have much time to use the ideas last year, but since the party was so successful, we are going to keep this book at hand from now until up until October! The projects are insightful and just great! Who thought of spraying Fleckstone to make Graveyard Stone Pumpkins?! We did the Orchard Stone statue and wanted to create the Amature Butler, but didn't have time. This year our Jack Skellington costume will be stuffed and built with the amature project in this book. We just finished making our first \\"Drippy Black Candle\\" and WOW! All I can say is this party this year will be fabulous! Most of the projects are clearly designed for adult entertaining, with none of those cheap kiddy elements, with paper masks and cardboard costumes. FINALLY something THEATRICAL!!!! Now you can have Phantom of the Opera style candles flickering though the house! Very elegant, wonderful ideas! All of them here are just fabulous, creepy, yet without going overboard into the gory, horror-movie style. Hey, let's make Halloween into a great, elegant, FUN holiday to celebrate! Adults love to have fun too, and since Halloween is one of my favorite holidays, this book really raises the bar with your haunted house and trick or treat home decorating.Martha Stewart's Halloween book is also good, but Kasey Rodgers is so much better! More Kasey, more!

And adults with style, not just adults who like blood &amp; gore. This book has crafts &amp; decorations for a very elegant adult Halloween celebration. In these projects, skulls nestle among fall leaves &amp; flowers, candles glow dramatically, &amp; silken banners flutter in the wind. The photos are lavish, the instructions are clear, &amp; the projects require only basic tools &amp; sewing skills. I've been making Halloween decorations for years, but this book had beautiful new ideas I hadn't thought of &amp; that I hadn't found in other books."},{"Title":"Halloween Crafts: Eerily Elegant Decor","review":"This is a well thought out, easy to follow book.

Finally! a Halloween craft and decorating book with not only clear, concise directions to go along with the excellent color photographs, but a plethora of wonderfully ELEGANT ideas for a &quot;spooktacular&quot; Halloween party as well. None of the overly gorey, &quot;kitchy&quot; stuff here! More like the elegance of the parties that those of the Victorian era must have enjoyed. BRAVO! and Kudos to you, Miss Rogers, PLEASE!

It seems as though most other books are &quot;little kid&quot; and &quot;cutesy,&quot; which is not my goal. However, neither is blood and gore. This book offered exactly what I sought. Many of the projects are simply outstanding, such as the &quot;Harvest of Skulls Centerpiece&quot; and the &quot;Creepy Drippy Candles.&quot; These projects, while creepy and eerie, project a degree of sophistication.I have several other Halloween books that I've gathered over the last few years, but this one is by far my favorite!!"},{"Title":"Halloween Crafts: Eerily Elegant Decor","review":"I have to reiterate what the prior reviewers have said. This is a FABULOUS book. Incredibly imaginative, yet sophisticated. I love the red gourd imps.

So often Halloween is reduced (doubtless by the presence of chain retailers that rely for profit on the kitschy) to the garish and silly--think of those stupid \\"witch-flew-into-a-tree\\" decorations. Kasey Rogers saves the day with this book, in which you can turn pumpkins into macabre \\"stone\\" settings, set up a Goblin King with his loyal subjects, light flickering Gothic candles, and enjoy a \\"harvest\\" of skulls. My favorite, though, is definitely the extremely easy to make New England-style tombstones. And next to the elegant nature of these projects, the best part is that nothing here is prefab silliness.

I didn't LOVE this book. One of the 1 star reviewers hit the nail on the head. There is just something about this book that I can't warm up to. The crafts were nice, different than most, but they were somewhat repetitive. Many, many pumpkin, squash, and gourd arrangements. There were a couple of other things interspersed, wreaths, figures, recipes. But mostly it was piles of pumpkins. And there was no joie de vive. Please excuse the French, but to say there was \\"no joy of life\\" in the book would sound a little stupid. Halloween is more a celebration of death. But most of the arrangements were dull.The two sections that caught my eye were the 'Old-Fashioned Party Fans and Favors' in Chapter 7, and Chapter 8. I have a weakness for Halloween collectibles and retro designs. And Chapter 8 had good party advice, like sticking to a theme rather than jumping all around.The authors are talented, and apparently have a feeling for the holiday, but I would like to see a little more fun, and a little less seriousness."},{"Title":"Halloween Crafts: Eerily Elegant Decor","review":"I agree with some other reviews that the plastic honey bear & \\"Aunt Jemima\\" lights are bit ... uhhhh, cheesey; however, there is tons of other stuff that is very classy and it has great photos and interesting tidbits.

I was attracted by the word \\"elegant\\" in the title, but the crafts presented are neither elegant nor very interesting. Most of those featured are more arrangements of store-bought props than anything else, and the other projects are like something you would have done in art class in grade school. I do not think making a witch nightlite out of a Mrs. Butterworth's bottle is particularly \\"elegant\\", and I found more interesting pumpkin carving ideas in the pattern books that appear in stores each year around Halloween. Again the focus was more on how make arrangements with the standard jack-o-lantern rather than on new or clever carving ideas. If you have given one serious Halloween party you have probably gone far beyond the ideas in this book (some of which seem more appropriate for Mardi gras than Halloween.)

The photos are grainy, and some of the instructions aren't all that clear, but once you get past that, it's not too bad! It has some good ideas for a Halloween first-timer like me, that will actually look a lot better than the photos in the book lead you to believe. Be warned though - most of the ideas involve pumpkins or gourds in one way or another! What this book really needs is a makeover - new photos, and a little re-working on some of the instructions, and it would be great.

(TheHalloween: The Best of Martha Stewart Livingbook is the only one of this style that I like (I own several).) One of the most annoying things about Halloween books is buying one, then finding out that you've seen every suggestion in a magazine (and weren't all that impressed the first time). As far as I know, this is a \\"from scratch\\" book, meaning that the book is the only place you'll find these projects.

Here the reader will find echoes of their own everyday life. Allen's poetry is surreal and humorous, as with the poem Jesus Christ, Roy and Ted at 7 Eleven and her experience is easily discernible in the obvious care taken over every line that is committed to the page.Donna Biffar's poetry is mature and precise. Anyone who appreciates the work of Carol Ann Duffy or Selima Hill will be drawn to Biffar. Her lines depict images of growing up, loving, and travelling through emotional maturation. Such poetry, it seems, is best written by women poets-as the feelings exposed are very specific and real.Heather Grace, the editor of this collection, is perhaps the poet who exhibits the greatest love of life. Her poems are filled with a deep inner passion for the most ordinary things. Not every poet can express this. Grace successfully makes a poem become a short film where everything can be imagined just the way the author wants us to see them. In a Caf&eacute; and Afternoons show this with clarity. Her best afternoons are &quot;shaken and stirred&quot; with imagination, just like this collection. Although she sometimes finds it hard to escape the obvious topics, such as the September 11 tragedy, Heather still reflects these topics in a much different light than an ocean of other poets would, and do. However, the main thing is-the passion is always there, even in a cup of coffee.Jan Oskar Hansen is the only poet who gives Shaken \`a non-English language' cultural angle. Although he writes in English, he has not lost the Nordic sentiment. Even in his brief interview he admits to the strong influences of Scandinavian literature, old and new. His poetry is concise and wise. The wisdom is revealed in poems Serenity - Their whisper is a gentle ripple/against the strand of time... and in others like Portrait and Homecoming, whilst the beauty of metaphors is expressed in August and Town in Italy. Hansen uses no unnecessary words.The poetry of Dazz Jackson is filled with political influences and arguments where the poet uses language to display cries for freedom, racial equality, human understanding. Such themes dominate the work of many poets, but rarely do they do so with a compassion to match Jackson's.A few stolen kisses, the beer unleashing/all sensibility and with it a truth/consuming... Truth and the hunger for it, in poetry and life, is the dominant feeling one gets after reading Athena Karnesis's poem Truth, a theme repeated in poems 1947 and Nightly Judgement. Life memories are beautifully displayed for all to bite on in The Dance and Mother's Hands, but it is the cunning use of adjectives and metaphors that makes Athena's poems so readable.\`A modern Emily Dickinson' is probably the closest description of Lyn Lifshin. Her works are mature, exact, often sharp. This is a female sharpness, one of matriarchal images, daughters, the Madonna. Uncommonly, Lifshin often becomes cold in places where one expects warmth. Conversely, she boils with passion in places where someone else (read less experienced poet) would come across as common and plain. And that unpredictability is absolute splendour as used here.Dr. Maiti uses imagery of snow, sand, sky to express his adoration for the beauty of the Asian landscape but his poems are equally filled with love of existential feeling. Calcutta is the Mecca of his poetry. The multicoloured days and streets are a stage set up for philosophical thinking.The Scottish poet, Hugh McCracken, is unlike anyone in this collection. He runs with a Henry Miller-like hunger through caf&eacute;s, concentration camps, passages of time, religion, even aliens. His poetry is the most varied in choice of topics and shows true originality. Even when one looks carefully and deeply, one cannot find strong influences of almost any poet in McCracken. He truly speaks with language of his own.Andrew J. Muller is the most mysterious poet. Obviously influenced by landscapes and travel, his poetry voyages through emotions like a Fenland train. Using rhyme in poetry can often cause predictability and vagueness, but Muller uses rhyme cunningly, and thus avoids taking the reader on an already familiar journey through clich&eacute;d language.The most gentle poetry comes from the Argentine born Carmen Ruggero. Although she is represented with only four poems, she reflects warmth and sincerity through and through. The poem for her daughter shows motherly love, whilst poems The House that Floyd Built and The Passage express cosiness and homely sentiment.Aspects of modern life and classical poetry influence Wynn Wheldon's work. He is a family man even in poetry (or perhaps he sees poetry as his own family), but the family in his mind is more than sacred. Not just plain and simple love, but the adoration of family life and actions are easily spotted in his work. His language and standpoint is both ironic and witty, and this gives real joy to the reader.Although David Whippman's poems are quite narrative, they are at the same time analytical, especially of relationships. Different Myths and Relationships in a Landscape mirror the affiliation of two souls. I hate the way the clock cuts time... the opening line of Time Piece is one of the most memorable. It perhaps sums up the aspect of time and expression as the two dimensions in which poetry resides. It certainly explains the way Whippman writes his work."},{"Title":"Shaken & Stirred","review":"This anthology features thirteen up and coming poets from all over the globe. Two of my favorite mid-western USA poets - Donna Biffer and PF Allen are well represented. Heather Grace has selected a group of poems that play off each other so well that the blending of these separate voices into one volume amplifies their song.I like seeing the work of poets I am familiar with in this anthology - letting me explore new work and new poets along side familiar friends like the haunting &quot;In Stings&quot; by PF Allen. This anthology is definitely a must have for anyone who is interested in keeping abreast of next great wave of poetic voices.These new voices include:PF Allen, Donna Biffar, Heather Grace, Jan Oskar Hansen, Dazz Jackson, Athena Karnesis, Lyn Lifshin, Prasenjit Maiti, Hugh McCracken, Andrew J. Muller, Wynn Wheldon, and David Whippman"},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"A little dose of saccharine laced with pollyanna improbability! Nevertheless, it makes for pleasant reading if somewhat dated.Suiitable for younger readers."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"This was a wonderful and heartfelt story in tune with a lot of Jane Austin novels. Easy to read and follow the lives of orphans in a very depressing Englad long ago. Enjoyable read and would recommend it to anyone"},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I picked this book because the blurb about it intrigued me and I'd never heard of this book. So far I am more than halfway through and have been enjoying it. It's a sad book though in many ways and I'm not sure it will necessarily have a 'happy ending' but it is good nonetheless."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"The book seemed to be well researched, and it was written in an interesting way. It's been a while since I read it,so I don't remember all the details, but I liked it very much."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I absolutely love this book! I am so glad I found it and wonder why I never heard of it before. It was just as exciting as my discovery of the Anne of Green Gables series and had a similar feel to it. The English Orphans was written around 1855 and is a classic rags to riches story. I was glued to my Kindle for two solid days and enjoyed the story and the characters immensely. I experienced both tears and laughter. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"A wonderful story all the way through with a most unexpected delightful surprise at the end. Character descriptions were well written and true to life."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"Enjoyable. It was sad reading about the importance of class and upbringing in older times. I'm thankful that this has, for most, changed in our modern society."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"My favorite author is Charles Dickens, and Mary Jane Holmes writes in the same style. Only difference is it didn't take me so long to get in the mode of reading her than it does with Charles Dickens (if you read Charles Dickens you will understand what I mean). I very much liked this book and have now downloaded and read Tracy Park (slightly preferred The English Orphan but perhaps it was because it was the first). I plan on downloading more of her books. If you give her books a try I don't believe you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"Mary inspires me to be a better person! She underwent so much and thought so little of herself. It's funny how small a world we actually live in and what wonders are still to be found."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I found the read a little difficult at first but after getting into it for awhile I was hooked on the story and felt propelled into that time period. I was sad to see it end and to me that is a mark of a good book."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I read this book when I was in fourth grade. I don't know where I got the book - it was old then (in the '60's.) The story is about a poor family who sail to America to make a better life. The parents get sick and die and the children are sent to the poor house. The pretty sister gets adopted by a rich family and the plain sister is left in the poor house and only later is taken in by a kind widow. The plain sister is the main character and she suffers from slights from her pretty sister who pretends not to know her. However in the end, the plain sister ends up being accomplished and kind and cultured while the pretty sister ends up being spoiled and pampered and despised. It is the classic Cinderella tale retold in a less magical manner, however just as appealing and pleasing to the sense of justice. I told the story to my daughter when she was young because I could not find the book. Then a few years ago I looked the book up on Amazon and found an original copy, which I treasure."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I was not disappointed, sometimes sad, sometimes happy but always keeping you turning the pages, I most definitely would read more of this author.You need to realize that it is set in times past, but that only sets the stage for how grateful we should be to live in the here and now.wonderful tale. a keeper.The English OrphansI went to kindle store and downloaded several more of her books and can't wait to start on them.

It was also inspirational. I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I chose to read it because it sounded interesting. As to why four starsIt was hard at first to keep track of people so many in the book was all I didnt care for. kind of dragged it out for me at first.I would tell people it was worth the read as it was a real good story."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I enjoyed this very much, and was surprised that I did. It was a nice slice of life from the 19th century which didn't concern itself with politics, the \\"Indian problem\\" or how technology was conquering the west. It was just a sweet story about young women in 19th century New England, and how a virtuous spirit bests shallow appearances. It was nicely written and sometimes a bit funny and wry. The characters are well drawn, likable, fairly believable and consistent."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I LOVE THIS AUTHOR, VERY GOOD IN DEPTH STORY. Lots of great characters. If you like Catherine Cookson you will also love Mary Jane Holmes.Great story about being an overcommer through suffering, which is what life is all about."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"So, I'm hooked! This is the first book that I've read by Mary Jane Holmes and I have to say...I'm in love with her writing style, the characters. It feels so real! I am an avid free kindle book reader and it's rare that an author comes along that really moves me. And she has. Imagine how excited I was when I saw that there at least 20 books written by her and they are all FREE! I cannot wait to read more novels by this amazing author!"},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"The title kind of gives away the fact that the children will become orphans. The time in which this story is based shows that life was hard and that people could die in a short time without medication and for unknown reasons. I enjoyed the book but had one problem with it. They pulled Mary's two front teeth but then they kept talking about how beautiful she had become! Seems a little strange to me."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"this was a very relaxing book to read...i did get involved with the characters and at times found it difficult to put down..."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"Loved it, kept my attention from the start, would recommend it highly.

Loved the characters and the unexpected twists that occurred. A good read for sure."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"It is a heartwarming story of triumph over adversary. It takes a bit to get my mind around, ye olde english speak but thoroughly enjoyed the character interaction. My minds eye was very easily able to step back into the time period."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"This was the first of three books I have started reading by Mary Jane Holmes. I never knew of her till I saw it was offered by Amazon on the kindle. Since it was free I thought I would read it.What a wonderful book it was. I enjoyed every page that I read. Her style of writing is just what I like. It keep me reading far into the night. Each person in it I got to really know.It is great to have this kindle and be able to read these classics now.Thanks to Amazon, I can enjoy alot of kindle books for free."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this first book I've read by Mary Jane Holmes. It makes me very thankful for the much easier lives that we live.I have downloaded all of the free books that she wrote and will read these first before buying her others. However, Ethelyn's Mistake will not be on my list of purchases. Why would an e-book cost $46.00? I am new to e-books, and this really stumps me."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. When she ope ned it on Christmas day the mirror was broken.I email the company the same day and was told the replacement part would be sent the next day. We have still not received the mirror and no one will answer my emails."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I am sure some would enjoy this book, but unfortunately, I am not one of those. I really couldn't get into it and didn't finish it."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was hard to understand the words at times but that doesn't take away from the story. There are many different characters in this book which makes it hard to follow at times. The ending was predictable but that didn't away from the enjoyment of following Mary from rags to riches."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"Being such an old story I read it for the purpose of seeing how it would be written but soon found myself caught up in the story. Except for a few words that are now used differently, I could have been reading a recently written book.It is a female book as it relies a great deal on the relationships between people and the good guys coming out in front but I love this stuff. Most of the characters have good and bad traits except of course for the main hero's/heroines.There is romance but not over the top it is more about the misfortunes, hardships and the overcoming of these hurdles.Great for those who like Catherine Cookson, Josephine Cox etc."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I really liked this book. It dealt with things that were really happening at that period of time. It was enlightening.Some things were sad but you saw how this individual worked very hard to work through the hardships and in the end things worked out for her life in a great way. Glad that I read it."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"Well written with developed characters and an interesting story, but unrealistic that the main character's lost relatives resided in the same city."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"The names were a little unfamilar and reading of years past having difficult times reminds us of sometimes the more things change, the more they stay the same. Depressing thought."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"This was an amazing book. I absolutely adored it. It should be a classic like Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol but that is just my opinion."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I found it a bit hard to understand the way they speak I really did enjoy the story. Still wonder why Amizon had it under Amish fiction."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"This is not the type of book I usually read but found myself lost in the story line.

It was a great read! The plot was very wholesome and touching."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I loved this book! Story plot was easy to follow. It was predicable in places but the flow from one event to another synchronized together eloquently. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I did not think I would like a book written in 1929. It is a great book though. Once started, I couldn't put it down. Great story line and characters. Highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"This, basically, was a good book as it took place at the turn of the twentieth century. Times were very different from today and some of the vocabulary used in this book was a little difficult to follow. This told the tragedies that Mary Howard faced and hoe she overcame them. The story was a bit dry at times but it was a book that was hard to put down, also."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"The story started as a slow dull story and remained slow but I was determined to finish it. It had a good story line but was a force-myself-to-finish book."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I like this. The characters are good. The plot is strong. I would recommend it. This is a quick read."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"Interesting read. Not well organized. Hurried at the end. I did enjoy it though. The heroines are sooooo good, and the villains sooooo evil."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"The setting was a time and place seldom thought about today. The circumstances were also a neglected subject matter. This was nicely done."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"Nice innocent read for the whole family.

The author had a great writing ability. I especially liked when she herself would narrate from time to time getting you from point A to point B for clarification. I didn't however enjoy all the death and sadness it touched me and at times made me cry. I recommend it, I stayed up till 3am to finish it and it was well worth it. Enjoy I will be seeking out the author's other works, it's ashame she no longer is with us but her legacy continutes in her skills as a writer."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"I have not read this book yet I chose it because the title appeals to me. But I am taking a class & haven't got to it yet."},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","review":"Poor family emigrates, parents and siblings die leaving 2 sisters,one pretty and the other studious and plain. The pretty girl falls on her feet while the other one struggles. Growing up sees their situations become more equal.....an enjoyable if not gripping read."},{"Title":"Dog in the Dungeon (Animal Ark Hauntings #3)","review":"This book has all the normal Animal Ark characters, animals in distress etc., but there is also a superb castle/dungeon type plot that all kids will love.The characters in this book are well done.My kids couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Dog in the Dungeon (Animal Ark Hauntings #3)","review":"I was forced to read this book for a children's literature class. Boy was I glad I had to read it!First, it is not as cheesy as the cover makes it look. It is very fun, and kids will love it. The characters are smart, and they inspire kids to be smart, too.I also liked how the book showed positive morals and that people need to love each other and promote positivity instead of negative attitudes.What a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"Dog in the Dungeon (Animal Ark Hauntings #3)","review":"My daughter could not stop reading this book once she had started. She loved the characters and the animals. A great holiday gift."},{"Title":"Lean Times in Lankhmar","review":"The story Adept's Gambit is one of the most moody pieces intheFafhrd and the Gray Mouser series. It contains a Lovecraftianhorror/mystery, a comical opening (in true F&amp;GM style) and a thrilling climax. It is the element of luck that plays such a refreshing part in Leiber's stories concerning the two heroes. He can give them heroic qualities galore but he keeps them grounded in semi-reality by never giving them ridiculous Conan-like abilities. Lean Times in Lankhmar is, for my money, the funniest thing Leiber ever wrote and possibly his best piece of narrative in the whole series. I'm think it's quite a feat to write a story that both mocks and celebrates religion and throws in some adventuring fun to boot."},{"Title":"Lean Times in Lankhmar","review":"Except for &quot;Adept's Gambit,&quot; a very early story by Leiber, all of the tales here are among the best short stories I have read in fantasy fiction. While Leiber's style of writing at time leans towards being a trifle florid, he nonetheless offers some of the most richly phrased descriptive narrative and inventive characters and settings one could find, and I think one would be hard-pressed to call any of his work tiring or lacking imaginative interest. These stories belong on the shelf of any serious fantasy reader, so I am sad to see they've gone out of print."},{"Title":"Lean Times in Lankhmar","review":"I really enjoyed the Cloud of Hate - Lean Times..., and Stardock - The two best thieves... - and The Lords of Quarmall sections, of this second book of the series, more than the Adept's Gambit - and associated parts. All of it was good, but the lastly mentioned - mid section - was rather contrived and inconsistent in style, the thirty year gap in the creation of some of the linking parts not helping. Maybe if they had been placed more strategically they would have worked better in the overall scheme. Anyhow, the more appealing sections are important, since elements from them are used extensively as future references within the last two books of the series, Return to Lankhmar, and Farewell to Lankhmar. So these must be read."},{"Title":"Lean Times in Lankhmar","review":"This book includes two of the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser books. Swords in the Mist and Swords against Devilry. In the former is a short novel called Adept's Gambit. Which happens of F&amp;GM's world of Nehwon and on ours during Hellenistic times. Like most of F&amp;GM's stories it combines swashbuckling action with comedy and horror"},{"Title":"Lean Times in Lankhmar","review":"Fun, exiting, I have read it three times in two years. I love to imagine the world in which Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser run around, drink, get women, and fight harrowing duels with any villian one can imagine."},{"Title":"Lean Times in Lankhmar","review":"Leiber is a classic Fantasy writer. He's right up there with Moorcock. His characters and plots are detailed, and he's not afraid to stray away from the typical &quot;knight-in-shining armor&quot; character."},{"Title":"Lean Times in Lankhmar","review":"Even though I consider myself a fantasy fan extraordinaire, it took me over 20 years of reading to finally get to some of the seminal masterworks, namely the works of Fritz Leiber, in \\"Ill Met in Lankhmar\\" and \\"Lean Times in Lankhmar\\". Although I would not consider these books among my all, all-time favorites, I am certainly glad I finally got to them, if only for their historical significance.I think that my favorite facet of these stories is trying to decide which characters and/or stories of more contemporary fantasy were based, to some degree at least, on Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. My prime candidate is the delightful \\"Garrett, PI\\" series by Glen Cook. Mr. Cook's city of Tunfaire is every bit the den of iniquity that Lankhmar is. I'd also put the roguish, yet possessed of a heart of gold, Indiana Jones in this category. I could be dead wrong, and there are probably many others, but these are the ones that I was reminded of.As I said, I'm glad I read the first two books and am anxiously looking forward to finding and reading the remaining tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser."},{"Title":"Lean Times in Lankhmar","review":"Sure, Fafhrd &amp; the Mouser are great, but whose bright idea was to change the formerly cool and moody covers to these hideous new affairs? Now they look exactly like any number of mediocre fantasy littering the shelves, rather than being distinguished as the groundbreaking classics they are. Bah, I say! A thousand times bah!"},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have had this book for some years now and also had the privelege to hear Mr Perdomo speak his poems. I NEVER grow tired of reading this book and I have read it many times since I bought it. The city comes to life through his words. I feel his love and admiration for his culture and his people when I read this book. It is beautiful."},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I read Willie Perdomo's poem about being a black latino in a book called &quot;Boricuas: Influential Puerto Rican Writings&quot; I knew that I had to read more of his poems. This book is the best poetry book I have ever read. I love it! Thanks Willie! You deserve to be called a great influential Puerto Rican writer! This shout out is coming from a Dominican brother! (Vaya!) who knows your pain."},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"An incredible book by a wonderful writer. It's not easy reading - it will shake you up but good. But if that's what you're looking for - hop to it!"},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Read it again and again -- always out loud -- and the extraordinary rhythms of Willie Perdomo's powerful poems will reach inside and grip your imagination. I never tire of picking this small volume up and enter once more New York City and the neighborhood of el barrio. The sounds of the streets, the cadence of young men and women as they boast and speak their affections, the sights of a Manhattan many visitors never see, all are integral to these poems. You'll be confronted with racism and poverty and violence. But, you'll equally face love and loyalty, family and hope. One of my students at the college in which I teach originally introduced Perdomo to me and I've been eager to share him with others ever since."},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A couple of years back, a friend of mine gave me a grocery bag full of books. I found an exquisite piece of work beneath the pile - Where a Nickel Costs a Dime. I live down south - way south and life here can be homogenous. With this book, I saw el barrio without leaving mine. I walked up 125th street without moving my feet. I cried, lived and died in Harlem. The collection of images is sharp. I won't compare Willie Perdomo to anyone else. No se puede. (He can't be.)Where a Nickel Costs a Dime - a must."},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Willie Perdomo uses the language and flow of the people living and experiencing life in el barrio &amp; the hood and introduces them to the masses. His style speaks to all who read him. It's as if wants to paint you a picture and include you in his recollections. I'm definitely feelin' him!"},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have to agree with some of the others. Willie Perdomo is a gifted and talented voice. I recommend that people who buy this go ahead and buy Smoking Lovely. The combination of the two is very powerful"},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love the poems in this book, particularly one called &quot;Postcards of El Barrio&quot;.Favorite line : the violent revolutions of red and white police sirens upset the sky blue peace of neon crucifixionsThese poems have a rhythm and a style than can only come from years of being exposed to life in the mean streets of El Barrio. So be aware, you'll need an inner city bent to fully appreciate the language in this book. But, there is no denying the lyricism in its pages.As for the performance CD included, it's not bad, but it feels like Perdomo is reading it at a break-neck pace. It makes it tough to sit back and appreciate his words.All in all, this is a great book. Worth the money."},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read Willie's collection of poems, and as usual found him to be very deep, inspiring, and intuitive. When I use words like, &quot;blast from the past&quot;, and &quot;as usual&quot;, it is based on a familiarity of the author. Willie Perdomo and I went to the same college, and we were good friends. He used to read poetry to his circle of friends at college, and everyone had nothing but the upmost respect for him. He has, a way with words that captures your attention and forces you to think. Bravo, Willie on your successful book. May you continue to dominate and implode the literary world with your thoughts on latino/latina struggles."},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Willie Perdomo is an incredible talent. His poetry speaks clearly of a world that is under-explored in literature."},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"there's no way to be lukewarm about this book. It's a raw and beautiful lyric, and always so specific. Whenever I open \\"Where A Nickel Costs a Dime\\" , Willie is in the room. And he owns the room. until the moment I've finished the book again, and set it away."},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"How could Amazon.com post such a scornful, personal review of a literary work? I live in the neighborhood where Willie Perdomo was raised and he is definitely not a disgrace to his people and his neighborhood. If I had a nickel for every time I heard a young and old Puerto Rican or African-American man or woman say they read his book and were affected, I would be rich. And now he is making contributions to children's literature with a new picture book called VISITING LANGSTON. People from all communities respect Willie and what he stands for. I buy this book regularly for people who live in our inner cities and need a witness. Please, the next time someone tries to post any kind of vicious attack on an author and his work, please refer to them to a therapist. Next thing you know he'll have a rabbit boiling in his kitchen. TCB"},{"Title":"Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I wrote an earlier note on this under a different account but just wanted to add to that under this new account. I first came across Willie and his work live at SOB's back in 1996, right before this book was published. I'd been to a couple of poetry slams at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and enjoyed them but hearing Willie was the first time poetry ever really connected for me. I FELT what Willie was saying - related to it like he was one of my boys - but at the same time realized that THIS WAS POETRY! It was a revelation for me as a fledgling writer looking for my own voice and, as a more established writer these days, I can honestly say that that is the most you can hope for from your writing - to touch someone deeply. Buy this book now!"},{"Title":"Madam: Inside a Nevada Brothel","review":"A fantastic book! A book of insights and deep dark secrets, offering the reader the most sumptuous feast of a novel to ever emerge from this &quot;other&quot; side of life. A true roller-coaster of emotions evoking laughter and compassionate tears at the same time. I devoured each page, staying up 'til the wee hours of morning with this one-of-a-kind find. Where has this author been all my life?? Read this book and be prepared to discover stories which have never previously existed in the world of literature! They're delicious, funny, sensual, painful and some are outright unbelievable! Overall, it's an outstanding contribution to our real understanding of the deeper processes that shape all our lives, because it reveals the human side of prostitution. Like others, I thought of prostitutes as dirty, misguided and low-life's. Those who patronized them were just as despicable in my mind. But of course, I knew nothing of the real facts until I read Madam. I had never thought about the disabled, disfigured, paraplegics or the mentally retarded who may never experience the human touch, a hug or being held in a woman's arms,except when they visit bothels and the women/prostitutes who are with them emotionally as well as physically. Most women I know, myself included, would not have the level of compassion it would take to hold a severely retarded man in her arms, while he drooled and jerked all over her! The book paints both sides of the story, the good, the bad and the ugly. It's all so very fascinating and a real learning experience. I felt like I was watching the entire brothel operation through the Madam's eyes and heart. Thank you, thank you for an unforgettable experience and life-lesson!"},{"Title":"Madam: Inside a Nevada Brothel","review":"Shaner takes you inside to the very center of the brothel from the women who work there, to the customers to the mundane but necessary operations that keep the whole thing afloat. She even dares to tackle the subject of systematic racism in this industry, which is something I have NEVER seen done in any other book on this issue. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because in the beginning, Shaner uses a lot of obvious puns and one-liners that are irritating and distracting to read. Once you get past that,however, this is a very informative book."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"The Big Moo sets us at the edge of a cliff and says \\"you've got two options: jump and do something remarkable or stay seated as time goes by, and envying people who dares to jump. So, what's your choice?\\"This is a book addressed to everyone, a book that make us think in improving the way we do things, not only professionally, but also in our personal life. Although it is sometimes far from reality and too close to a dreamer's vision of the workplace, it explores and shakes our comfort zone and the limits of it. The Big Moo asks for changes in the approach, in the way we face things in everyday life, and it asks for it shouting!It's an enthusiastic, inspirational and positive reading which message says \\"do things according to yourself and your beliefs, and the most important, do them now!\\".I surely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"Like a bell shaped curve, the stories are NORMALLY distributed in this book. Some are worthless, some are priceless, and most are average. Some are brilliant, and others beg you to question the mental stability or egos of the authors (hehe). Seth Godin wrote about being a purple cow in your herd of average cows. But one day, someone mentioned to him that it is not enough to be a purple cow if you don't have a BIG MOO to tell people, to mentor, and to generally publicize your ideas. To be remarkable, your have to be REMARK-able. Others have to hear you so that they can REMARK about your ideas. Some people have good publicists at work; so if you have a good idea, it is not enough to toil in silence. Therefore, Mr. Godin asked 33 of his favorite business leaders and pundits to contribute short bite sized, easily readable tips on how to have a BIG MOO, how to evangelize, believe, communicate, execute, and like a giraffe, stick your neck out. Even if you come away with 2 sustainable ideas, the book is worthwhileMr Godin does not let you know the names of each contributor, and the stories are not organized; so you are unable to prejudice your reading (or is it a forced skimming) of the tips by who the author was.Each reader will get something different from reading this book, since each reader is at a different place in their careers and needs. Some highlights for me were the stories of people who defied convention and became remarkable, and the short pieces on Dr. Apgar's \\"Apgar\\" test for newborns, an idea that spread worldwide without any marketing budgets; Newton, who spent most of his time on calculus, but he is best known for his ideas on gravity, because he named it (gravitas).. so you should name something and be remembered for it; Bob Fosse, who had reduced flexibility, poor posture and bad feet; that new hires, after their 3 month anniversary, sometimes have great new ideas for your firm; and the story that compares the careers of Chevy Chase and Bill Murray, which relates the idea that remarkable doesnt neccessarily mean \\"right now.\\""},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"This book is terrible.

So I decided to do a bit of research and landed on their site (http://www.remarkabalize.com), where I discovered the really cool part about the book and its message: the book can be customized with your company's logo, message, and forward for the same price as listed here. I bought the book for clients, employees, friends, and family. The book's message is outstanding-it's about innovation, growth, and inspires a generation of the remarkable within your company. Very cool stuff. A must read for those with a creative entrepreneurial spirit."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"Seth Godin decided to do something remarkable.He thought, \\"Why not publish a book written by 33 people that doesn't make a dime of profit?\\"Why not?The result is The Big Moo, an anthology of 72 short, pithy essays covering everything from a list comparing big companies vs. startups, to a lesson on leadership learned in a redwood forest, to what a Colorado roofer did right, to what a local print shop did wrong.The chapters bounce around all those topics and more, but all relate to the core idea of being remarkable. Godin defines remarkable, in business or personal life, as doing something not good, and not perfect, but that stands out, that causes people to start talking, \\"remarking\\" about it. In other words, not only do you have to stand out (as he wrote about in a previous book The Purple Cow), but you have to do something really out of the ordinary, remarkable, a.k.a. \\"The Big Moo.\\" He says that the real challenge before us is to do something truly remarkable with our work and our lives. The Big Moo doesn't pretend to be a step by step guide to guaranteed remarkability, but instead is a freewheeling brainstorming session to whet your appetite and spark your creativity toward creating your own remarkable life.The book itself is the prime example of doing the remarkable. The editor, Seth Godin, approached 32 people, some famous like Tom Peters and Guy Kawasaki, and others famous only to the people they have impacted. He asked them to contribute material to the book for free, with the agreement that all the book's profits go to charity. On top of that, all the material is anonymous, so that you're not sure who wrote which chapter. Remarkable.How I received the book is an example of the ripple effect of remarkability that Godin is aiming for. My copy came from Glen Tullman, the CEO of Allscripts. When his company read the book, they asked the question, \\"What can we do remarkable?\\" The result of asking that question is a new collaborative initiative that Allscripts has launched that will provide the ability for every physician in America to use electronic prescription prescribing completely FREE, which is absolutely unheard of. Now that's remarkable.The Big Moo is a quick and fun read, sure to give you some good food for thought for your own remarkable life."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"For a book that's about being remarkable, it's ironic that this is so unexciting. The book had a lot of potential - but with the exception of two or three pages, it's a huge letdown."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"This book is a collection of random very short chapters by various authors. Essentially they will tell you the sun rises every day, if it rains you'll get wet and so forth... it's amazing that still nowadays the press gets mad over such things. It's time to scream \\"The King Is Naked\\"!"},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"For people who have read my other reviews, or heard me speak, you will know I have a great fondness for author Seth Godin. I have read his books for years, and his thoughts and messages are always valuable. He certainly is not the deepest thinker when it comes to marketing, but he does offer a fresh approach as to how to effectively get your message heard. The Big Moo is a Seth Godin edited book. He invited 33 business, marketing, thought leaders, etc. to write a short essay (usually 1-2 pages each) on how they think businesses will prosper in the next five, ten, fifteen years. Seth never does anything in the norm, and this book is no exception. When you read the 33 essays, they are uncredited. While he does tell you who the 33 authors are, he does not tell you what they wrote. I'm not sure what his purpose was, and I'm not sure it matters whether you know or don't know. It is just Seth being Seth. The message that the book puts forth is the fact that you, or your company, can't just be good, or even great. You have to be remarkable if you are going to stand out from the crowd. This is a quick read, and I do recommend it. As is true with all of Seth's books, if you walk away with one idea that helps make you remarkable, it is worth the $19.95 that you pay for the book. By the way, it should be mentioned that all of the profits generated by this book are going to charity, and none of the 33 thought leaders were paid for their essays."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"I am a big fan of Seth Godin. I have found something valuable and practicably applicable in each of his books on marketing and innovation. I regularly read his Blog as a way of keeping my mind sharp when it comes to think about issues of marketing and branding. I love his latest project - \\"The Big Moo.\\"A few months ago, Seth contacted 32 of the most creative business thinkers, thought leaders, writers and innovators and challenged each of them to contribute a short essay that would be compiled into a book about how to be truly remarkable in business. The profits for the book project would all go to charity -The Juvenile Diabetes Research FoundationThe Acumen FundRoom to ReadEach of the authors immediately agreed to participate, and the resulting book - The Big Moo - will be published in the next few weeks and available on Amazon.com and in bookstores everywhere.Many of the contributors to the project are individuals whose work I already know and admire - Malcolm Gladwell, Tom Peters, Daniel Pink, Dave Balter and Seth Godin himself. Each writer was willing to leave his or her ego \\"at the door,\\" since the resulting 33 essays are printed without author attribution. I have just finished reading a pre-publication copy of the book and found it to contains some very helpful and encouraging nuggets that spur my own ideas of how to work on being \\"remarkable.\\"As an appetizer, let me share some ideas that grabbed me from just two of the essays:From the chapter: Fire The GatekeepersIn California, Hyland Baron, an independent arts, economic and urban-development-oriented community organizer, reads the Oakland Times religiously. She underlines people's names, details about projects, and other useful information. Then she writes those people e-mails or calls them on the phone with recommended resources, incentives for introductions, and other expressions of support and congratulations.I do the same thing. If I read a book I've found personally or professionally important and useful, I try to track down the author. If a piece of music affects me, I reach out to thank the artist for their effort. And if I want to meet, learn more from, or help someone I encounter on-line or off-line, I write to them.I do this, not as a fan but as a comrade, as a coconspirator. Because if someone else's work has improved my life or my work, it is my responsibility as a consumer, customer, fellow creator to help improve their lives and work in kind. . . .Such an approach to life requires an assumption of indirect reciprocity. We must assume that the people who makes things happen are visible, accessible, and responsible to those who use their tools to make still more things happen. It also suggests that we need to open ourselves to such outreach from those who wish to approach us. (pages 111-113)* * * * *Amen! I feel as though I could have written many of these words myself, since they reflect the modus operandi I have adopted over the past several years. My life has been immeasurably enriched from conversations and correspondence that have resulted from my having taken the risk to reach out to authors and personalities such as Seth Godin, Dan Pink, Malcolm Gladwell, Kelly Perdew, John Irving, Michael Abrashoff, Admiral Bill Owens, James Webb, Duncan Watts, David Lipsky, et al. I also make it a regular practice to offer feedback to actors and directors when I attend theater events, and to musicians when I attend live performances.From the chapter, Stop Being Ordinary, I liked these five practical suggestions for behaving remarkably:1) Avidly Collect Firsthand Experiences - Be your own Sherlock Holmes. Take pains to observe and understand nuances from the front lines of your business . . . A.G. Lafley, CEO of $50 billion Procter & Gamble still regularly finds time to visit individual homes and talk with customers to keep current on what really matters to people.2) Practice the Zen Principle of \\"Beginner's Mind.\\" - People with a thirst for learning can momentarily set aside what they \\"know.\\" They often have extensive academic backgrounds and ample professional experience, but they manage to look past tradition and preconceived notions. They're confident in their knowledge, yet willing to challenge it when confronted with new information.3) Keep an \\"Idea Wallet\\" So You Don't Lose Momentary Insights - Real-world anthropologists carry a field notebook and a camera to record their discoveries. Try recording ideas in real time - on your PDA, or even on a folded sheet of paper you keep in your back pocket.4) Embrace the Power of Storytelling to Bring It All Together - Storytelling has an emotional appeal that trumps all the raw data in the world. Medtronic, a blue-chip medical-technology company, reports that when their teams need an extra spark, they bring in patients and ask them to talk about how a Medtronic product changed their lives. The results are positively electric. These life-affirming stories leave hardly a dry eye in the house, and the entire Medtronic team returns to work with a renewed energy, motivated to do their absolute best.* * * *I plan to purchase multiple copies of \\"The Big Moo\\" to give to colleagues and clients as holiday gifts. In that way everyone wins - the giver of the gift, the recipients and the charities whose work is being supported by this worthy publishing project.

These ideas can apply to a business, team, project or an individual. I have several ideas that I will implement as a result of my initial reading.It is a follow-up, of sorts to Seth Godin's Purple Cow . Rather than just talking about being remarkable, it is remarkable itself in at least five ways:* It is written by 33 people (including people like Tom Peters and Mark Cuban among others I don't know) and edited by Seth Godin. How many books have you read with 33 authors?* None of the chapters are attributed to an individual, though I am sure the chapters were largely submitted by the individuals, and not written in collaboration.* Each person on Godin's original list ideal contributors said yes - 100%.* All of the proceeds will go to charity.* And, the book has been released as an uncorrected proof. Godin, the editor and project leader, got the publisher to allow sales of the pre-production version of the book if people bought a large quantity as a way to spread the word about the book (This is probably a first.)The chapters are more like short essays and seldom longer than three pages, making this an ideal book for reading a quick few pages while waiting in line or between meetings.

It turns out that there is no apparent limit to the degree of atrocity of the rubbish that can be generated (and printed) in an \\"unprecedented collaboration of the world's smartest business thinkers\\". Despite the separation of material in this book into separate chapters, there is no individual attribution of responsibility for the individual chapters. This is not a good sign.Seth Godin, the nominal 'editor', obviously sees no problem in publishing a book which, for any concrete piece of strategic advice that is included, hedges its bets by also advising the diametrically opposing strategy. Thus, to succeed companies should:1a. Stick with what they know and do it well. (Focusing on your specialty is key).1b. Not get stuck in the rut of what they know, they should branch out. (Focusing on your specialty is fatal)2a. (page 23) \\"ignore your customers\\" (the customer is ignorant and wrong).2b. (page 64) the customer is always right.3a. (page 31) \\"Every organization that gets into trouble falters because it waited too long to change...\\". (urgency is crucial)3b. (page 136) \\"Remarkable doesn't always mean right now\\" (urgency is detrimental).And so on. Because chapter authors are not individually identified, should your coin toss happen to choose the wrong option between 1a and 1b, 2a and 2b, 3a and 3b, there can be no assignable blame.However, at least the examples above have the virtue of giving concrete, specific advice. If that makes you nervous, there is also plenty of this kind of gibberish:Plant rocks.Embrace the power of storytelling.Ignore the regulations. (I'm trying to imagine how this would play out in, say, the pharmaceutical or biotech industries).Imagine there's a tiger loose in your office. Breathe the fear. Fear is good.You are not a cog. You are not ordinary. In fact, you are remarkable.But if you're dumb enough to buy this book, you're a complete moron. Even by the extraordinarily lax standards for business advice books, it sets a new low.Zero stars."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"Seth Godin, editor of the book, has collected 33 inspiring ideas and they become _The Big Moo_. The Group of 33, as the book references these successful business people, includes Mark Cuban, Dave Balter, Malcolm Gladwell, Tom Peters, and Guy Kawasaki. The aim of the stories or ideas is to show what it takes to become remarkable.The book's title comes from Godin's previous best seller, _Purple Cow_ which shows how to stand out in a world of brown cows. According to the book's synopsis, \\"... sometimes you need something even bigger than a purple cow. You need a big moo &mdash; an insight so astounding that people can't help but remark on it.\\"While _Purple Cow_ focuses on standing out, it lacks the second and very important step &mdash; getting others to talk about your business. Standing out alone doesn't lead to business. How do people find out about you? That's what _The Big Moo_ is about &mdash; sharing ideas and real-life examples of how to get people talking.\\"Some Things Just Don't Translate\\" points that the way we see our products may not be the way customers see them. Sounds obvious, but it isn't. An Italian in the house ware business opened a store in the U.S. His foot traffic wasn't match by sales. He observed his customers and remained baffled as to why they were looking and taking an interest, but not buying.He asked a customer how she liked the store and merchandise. It turned out that what Americans considered vases, Italians saw as glasses &mdash; and vice versa. The owner, of course, was selling glasses of six in a case and vases as singles. Americans didn't want to buy six vases &mdash; they could've bought six glasses with ease, though. This type of valuable advice appears throughout the book.Most essays clearly get the point across although a couple aren't as strong. The book does what it sets out to do: motivate the reader to get out there to put ideas to work to develop a remarkable organization that gets everyone buzzing.Though the book explains the contributors gave up their by-lines for the book, I would've liked to know who wrote each story. There's no way to guess who wrote which story as few of them relate to the businesses associated with the people. What does knowing who wrote it do for me? It tells me who made the observation or how the person thinks. It's like sharing a quote without the author's name.It's an easy, gratifying, and fast read. I read the whole thing in about an hour. Each essay is about two pages on the average. All the proceeds from the book go to three charities."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"I can't stand self-help books in which the author does no more than serve up a laundry list of ideas with no coherent thread. \\"The Big Moo\\" takes this one step further by having 33 authors (not properly credited) each serve up one item for the laundry list. Seth Godin said he did not identify which author wrote which chapter \\"because it makes it easier to read the book as a whole, to avoid being interrupted by the noise your brain makes as it shifts gears from one voice to another.\\" What nonsense! Just because the author of each chapter is not identified does not mean there is a common voice from chapter to chapter. Each chapter is unrelated to the others and there is no development from one chapter to the next. \\"The Big MOO\\" gets a big BOO!P.S. I wanted to give it zero stars but that's not allowed."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"Q: What's this book all about?Godin: This is a book about how and why to grow. It's not a book of facts or logical reasoning. Instead of lecturing you about how important and wonderful it is to do scary, brave, and remarkable things, [this book] paints a very different picture for you. My colleagues and I are intent on slipping some subversive ideas into your subconscious...ideas that will help you dream bigger dreams (though they might cost you some sleep as well). We believe one way to get past [what we call] the growth paradox is to avoid addressing it head-on. Instead of warning you about the dangers of stagnation, or promising you benefits of growth, we've decided to tell you some exemplary stories instead. Stories that are easy to read, memorable, and, most important, useful parables for putting growth to work in your own organization.Q: What's the \\"growth paradox\\"?Godin: Most organizations are paralyzed, stuck in a rut, staring at the growth paradox. On one hand, they understand all the good things that will come with growth. On the other, they're afraid, petrified that growth means change, change means risk, and risk could mean death. Nobody wants to screw up and ruin a good thing, so the organization just sits there, motionless.Q: Individual contributions by your 33 colleagues aren't credited. Pretty unusual, perhaps even remarkable. You identify them. Why not credit them?Godin: We did it because it makes it easier to read the book as a whole, to avoid being interrupted by the noise your brain makes as it shifts gears from one voice to another. That and it lets you guess who wrote what.Those who have read any of Godin's earlier works already know that his thinking is highly unconventional as he relentlessly asks conventional questions such as Why? Why not? Are you sure? How do you know? What if? Have you thought about...? He delights to churning up waves atop gray matter. Heaven knows, he has opinions of his own. Also opinions about those opinions. However, to me, his greatest value as a thinker is his role as what I call a \\"provocateur of the intellect.\\" That is to say, most of his best ideas focus on how to help others to formulate their own best ideas.What we have in this volume is a synthesis but NOT a homogenization of what 33 business thinkers have to say in response to two questions:1. If being remarkable is the only way to grow, how to become remarkable?2. If the only barrier to being remarkable is one's ability to persuade associates to make it happen, how to do that?It would be inaccurate to say that the responses are \\"all over the map\\" because, in fact, there is no \\"map.\\" Within the responses, however, are what can correctly be viewed as time capsules of intellectual stimulation. Their impact will vary from one reader to the next. For me, some had significant impact; others none whatsoever.When we first see a purple cow, it is remarkable. But after seeing hundreds....What is remarkable this morning is merely familiar tomorrow (or this afternoon) and ho-hum thereafter. According to Godin, \\"A big moo is an extreme purple cow, the remarkable innovation that completely changes the game....Yes, a purple cow is what you need, but the big moo goes a step further. In order to grow [whatever] at the pace the markets demand, you and your colleagues must find the big moo, the insight that is so astounding that people can't help but remark on it.\\" I agree, while presuming to suggest that the process of \\"remarkability\\" proceeds at a high rate of speed. To repeat, what is remarkable this morning is merely familiar tomorrow (or this afternoon) and ho-hum thereafter.Ultimately and inevitably, the value of what Godin and his colleagues offer in this book will be determined entirely by the value of the ideas which they generate in the conscious and, more importantly, the unconscious mind of each reader."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"The Big Moo has truly become a cornerstone of the corporate culture at my organization. We ordered customized copies of the book from http://www.remarkabalize.com, where we had our logo, personalized message, and custom-made forward put right on the book to give as gifts to our clients and employees. It seems to have really struck a chord with everyone we've passed it on to-which has only made our personal message and brand identity stronger as a result. Corporate communications are so important these days for every industry; unfortunately, the tools out there today seem to be moving in the direction of the mundane and lackluster, with nothing truly getting through to your key audience. The Big Moo was our answer-it's chock-full of innovation and inspiration with the added benefit of our personal message to really drive home our objectives. Now everyone's mooing-mission accomplished."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"With great anticipation, I opened my copy of The Big Moo, a new book that was masterminded by Seth Godin and his collaboration with the 32 other co-authors.The range of emotions the book evoked in me was incredible--excitement, disgust, inspiration, sadness, regret, optimism, intrigue--just to name a few. I was unable to sleep until I finished it, and am still contemplating the passages and thinking about it (instead of sleeping). In many ways, I feel like Seth and the other authors did share \\"the secrets\\" that many of us seek. At times while reading it, I did not want to tell anyone else I know about it. However, I was won over by my belief that the more who understand and strive for The Big Moo, the better all of our lives will be.To \\"The Group of 33\\":Thank you!...for reminding me that trying to make a difference, change and improve things is worth the struggle....for validating that individual conversations are important, and listening is the most critical element....for sharing your personal insights and experiences through wonderful stories, metaphors and maxims....for quelling my frustration from the many unanswered \\"why\\" questions I have posed to vendors, bosses, co-workers and others. It is a whole lot clearer now....for assuring me that opportunities are worth pursuing, customers are worth dazzling, and the experience is the reward.To Everyone:Don't buy into the notions of comfortable, security and stability.Don't wait, or tomorrow may not come for you.Don't let your passion die."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"Seeing the cover's impressive list of authors (\\"The Group of 33\\" as Godin labels them), I was excited to read clips of their wisdom. I had the faith to bring it as my sole book to read on a five hour flight. Big mistake. Turns out the book is just a watered down version of Godin's same couple of ideas that he's put in about 10 other books. None of the writing or stories (which were cheesy) were attributed to any of the 33 other \\"authors\\" individually. It's hard to believe all 33 of these well accomplished and opinionated people agreed on these ideas or collaborated in coming up with these light tidbits that have been articulated by Godin in the past. I get the sense that Godin just wrote this book in about two hours, asked a bunch of his friends if he could stick their names on the cover, and sent it to the publisher."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"Here is the first few lines of the chapter beginning on page 162:Play is tactile...

The results, as expected, is a hodgepodge of slop mixed with a few gems. Many of the short (2-4 page) passages read like some busy author quickly jotted something down in 30 minutes. An example - one author (none of the articles names the offending author) writes that the secret of being remarkable boils down to three things - practice, make sure you understand what is being said, ignore the experts. Or something like that. Very trite.On the other hand, there are a few gems. I loved the short passage on why good ideas are pinned down by corporate gravity, and what you need to do to achieve escape velocity.Overall, this was a quick read. I breezed through it in about 90 minutes. And most of the passages lacked insight, or were carelessly thrown together, or were purely theoretical with no evidence that this is what worked. Many of the articles were contradictory. One author writes \\"never compromise to satisfy the critics\\" while another writes \\"expect your idea to be molded and shaped as it works its way through the layers of approval\\". So which is it?I can see why Godin withheld the authors' names from these articles. He didn't want to embarass anybody, but he still needed to put a book together. In summary - this book doesn't have enough meat on its bones to be considered a whole cow."},{"Title":"The Big Moo : Stop Trying to Be Perfect and Start Being Remarkable","review":"I've been going through a phase of reading business books lately, and this one stands out for a few reasons. Firstly, it is divided into roughly 70 stories by 33 authors, each only a page or two long. Good for those of us with ADD. None of the stories list their author so you just have to guess. Some are very easy to pin down, for example there is a chart that is straight out of Guy Kawasaki's book Art of the Start (also worth reading). Most of the rest I may never be able to figure out. The amazing thing is that these stories actually flow together quite nicely, and entire sections sound as if they were written by a single person.The cover says the book is themed around how to make your organization remarkable. While these stories aren't a step-by-step guide to achieving this(has anyone ever tried writing one?), they do provide a good jumping off point. All are inspirational, and many are very subversive.

The copy I have is in Japanese, and knowing that it was translated into Japanese from the original English text, both my sister and I were interested in finding the English version, which I just found and ordered from Amazon.Half way through the book, I am fascinated to read about the many daily and seasonal rituals that were historically embedded in Japanese life. Today, many of these rituals and ceremonies have been either forgotten or so truncated that almost no one knows what they were for, and how they were done properly. It's a shame to think of the loss of these beautiful and respectful practices, and a lot of her book has to do with the theme of lost times. Also just having seen the \\"The Art of the Samurai\\" exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, this book gives you an idea of how so many of the amazing pieces of armour were sold by samurai families in a state of acute economic decline. It made me think of the curious journeys that all the exhibit pieces must have made from the hands of the original owners.The book is altogether elegant, quaint and very touching (all based on the Japanese version but I am sure the same can be said of the English original).

I give it 4-1/4 stars.THE COURSE OF EMPIRE reminds me a lot of the later books from the alternative history/future series involving an Alien invasion of Earth, written by Harry Turtledove. The big differences are that the aliens are \\"seal-like\\" instead of \\"lizard-like\\", that they do a more thorough job of conquering the planet, and that there is a third more threatening alien menace thrown into the fray.This is the first book that I've read that was written by two authors. The size of SciFi books have increased over the years to the point where it makes sense to have a \\"team\\" of authors to help add size and different viewpoints to these huge stories. Usually I could tell which passages were written by which author - and, in general, I'd say I'd prefer the passages from Eric Flint, but not always - there were a couple of passages, which I'm sure was authored by K. D. Wentworth, which involve some sentimental interactions with the aliens, and they were quite touching for SciFi (I've previously found only Flowers for Algernon to be a SciFi tear-jerker).Unfortunately, these great passages were offset by some technical errors in editing and content, again occurring in the parts that were seemingly written by Wentworth. For example, at one point, a human military officer comes in a Humvee to pick up lead heroine Caitlain, and \\"Jao-style\\", reaches over to unclick the door for her main passenger, while the others climb in a back door - I've been in a military HMMWV, and first of all, the driver can't simply reach over the super-wide center radio console to get to the passenger door; secondly, you don't just click the door open like in a regular car - the HMMWV door mechanisms aren't that easy to operate; and thirdly, two people can't climb in one back door, also due to the center console separation - so, we obviously have someone trying to write about occurrances at a military base, but who doesn't know the first thing about things military... I just wonder, how do mistakes like that get by two authors and the editors?Anyway, the book is generally of quite high quality, and I do recommend it."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"Excellent story full of interesting characters (human and alien) and thought-provoking situations. Very convincing depiction of an alien species (Jao) with some truly unwordly attitudes. A long book (650+ pages), but I was sorry to see it end. I do hope the authors consider a sequel.The only criticism I might find is that the plot became a bit over the top towards the end. But by that time I was completely hooked!There are very few books I would recommend without reservation, and this is one."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"Although it was conquered twenty years earlier, Earth remains restive--and the cruel and unimaginative Jao governor manages to stir up resistance--which he ruthlessly but casually puts down. With control of space, the Jao cannot really be threatened by humans--but they can prevent the Jao from using the planet's resources for their own conflict. And the Jao do have a problem--the Ekhat race threatens to overwhelm the entire galaxy, eliminating all other life. Survival requires humans to work together with the Jao--but the Jao governor seems to have eliminated that possibility.Into the equation comes Aille, a high-status Jao who has been assigned as sub-commander, responsible for ground-based planetary defenses. Aille upsets the equilibrium established by the Jao governor, accepting both Jao and humans into his 'personal service,' and looking for ways that human technology and tactics can add to the Jao ways rather than requiring humans to become the type of mini-Jao that other conquered species became. But by doing so, Aille simply earns himself the hatred of the planetary governor. Disobeying orders will make Aille outlaw and destroy everything he's worked for, but following orders seems to lead to an even worse situation.Authors Eric Flint and K. D. Wentworth combine to deliver a fascinating tale of colliding cultures. Flint and Wentworth personalize their story with multidimensional characters--both Jao and human, giving the reader an emotional stake in the outcome. Their descriptions of Jao customs and communications patterns add interest and deepens the story.The role of empire, whether human or alien, is complex with the conquering people being influenced by their conquests as well as influencing them. Flint and Wentworth have obviously given this subject a lot of thought--adding to the richness of their world-building and reader interest.I have no hesitation in recommending THE COURSE OF EMPIRE."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"This was the first book I have read by either Eric Flint or K.D. Wentworth and I must say that I was hooked from the beginning. The concept seemed fresh to be, man meets alien conquerors and fails to defeat them. This does not conform to the normal style of military sci-fi that I read. There isn't a whole lot of action, there is some and it is well written. The real catch of the book though is the characters. The Jao are an extremely well thought out race of aliens. They are different enough to not be human but similar enough that they are can be reasoned with to a degree. The aliens have their own culture/society that dosn't always mesh well with human culture/society. Aille, the storys main character, grows and learns from his time on Earth and the people that he associates with. I highly recommend this book to any sci-fi fan and I can't wait till the sequel is released.One more thing, the space battle in the sun's photosphere is super cool."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"I'm constantly on the prowl for sci-fi portraying convincing scenarios of human/alien contact. \\"Empire\\" is one of the best of such. The Jao are a fascinating species who come alive because of the level of imagined detail the authors have devoted to them, and because there is potential for \\"association\\" between them and humans. With the other aliens, the Ekhat, no bridge of understanding is possible, and these weirdly \\"musical\\" monsters provide a common enemy for humans and their Jao conquerers to unite against. But the question is whether the threat of annihilation will be enough to overcome the rivalries in the complex Jao organizational system and the bitter determination of earth's indigenous peoples to resist their fierce occupiers from the stars....\\"Empire\\" does take its time establishing the main characters and the situation in which they all find themselves. But the investment in that steady build-up rewards the patient reader as the action revs up to a blazing fire fight in the sun. Don't stop there though. Then comes the Jao Naukra (enquiry/trial/calling-to-account) where consequences including death are risked by the leaders who exceeded the usual boundaries of authority. The forwarding of a \\"third way\\" at those proceedings reminds the reader that thinking outside the box may solve seemingly insoluble political/social/species conflicts. And although a courageous young Jao male and human female spearhead the push for groundbreaking changes, \\"Empire\\" does not forget that great revisions are often planned for by \\"elders,\\" sometimes very Machiavellian ones.This novel meets the very highest sci-fi standards. A sequel of some type would be wonderful -- perhaps set forty or fifty years in the future, permitting Aille and Caitlin to mature in wisdom and power in the reality they help create and their offspring to be the radical thinkers and doers....just a suggestion."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"One of the 10 best I've read - and I've read many. It looks like other reviewers agree. This story seems so much like something that really happened - or could happen - that you feel you are on Earth in an alternate universe.The aliens have invaded, and we lost. But, like humans, they have good guys and bad guys, and they have conflict amongst themselves. The humans have to dig deep to find their courage and ingenuity - and isn't that always so? That we only rise to the occasion when things seem the worst?To learn about the real extraterrestrial intervention check out the Allies of Humanity."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"Alien invasion novels tend to feature the humans. Either the humans who drive off the aliens, the humans who are resisting the aliens, or the humans who themselves are the alien invaders. In this story, however, the humans have lost, the aliens have won, and the story is about the aliens.These aliens have a bigger purpose than just conquest. They are fighting a different group of aliens. And so they would really rather if they didn't have any trouble from the annoying humans. But humans being humans, they continue to annoy.Eventually, one clan group of the aliens decides the time is right to strike a blow against the prestige of another clan group, and sends an emmisary to Earth in order to accomplish this goal. This setup allows us to see the situation on Earth 20 years after the invasion from the eyes of a recent arrival, someone who is trying to understand the situation and make use of it.It's a great choice for advancing the story and letting the reader discover the situation as the central character does.Meanwhile, we also view the situation from some of the humans who have grown up in this altered world as a conquered people. These viewpoint characters show us what the main character does not or can not see, allowing the story to progress in full view of the reader.And then, of course, the second group of aliens arrives with a battle fleet. What happens to the earth and the fate of the human race depends on how well one alien overlord can come to understand and rely upon his conquered human subjects.It's a great book, highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"I won't go into details of the plot, since others have done that. Suffice it to say that this story seems so real you could almost believe it really happened in an alternate universe. I'm not one of those New Age groupies that feel all ETs are our space brothers, so I found the idea that our world was invaded by force quite believable. As was the fact that the aliens had different factions that fought amongst themselves. Why should ET be any different than humans?For a very realistic take on an extraterrestrial intervention check out the Allies of Humanity."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"This book is quite an experience.

Wentworth) but somehow I missed reading this book until it turned up as a free ebook on Amazon. Now I've found that some of these \\"free\\" ebooks turn out to be worth the price, but this is not one of those instances. \\"Course of Empire\\" is a good, solid read and I enjoyed it-- and will probably pay actual money for the sequel. (I'm giving the book four rather than five stars only because I prefer to reserve that rating only for something I think is really spectacular.) The story, briefly: Some 20 years ago, Earth was conquered by an alien race known as the Jao. Under a brutal Jao governor, humans are being treated badly, especially in places such as America which put up the most resistance to the Jao conquest. Now a young, though high-ranking and brilliant, member of the Jao culture comes to Earth and tries to learn to understand humans, and win their trust and loyalty, so that humans can join more effectively in the fight against the Ekhat, another alien race who are not a fake bogeyman as most conquered humans suppose, but a real planet-destroying threat. The emphasis is more on developing the alien Jao culture, and contrasting it with human culture, rather than blood-and-thunder action. One bit of a cliche crops up; this is one of several alien-invasion novels I've seen where the idea is developed that the aliens are really less creative and less capable of technical advancement than the humans, but are initially capable of defeating the humans only because they (the aliens) have been around longer to slowly develop their technology. Here, however, this is given as the reason why the humans and the Jao need each other as allies rather than enemies, rather than the reason the humans finally defeat the aliens."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"This is a really good book. Don't let the cover fool you, what is inside is really entertaining. The read may be a little convoluted at times but that is because of the complexities in the plot. Don't let what I said form a preconception that will bias you into thinking that the book will be laborious, it is actually part of what makes the book fun to read. Take into account that the book is long, about 520 pgs, before you pick it up."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"I found this a difficult book to read because it is so very well written. That's not a contradiction, by the way. Any book about alien contact where I spend the first third of it trying *NOT* to grind my teeth into powder over Jao callousness and Jao brutality has definitely involved me in the story.For the Jao have conquered Earth, reducing its population to sullen subservience, destroyed cities for the merest trace of resistance, and even wiped out Mount Everest to prove that they are not to be defied. The areas which resisted most strongly have been hammered into poverty and want, and there are places where no one who collaborates with the Jao dares walk unarmed or alone.But the Jao are not the monolithic Beast of the Apocalypse they seem to be, for one faction, known only as the Bond, has apparently engineered a situation they hope will resolve the mess, and so the tale begins, as a new Subcommandant arrives on earth, fresh from the equivalent of Annapolis...There is more to this book than the parts of the story which aroused my wrath, for these aliens are truly *alien*, and that provides the tale with its richness. John Campbell defined alien as \\"what thinks as well as a human, but differently\\" and the Jao are indeed different. From those differences arise the conflict, for how do beings who are engineered, rather than products of evolution, proud of their rationality, and involved in a war for survival against others whose alienness is so bizarre that meaningful contact with them is impossible, deal with the inconsistent, irrational, maddening and quarrelsome humans?For that matter, can, or will the Jao succeed in fixing the horribly botched first contact and conquest of the humans? Without breaking the very things that might make humans valuable partners in their ultimate quest for survival? And, if they can do so, how can they achive it without destroying their own species' unity, upon which the survival of all, Jao and human, must ultimately depend?All of the above issues and more come into play in this book and by the time the story ended, I found myself actually trying to think like a Jao, and see the universe from their perspective. Quite a change, I must say, from my \\"kill them all\\" attitude generated by the early part of the story. That change is a high compliment to the skill with which the story was unfolded before me.Both K. D. Wentworth (\\"Black/On/Black\\", \\"Stars/Over/Stars\\", \\"Imperium Game\\") and Eric Flint [website]BR>have shown themselves writers of the highest caliber, and this book, written by them as a team, is a credit to them both. I am grateful the book was so difficult and hence, so wonderful.Thank you, Kathy and Eric."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"Take two authors known to be among the most capable at creating believable and completely inhuman and nonhuman aliens, and ask them to write together. What do you get? You get creativity squared. You get _Course of Empire_ by Eric Flint and K.D. Wentworth.This book deserves nomination for the Hugo and Nebula awards. It is a deceptively old-fashioned plot: aliens conquer the Earth and what happens later. But the aliens are real _people_ -- not human people, but people nonetheless...and not one-dimensional cutout villains. The humans are real. The aliens are real, and the situation is entirely believable.Flint, while better known for alternate histories, began his writing career with the brilliant _Mother of Demons_ in which he created believable aliens out of giant landlocked squidlike beings...and got us to care about them and understand their motivations.Wentworth, likewise, known for her fantasies, is the creator of the fascinating Hrinn...neither catlike, nor doglike, nor bearlike, but a warrior animal race, intelligent, emotional, honorable. This book should be a breakthrough for Wentworth, who is amazingly underrated as an author...and deserves much better as she shows in _Course of Empire_.Put together, Flint and Wentworth develop the Jao. Very different than humans, human interactions baffle the Jao...just like the Jao baffle the humans who are their slaves.This is an awe-inspiringly good book, and should be read and enjoyed, over and over.Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"The Course of Empire (2003) is a SF novel about a Terra conquered by an alien empire. This conquest was the most difficult in the entire history of the Joa people; even after twenty years of occupation, the Terrans have not yet been assimilated. Resistance groups still operate in the mountainous regions and riots still occur in the more heavily populated areas. Many of the troops that should have been reassigned after the conquest have been retained to suppress the resistance.After the conquest, the Narvo kochan was given the oudh to govern Terra and that clan selected Oppuk krinnu ava Narvo to serve as Governor of the planet. The governor and his staff have a low opinion of the humans and this disdain extended down to the lowest levels of the Jao military. Indeed, most Jao consider the humans to only be clever animals, whose behavior is insane and whose mentality is incapable of understanding Jao ways.In this novel, Aile krinna ava Pluthrak arrives on Terra to assume his duties as Subcommandant for Ground Forces, accompanied only by his fraghta, Yaut krinnu Jithra vau Pluthrak. His presence causes a great deal of consternation, since the Pluthrak kochan may be the most prestigious clan of the Jao, with the possible exception of their Narvo rivals.Aile becomes even more notable when he starts adding Terrans as well as Jao to his personal service. The first to be added is PFC Gabe Tully, a jinau trooper in the ground forces. Later Aile adds Willard Beck, a human technician, and then Nath krinnu Tashnat vau Nimmat, a Jao supervisor at the Pascagoula refit facility. When Yaut is sent to Jao country to gather information, he adds Tamt krinnu Kannu vau Hij, a Jao guard, to Aile's personal service when she acts rudely to him; she obviously needs the training and she seems to have potential. Later Aile adds combat veterans from both the Terran and Jao forces to his personal service.The Governor holds a reception for Aile in the gubernatorial palace in Oklahoma City. There Oppuk taunts Aile, trying to goad him into a misstep, but Aile successfully deflects each challenge. Afterward, Caitlan Stockwell comments upon the interplay to Aile and he talks to her for a while before abruptly shedding his clothes and diving into the swimming pool. Later Aile learns Caitlan's name and identity as the only remaining child of the human appointed as President of North America. Caitlan then introduces Ed Kralik, a Major General commanding the Pacific Division of the jinau forces, to Aile (which is a blatant flaunting of Jao manners, but Aile is getting used to the human version of social customs).This reception and the information subsequently provided by Jao combat veterans leads Aile to conclude that the Governor has become demented in his hatred of the humans. Aile begins to maneuver against the Governor in a type of traditional formal conflict called \\"advance-by-oscillation\\". This approach is a form of psychological operation similar to Dickson'sTactics of Mistake, which was derived partially from a fencing tactic of rapid engages and disengages that gradually draw the other blade out of line until the opponent is essentially unguarded. Aile starts to refute the official opinion regarding the humans in various ways, driving the Governor to wilder and wilder reactions, and then countering this erratic behavior by exposing his misjudgment. This tactic should eventually alienate the Governor from his allies, including his own kochan.This story was inspired by a story from Christopher Anvil, possibly in the series collected asPandora's Legions. However, Anvil wrote many other stories about the Earth being invaded by hapless aliens; the earliest to my knowledge is The Gentle Earth (1957), which contains many of the elements of the Pandora series.However, the Jao have an entirely different concept of social obligations and relationships than the aliens in the Pandora series. The Jao have a social organization somewhat like theHrinn, but without the separation of male and female. Their concept of usefulness as the primary social ethic is close in some ways to the Japanese concept of bushido.This story basically takes off where Anvil's stories usually end, with the invaders realizing that they have caught hold of the tar baby or, to phrase it another way, they have a tiger by the tail. These invaders are basically good-hearted (but ruthless) defenders of all galactic life from the ravaging and incomprehensible Ekhat. However, the Jao have never encountered another sapient species with equal or better technology and have made a number of errors in their first contact and their subsequent treatment of the natives. Now they need to remedy their initial mistakes and convince the unruly natives to \\"associate\\" with their conquerors as do dependent sapients on other conquered planets.This tale is mostly written from the point-of-view of the alien Jao, even when the principal character is Caitlan, for she is more than half Jao herself. Aile begins his task by listening to the natives and to Jao who have extensive experience with the natives. Both he and Yaut spend at least one rest period a day absorbing the language imprinting program, but find more puzzles than answers therein. Thus, he spends a good part of every day confusedly trying to understand the human mindset. Then he learns that the mindset of the human female is not quite the same as that of the male.Highly recommended for Flint, Wentworth, and Anvil fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of aliens being hoisted by their own petard and of belated attempts to establish positive relations.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"In my long-term view, this is the best &quot;cross cultural&quot; SF war (or culture clash), I believe since the &quot;moties&quot; were created. The Jao conquerors are well developed aliens with a cultural set much the opposite of ours, though there are some similarities to our eastern cultures. The personality types (especially the repugnant &quot;Earth Administrator&quot; and his book long battle with another Jao family's &quot;rising star&quot; has many parallels in Earth history. These clashes go well with the proto and real revolts of earthlings (especially Americans). Earth's eventual freedom in the context of Jao culture and a coming third party war with another race (and its initial battles) and possible elimination of both Jao and Earth is a wonderful way to tie it all together. Thoroughly enjoyable; know your history and some philosophy. Read and enjoy !!!"},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"This has got to be one of the best human/alien interaction books I have ever read. It's not so much that this story is about alien conflict, the story takes place twenty years after Earth is conquered, but rather about how humans and aliens learn to live and fight together for their common survival. What I found so great about this was the way the authors wove alien customs and thought processes into the story. The Jao were truly believable and there actions and motives came across as alien rather than being human with just an alien flavour as so many sci-fi novels seem to do.Well worth the hardback cover price."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"K. D. Wentworth shows that the promise of interesting interaction betwixt and between alien and human cultures in her previous two novels was not an 'empty promise'. In this novel she delivers a well thought out alien culture. And in a way that reminded me of C.J. Cherryh made the setting such that the humans in the story must adapt to the aliens culture. Not only does she avoid the clique of the human culture dominating, but she also avoids the old 'aliens conquer earth, valiant earthmen triumph in the end' storyline with a far more interesting plot.The Jao conquered Earth two decades ago - and things on earth have been going downhill ever since. The Jao are in a war with the Ekhat and are conquering other races in a quest for resources. Except that humans believe the Ekhat are just 'boogie aliens' created by the Jao to keep subject races in line. A powerplay between two major Jao 'clans' brings a young Jao scion to earth. And opens up the posibility of change as the young Jao assumes his duties and learns about earth and earths' people.The story makes interesting comments about the clash of cultures that could as easily be applied to the differences between human cultures. That reason, an open mind, willingness to listen, to learn about/from and to compromise are needed to allow two very different cultures to work together. That two cultures together have strengths that neither has on its' own.But Wentworth weaves all of these into a great story that grabs you interest and drags you along on the journey the characters are undertaking. With plot, hidden sub-plots, characters you like/dislike, plots by the characters, a great culture clash and the fine writing I have come to expect from Wentworth this novel is definitly on my 'Best of 2003' list.Give the bibliophile in you a treat and read this novel."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"I totally, 100 % loved this book. Not being much of a sci-fi fan, I normally shun anything with spaceships on the cover. But I semi-enjoyed the book \\"1632\\" and looked around for something else to read by the same author, and ended up with The Course Of Empire.All I can say is, what a great book. It has it all: thought-provoking political, military, social, and anthropological elements, good storytelling, compelling observations about us as a species, etc. This book can be enjoyed on many different levels: as simply a good yarn, or on a deeper level about politics, alliances, and conflict. The major story line is about occupation (in this case, by an alien species taking over Earth), and specifically the difficulties of occupying a resistant people (in this case, humans). Although the book appears to be modeled on historical occupations (British/India, Rome/Greece, Mongol/Chinese, etc.), you will not miss the poignant relevance to today's headlines.Mr Flint gets an A+ for character development, normally IMHO a weak spot in the sci-fi genre. The characters, both alien and human, are complex, multi-faceted participants in the story. A small few are \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", but most are shades of gray and surprisingly (and compellingly) realistic. At various points in the book, I did not know whether I was rooting for the humans or the alien conquerors (the \\"Jao\\"), which is really quite an accomplishment from a writing perspective. In addition to being complex, the characters evolve during the course of the book. Rather than being static archetypes - the evil alien, the brave resistance fighter, whatever - they are learning, evolving characters whose personalities and viewpoints change as the story unfolds, just like in real life. It had a bit of the \\"Shogun\\" (James Clavell) feel of evolving characters who change and grow as they are influenced by a completely alien, seemingly-contradictory-but-actually-quite-internally-consistent alien culture.I also really enjoyed the alien culture of the Jao (the conquerers) and their view of humans. The Jao perspective and exasperation with the humans provided a lot of insight and humor into our species. In addition, the Jao culture was so well thought out and developed that, rather than just being a way to fill pages, they were an internally-consistent culture worth reading about and pondering. Ever little detail made sense and fit. For instance, rather than mating at any time like humans, they only mate infrequently, when called back to their home planets, and the rest of the time they have basically no interest in sex or mating. So there's a scene where they're all walking around naked, male and female, unconcerned and unashamed, while the humans are kind of uncomfortable about it (apparently they have similar sexual organs to us). Then it clicked for me - of course! if they're not sexually aroused or interested except at the exact assigned time and place, then why would they care whether they mingled with or without clothes. That is literally one of dozens or scores of clever, internally-consistent aspects of the Jao culture that made me think.If the Jao don't give you your fill of other-worldly alien types, there's the Ekhrat, a *truly* alien species trying to exterminate everyone else. What's super-interesting is that the Ekhrat are so alien that they can barely be comprehended or described at all - and yet, Mr Flint somehow communicates what they are about while maintaining the mystery that they are so alien as to defy description. At the end of the book, the very last page in fact, I thought to myself, I wish he had spent a little more time on the Ekhrat. And guess what, I turned the page and there was a 3-4 page appendix on the Ekhrat going into more detail. Such a well thought out book!Finally, in most 600+ page books, there are slow patches and, particularly toward the end of the book, a sense of fatigue. Not in this book. Mr Flint manages to keep it moving and it actually picks up momentum as you turn the corner into the final 100 or 200 pages. There is not a slow paragraph in this book. It is a wonderfully edited book with great pacing.This book is a solid 5 stars, 6 if it was possible. Buy it and read it, just don't do so on a night before work, or you will be very tired and unproductive. I just could not put this book down, for the three days it took me to read it."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"This is one of the best books I've read this year. Eric Flint has created a consistent, believable premise, and follows it to a great conclusion.The Jao have conquered earth and been in control for 20 years now. There is great concern the evil Ekart will be coming to eradicate life on earth soon, but the people on earth are not cooperating with the Jao to build the forces necessary to fight the onslaught. Resistance movements still exist in many pockets of the planet, and the Jao governor is becomingly increasingly brutal and disturbed.A young Jao from the prominent clan group is newly assigned as the number 3 leader on earth. His clan is noted for deeper thought than the clan of the current governor, and he for the first time begins to bond with a few earth people. He takes some into his personnel service, and begins to maneuver to oust the current governor.Flint creates the Jao completely unlike us in motivation and response, and does an excellent job creating the Ekart as well. This book completely captured my attention with a combination of philosophy, politics, and warfare. It will satisfy any fan of Drake, Weber, or C.S. Forrester with his thoughtful mix of character and action.Please Mr. Flint, bring on the sequel!"},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"This one was intriguing, exciting, maddening and fun right from the beginning. It was also hard to put down.The venue is Earth, at about our present level of technology. The time is about 20 years after an alien invasion. Humanity was conquered by the alien Jao and now lives a precarious existence. The existence is precarious because humans don't really understand their conqueror and the conquerors don't really understand humans. Any infraction is punished mercilessly but there is no rancor in the punishment. There is no rancor except from the alien who commands earth. He hates humanity. That makes the situation tense.There is a reason for the conquest beyond mere imperial desires. The Jao are at war with the Ekhat. So is everyone else in the galaxy who is not Ekhat. This is for the simple reason that the Ekhat regard all other life as an abomination and wish to cleanse it from the universe. This is not a healthy situation for anyone who is not Ekhat. Unfortunately, humanity does not understand the extent of the problem and many of them do not even believe in the existence of the Ekhat. Many regard them as some sort of Bogeyman used by the conqueror to keep the subject races in line.The Jao themselves are not completely unified. They are organized into great clans and political alliances and often let those ties overshadow the common good. So it is that the ruler of earth is of one clan and the Jao sent to serve as one of his top deputies is of the clan most at odds with his. This leads to even more clashes of will and ultimate goals.Although this book deals with conflicts on many levels, it is mostly about indirect manipulations. Human factions try to manipulate each other to their desired goals. Jao factions do the same thing. Humanity tries to manipulate the Jao and the reverse is also true. When larger, even great schemes are laid on top of this cauldron of scheming, things get really complex. It is said that Byzantine court intrigues maid Prince Machiavelli look like an amateur. The machinations in this book put the Byzantines into the same category. It is all wonderfully intriguing."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"Two decades have passed since the Jao conquered the Earth, but the victors still debate what to do with the defeated humans. Many Jao believe extermination by total destruction of the planet is the final solution. Some like newly arrived Commander Aille believes winning the hearts of the humans is the best long term solution.Before the Jao can resolve the human problem, they have to contend with the deadly Ekhat, who plan to commit solar system genocidal eradicating human and Jao without a second thought. The Ekhat turned the Jao into sentient beings, but expected loyal servitude bonds instead of ungrateful rebellion. For Human and Jao to vanquish the Ekhat they must forge more than an alliance. They need a consensus that is much greater than a simple summing of the parts. Only leaders like Aille and the human Stockwells have the foresight to see what must be done, but each race has xenophobics sitting in key positions.This futuristic tale works on several levels as readers will believe that the Jao and Ekhat exist as well as the conquering of the planet has occurred. The action is fast and furious so that this work will appeal to military science fiction buffs. However, the strength of the tale resides in the social, anthropologic, technological, and political make-up of the Jao and the Humans. Readers will observe the difficulty of blending the best of the conquered and the conqueror into a seamless oneness that might prove capable of surviving the Ekhat. Eric Flint and K.D. Wentworth provide a triumphant story that is as much cerebral as it is action-packed.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"Great characters including the aliens, interesting and complete culture building. Read the book in two days, staying up late each night and bought the second book on the third day. Would like to read more from these writers."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"I didn't expect it to be that good, it gave me the same feeling of In Her Name series.If I am to make a small criticism it is about the ending which seemed a bit abrupt and hasty.I got this one free but for sure I am about to buy the sequel, The Crucible of the Empire.Strongly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"This book has a well thought out race of aliens with their own psyche. It is rather introspective, stressing whether human and alien can overcome the differences in their culture and psych to work together, and somewhat light on action. The main thrust of the plot is can human and the aliens (Jao) get along despite their fundamental differences in psyche and culture?The book has probably 3 sequential endings, outmanuever crazy Jao leader, defeat second race of very hostile aliens, and kiss and make nice with the Jao after its all over. (No spoilers there...its obvious that all these things need to happen very early.) By the third ending, I was tired and just wanted it to be over -- you already know the humans and Jao are going to make nice and all is going to be fine, but there is still 11% of the book left.Although the writing here is quite good, and easy to read, I did find the plot ever so slightly contrived...for example, human and Jao cant possibly understand each other until the right alien leader lands. Some of the alien's cultural concepts are also somewhat contrived -- for example the aliens dont use time, because they have an innate sense of \\"flow\\" and just know when the time is right to do things.Finally, those who like imaginative/creative or realistic technologies/futures will be disappointed -- there is almost none of that. This book is more about the alien's psyche than their gizmos.Conclusion: Course of Empire is a well written alien occupation book with creative and fully fleshed aliens with their own culture and psyche, but suffers a tad from being somewhat light on action, heavy on introspection and having a slightly contrived feel in parts.P.S. Check out Footfall by Pournelle and Niven for a highly regarded alien occupation type book."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"This work is one of the best works I have read in the science-fiction genre for some time. The characters were three dimensional and the outcome well thought out."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"An impressive creation of an alien specie that attacks earth for its own agenda. Both alien and human characters well individualized. Military scenes became extremely tedious for me, but were the main focus of the story. I also tired of the minutiae of the alien social structure. There was so much emphasis on the physical posturing it came across more as superfluous and ridiculous, slowing down plot flow instead of adding anything. Would have been more effective if more secretive instead of a constant presence. It was interesting, could have used some serious editing."},{"Title":"The Course Of Empire","review":"It took a while for the book to really get moving, as a lot of back story was needed, but once it got going, I could not put it down. The characters are well formed and the romances between them do not take center stage, but give you the warm fuzzies anyway.The alien Jao are a very unique concept, and it took most of the book before I got what I think is a proper view of them and their customs. The authors have done so well and thought out so much about each of the introduced species that I will be looking for more.All in all, a satisfying read, I have docked a star for the length of time it took to build the suspense. Purely a matter of opinion, but this is a review after all.One more addition, for some reason I was thinking of this as an interspecies romance when I started reading and it is not.

The author's style is clearly polemical, and none the worse for that. The illustrations are interesting and attractive. However, don't use it as a work of reference. The author has been let down badly by his editors and verifiers, and the book is littered with mistakes and inconsistencies. For instance, every railway fan knows the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway opened in 1825: this book gives 1824, 1825 and 1825 on three separate pages; it spells the name of the architect Philip Hardwicke in two different ways on the same page; another railway, described as cable-hauled, clearly uses locomotives in the illustration a few pages away; another picture purports to describe an electric loco as a diesel, and actually illustrates a driving luggage van! Buy the book for the attractiveness of the illustrations and the robustness of the author's views, but take the captions and the text with a large pinch of salt."},{"Title":"Wait 'til harvest","review":"This is the best book I have read in a very long time. It is funny, it is heartwarming and truly portrays the sacrifice, love, and dissapointment that are part of a marriage now. I laughed and I cried.

After I read it I felt grateful for all that I have and had a greater perspective and sense of happiness."},{"Title":"Wait 'til harvest","review":"Here's a book that deservedly won the Seal of the Idaho Centennial Commission. It's a well-written biography of a matriarch who lost her husband to cancer in the early 1900's and then had to raise her six children on a dry farm in the great Gentile Valley of Southeastern Idaho. Anyone who loves stories of the West and well-written biographies will enjoy this story."},{"Title":"Studies on saving faith","review":"I'd give it 10 if I had the option. I'd also make it a must read for every Christian. This book deals with the most important question you need to have assurance of having the correct answer to: Am I TRULY saved?Pink does not mince words. He gets right down to business and points out the errors of our modern \\"soothsayers.\\" You won't hear this at a Billy Graham Crusade or at Harvest. But you MUST hear it. Our eternal salvation does not rest in \\"feelings\\" of peace but in the facts of Scripture. Feelings fail us, the Word of God never will.I have never known a time when I did not believe but I spent the first half of the book forced to truly examine whether or not my \\"faith\\" was Saving Faith or just an intellectual one.Pink does not spare anyone's feelings. He goes after the evangelists and the orthodox equally. He hammers home all his points using, not an assorted collection of personal stories and emotional sentiment, but Scripture. This book is a hard pill to swallow but it's worth the effort.You will never see this on the top selling list at the New York Times Book Review. You'll be lucky to find a copy in your church library even if you are orthodox. But you can find it online to read for free at reformed dot org. Just click on the link for books on the left side of the page. Then scroll down to find the link for this specific book.You will never be sorry you read it."},{"Title":"Studies on saving faith","review":"This book is interesting for a number of different reasons. It is another one of the gems that was put together from a series of articles from 'The Studies in the Scriptures'(These were taken from articles that first appeared in 'The Studies...' in 1932,1933 and 1937).What is also fascinating about this book is that two other publishers have taken some of the same articles that are included here ,and combined them with other articles from 'The Studies...',with different titles but dealing with the same subject,that being various aspects of God's saving work. The titles of the other books are 'The Doctrine of Salvation'published by Baker Books and 'Genuine Salvation'published by International Outreach(located in Ames,Iowa). This is also the second publisher that has put this same book in print,the first was Reiner Publications. The interest that various publishers have shown in these articles should not suprise those who are somewhat familiar with the life and ministry of A.W.Pink. What Pink has written on the nature of salvation are among his most searching and insightful writings that he has penned on any subject. One astute observation (there are dozens that could be given)will suffice:on p.5 Pink's observation as to why the Phillipian jailer (when he asked,what must I do to be saved)was only instructed to 'believe on the Lord Jesus Christ',(as opposed to being exhorted to 'repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ'),writes \\"thus it was no giddy,careless,unconcerned person,who was exhorted to \\"simply\\" believe;but instead,one who gave clear evidence that a mighty work of God has already been wrought within him. ... In his case there was no need to press upon him his lost condition ,for obviously he felt it; nor were the apostles required to urge upon him the duty of repentance,for his entire demeanor betokened his contrition.\\" Another interesting feature of this book is that in the last four chapters we have Pink's Bunyanesque take on a worldly professor and a child of God who is struggling with assurance. This dialogue has the editor(Pink),having a conversation with Mr.Carnal Confidence in the 19th chapter and with Mr.Humble Heart in chapters 20 through 22. Some of the serious maladies that plague this generation in preaching,christian books and personal evangelism would by God's grace be remedied by a prayerful and careful reading of 'Studies on Saving Faith'."},{"Title":"Studies on saving faith","review":"I have the paper back edition on this extensive study on true evangelical faith as opposed to a non saving faith.The book gives adequate biblical testimony to what the Holy Spirit actually does in infusing true faith in sinful man.This is one of the finest works on this subject ever written,those who are familiar with Arthur Pink ,will not be disappointed in adding this book to their library.Five stars also for amazon for providing it for kindle users"},{"Title":"Studies on saving faith","review":"AW Pink is superb as always! It explains what saving faith truly is in a clear and concise way. I've never been disappointed with a book written by Aw Pink."},{"Title":"The life of Monsieur de Moliere","review":"Mikhail Bulgakov's book The Life of Monsieur de Moliere is a very biased book that is uncritical of the great French writer Moliere. Despite the author's unabashed love of Moliere, the book is a treat from beginning to end. Bulgakov feels an affinity with Moliere because he wrote under a totalitarian regime headed by Stalin in Russia and Moliere wrote during the reign of Louis XIV. Although Moliere certainly had much more freedom than Bulgakov did, he still felt the sting of censorship from religious zealots and was often persecuted by those whom he made fun of in his plays, ( nobles, doctors, the affected ladies of French society). Bulgakov praises Moliere as the greatest French writer and as one of the greatest comediens ever. Indeed history has proven him correct. Three centuries later Moliere's works are performed in almost every nation in the world. The great joy that Bulgakov feels towards Moliere infuses the entire book (sometimes to the point of unintentional farce.) But he paints a vivid and energenic portrait of the playwright, actor and director that captures the essence of his work. Many of the details of Moliere's life are unknown and Bulgakov does take Moliere's side wherever there is ambiguity. ( For example, many of his enemies have said that Moliere married his own daughter and knew that in fact she was his daughter.) Bulgakov refutes this charge as ridiculous and indeed, without proof, it should be discounted. Bulgakov takes us from Moliere's birth (a very funny telling of how the midwife who delivered him couldn't realize he was more important to history than any royal baby she may have delivered) to his tragically ironic death right after a performance of his play The Imaginary Invalid. Bulgakov wheres his love of Moliere on his sleeve and it works to perfection in this book. Moliere's plays have an energy that imbues every verse. This book is the same way. Most other biographies are staid in comparison. They rarely capture the true genius of the great writer and almost never convey the great fun embodied in his works. Mikhail Bulgakov's biography is the best book, even though it is biased, ever written about the great French playwright."},{"Title":"The life of Monsieur de Moliere","review":"I read this in the Russian so can't guarantee anything about this translation.This is a biography, a novel and an experimental work all rolled into one. Bulgakov describes the life of one of the most famous and beloved French playwrights and indeed authors. He goes into the intrigue between him and his enemies, the controversies surrounding his satires, his times and personality. The end result is a magical picture of Moliere's France with the splendour and opulence of the period (the reign of Louis XIV). All this is done in a way that reminds me that common ideas about writing (eg. show don't tell) are just that: ideas. Bulgakov definitely tells more than he shows and the work ends up being a crossover genre piece rather than a straight novel. But this does not detract, in fact his intrusions into the text with respect to the evidence for certain periods in Moliere's life work well.This may not be a masterpiece of world literature but it depicts Moliere in a very interesting way and it's from a writer who felt a special connection with him because of Bulgakov's own troubles with censorship and being ahead of his time. In fact, he refers to Moliere as a wolf of his time in the book, the same image he speaks of himself in one of his poems about how he was hounded; which makes this a splendid exposition of one literary wolf by another..."},{"Title":"Rand McNally Central United States: Highways & Interstates (Rand McNally Folded Map: States)","review":"I was trying to get a Midwest map to match the West Coast map that I already had.

Pink's excellent work on the sovereignty of God is one of the best twentieth-century treatments of the subject. It is a carefully reasoned, Scripture-saturated, heart-probing, man-abasing, God-exalting book. It is theology with a view to doxology. This exposition will lead you to exaltation!Pink begins by defining God's sovereignty. Then he applies this understanding of God's sovereignty to creation, administration (providence), salvation, reprobation, operation, the human will, human responsibility, and prayer. He ends by looking at what our attitude towards God's sovereignty should be, answering objections, and emphasizing the value of the doctrine. There are four appendices dealing with the will of God, the fall of Adam, the meaning of \\"world\\" in John 3:16, and the meaning of I John 2:2.This book is a supralapsarian Calvinistic look at the doctrine of God's sovereignty. I do not agree with Pink in every point, but I commend this book. I know for a fact that God has used this for the conversion of sinners. And regardless of whether you will accept all of Pink's interpretation of Scripture, you cannot help but walk away from this book with a higher view of God than you had before. I count this as one of the most important books I have read. Read this book. Study this book. And adore the God of this book. Be satisfied with sovereignty!"},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I read this book in the last year of my undergraduate education (last year, 2005). I wish I had read it earlier - there is absolutely no doctrine of Christianity that causes one to be at peace quite like the Sovereignty of God! I picked it up while doing a study on various attributes of God and, thankfully, it became one of my favorite books. It goes well hand in hand with his \\"Attributes of God\\", even comparing it with A.W.Tozer's \\"Knowledge of the Holy\\"; in fact, I would suggest you read those two, especially Pinks book, before you begin this one, it only helps...Many people hate Pink because of this book. It was the \\"famous\\" chapter on \\"The Sovereignty of God in Reprobation\\" that gave many Arminians and some Calvinists that twitch that is associated when his name is mentioned. Be careful what edition you buy, avoid the Banner of Truth copy because they deliberately omit that chapter (and a couple others), claiming that Pink abandoned his veiws regarding that chapter. Whether he did or not is irrelevant; you should get your moneys worth - what he wrote is what you should get, not what other poeple think he believed and would have taken out. I have the Sovereign Grace Publishers copy, its a good copy, complete. I like the ample space they leave for margins, great for note-takers like me.The first few chapters are a little slow going but necessary, I must admit. The exciting part really starts at chapter 4: \\"The Sovereignty of God in Salvation\\". He splits up the chapter into three parts, each three devoted to how the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are Sov. in Salvation. Its got one of the better defenses I have seen for a strictly limited atonement. One thing I loved about this chapter is that Pink made sure he always brought the attention back to God; in fact, this is typical of Pink in almost everything he writes!The next chapter, \\"The Sovereignty of God in Reprobation\\" is one that was, for me, the 'life changer', in the word of one of the commenters below. From my understanding (im not an educated theologian, yet), this is one of the greatest defenses for a supralapsarian position I have ever read. He also calls to mind many Scriptures to point out that God is sovereign even over the death of an unbeliever, and that \\"The Lord hath made all things for Himself; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.\\" (Prov. 16:4). He says (p. 105) \\" In the Day of Judgement the Lord will say unto many, \\"I never knew you\\". Note, it is more than simply \\"I knew you not\\". His solemn declaration will be, \\"I NEVER knew you\\" - you were never the objects of My approbation. Contrast this with \\"I KNOW (love) My sheep, and am known (loved) of Mine\\" (John 10:14). The \\"sheep\\", His elect, the \\"few\\", He DOES \\"know\\"; but the reprobate, the non-elect, the \\"many\\" He knows NOT - no, not even before the foundation of the world did He know them - He \\"NEVER\\" knew them!\\" This is difficult stuff for people to swallow, but it clearly is what Scripture teaches in Romans 9 (for example, where Pink leads us to immediately after that quote). It is certainly an eye-opener, to say the least! At this point, youre either going to love him or hate him, this is usually when you make up your mind. Either way, you really should hang in there and be honest with yourself and God; ask yourself the question \\"could Pink possibly be right? Is this what Scripture says?\\" One has to ask that because if he is, many of us, like me before reading this, would be commiting Idolatry: worshipping a kindly old man rather than the roaring lion of Judah, the God of the living and the dead. The scary thing is, I dont know of a singlle person who's found mistakes with his exegesis. Whether they agree with the final result or not, the man is right in his analysis. Thats why many love him.Chapters 8 and 9 do a great job at reconciling the Sov. of God and the Human Will and Responsibility. He contains a typical response but spelled out with many Scriptures, examples, and images - almost reminds me of Thomas Watson in the use of his imagery. It also contains some paragraphs that, to me, are worth the price of the book. These four chapters (4, 5, 8, and 9) are gold mines in and of themselves! Whether or not God is Sovereign over every aspect of our lives we are very clearly commanded to \\"preach the Gospel to every creature\\" as Pink points out. Whether or not we understand every nuance of God's plan of redemption, we MUST obey and preach the Gospel. To neglect this duty is to miss the point incredibly. Not only does he emphasize this point but he goes on to make a very needed explanation of what freedom truly is: \\"...the holding in check of sin, the preventing of the exercize of the carnal mind ... was not a DESTROYING of their 'freedom,' rather was it the inducting of them into real freedom\\" (p 184), ... WOW! (p. 185) \\"True liberty is not the power to live as we please, but to live as we ought! Hence, the only One Who has ever trod this earth since Adam's fall that has enjoyed perfect freedom was the Man Christ Jesus, the Holy Servant of God, Whose meat it ever was to do the will of the Father.\\" That concept is liberating! When you realize what freedom truly is you, naturally, become humble and suddenly dont have a problem with God electing you! You might wonder \\"why me, why not the next guy?\\" Pink would tell us, \\"The secret things belong to the Lord...\\" (Deut, 29:29) redirecting our attention back to God, where it belongs, dwelling on ourselves is pride - an act of \\"unfreedom\\". We would be instructed to say \\"even so, Father, for it seemed good in Your sight\\" (Matthew 11:26).Anyway, I just thought I'd put out a couple of bits of this book out there. Its beautifully written with many many Scriptures. Almost every single paragraph of the book has a verse, many have more. The appendices in the end are VERY useful. I whole-heartedly recommend this book, buy it and be nourished!If you want more resources for studying free-will, responsibility, and the sovereignty of God, I would like to direct you to \\"Bondage of the Will\\" by Martin Luther (the one translated by JI Packer and OR Johnston) - and if youre really into hurting your self mentally and training your soul hard - \\"Freedom of the Will\\" by Jonathan Edwards. Classics ... very hard-core. The second book is so good, but only if youre prepared for a bit of slow and difficult reading (its worth it). If you want a rather simplistic, yet thorough, introduction to Calvinism and the Reformed Faith before tackling any of these books, might I suggest \\"Putting Amazing Back Into Grace\\" by Michael Horton."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I have studied this book twice so far, almost 15 years apart. Both readings strengthened my faith in God and encouraged me through tough times. It was written for tough times, when people are struggling with pain and suffering, fear and doubts about God's role on earth. It's not so much written about us, it's written about God, and it convicts us and reminds us of who God is and has to be, or He wouldn't be God, someone or something else would be. It can be a hard truth, but it is a neccesary truth for His own to gain strength and security. Read the book if you need help or want to help someone else."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"Excellent! Such a clear explanation of sovereignty and the doctrines of grace. This is a 'life-changer'. I read it along with the bible and saw that every doctrine he explainded was clearly validated with scripture!

His invective against arminianism is powerful and does have it's amusing side. If only he were with us today to say a few words about the modernist liberal and his/her disgraceful and shameless compromising of the Gospel and watering down of the Church's standards.However, rather than focus on the controversy, we should focus (with the assistance of Scripture and good books like The Sovereignty of God) on the God who is totally in control. Revell in this comfort. Show confidence in his plan. And most importantly, if you are a Christian, rejoice that he chose you from the beginning of time.Before you really believe in God's total sovereignty, you believe in half of Christianity. You believe in half a God. It is questionable whether you really believe in what could be described as \\"a god\\" or \\"God\\" at all.If you go Pink's way, which I have, don't expect popularity. Pink was at times rejected (by arminian & calvinist alike). But you'll rest with the assurance that:1) God is totally in control of your salvation and life (as abovementioned).2) God expects evangelism, but doesn't expect you to behave like a lunatic in the process. Salvation begins and ends with him."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"Next to the Bible, this book changed my life in 1966. I believe it should be read by all thinking Christians. It is biassed. The author admits that in his preface, but it is biassed deliberately to focus upon the greatness and grandeur of the Godhead. After reading this book, your understanding of God will never be the same again."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"Search the scriptures and you will see there is a Sovereign God near you.After doing just that and reading this book,He pulled back the veil and revealed himself for who he really is to me.

Pink does not mince words, and cuts through the smoke screen of God's 'universal love' and 'desire to save all' that sadly clouds the vision of many, if not most, of the Reformed theologians and seminary professors since the late John H. Gerstner and Gordon H. Clark went on to glory.Do not buy the sanitized edition published by the Banner of Truth Trust, which has censored the unpalatable chapters. If you read Pink carefully and prayerfully, the scales will fall from your eyes. They fell from mine. Soli Deo gloria!"},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"In many ways this book comes as a refreshing antidote to much of the slush that is being published for the Christian reader. We live in a day when, because evil abounds, the love of many has grown cold. Frighteningly large numbers of church folk no longer want to hear of discipleship, discipline, long suffering, brotherly love, self control and denial of self. Instead, God becomes a kind of mentor to help you become \\"whole\\" - whatever that is meant to mean! This aim, which is just another fixation with self, makes God simply an accessory to our selfish ambition.A W Pink's book redresses the balance and has God on the throne, where He truly is. That of course must be good. However, if you are going to buy this book let me offer a brotherly warning. Firstly, this book represents a refined doctrine. By that I mean that, just as the radium the Curies extracted became, in its concentrated form, a highly dangerous substance, so, this focus on God's Sovereignty, though a wonderful and necessary subject for meditation, can also lead into many dangerous and off balanced positions.Though there are many good things in this book, it is not the complete picture of God. It is not irrelevant to state that this book tends to be championed by those who believe that if we lived in the 17th Century - or at least adopted the doctrines and life styles of 17th Century Puritans - we, the church, would be doing very well today. In reality, these people have brought little refreshment to the church.OK, then, I'd say the short of it is this: Yes, read the Banner of Truth version (even they cut out some of the original material because they thought it was extreme - and later in life A W Pink himself thought he'd gone too far as well). Get excited over the Great God who Rules in the Heavens, just as Isaiah did. But remember that God is not remote and He really does answer prayer. Indeed, some things will not happen unless we pray. Furthermore, balance this vision with another - for instance Frances Roberts devotional \\"Come Away My Beloved\\" (also available at Amazon). There you will get a Sovereign God and a God of intimacy.Although in many Christian camps God has been depicted as standing pathetically by seeking to beg sinners to come to Him in a way that is not worthy of Him, do not allow strongly worded descriptions of this tendency to block out what may be true here. Many times the Sacred Writings picture God as pleading with His people, and sinners, to come to Him. \\"All day long I have held out my hands to a rebellious people but YOU WOULD NOT\\" is just one example.Mr Pink is one of those writers who digs channels for you to go down. You aren't supposed to climb out of the channel and look around but simply to follow his line of thought until you are convinced that there is no other way of viewing the truths he deals with. For instance, I think he takes the illustration of being dead in trespasses and sins too far. The same figure of death is used for the Christian also (in his being \\"dead to sin\\") but if Mr Pink were to press that application as far as the other, he would be forced to conclude sinless perfection. Indeed, this sort of exaggerated reasoning forces many, from his camp, to make saving faith a total gift of God in order to avoid the slightest involvement of man in salvation (which involvement they term synergism). In order to extricate faith from human energies a teaching is developed which puts regeneration before faith. This flies in the face of the true Reformers who taught the biblical doctrine that a man is justified, by faith, while he is still a sinner. These unbalanced types, however, believe that we are justified by regeneration - it is an inescapable conclusion. Since regeneration is a kind of washing or cleansing, it follows, if regeneration came first (which it doesn't), that men are justified because they are justifiable rather than justified by the death of Christ. Voila: the first step toward Rome! The Biblical Christian need merely point out (from Romans 4) that the reason God chose faith as the door to salvation is that it is not reckoned a work of man (synergism) anymore than a man who holds out his hand to take money can be said to have, by so acting, earned it."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I ran across this book while searching for material relating to Free will and Predestination and their interplay (or lack thereof) which each other. It came highly recommeded so I bought it and read.It is very apparent that Mr. Pink has a deep passion for the pursuit of God and is a herald for what he believes to be the truth. His committment to Christ is above reproach. That said, however, he presents his arguments with less tact that I would expect from a person so intent on persuading people to subscribe to a certain doctrine. Instead of building a case and leading the reader to draw the intended conclusion desired (as C.S. Lewis wonderfully does) Pink seems to drag you across the dividing line between the two camps of thought and prevent from crossing over to the other side. There is little respect or empathy for arminianism in any form - it is treated instead like a disdained and sinful idea with the power only to corrupt and denigrate the minds of those who hear it.Specifically, he insists on maintaining the \\"Balance of Truth\\" between the ideas that God is both sovereign and man is responsible for his behavior but gives little real credence to the latter. His argument in the end boils down to merely asserting that man must be responsible even though it is logically inconsistent with his argumentation. Most disappointing of all, however, is his treatment of the problem of evil. If God is completely sovereign in the manner that Pink maintains then His control of evil is congruent to that sovereignty. It would have been understandable and even acceptable to merely say that God is both good and sovereign because Scripture maintains both but he goes on to attempt a solution and ends up destroying the little credibility the reader has left at that point.Finally, his insistence on avoiding the label \\"hyper-Calvinist\\" is a bit like someone downplaying the title \\"fundamentalist\\" merely because he does not like it - in both cases the vast majority of people would agree to the label despite personal opposition. In the end, Pink left me not so much a picture of a completely sovereign God but a God who operates only in the most carefully constructed of boxes."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This is a very well written book with much that is God honouring. It would have to be since much of it is Biblically based.However, this book has become a kind of tract for higher Calvinism. The Banner of Truth used to publish testimonies of Pentecostals who had been \\"saved\\" from Pentecostalism by reading this book. But the Banner of Truth left out the chapter on double predestination and in one of their publications they gave the reasons for this. It would seem that Mr Pink himself had moved away from his former position - or at least the Banner felt that he had.This is not surprising of course. When we are young we like things black and white. Also, when we are angry at worldly tendencies in the churches, we long to find some cause or teaching which exposes such as sham - a stick with which to beat them. We are then on a pendulum swing and it is all so clear and easy. But often it is a slow, difficult and painful climb back to a more correct position. In our \\"battles for the truth\\" we are like bull-seals fighting over territory, oblivious of the calves and cows that are bruised and squashed beneath us.Dear brethren, has this modern Calvinistic trend really brought about revival? Are the folk in your church any more holy, loving and righteous than any other sect? Do you love Jesus any more than you did before you got switched on to this philosophy? Or, is it a constant pressure to keep up with the book reading plan? Do you need a wheel barrow every time you visit a reformed convention; to bring all the books back? And with all the talk of preaching amongst this group have you ever come across more boring preaching? No, I'm not trying to be rude but lets face it, most of us got turned on to this tendency by Martin Lloyd Jones, only to find that he was a one-off in his generation.Now look, art and literature are ok aren't they, but do you really need me to spell out the dangers? Look at the Koran. Moslems say that in the Arabic it is sublime. Yes, but look how it translates! It is the same with English books. A writer can write in a way that sweeps all before him. At the end of reading the book you say \\"Wow, that's great, his reasoning has really convinced me\\". But you can't relate it to others so you say \\"Ah, you just have to read the book\\". Reasoning can be very subtle and much of this book is of close reasoning. Take this syllogism for example:\\"Most people like ice cream; I am like most people: therefore I like ice cream\\". I admit that the error here is obvious: I might be like most people in most things but not necessarily in the specific case of being an ice cream fan. But the syllogisms aren't always so obvious.Look what you are led to believe in reading this book:1. God chose certain people to be saved before time began and the rest He CHOSE to go to hell.2. We are so dead in sins before getting saved that we can't choose one good thing - not even to want God.3. God regenerates us - that is, gives us the new birth - before we believe, in order that we shall believe (this is nonsense: the life is in Christ. He that has the Son has life - you get the life by receiving Him)Now in John 3, the serpent lifted up on a pole is spoken of as a picture of how God gives Jesus to the world (note that He is offered to the world as the crucified Saviour). In closing, lets just look at this incident from Moses' time. Here are the Israelites being bitten by snakes. They cry out to Moses. Moses goes before God and God tells him to make a bronze snake, put it on a pole and whoever looks at the serpent will be healed. Let's imagine the scene:Moses (to the crowd): look at the serpent and you will be healed from the effects of the poison.Joe: What me too?Moses: All of you...yes, you too.Joe: It can't be for all of us, some of us have already died. The serpent could never have been for them specifically.Moses: Look, this is a matter of life and death...believe or perish!Joe: I need to know what warrant I have to believe. Surely this latest judgement is meant to kill some of us. How do I know it wasn't meant to kill me? Who am I to be presumptious!Moses: God has said look at the snake, as the only provision for your deliverance, that's all the warrant you will get. But if you persist in your folly it is because you have no regard for what God says, but only for foolish philosophy.Joe: How could I have any regard? By nature I am unable to look at the serpent. By nature I don't even want to be saved. By nature I cannot even utter one word that pleases the Lord. By nature my looking would be an attempt to earn my healing rather than rely on total grace.And so it goes on. And so it has gone on for centuries. We virtually invented this doctrine in England. Come and see the barrenness over here my brethren and then think again.On the clock we are seconds from judgement. Our western nations beg destruction. Pray. Seek the Holy Spirit. Seek God and let nothing get you off track."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"Mr. Pink is very deep and insightful in all of his books. I have several. He tends to spiritualize a bit much, but the pros greatly outweigh the cons in most cases. However, this is not the case with &quot;The Sovereignty Of God&quot;. Before you read any of his books, you must realize that he was (admittedly or not) a Hyper- Calvinist. The most dramatic error of this theology is to say that certain people on this earth have been predestined by God for Hell and that there is nothing that they can do about it! This theology does not agree with countless Bible passages. Romans 8:29 says &quot;For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.&quot; Predestination is based on God's omniscience. He simply knows who will accept Christ and who will not because He knows everything. He did not predestine anyone for Hell. Man chooses Christ or rejects Christ. That choice determine his destiny. God simply knows what people will choose. The following Scriptures will clearly tell you that Jesus Christ died for everyone, and not just the elect! Isaiah 53:6 - John 3:16 - Romans 10:13 - I Timothy 2:3-6 - I Timothy 4:10 - II Peter 3:9 - I John 2:1-2 - Revelation 22:17 - God wants all to be saved and that is why He sent His Son to die for all! The result of this poor theology is lack of concern to tell people about the Savior's ability to save. Because if a person is predestined to Hell, they cannot be saved (according to the Hyper Calvinist). This is not a book for the Browse-Through-Bible-Student! If you are not strongly rooted in the Bible Doctrine of Salvation by grace through faith, I cannot reccomend that you read it! As a matter of fact, I discourage it! Many a weak Christian has fallen prey to the Deadly T.U.L.I.P. through Mr. Pink's work on &quot;The Sovereignty Of God&quot;! Be very careful and prayerful! I was not allowed to rate this at less than 1 star otherwise I would have."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This book has probably influenced my view of God more than any book other than the Bible that I have ever read. It presents God as the ruler of the universe who &quot;works all things after the counsel of his own will. Pink writes in a linear fashion and constantly backs up what he says with a combination of logic and scripture. He answers just about any objection one might have especially when dealing with the sovereignty of God in salvation. Whether you agree with him, it will introduce you to Calvinism as no other book can."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"The God that the modern church worships is a much different God than that of Scripture. As a minister, this book challenged everything I had been taught in my very popular Arminian seminary. I fought the commonness of God as absolute Sovereign (truly) in scripture, until God's grace and scriptural truth effectively won out. Thanks God, you alone are in control."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"What a breath of fresh air in a world full of Arminianism and &quot;free-willers&quot;, how wonderful that A.W. takes a solid stand for the truth. I wish he were alive today so i could tell him what a glorious effects this book had on my life. it makes me appreciate the fact that all my steps are ordered by a Sovereign God. Spurgeon called the Armenian god an &quot;idiot of their imagination&quot;. i wish more would read this blessed book."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"If you want to read one book on theology this is THE book. This is clearly written so that all may understand it and is presented in a very straight-forward, logical manner. This is the book that helped push me over the edge on particular atonement. Mr. Pink uses a ton of scripture verses to defend all his positions. As a Christian, it is the word of God that is sharper than a two-edged sword and the Holy Spirit will work in you when reading this book since it is full of scripture. If your church library doesn't have this book, I highly recommend them getting it so that all within the church have a chance to read this outstanding book."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"The reformed doctrines as presented by the divines of Dort to refute the Arminians' Remonstrance, which Pastor Pink covered in this book, are a sweet affirmation, a humbling, comforting, glorious, robust, impregnable, formidable, human-pride-demolishing, biblical defense of the absolute sovereignty of God where the doctrine of unconditional election exalts in the sovereignty of God the Father in salvation, the doctrine of limited atonement exalts in the sovereignty of God the Son in salvation, and the doctrine of irresistible grace exalts in the sovereignty of God the Holy Spirit in salvation. The blessed Trinity then works in unity to preserve the elects to be faithful to the end, hence the doctrine of perseverance of the saints. Moreover, St. Paul certainly had in mind the deceitful heart of men when he wrote the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans, as well as the beginning of the second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, to deliver a crushing blow to all vain human boastings of their free-will, by hammering on the utter inability of the fatally-corrupted will of men to do any good in the sight of God in and by themselves, so that \\"every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God\\", hence the doctrine of total depravity, which, though discussed in this book, but not as comprehensively as in Martin Luther's \\"De Servo Arbitrio\\", a.k.a., \\"The Bondage of the Will\\". To deny all these, as Pastor Pink puts it, is \\"to undeify\\" or \\"to unGod\\" God of his God-ness because two essential must-have attributes of God's God-ness for him to be God are his omnipotence and omniscience. Embracing Arminianism also dangerously elevates men to the level of the sovereignty of God; a realm where if men insist to enter, would render them blasphemous to God. Finally, in my view, Pastor Pink, though he did a marvelous job in distinguishing between natural and moral ability, might have done a little too much in attempting to explain the missing link between the sovereignty of God and human responsibility, as well as other objections, to the point that it sounds like he ended up begging the questions. Perhaps there is indeed no humanly answer to this great mystery, which then all we can do is to affirm, adore and rejoice in its truth. \\"The secret things belong unto the LORD our God.\\"As a related side comment, I would like to add the following thoughts. Prof. Mark Talbot points out during his address at 2005 Desiring God National Conference in Minneapolis, MN, (he explains it in the context of Opentheism, but I believe it is applicable here as well) that the doctrine of autonomous-self teaches that God values man's free-will so much that he is willing to pay any price. God is really good in cleaning things up to the point that the alternative plan B that he executes looks even better, more perfect than the botched plan A that man has frustrated. So in a way, the doctrine of autonomous-self treats God like a lackey or a genie in a bottle whom man can stir as he wills. I regard this Arminian stand on the free agency of man and God as the most self-centered among man-centered doctrines, even more man-centered than opentheism. Opentheism at least admits the future is unknown, even God has no control over it and anybody could change it. The Arminian doctrine in regard to the free-agency of men, particularly as stated in the first article of Remonstrance, that faith is the condition of election, is worse than open-theism because it teaches the future is already known, at least in regard to salvation, who is saved and who is not, and who makes this decision before the foundations of the world is men. Then God responds to each individual decision either by saving or condemning. Everything God does is for the benefits of man, and here is man, the center of the universe and God's idol. This, I fear, may God forbid, is the desire behind those who embrace the doctrine of autonomous-self which is nothing but the very ambition of Lucifer to be exalted above God (Isa 14:13-14) because the resemblance between the two is striking.If it is to be inquired how the Arminian doctrine of autonomous-self or free-will could exist and what the spirit behind it is, where men insist on being the captain of their destiny, it is helpful to study the account of the fall of Lucifer from grace whose account was given in the fourteenth chapter of Isaiah, \\"Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.\\" (Isaiah 14:11-15)We learn the cause of him being eternally condemned by God from v.13 and 14 is that he is so filled with pride and self-adoration that he declares himself to be worthy to ascend into heaven and be exalted above the stars of God. He considers himself to be as equally valuable, as equally worthy, if not more valuable and more worthy than God himself that he should be like the Most High. In response, God removed him from his original state and declares that his splendor be nullified and brought down to shame, and he himself be brought down to hell, to a place of eternal torment which is the lake of fire (Rev 20:10) forever as his eternal destiny. When Lucifer was removed from heaven, his name became Satan, and was cast to the earth.In the account of the Fall in Gen 3, after which God offered the promise of deliverance through the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross implied in v. 15, we may observe a correlation between Satan's sinful ambition to what he tempted Adam and Eve with, which eventually led the couple to sin against God and caused the entire humanity to be totally and hopelessly depraved under the same condemnation that Lucifer has as a result. The correlation is clearly seen in Gen 3:5, when Satan, disguised as a serpent, said to Eve, \\"For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\\" Here are the double lies offered to Eve springing out of the same principle behind his botched coup attempt; first, that she would be like gods, and thus independent, able to rule over herself apart from God, and secondly, there is not one God, but many gods; each is sovereign over himself or herself.From this train of thoughts, we may observe that first; the doctrine of autonomous-self, or often referred to as \\"free-will\\", whether it be \\"Christian\\" or non-Christian one, though may not appear explicitly, originates from the same spirit by which Lucifer rebels against God, that is, the spirit of self-idolatry. Secondly, the doctrine of autonomous-self is indeed a non-Christian doctrine because there is nowhere in the Bible that teaches such a doctrine and therefore, should be rejected by all true Christians, as Pastor Pink affirms in this book."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book. Pink uses persuasive arguments and scriptural foundations to establish his points on an issue that has been neglected in American Christianity. He is a bit extreme, however (by comparing some writings of John Calvin to this work, I've noticed that Pink is more Calvinistic than Calvin). Nevertheless, the book is a great help not only in doctrinal but also in practical matters. Most readers should be prepared to have their traditional views of God shaken a bit."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I would like to purchase The Sovereignty of God by Arthur W.

I remember thinking as I was reading this book \\"man we need another Pink today.\\" He ripped apart the way that evangelism was being done in that day. Every little false illustration and such. This book was written I believe in the thirties and what is amazing is he talks about problems streching back to the turn of the century that we are still having today. Some the illustrations that he tears apart such as the \\"doctor with medicine\\" illustration were taught to me in seminary.

The Gnostics taught this same devil inspired teaching,and all the early church Bishops denounced them as heretics. those who teach and believe this today are simply believing and teaching the same heresy as the Gnostics taught in the fist century. All the early church teachers taught holiness or hell. the false teachers taught eternal security and predestination. Use common sense. People like Polycarp were taught by the Apostles,and all his teachings which can be found free online verify that holiness or hell is what everyone taught for the first 300 years except the heretics.

The reason for this is probably due to the fact that in Pink's day the doctrine of God's sovereignty was almost completely ignored, misunderstood or rejected. Why read or study a book on the doctrine of God's sovereignty? The author believed that this doctrine is the second most important doctrine taught in the Bible, the first being the Divine inspiration of the Bible,which is the title of Mr.Pink's first book that was published. Pink has this to say about the importance of this Biblical truth on p.19 &quot;It is... the key to history, the interpreter of providence,...and the foundation of christian theology,p.215...it is designed as the sheet anchor for our souls amid the storms of life. The doctrine of God's sovereignty is a divine cordial to refresh our spirits. It is designed and adapted to mould the affections of the heart and to give a right direction to conduct. ...It affords comfort for the present and a sense of security respecting the unknown future.&quot; A right understanding of this doctrine places God on the throne where he belongs and under His blessing produces humility in His people. The Sovereignty of God is the most comforting doctrine in the Bible to a christian in the midst of trials. This reviewer is convinced that 'The Sovereignty of God'by A.W.Pink is one of the most important and influential books that has been written in this century."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This book, and this edition of the book in particular, is Arthur Pink's full discourse on the sovereignty of God. It is a book that has been a source of intense controversy and impassioned views. Not everyone will agree with what Pink argues here. In fact, most will probably disagree with some portion of this discourse. Nonetheless, he presents an immensely powerful and mostly persuasive argument on the sovereignty of God within a high Calvinist theological framework.Pink's discourse is thorough, very well documented Biblically, and passionate in what it seeks to present. When he wrote this book, Pink was clearly concerned about the elevation of man and his abilities at the expense of the sovereignty of God throughout Christendom. He understood that presenting a high Calvinist view of God's sovereignty would not win any popularity contests, and he was certainly right about this. But even while not agreeing completely with Pink's views here, I have to say that I found this book to be the best systematic treatment of this issue that I have yet read.I felt that Pink did a good job of clearly establishing the sovereignty of God in all things, including election. I also felt that Pink's discourse on human responsibility and accountability for his actions was utterly outstanding. The reconciliation of human responsibility or 'free-will' in light of God's sovereignty has been a central issue in Christianity throughout its history. I felt that Pink's attempt at reconciling the difficulty is a very significant achievement that moves the discussion in a very positive direction. Throughout his discourse, Pink's Biblical exegesis is thorough and often compelling.I mentioned at the start of this review that this particular edition of Pink's work is a source of great controversy. The reason is because of two main arguments put forth by Pink in this edition that were deleted by the Banner of Truth edition. The first is Pink's argument in favor of limited atonement that argues that Christ did not die for the sins of the whole world on the cross, but only for the sins of God's elect. This is by far the most controversial and debated point of the 5 points of Calvinism. Many self described Calvinists reject this point in favor of a modified form of unlimited atonement, but Pink argues forcefully for the limited atonement view here. Second, and even more controversial, is Pink's lengthy discourse on what is known as 'double predestination'. This is the view that God not only actively elects certain people to be saved, but also actively condemns people to torment. Again, most Calvinists today reject double predestination, but Pink, in the longest chapter of this book, strongly affirms this doctrine. This chapter is the single most controversial aspect of this book, among many controversial aspects, and was deleted in its entirety in the Banner of Truth edition of the book.While I don't think I personally agree with the doctrine of double predestination as Pink presents it, I found myself nonetheless grateful for having read Pink's views on this topic. It has caused me to dig deeper in my thinking to arrive at my own theological convictions. As a result, even though I disagree with some of what Pink wrote, I consider this book to be among the most profitable I've read, and highly commend it to readers who want a clear-cut, unapologetic presentation from a highly Reformed perspective on the sovereignty of God and how it manifests itself, as well as human responsibility in light of God's sovereignty. A classic treatise that will challenge the reader mightily."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This little book has helped many to come to accept that God is absolutely sovereign over His creation. But this will only happen if one is willing to really consider this issue. And the way to consider it is to look up the Scripture references Pink cites in this book.

I know of people who have gone through much emotional struggle when reading books like Pink's. It is simply hard to accept that God is in control of our destinies, not us. But that is why it is absolutely essential to consider carefully what the Bible teaches on this subject.So yes, get Pink's book and look up the Scripture verses he cites. And for even more verses to consider see my \\"Scripture Workbook.\\""},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This has been my introduction to the Reformed doctrines of Grace, or Calvinism. I have always been a dispensational Baptist, not quite Arminian all the way, but also not Calvinistic all the way. I have always been disturbed by some of the verses in the bible that clearly talk about predestination and never heard a clear explanation of those verses; now I have. While I would have always said I believed God is Sovereign, now I really have a fuller understanding of that. While I have always believed humans are sinful, I now have a much more clear sense of how God sees us. And I have always been uncomfortable with Christians who proclaim Christ yet do not seem to even want to contend for the faith. This book validates my concerns. For these things alone, the book is worth reading. Pink is very scholarly and logical and makes many excellent points on these issues and more.However, I am still struggling with the doctrines of people being predestined for hell and that Christ only died for a select few. There are many verses in the bible that seem to me to refute these two beliefs, Pink's excellent arguments withstanding. Pink does a great job of presenting the Calvinistic viewpoint, but I keep thinking of the verses to the contrary that I have always known.Am I predestined to become a 5 point Calvinist? Right now I would say I am not irresistably drawn, but I will say I did get a lot out of this book and have decided to let God show me if I am to change my mind.

When I first read this book, I must admit that I found it hard to accept the doctrine of calvinism. Like many Christians in the charismatic churches, I was taught that I could lose my salavation, that Jesus Christ died for every person, and that free-will triumphs over God's sovereign will. Even so, this precious book has made me reconsidered my arminian beliefs until finally I began to see that salvation is from the Lord from the beginning to the end. How God has caused this book to impact my spiritual life is beyond measure to me. My whole outlook of life has changed dramatically, now that I know that He is in control of my life and my salvation.

This book is packed with Scripture, and will impact any serious Christian reader with a view of God that demands his/her whole-hearted reverence, adoration, love, and worship. Realizing the sovereignty of our God will accomplish peace in the hearts of His people like nothing else can bring. Knowing that God is sovereign will allow the Christian to truly walk by faith - Biblical faith in a God who loves him and sovereignly works all things according to His good pleasure. A sovereign God is truly the only kind of God who could ever carry through on a promise to work out everything for the good of those who love Him, and are called according to His purpose. It is this doctrine that will give God's children faith and motivation to pray - after all, there is no point in praying to God if He can't do whatever He wishes.

All things are subject to His (God's) immediate control: all things are moving in accord with His eternal purpose, and therefore, all things are working toether for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to His purpose.&quot;Rev. Pink himself knew that &quot;It would be foolish for us to expect that this work will meet with general approval.&quot; He saw the trend in modern Christendom (so-called) as being toward the &quot;deification of the creature rather than the glorification of the Creator.&quot;This book presents a relentless defining of not only the sovereignty of God, but also His sovereignty in Creation, Administration, Salvation, Reprobation, and in Prayer, to name a few. Arthur Pink exposes the modern gospel as a weak, apostate faith that has &quot;relagt(ed) God to the background.&quot;After reading this book, the Bible will become a new book to you.

I own two - one published by Baker which is 264 pages long, and one edited and republished by Banner of Truth which is only 160 pages, with fewer words on each page. They greatly abridged this book when they published it at Banner, and took out entire chapters (\\"Reprobation\\"). I once asked Walt Chantry which edition he recommended reading, wondering if he might recommend a softer presentation of Pink's work. He said, \\"I would want to read the book as he wrote it.\\" That is my recommendation as well. As much as I love the Banner of Truth, don't get their edition of The Sovereignty of God, get the full unabridged edition.This book is notorious. It is either highly recommended as \\"life changing\\" or it is hated and warned against as \\"heresy.\\" I can't say that it changed my life, but I can give it a high recommendation. The subject of God's sovereignty is controversial, but I think this has more to do with people's presuppositions and unwillingness to accept scripture for what it actually says. In this book, Pink goes through all the Bible teaching on God's sovereignty, that He does whatsoever He pleases, and shows how this is taught with regards to Creation, Administration, Salvation, Reprobation and Operation. He then deals with how this relates to man's will, human responsibility, and prayer. He closes the book with answers to objections, what our attitude should be toward this doctrine, and the value of it.This is an excellent book. At times my mind was opened as I considered truths that I hadn't even thought of before. I had to read portions from the chapter on \\"Creation\\" out loud to my wife because they were so insightful and useful.Our God is the sovereign ruler of the universe.

I recently read somewhere that this classic work remains one of the best defenses of Calvinism. Indeed, Pink is mostly a strong thinker, grounding himself consistently in Scripture. A frustration I have encountered when talking with people on either side of this issue is that they base their positions on what others have said or what they believe makes the most sense emotionally or logically. Pink rightly encourages Christians to read verses in context, which often lends a great deal of clarity regarding the extent of God's sovereign will.There are times when I think he casts some arguments out of hand without considering them carefully enough. The difficulties and objections chapter, for example, could provide a more robust detailed defense of his position. I still think that R.C Sproul's Chosen by God remains a better read regarding God's sovereignty for most readers, but Pink's work is a classic for God reason."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This is an excellent kindle book on the Sovereignty of God.

This book needs to be made available with an active table of contents."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"loved it!! never read any calvinistic ideas before, only got the book because of a want to learn about god's sovereignty --- it isn't a book about calvinism, but the writer's views are calvinistic, which after studying the points made by the author, and the verses to back it up, i think the author has it spot on. loved this book!! spiritual depth that really helps you to know god better. strong meat. you will not waste your time when you read this, it does not ramble. i read a LOT!! and this book, along with the sovereignty of god by spurgeon and also knowing god by packer are my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This book was recommended to me by my pastor because I was finding predestination difficult to fathom. The first five chapters were challenging and slow to read: I often read the same sentences over numerous times before I absorbed the content. (I loaned the book to my mother and she said that she had also been struggling with comprehension up to chapter six.) However, in spite of the initial \\"slow read\\", I liked A.W. Pink's writing style; he writes with depth and passion and all points are supported by scripture. After reading \\"The Sovereignty of God\\", I totally understand predestination and how God is truly sovereign in ALL things. I highly recommend this book; it should be a \\"must read\\" for seminary students."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I read this book when I was first being introduced to the reformed perspective of the sovereignty of God. As a new Christian I was still warming up to the idea of buying books for something other then school, so the fact that this volume is free online really helped. One thing I wasn't expecting was for my whole world to be rocked. If you have been used to a man centered theology this book may indeed shock you. With God's grace your eyes will see the world completely different. God is in control. He's not sitting back idle, but intimately involved with his creation.The book has a warm devotional feel on top of hundreds of references from scripture regarding God's sovereignty. One thing that I appreciated from this book was how he showed that God is in control of every thing that happens. He governs the whole world and everything that comes to pass by his providence. He covers election and the controversial doctrine of reprobation. He also gives practical application within each section including chapters based solely on what the implications of this doctrine are for our life. If you know anyone struggling with this doctrine or would like to introduce someone to the majestic sovereignty of a God who is passionate for his glory, I strongly recommend Pink's volume."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"Pink, A.W. : The Sovereignty of God (G)This is a great book. Pink explains not exhaustively but concisely and very helpfully what the Bible teaches about the sovereignty of God. If you are confused or find the doctrines known as Calvinism offensive this is a book that could be very helpful. The author does not water down the Bible's teachings but also does not go beyond the teachings. For those who embrace the sovereignty of God this book will show you again the importance of this doctrine and how it is practical in the Christians life. The book is a fairly simple read apart from a small technical part discussing the will of man, but even this section could be understood I just needed to focus more.

Pink write in easy to understand terms that aids in the often misunderstood doctrine of God's sovereignty. He takes on the controversial subject without apology."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"In 1930, A.W. Pink wrote The Sovereignty of God, an earthshaking book that awakened readers to the absolute and kingly control of God over all things. I read the book for the first time in 1991 and have read it several times since.Pink defines sovereignty in the first chapter: \\"To say that God is sovereign is to declare that God is God. To say that God is sovereign is to declare that He is the Most High, doing according to His will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, so that none can stay His hand or say unto Him what doest Thou? (Dan. 4:35).\\" Pink argues, \\"In a word, to deny the sovereignty of God is to enter upon a path which, if followed to its logical terminus, is to arrive at blank atheism.\\" He continues, \\"Sovereignty characterizes the whole Being of God. He is sovereign in all His attributes. He is sovereign in the exercise of His power. His power is exercised as He wills, when He wills, where He wills.\\" Indeed, there is no limit to the sovereignty of God.Pink surveys God's sovereignty by emphasizing His sovereignty in several areas including creation, administration, salvation, reprobation, human responsibility, and prayer to name a few.The Sovereignty of God should be required reading for every Bible College student and every Seminary student. Pastors should return again and again to this treasure. And Christians of all stripes should be encouraged by this marvelous book.5 stars"},{"Title":"Methods in Neuronal Modeling: From Synapses to Networks (Computational Neuroscience)","review":"I read this book as part of a Robotics Research project. It is a good introduction to Neuronal Modeling, and it was the first technical handbook of computational neuroscience. The book is a series of 13 articles on topics such as computer simulations of neural circuits, biophysical mechanisms for computation in neurons, etc. Each chapter concludes with a description of the model discussed and the details of its implementation on the computer. Since it is a series of articles, with many authors, the book feels a little bit fragmented. However, it is put together nicely and must have been skillfully edited. The book is easy to read, as well as interesting.The book should be of interest to a variety of people in Medicine and Technology (other than the people in the specific field), but especially to those who work with Artificial Neural Networks. An interested layman could also read this book. I have to admit that I have not read the second edition of this book, but hopefully it is equally good, in addition to being more up to date, so the second edition would probably be the one you should buy first."},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"It was one of the most addicting books I have evey read.

I know alot of people liked this story but it is totally out there. I disliked it terribly.The main protangist turns into a woman under a full moon, once a month that's 12 times a year. But the story only focuses when the chararcter is female, what about the rest of the time and year? Then they get married. The male and female couple. He will be a male 95% of the time yet this is almost ignored.This is not for any Yaoi Fan. Its silly."},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"Ok i was really disapointed with this one i mean im a fan and i read all of fake wich i LOVED it was a great series. it had everything and very juicy (everyone should check it out) but with until the full moon it did nothing for me i mean the relationship is more about him and the girl wich i dont mind but his relation with marlo was barely their. i mean it was bad the actuall drawings were great and all but i was just disapointed i was expecting much more"},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"If you're planning on buying this manga, the most important thing for you to realize is that it will not appeal to everyone. I know the \\"by the author of FAKE\\" tag is sure to lure many yaoi fangirls in, but the fact is, this isn't FAKE. I'm sorry, but it's not.The first difference you'll notice is that the two main characters aren't police detectives but, brace yourselves, supernatural creatures. Namely, a vampire and a werewolf. Marlo, the manga's main character, would be the starring werewolf, were he not plagued by an interesting genetic \\"disorder.\\" Basically, when the full moon hits 'im, he doesn't grow fangs and thick grey fur, but instead turns into a woman. (NOT a police detective.) And that's when the \\"main plot\\" kicks in. And by \\"kicks in\\" I mean: David (the vampire) incessantly tries to get into Marlo's pants. Of course, things are far more complicated than this, but I fear giving away plot twists and such.Basically, if you liked Matoh's artstyle in FAKE, or if you like vampires and werewolves, or are a fan of guys turning into girls and vice versa, then I would highly recommend this. The characters are charming (even the \\"bad guys\\"), the art is beautiful, and the story is, though not entirely original, thoroughly enjoyable.(As a sidenote, I'd like to apologize for any sarcastic comments/snideness. The fact that so many reviewers seemed to be trying to turn a perfectly good manga into another finally got to me. I do, in fact, love FAKE, but Matoh has the priviledge of creating works other than FAKE.)"},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"Quick Summary-------------David, an aristocratic womanizing vampire, and Marlo, the son of a werewolf and vampire, are best friends. They haven't seen each other for years, but when Marlo's parents bring him to David's father, a renknown doctor, for a 'special problem' Marlo seems strangely cold to David.The reason for this is revealed when the reader discovers that, due to his strange genetic background, Marlo turns into a woman during the full moon!The parents decide that the solution to Marlo's 'little problem' is to engage him to David. David is thrilled about the situation, proclaiming his love for Marlo at every opportunity, but Marlo isn't sure what he feels.The two then have the standard romantic hijinks that result in most shojo manga, with fantasy twists.Pros----Fans of comic fantasy will get a kick out of this short series. It's a cute, funny, and, as always, beautifully drawn romp that involves werewolves, vampires, witches, and gender switching. Throw in a dash of romantic complication and you've got a fun little two volume seriesCons----Fans of romance or Boy's Love will find themselves disappointed. Matoh tries to do too much within just two volumes, and not enough of it focuses on the deeper aspects of David and Marlo's relationship.A part of the reason for this might be that the series was cancelled in the Boy's Love magazine it originally ran in and another of Matoh's publishers allowed her to finish out the seies quickly in another (non BL) magazine. As a result it feels rushed.The Bottom Line----------------\\"Until the Full Moon\\" is cute, funny, and beautifully drawn. Just don't expect any sort of deep emotion or meaning. Fans of Matoh's other works may be disappointed, but new fans or those simply interested in the fantasy elements will be happy enough.Think of it like sorbet. It's pleasureable, and a nice palate cleanser, but doesn't have enough substance to make a meal. It does, however, make a decent dessert."},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"Once I knew that this book was by the author of FAKE, I picked it up right away. I was amazed when I read it because, not only was it hilarious, it was really romantic. It has a good bunch of fantasy too, so anyone who doesn't mind some yaoi, should definetly read this!!"},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"I'm surprised that people are comparing this to Fake...it IS by the same author but it is NOT yaoi!!!!I would say it's just a story (it doesn't fit into yaoi or shoujo)...It is about Vincent, a vampire and a lady's man, and Marlo, who turns into a woman on a full moon! The story is about how Vincent loves Marlo either way and doesn't care about what other people say. When their parents find out, they decide to let Vincent and Marlo get married -- and that's where all the humor and drama starts :)The story is very cute and the artwork is super...as usual! But it's WORLDS away from Fake -- so don't compare them, please!!!"},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"For those of you who have read FAKE, following it through book by book and maybe even buying the FAKE animated feature, we all have a bearing about how good Until the full moon will be. And let me tell you now, it's much better than anticipated.There are characters not until those of the FAKE manga, Marlo a half vampire/werewolf is not unlike Ryo and playboy vampire David not unlike Dee. In this manga, instead of going down the police storylines, it focuses on fantasy.Like in Sanami Matoh's last series there is an equal amount of romance and humour. For people who like slash or fantasy I would add this to your shopping basket. For those of you who liked Fake put this in your basket. For those of you who normally read shojo, put this in your basket. And for those of you looking for something different, put this in your basket.I also recommended Sanami Matoh's FAKE series... [But I figure you might have guessed that] and with Pet shop of Horrors by Matsuri Akino"},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"Just a warning: If you liked Fake, don't buy this book.This book is often listed under yaoi, because it's about a gender switching, half/werewolf/vampire who is being pursued by a male vampire, so occasionally there is some M/M action, mostly groping. Rare, though. And second volume, don't even think about it. The romance is all between the man and the female version, and that is not something dedicated yaoi fans should have to see, much less waste their money on. Don't listen to anyone who says you'll like this if you like Fake. Sanami Matoh is a goddess for creating Fake... but she is equally dedicated to het stories, so just because it's by her, don't assume it has the same good stuff."},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"This one has a paranormal bent featuring werewolves, vampires and pretty young men. How could you go wrong, right? Well, it happens.Marlo is the child of werewolf and a vampire and recently started changing during the full moon. Instead of turning into a wolf, as expected, he's changes gender. His parents enlist the help of an old family friend whose rakish son, David, had an innocent but more than friends type of relationship with Marlo when they were young. But it's been 10 years and Marlo wants to keep his \\"problem\\" from David. It's not long though before David sees first hand what is going on and is painfully attracted to the female form of Marlo. But he doesn't' seem to mind the male form all that much either. The parents of these two young men decide that a cure is unlikely decide they should marry. Enter Marlo's ex-girlfriend to stir up feelings of jealousy and tension and two old friends of David who cause a wee bit of trouble for him as well. After these issues are resolved the book steps back in time to a past version of Marlo & David which I guess is show that they've always belonged together? I don't know, it was all a little strange and not as cohesive as the author's previous work in \\"Fake\\". Sadly, the relationship wasn't nearly as interesting as the one in the \\"Fake\\" series either. Though David loves Marlo regardless of which form he's in, Marlo doesn't want David near him unless he's a girl which is only day a month. A bit disappointing overall."},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"I guess this is a fair manga on its own, but I, like most others who read this, came looking for more like /FAKE/ and met with (pardon the pun) a total cop-out. Simply put, Matoh-sensei didn't have the guts to do what she did with /FAKE/, i.e. establish a believable homosexual relationship between the two main characters. Most of their romantic moments take place while Marlo is in his female form, and I see this as the manga-ka wimping out on us. Granted, there are kisses (scant) and declarations of love since childhood (unconvincing) while Marlo remains male, but these just failed to move me the way /FAKE/ did. And the characters didn't help. Marlo was depressingly effeminate, even when he was still a guy, and obviously unable to take care of himself; a traditional Gothic heroine. David was unconvincing in his declarations of eternal love, which I found interesting that they only came after he found out that Marlo turns into a girl once a month. One thing I will say for Sanami Matoh: she can write fantasy. But honestly, she should've just taken out the yaoi element altogether, and left this a straight fantasy (no pun intended, this time)."},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"I was attracted to this because of the interesting story line, involving a guy named Marlo, who is a half-breed vampire/werewolf character. However, the really interesting part of this story is that during the day Marlo is a guy but his gender changes during a full moon. It's really interesting and has a lot of neat characters. David is a playboy vampire who really likes Marlo but no one can take him too seriously. The story is really funny and romantic, with a serious under-tone at times. There is also a ton of male/male action in it. I found this to be very creative and compelling."},{"Title":"Until the Full Moon Volume 1","review":"Yes, this is a little light on the Yaoi side of things. Marlo spends a lot of time as a female in the book, and there is no sex. However, there story is witty, well developed and the love story IS there. Also, there is angst in abundance as Marlo struggles for his feelings for David which began as a young man and which he still has. I enjoyed this enough to check out the Mangaka's other work.If you've already read through most of the hard Yaoi available in English (like I have), and are looking for something fun, with a Yaoi theme, this is definitely worth picking up."},{"Title":"The Fisher-Stombaugh families and allied lineages of Maryland and Pennsylvania, 1715-1949,","review":"I kept running into Florence Hepp Peterson's name in my Fisher genealogy research, and thought I'd take a chance and buy her book.

Rediscovering Catholicism should be required reading for not only all Catholics (especially those who have willfully pulled away from the Church) but for people of all faiths. It thoroughly addresses the three major philosophies that have so readily and indiscriminately found their way into our present western culture i.e. individualism, hedonism, and minimalism and passes along centuries-old wisdom on what is the only true path to overcome these empty ways of living. Matthew Kelly writes in a simple prose style that should be easily understandable for readers 12 and older which is of importance because I believe that teenagers especially and the youth of our society should read this book and fully digest what it says! The youth are the ones who are the most easily influenced, desensitized, and targeted by the internet and all forms of media. They need food for the soul and an insight into the spiritual life which Matthew Kelly more than provides in this book.

Because Matthew Kelly does not provide a citation for even the most basic concepts he is either: plagarizing or a plain poor example for young people to follow. His books, while inspirational to some, does not provide the reader new avenues of our rich Catholic/Orthodox history to follow - to rediscover Catholicism is to rediscover how we \\"fit\\" into history, salvation history, to make this moment a moment of faith and fulfillment to our calling. If you look at even the most simple work of our present Holy Father, Benedict XVI, even he cites every thought he uses, not because he wants everyone to know how smart his is, but because he wants those who read, even his letters, to look to the sources of faith: scriptures, Early Church Fathers, Doctors of the Church, and the many faithful throughout history.This is why I don't recommend Mr. Kelly's work."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"at this time I have not read it.

As Matthew Kelly points out, it's not for everyone; but, it is definitely for any Catholic (although a Christian of any faith could benefit from this book) that finds himself questioning his faith. There are a lot of self-help books out there; however, in a very straight-forward way, this book can be life changing."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"I found Mr. Kelly's book to be inspiring and enjoyable to read. I wholeheartedly agree with much that he has to say and find his enthusiasm refreshing. I was, however, distressed to find several grammatical errors throughout the text (I work as a writer and editor and they just seem to jump out at me!). I'm not sure if these are to be attributed to Kelly or to his editor, but I hope that if the book goes into a second edition that they will be corrected. The errors' presence in the book serves as a distraction from Kelly's message, and sadly, in my opinion, harms his credibility.

Now you know how God the Father feels!There. I just saved you reading five pages of junk with a pious ending.What kind of theology is this? What kind of representation of the Holy Trinity is this? Surely Kelly knows the Catholic teaching that Jesus Christ died, but he did not stay dead. Rather, he _rose from the dead_. Surely Kelly knows that Christ is not dead, and was not lost to the Father.This story -- which leads off the book -- distorts the central teaching of the Christian faith, for the sake of getting an emotional response.

With a clear voice, he shows how each area of society should and would inculcate a biblical worldview if those who claim to be Catholic lived what they say they believe.Divided into readable sections, Kelly explores the need for a Savior, the relevancy of Christ today and the call for holiness that a personal relationship with Jesus requires. His look at seven pillars of Catholic spirituality is an objective take on what makes us Catholic and how, if applied, will renew the inner life of the individual. His section on fasting and discipline is a real slap on the hand to most of us, as it should be.Kelly makes a passionate plea for a return to virtue and calls on all who claim the Catholic faith to look to Jesus and emulate His call to evangelization. Through servant leadership, courage, and Christian character that comes from a personal and growing faith in Jesus, we as a people, will draw the sinner to Christ.This book will challenge even the weakest to become more bold in what Christ and His Church would look like if we all hungered and thirst after righteousness.REDISCOVERING CATHOLICISM: JOURNEYING TOWARD OUR SPIRITAUL NORTH STARBy Matthew KellyISBN: 1-929266-08-1For more book reviews see Lori Bragg Harris"},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"This book will inspire you to be a better person, Christian, and Catholic.

Here goes: If you're looking for a book on what it takes to be a fundamentalist catholic whose idea of God has never progressed beyond the 6th grade, then this book is for you. In all fairness I have to confess I read very little of the book. The little story at the beginning about the pandemic for which there is no cure pretty much ruined everything in advanced. It's one of those stories I would expect to hear at a Baptist summer retreat for middle schoolers, not for serious-minded adults looking for deep catholic theology. Then I flipped to the section on the rosary. When it was implied that a woman was cured of cancer because she was lucky enough to have prayed using Mother Theresa's magic rosary, I wanted to throw the book across the room. I'm a 45 year old who is meandering his way back into the catholic church after a 30 year search. This is the kind of theology which has only served to keep me away from organized religion. Catholicism has a history rich with authors and saints who are willing to explore the depths of human experience. It seems this book is full of tired, pat answers we've all heard a million times. Matthew Kelly is probably a great guy with good intentions, but this book is content to feed us more milk, when so many of us are dying for meat."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"same book as &#34;Rediscover Catholicism&#34; just a different addition!do not understand why that wasn't told to me in the discription of the book!!"},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"When the book was loaned to me a few years ago, I was sceptical.

It helps me to keep in focus my spiritual side."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Kelly helps us to take inventory of the contributions of the church. He reminds us of the power of stories and role models--easily found, yet often undervalued, in the lives of the saints. He encourages us to change ourselves and our Church by looking to our great history and the potential of our future.This is a great read. It is NOT a \\"self help\\" book. It is an honest look at how we can grow as a person and a society through spiritual empowerment used as a tool for the attainment of greater holiness."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"I'm a Catholic mother looking for a reason to stay and keep my kids in the church. After reading this book, I want to run away. In Chapter 2, Kelly highlights 3 \\"prevailing\\" philosophies that he blames for the \\"tremendous moral and ethical confusion\\" of today. (1) Of INDIVIDUALISM he writes, \\"individualism always weakens the community and causes the whole to suffer. In every instance it is a cancerous growth.\\" Terrorists who want to kill Americans agree with Kelly. Our great country has its roots in individualism which is core to capitalism, innovation, creativity, problem-solving, competition, tolerance, self-suffifciency, individual responsibility, and freedoms for all citizens.Secondly, Kelly attacks HEDONISM describing it as \\"...the philosophy that emphasizes pleasure as the ultimate goal of life\\" and \\"a passport to enslavement by a thousand cravings and addictions\\". Actually, anything that causes despair (such as addictions) are antithetical to hedonism. Hedonism says that individuals have the right to pursue their own happiness (sound familiar?)and to reach out for activities and attitudes that appeal to the mind and body and facilitate performance at work, social obligations and life goals. \\"Overindulgence\\", \\"moral decay\\", \\"lust\\" and \\"overconsumption\\" are not reflective of the true Hedonism.If you know anything about MINIMALISM, you know that Kelly doesn't know a thing about Minamalism. He writes, \\"A minimalist is always asking, 'What is the least I can do? A minimalist is always seeking to exert the minimum effort and receive the maximum reward. Minimalism is the enemy of excellence and the father of mediocrity. It is one of the greatest philosphical diseases of our age.\\" WOW! KELLY really didn't do his homework. I'm a little embarassed for him. Kelly is talking about SELF-REGULATION and doesn't even know it. PATHETIC! The church really looks dumb and out of touch with this book. That is what I rediscovered about Catholism. I'll look for spiritual growth in a more intelligent place."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"thhis book breaksdown tosimple reading. Perhaps a page or two on each segment which knits into a wonderful path to holiness"},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"I grew up catholic. Up to sixth grade, then out into the the real world. I never lost the passion for my faith, but I did get off track for a few years. Life happens as you know, and the best thing about a strong catholic ubringing is, you never fully forget it. I can still recite 60% of a catholic mass by memory. I was gifted a miracle this year, I know it cant be explained as anything else. So I wondered why I should be so bold as to ask God for help? Being a child of God made me question why I wasnt a MAN of God. What happens along the years? Is the church relevant to me as an adult? Are the teachings great for the open mind of a child, but not so great for the cynical mind of the 21st century American male?Matthew Kelly brings up alot of these questions, and provides even MORE answers. Do you wonder about aspects of the faith? The importance of fasting, or why the sacrement cannot be partaken by all? Have you wondered why we honor the saints as we do? Kelly points out the reasons why, and gives specific examples of why our honored saints are to be respected and loved.Kelly is not preaching on some alter on high, he points out where the modern church seems weak. Where the contemporary Catholic may feel disconnected or lost. What he does though, which is clearly not a shortfall of the faith, is clarify Gods intention for YOU. God puts us here to live this life to be a part of his creation, to learn, and to be the \\"best us we can be\\" Kelly makes this point once a chapter it seems. Those that may feel lost, could end up blaming the parish, or the diocese, or Rome...but its all up to US.Isnt it great to know that we are the ones piloting our own ship? Are you? Do you use the tools God has given you? Do you honor him by loving your family, friends, and God himself?This book may or may not answer all your questions. I was debating a return to the catholic church, and for me, it isnt the answer right now. I will love God and praise him as i grow in my understanding of his love or us. There is still too much politics in the church, and those arent the rules of God to me. Matthew Kelly sees this and covers this in depth in this book, and prays (hopefully) that old politics will change enough to lead the church through its current troubled time into a glorious future. I pray for that as well.Thanks be to you Matthew for helping me heal my broken heart, and allowing this wayward faithful man to again walk a path of God."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Matthew Kelly has given us a lot to think about.

Want to know more about the Catholic faith? Read this book. All fallen away Catholics should read and pass it on."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Kelly's book is insightful and provocative. It stimulates the heart and mind to either \\"rediscover\\" our Catholic identity, thoughts and traditions or to discover them for the first time for those who have not lived the Catholic tradition from the cradle. The book will help re-focus your Catholic faith in wonderful and powerful ways."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"A friend pulled a quote from this book, and that's what made me put it on my wish list. The more she quoted to me, the more anxious I got to actually read it myself! There are so many succinct and well-articulated thoughts in here that it makes up for some of the redundancy. I think Kelly's aim was to make sure he reminded you of major points incase you didn't read the book quickly enough to remember. It didn't bother me -- just made me think about it more!It's refreshing to find someone who is willing to be honest about how we, as Catholics, need to step up our game. The truth is that the Church is beautiful, awe-inspiring, and the surest way to Christ. We lead lives that are not so pretty, not really inspiring, and faltering on our way to recognizing the Cross and our Savior. He challenges us to really try to embrace and live out the counter-cultural lifestyle that is true Christianity, and he reminded me to remember that our faith isn't about what is happening now -- it's about what happened 2000 years ago, and the fervent, passionate, incredible community that came from Jesus' first group of disciples. If we can think on that, remember what that was like, it should inspire us to continue the mission even more wholeheartedly.There are lots of suggestions for tools to grow in faith, examples to remember, and challenges for how to make our faith communities better. And it's an easy read with some amazing quotes to pull out and hold on to. Definitely recommended, and I plan on sharing it with people in my life who may need a boost to renewing their faith and love of the Catholic Church."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"I found this book inspiring and informative. It is an excellent contemporary manual for those starting their persuit of Holiness. Like all books of this sort, you only get out of it what you put into it. But unlike many other books, this text has enough substance and vision to really benifit readers who take it seriously and follow it up with action. I first got the book several years ago and try to read it every two years or so. Each time I revisit it I find myself renewed in many ways. My only complaint has nothing to do with the book, but with Mr Kelly's self promotion (it is rather self centered and unbecoming for a person who has authored a book on Holiness). Nonetheless, God has written a wonderful book through his efforts. I hope you read it!"},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Did not enjoy this book it seems to be more like a novel then a rediscovering book.

I found out it was given away during Christmas, and I was much past this time so I decide to get a copy myself. I downloaded this on my Kindle and was amazed at the power of what I was reading. You do have to get past the first parable at the beginning of the book, this may shy people away but it is in no way a prelude to the way the book is written. Lets just say, I buy most of my books on Amazon and for my kindle and this is the first time I have ever written a review.This book shed some much needed light on my path as a Catholic, which as the book suggests, I was rediscovering. It takes you from just going to church on Sunday, to taking Gods words and the work of Jesus with you every day. It also takes the works of our Catholic roots, and brings them into the present in a very relevant way. This is a great book for those who may find themselves lost, or who want to renew their faith. I would highly suggest this for any Catholic or other faith based individula to read and discover for themselves."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Love this book and Matthew Kelly's CD's.

Go again, Matthew!"},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"I'm currently battling with Catholics Come Home (itself, far from a perfect voice for the Church) to get them to stop promoting this book. Not only is the reasoning childish and undocumented, Kelly also indulges himself in egotistical rants about his pet hatreds or political opinions, including some junk science fat bashing among many others. If you want to know what Catholicism's about, read the Catechism, or check out the \\"One True Faith\\" video series, or Peter Kreeft, or C. S. Lewis (OK, not Catholic, but we've adopted him.) I pray (literally) for the people who Kelly has turned away from the Church with his ignorant pomposity."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"I finished &quot;Rediscovering Catholicism&quot; last week and am astounded at the impact that it has had on my life. Now, don't get me wrong; I haven't just become immediately &quot;holy&quot;, but I do find myself rethinking many decisions in my life.I do not feel that Mr. Kelly wrote this book to be a college text, and it should not be reviewed as one. No footnotes: I say good! Those who most need this book need not see the sources of Mr. Kelly's writings. I believe that it was written to be a self-help book for those who need a little encouragement on their Catholic path. Take it for what it is: a WONDERFUL, personal Catholic revitalization!I am a life-long Catholic who was taught in Catholic schools all of my life (K-Grad School), but this book, at this stage in my life, helped me to learn more about my personal, Catholic faith than any classroom ever did. It's free moving treatment is wonderful. Mr. Kelly does not dwell on harsh points and always helps the reader guide him/herself along their own, personal path to their &quot;Spiritual North Star&quot;.Just as with all of these reviews, I hope that you take this for what it is worth: the view of a late-20's Catholic who was in need of a jump-start. &quot;Rediscovering Catholicism&quot; MORE than fit that bill."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Matthew Kelly's book is overwhelming. It is hard to put into words the power of his message, or I should say, Christ's message. I recommend this book to everyone who is Christian or interested in Christianity. And certainly, Catholics should read it if they are at all unclear about their church. Still, it is possible that the title could also be Rediscovering Christianity, because the focus of the book is becoming Holy and finding the only kind of happiness that endures."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"I am a convert to Catholicism and then drifted away and became a lukewarm Catholic. Kelly's book showed me what I was missing, why I should not take the Mass for granted, and why being Catholic is definitely the right choice for me!! Kelly is a relatively young (born in 1973) Catholic who speaks with more wisedom than most longer-tenured Catholics! If you are looking to re-energize your faith, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Matthew Kelly's book is life changing! I recommend it for every catholic out there. If I had the money I would give copies to everyone I know. He stresses on getting back to the basics of our Catholic faith. So often we focus on the details that aren't too important and forget to pay attention to our foundation. I thouroughly recommend this book to anyone, catholic, non-catholic, and those thinking of becoming catholic."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Matthew Kelly gives a stunning and passionate yet still grounded in reality open to the world perspective and scope on how the ancient religion was never gone but just out of view for a while. Anne Rice returned after 30 years, I did after 15, and many others find their way back to Rome. All roads lead to Rome no matter what side paths you take. God will always forgive and if need be ... there is a Redemptist Order for those lost flock who are now found.When I needed to navigate to my true soul's north star this was an instrumental book along with my old Catholic bible. The rosary made sense in the inner journey that surrendered my heart back to God and re-established the Catholic church as my compass. Matthew Kelly paints a stunning overview of just why Catholicism matters so intimatley in people's lives.Just to give you a context of why this book is such a Catholic treasure ... I had not been to confession in 15 years because I had dabbled in New Age spirituality since freshman year at University. I had falsly come to the belief that my precognitive capacity had me in danger with the very church that ended up being my salvation from a secular existence comprised of career-driven, ambition seeking urban professional who only had time for friends, and a second income being a known intuitive and paid consultant on what the future would bring. In truth, my spiritual gifts were meant to raise and build the church ... nothing else.You see, when a dark night of the soul came upon me it wasn't my tarot decks, my horoscope, my yoga teacher, chakra meditations, affirmations, incense, a secular psychologist, my own trusted and very expensive psychic, and most of all ... my own intuition that brought me back. It was prayer, confession, and books like this that restored my spiritual foundation. Being a Roman Catholic never leaves you ... you can take the girl out of the church but not the church out of the girl."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star by Matthew Kelly is a strongly written defense of traditional Catholicism as a way of life designed by God to help each person live to the fullest. Pondering diverse issues and crises, dispelling dozens of myths, and all the while reinforcing the importance of faith, hope, and salvation, Rediscovering Catholicism is energetically recommended for its invigorating, inspirational, and spiritual presentation."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"I attacked this book today and was really hoping that this was a book to give a new voice to authentic Catholic teaching. If you are cafeteria Catholic at this point in your life,(no offense but you know who you are), you might get suckered into the feel good nature of this book and be tempted to give it 5 stars. IF however, you're a authentic Mass going Catholic its more of the same spritual cotton candy, pretending to be the real Catholic goods. I'll just tell you its the same old \\"how did we as a church go wrong\\" stuff... His answer: we are hypocrites. He ignores by name all the controversial issues (gay marriage, abortion, contraception, women priests), instead of maturely taking them on, and pretends these will go away in peoples minds if Church leaders and all Catholics act less hypcritical. Really? Does anyone believe these issues aren't real? How about owning church teaching like a proud Catholic, Matthew? Wouldn't that be original these days!But sticking your neck out well that's scary, that takes real hard work, study, thought, more research, footnotes and creativity and besides anyone who espouses that stuff could easily open themselves up to the charge of being a hypocrite.... which would then lead to more empty pews (according to Matthew)... see how this works? are you sick to your stomach yet?Honestly, this book isn't it. You may feel good after reading it, but do not kid yourself, this won't bring you into communion with the Church if you are wrestling with \\"issues\\" as a Catholic. Do yourself a favor and next time go and read authentic, lovingly presented Catholic teaching from someone like Christopher West or JP II.It ain't easy being Catholic in our secular world, you need AUTHENTIC theology and teaching along with prayer, action, and the Sacraments. I'm afraid this book won't help."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Great book for 'cradle Catholics' . Answers are given for so many of the questions we had as to Why are we doing this?

I strongly recommend this book to any Catholic. This should be a go-to resource for Catholic culture warriors. I imagine that saints would recommend it to their disciples, and that anyone who thinks that they could glean nothing from this book have some way to go before reaching living sainthood. His chapter on fasting, a practice which you might prejudice as unpleasant, is particularly excellent. No really!While Kelly did somewhat overuse some of his trademark unintentionally groan-worthy buzz-phrases (e.g. \\"best-version-of-yourself\\" and \\"Spiritual North Star\\"), he did not overuse them as much as he has in some of his spoken word publications. To the positive, he strongly recommends periodic confession as well as adoration, fasting and recommends against weak-sauce Lenten penances like giving up candy in a way that is challenging, not insulting (sorry to those I might offend).His work is indeed almost void of citations of other sources. The positive is that the work is accessible to all, the negative is that it does little to point one to other good spiritual works, to my recollection.I highlighted something on almost every page. I've been serious about my faith for years and enjoy \\"deeper\\" reading like Theology of the Body, but I had the grace to accept that this book had something to teach me and I did my best to absorb it. I loved his words on personal discipline.To be honest, my only real qualm with the book was toward the end when he said he considers ordination of women in the future to be \\"unlikely\\", whereas an ardent Catholic naturally knows that it is definitively IMPOSSIBLE (that is, no likelihood, rather than little likelihood). That was my only hint that Mr. Kelly might not be steeped in all the teachings of the church, and I probably read too much into his word choice. When a red flag raises for me, I am a very wary Catholic. I'm one of those. And Kelly's book meets my approval. He spoke well of spiritual and personal discipline and I'm grateful to him for this book."},{"Title":"Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star","review":"Though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I did find the title quite misleading. In this book, Matthew Kelly continues in his more of a \\"self-help\\" style, more so than a work on Catholicism. This book evoked some challenges and stirred up some emotions, and really convicts the reader to take ownership of their faith. For the most part though the book's content probably would have been better titled \\"Rediscovering Christianity\\" or \\"Rediscovering Spirituality\\". This book in the last section does seem to breeze by some Catholic doctrines and practices, but again in more of a sense of spiritualness than anything else. If you are looking for a book to perhaps reignite your lost piety or give you a new spiritual outlook on life I highly recommend it. However if you are looking for more doctrine defining or apologetical works I would recommend you look more towards a Karl Keating or my personal favorite, Scott Hahn."},{"Title":"Modern Multithreading: Implementing, Testing, and Debugging Multithreaded Java and C++/Pthreads/Win32 Programs","review":"As a Java engineer, I cannot really recommend this book.

I have already completed my bachelors degree in Computer Science, which means I only had a basic understanding of threading from my Distributed Computing class. So, I knew a whole bunch of thread jargon and slightly understood how threads are created and what the critical section problem is, as well as a basic understanding of how semaphores can solve the problem. Beyond that, the book has taught me what goes on behind the scenes of thread creation and why critical sections can be so complicated. The average Computer Science student is not interested in how it works behind the scenes, only how to make it work for their current needs. This book, while useful to a more adept coder, will not quickly and easily fulfill that requirement. It is definitely geared toward those that are really serious about multithreading and intend to test/use their threading knowledge over and over again.

This book has them, but the writing isn't that clear or readable. It reads like a grad. level paper more than a standard technical book that most of us are used to.The book lightly covers standard multithreading concepts and objects, but you're better off learning those someplace else because I'm sure it's explained in more \\"laymen\\" terms elsewhere. The one thing this book does do well is offer a way for you to write mutexes, semaphores, monitors, etc. in a way that would allow you to replay a given run of a multithreaded program (assuming you also can reproduce the input to said program somehow). If you know how to debug a single threaded application, this ability makes it easier to debug a multithreaded program. (As things become determisitic.)However, if you already have a program that you're trying to debug, you end up out of luck, unless you want to port your program to use these new libraries.Also note that all the examples in this book are for C++ or Java.

The recipes are actually the second half of Classical Cooking and while they are consistently good, the really amazing part of the original version happens to be the theory section that professional ethics, sanitation, and safety, kitchen management, food descriptions and purchasing, nutrition, menu planning, accounting, before going to cooking theory.Apparently, John Wiley intends on publishing this content at some point, but it is a real shame that they chose to A.) break up the book in two, and B.) publish the recipes first. It is the missing theory and methods section that teaches the fundamentals of running a restaurant, hotel, or institutional kitchen.One excellent solution is to seek out the out-of-print 2nd edition (Van Nostrand Reinhold) in used bookstores.

Moonfire, her best selling book on Fictionwise, is the first book to take us to the exotic future world Treaine, with its multiple moons and varied cultures. I couldn't wait to get back to the future with this newest romance.Sebastian Asteril rescues Cassie Gordon from a flesh auction by purchasing her. He isn't sure why he did that, he'd seen many other women being sold before, but Cassie is different and he has no choice, he can't leave her. An outcast from Treaine, stripped of his rank as captain in the Mariltar Seventh Fleet, Sebastian is a trader of goods among the far flung worlds. He takes Cassie with him, but when danger threatens, he marries her and leaves her on Treaine. Unsure of her growing feelings for the scoundrel Sebastian, Cassie is excited and unsettled when he returns. He tells her he is allowed on Treaine for a brief time to trade, yet his actions remain suspicious and she begins to wonder if he is as he seems. Danger from her past threatens not only Cassie but the entire Crestar System and Sebastian is the only one who can save them all.Ms. Clarke is a masterful writer who makes you care about her characters. I always know that I will find a fully developed new world to explore with two people I want to get to know quite well.

By the time they arrive at their destination, Sebastian and Cassie have developed a bond - but will it survive Cassie's psychological trauma from the pirate attack and Sebastian's lies?This full-length novel has a very ambitious plot of broad scope containing a controversial topic (drugs and drug-dealing), as well as a love story that spans time and distance. The plot moves along at a fast clip, and the author manages to keep surprises coming until the very end. Clarke definitely knows her science fiction, ably blending a believable science fiction story with an emotional romance. In my opinion, StarJumper's Bride is a superior addition to the genre of futuristic romance, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.I liked the character of Sebastian a lot - he was brash and sexy, and came across as a very independent guy. I was less fond of Cassie's character because at first she seemed timid and passive in many ways - not really a match for Sebastian -- although her character grew and developed as the story progressed. The love scenes are sensual and somewhat explicit, and demonstrate the hero and heroine's growing affection for each other. Readers should be warned that the story does contain some violence, which is used to move the plot forward. -- Jean, Fallen Angel Reviews (courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews)"},{"Title":"StarJumper's Bride","review":"I was really excited to get this book. But unfortunately, I could not get into the story. The storyline was fine but the heroine really bothered me, she just seemed really passive and boring. I stopped and started this book so many times I lost count. And because it was so expensive, I ultimately felt let down. Maybe if it was purchased as an e-book and I didn't have such expectation (based on the other reviews) I might have felt better."},{"Title":"Syntax: A Functional Typological Introduction (2 Volumes)","review":"Oh, the greatest joy is having your instructor of syntax to be the one, the only Tom Givon. I suppose for all the non-UO students, you must merely read his grand text, which we are discussing here. To all who are getting this for school, yes he even speaks this way. In fact, it's stranger in person because of his thick accent (born in Israel, raised in Spain). But don't get me wrong, he is at the top of his field for the subject, he just needs to work on the delivery.

Pogue is a classic piece of World War II literature. Dr. Pogue (1912-1996) was a military historian of some note, having served as one of the U.S. Armies official historians for decades. Pogue was among a large cadre of PhD-level historians serving with the U.S. Army during the Second World War who were first and foremost academic historians and secondly soldiers in the U.S. Army. Pogue's writings are always of the highest quality and his assessments critical yet fair. His presentation and assessments in the \\"Supreme Command\\" are no departure from this trend. As a volume in the 'Green Book' series, \\"Supreme Command\\" is just one of several official U.S. Army histories offer by the Office of the Chief of Military History (Dept of Army) in the years following the war. \\"Supreme Command\\" was first published in 1954, after several years of painstaking research on Dr. Pogue's part. As is generally true of other volumes of the 'Green Books', \\"Supreme Command\\" is limited in scope relative to the entirety of the war. In the case of the \\"Supreme Command\\", Pogue limits his study to issues associated with Dwight D. Eisenhower and SHAEF activities in NW Europe from the announcement of Ike as Supreme Commander to the cessation of hostilities. Although the 'Green Book' series is an official history of the U.S. Army, Pogue does not limit his prose to the U.S. Army. Rather, as is inherent in the allied nature of SHAEF and its command activities, Pogue often includes issues dealing with the British, Canadians and Russians (as well as more minor Allied partners where applicable) as they relate to activities of the Supreme Commander, SHAEF and U.S. Army activities. As such \\"Supreme Command\\" is more holistic in presentation than many of the other volumes of the 'Green Book' series.At times Dr. Pogue's style is stiff and quite 'academic' (not too surprising as this series was written as an official history of the activities of the U.S. Army in the Second World War, not as a marketable product per se). Yet, the \\"Supreme Command\\" is full of important information valuable to serious students of WWII history. Readers should also realize that Pogue's presentation of this information was one of the first of its kind and much of the historical writings dealing with similar topics over the past 50 years have grown directly (or liberally borrowed) from Dr. Pogue's work - making this is one of the most influential pieces of its kind out there.While sometimes dry this book is a significant and important piece of work not to be missed by anyone with a deep interest in the events of 1944-45 in NW Europe; especially for anyone who has or plans to write about such topics! 5 stars."},{"Title":"Reading German: A Course Book and Reference Grammar","review":"I have used this book to supplement my own book, German Quickly:A Grammar for Reading German, and I have found the explanationsextremely helpful and the readings more interesting than thestandard textbook fare. Initially, the book looked scary, even to me, and I teach German! Therefore, I think it is more useful as a review book than as an introductory grammar. For the price, it's an excellent value, and a useful reference for anyone seriously interested in reading German scholarly texts."},{"Title":"Reading German: A Course Book and Reference Grammar","review":"I used this text in an independent study course, and found that while it taught me basic grammar principles, it was confusing as it didn't use the traditional names for these principles. For example, subjunctive forms were called &quot;non-factual.&quot; It explained what a noun, verb, sentence, and independent clause were. This is most helpful for someone who has never learned a foreign language before, but for someone who has a solid grounding in grammar, this book is a bit too simple."},{"Title":"Reading German: A Course Book and Reference Grammar","review":"I agree with April, this book is not necessarily an introductory text. It seems more of a comprehensive review or could be used to sew up the complex topics that you've never quite understood. I've read a lot of German textbooks and this one is one of the most rich in terms in raw content. Simply tons of applicable text in English/German, grammar topics coming from a slightly different angle (which is always helpful for me), and exercises. The format of the book is a little different than most language tutorials you'll come across. There are basically four main sections (1) A Reading Course - essentially concepts + associated exercises, wrapped up with 5 chapters of texts/exercises. (2) Reference Section [my favorite]- individual grammar topics which are referenced throughout the Reading Course. These can also be \\"cherry-picked\\" by the reader. (3) Further Exercises - auxiliary exercise section and (4) German-English Text Corpus - 23 excerpts (about a page a piece) of German articles, books, etc. Because of the way it references the reader to various sections, I found myself jumping around in a non-linear fashion and, as a result, came to the same supporting grammer topics from different directions in the text. Depending on your learning style, this could get annoying. No dictionary or glossary is provided, so have your pocket Langenscheidt or Harper-Collins ready. On the plus side, all exercises and German texts have corresponding English translations for them."},{"Title":"Reading German: A Course Book and Reference Grammar","review":"\\"Reading German\\" is a surprisingly well-structured reading course that has its place both in the classroom and in the library of self-learners. The course contains authentic texts of increasing difficulty drawn from various sources. The accompanying explanations refer the reader to a separate, very well-developed, grammar section that, alone, is worth the price of the book! Although the course is fully-developed and includes translations of the German texts, most learners will find themselves diving into their dictionaries. In my view, this course is appropriate for learners who have achieved a basic-to-intermediate competence in German and who wish to expand their understanding of the language through some very serious study.

Truman, who entered the White House in one of the most critical eras of our nation's history, rose to the occasion and truly executed the office of President of the United States to the best of his ability. Superbly written and researched, McCullough examines the many different aspects of Truman's personality which led him from the battlefields of France in the First World War, businessman and local politician in Missouri, to the White House. Particularly interesting and insightful is McCullough's examination of Truman's early years. Throughout the book Truman's inner world, consisting of his romance with Bess Wallace, is highlighted. An able and astute politician, the life of Harry Truman is a true 'american success story.' Scholarly and insightful, McCullough's Truman is an excellent source for both the professional historian and student."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I rank this masterful biography right alongside my other favories: George Marshall (Ed Cray); Eisenhower (Stephen Ambrose); Patton (Carlo D'Este) and Theodore Roosevelt (2 volumes by Edmund Morris).While Truman certainly had his flaws, on balance we were fortunate to have such a decisive leader at the close of WWII and the beginning of the Cold War. He left an enormous legacy - dramatically ending the war with Japan; enunciating the Truman Doctrine; approving a heroic Berlin Airlift; winning a remarkable victory against great odds in 1948.He is an interesting study in contrasts.The President who fired MacArthur was, perhaps, an unwitting enabler of MacArthur's ill-conceived plan to broaden the Korean conflict beyond the recaptured 38th parallel. Perhaps a wiser President would have recognized MacArthur's &quot;blind spot&quot; regarding China and stopped the war much sooner.The President caricatured for a fiery temper and salty language was actually a bookish scholar and praised by all colleagues for his great composure under severe strain.The President well-known for honesty and integrity but whose political apprenticeship began under one of the worst of the big-city political machines (Pendergast in Kansas City).My only objection, a slight one, is that Mr. McCullough (like Ambrose with Ike) seems to like his subject very much and perhaps isn't critical enough where historical second-guessing might be warranted. All things considered, it's a 5-star effort."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This book is without a doubt the best book I have ever read. McCullough covers everything from his life on the farm to his position in the Pendergast organiztion, to WW1, the Senate, Vice Presidency, and finally Presidency. There were five aspects about the book that I found most interesting:1. The segments of the book concerning the Pendergast political machine. It was interesting to read about the power they held in Missouri and the relationship with Truman after he became President.2. The whistle stop campaign of 1948, the election that nobody thought HT could win.3. The relationship between Truman and his top advisors and cabinet members such as George Marshall and especially Dean Acheson.4. The process of nominating a President and more specifically a Vice-President. This book tells you what takes place behind the scenes at the democratic national conventions of 44 and 48.5. The Potsdam meeting between Churchill, Stalin, and HT.If you want to read a book about American Politics, this is a good one. If you want to read a book about WWII after FDR this is a good one. And if you want to read a book about Harry Truman this is the one."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"When I opened this book, I could scarcely believe what waited for me inside: the true, fantastic and engrossing story of the most All-American President we may ever have had. The story is one that seems impossible today: it follows a boy born to the hardest working and poorest of families on a Missouri farm, through his amazing, harrowing days as an infantryman in the U.S. Army during WWI, to his entry into county politics, his rise to the U.S. Senate and his remarkable ascendancy to the White House. Any student of American History -- indeed anyone proud to be an American -- will enjoy this book. I finished this book with a heart-felt appreciation for the gifts Mr. Truman has bestowed upon us and a fresh respect for him. Never having set foot in a college classroom, he learned all of his lessons from the school of hard knocks and stood toe-to-toe with the roughest and toughest of the world's leaders."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This was a very informative well written biography that presented his life from childhood through death. It added great insight into the private life of Truman and how he was percieved by those around him.There was a great deal of detail on the various major periods in his life besides his presidency - childhood, world war 1, his post world war business failure, his move into politics, his brief vice-presidency and his life in Independence after the presidency.The chapters on the major points of his presidency were also excellent. A real in-depth look at his feelings on the atom bomb, his race against Dewey and the Korean War were particulary interesting.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in seeing the evolution of a public figure over his entire lifetime."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I can't say anymore than that what has already been said by others to proclaim this as a great book. I do not see it as a flawless book though, given McCullough's affinity for his character makes this read more like an autobiography than a biography, but it is one of my favorite biographies."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I wish I could give this book 10 stars. Although a large volume, I couldn't put this book down. McCullough's style flowed well, and the subject was engaging. I never thought I could have much praise for a Democrat, but I have to admit that by the end of the book, Truman had become a man that I now greatly respect. McCullough's treatment of his life is superb, and I found it a remarkable irony that a man of such integrity was supported by such a corrupt political machine. And with the transition from WWII to the Cold War, it became apparent how much Truman seemed to be just the right man for the job at that particular time. The book is remarkable. Well worth the time and money."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"...a man has to keep on riding or be swallowed.&quot; So said Harry S Truman. He should know. After only a few months as vice president, he seemed by all accounts, to be totally unprepared and overawed on the occasion of being named our 33rd president, upon the death of FDR in April 1945. His quote about the presidency being like riding a tiger seemed to confirm this. The &quot;accidental president&quot; had a lot to prove. It would be poetic justice to say that he went on to be a popular president, but truth, like reality, is seldom so romantic. Except for short periods, Harry S Truman, throughout his two terms as president, was always extremely unpopular.It has been left to posterity and admirers like David McCullough to restate the case - as he does in TRUMAN - that the man was &quot;a figure of world stature, both a great and good man, and a great American President.&quot;Is it a legitimate claim?; can we reconcile this with the young man who was a political unknown until he received backing for Senator from the Kansas City political machine? Indeed it doesn't even appear as if Truman had much political ambition as the book shows that he worked at not being chosen as FDR's running mate. That he was chosen was then less his own doing, and certainly not because he was popular, but due more to political expediency. Truman becoming president Mr McCullough says, can be seen in this light: &quot;it had been the system of politics, the boss system, that counted in deciding his fate.&quot;Given this background and less that convincing qualifications for the highest office, it is a tribute to Truman, and an amazing feat of Mr McCullough, that this book convincingly shows just how effective a president Truman was. The adroitness with which Truman handled the tricky domestic and international political events of the period shows that he very quickly learned how to ride a Tiger.&quot;A well written Life is almost as rare as a well-spent one&quot; (Thomas Carlyle)"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough is simply one of the best non-fiction writers active today. This book is long, but is actually a quick read. As a historian, I generally do not enjoy biographies because their writers often fall in love with their subject and lose objectivity. McCullough may be guilty of this as well. The writing is engaging, though, and never dry. It is extremely well documented and factual. Those interested in learning about Truman will be pleasantly surprised to find a politician with a high standard of ethics. He is a joy to read about in this age of spin doctors and amoral politicians."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough's biography of Harry Truman remains the best, most objective biography available. Nicely written, this fast-paced book covers all aspects of Mr. Truman's life without getting caught up in his persona as had other biographies, including an &quot;oral biography&quot; very popular in the 70's.Here is an objective comprehensive biography which presents Truman as a complex individual in his various roles as husband, father, beleaguered son-in-law, WWI officer, businessman, Senator and President. The president was an uncommon mixture of intelligence, character (boy did he have character), honesty, decency and above all, the common touch.This is a marvelous book, one that you will come back to time and again."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Because of it's size, this is an ideal book for the Kindle. I borrowed the book from the library and with arthritis in my hands it was hard to hold. The Kindle version is priced very close to the paperback. Wish it was more reasonable. This is, however, like buying two books. An unassuming man who lived in one of the most gripping times in history. I will definitely look for other McCullough books. His writing style is so easy to read for what would otherwise be a daunting amount of material to wade through."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is an amazing biography about a man who had relatively humble beginnings and became an unwitting president. This is a real page turner (for a biography) and even though it deals with many areas of history that I had little or no knowledge in, it didn't bore me in sections like other biographies did (Edward R. Murrow, Eisenhower, Lindbergh). It was also interesting to see how some of the social issues we are dealing with today (debate over nationalized healthcare) were also issues in the 1940s.It is a great book, and written well enough that I purchased several other McCullough books."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I am reading this lengthy biography...well done!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Very well done bio.

Truman was a rare man, full of honesty and goodness. Glad he became president."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough provides readers with an artful insigt into an underappreciated president. I commend McCullough's extensive research, but at times felt he downplayed, or could have given more discussion to certain events. For example, the Steel workers strike, one of the most controversial moments in Truman's presidency, was given very little space. However, I do commend his coverage of politcal machines, in regard to their extreme importance in the political age in which Truman lived. Definitely a must have for anyone interested in the Presidency."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"As a child, I learned a bit about Harry S Truman by osmosis and had a generally good opinion of him. The basis of my opinion was derived solely from the down-to-earth nature assigned to him in the 1960's TV news sound bites and mini-historical reviews - &quot;the buck stops here - &quot;give 'em hell Harry&quot;, and the like. This book provided me with an incredibly indepth view of a common man, like any of us - no more, no less - who was tested again and again throughout his life. The circumstances through which he was thrust into the presidency were detailed and helped the reader understand Truman's sense of self. The writing is compelling - even when covering day-to-day details - and it helped the story of how Truman lived his life become, for me, a pattern that any reader might strive to emulate."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Having read this book, I clearly understand why it won a Pulitzer: is writing is exceptional. The author does more to help the reader understand President Truman than any other biographer to date."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry Truman was perhaps the last of those who serve in the public interest not so much as to get their name in the history books as to accomplish something worthwhile. Now we have president's who in their second term are already thinking of their presidential library. This book reads like a novel and tells the story of a common man, a man who failed at so many things yet rose above that failure to accomplish much. It's a great primer (or refresher) on the early days of the Cold War and a fresh look at an American President who once was thought of as below average in intelligence and ability. But, beneath the surface was a man of substance. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough's narrative strength is wonderful. How else does an author keep his reader chained to a 1,000 page book? Truman's story takes one through the most important periods in the formation of the cold war. It's fascinating reading. Still, McCullough'c ceaseless praise for Truman begs a question of balance. You're hard-pressed to find five lines of criticism of Truman anywhere in the book. Given the magnitude of the controversies through which HST led America, Truman must have done something McCullough to which McCullough objects. Anything? For example, Truman joins the Klan, yet this warrants nary a negative comment from the obseqiuous McCullough. Yes, it's a great story, but not a balanced one."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Good book. McCullough needed an editor to bring this down to Edmund Morgan size, the master of the concise history book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"As one who grew up through Truman's Presidency (I was 7 when he succeeded FDR), I am fascinated by the adulation heaped on him today - which Professor McCullough contributes to through this well-written glorification. I'm a self-professed liberal, and I've never voted for a Republican for President, yet I've never agreed with the adulation heaped on Truman. He was decisive? So what. The unfortunate old man who lived in the shadow of Mount St. Helens and refused to move when the mountain rumbled was also decisive. And he turned out to be wrong, dead wrong. And he was also named Harry Truman. So, don't praise decisiveness; evaluate the consequences of the decisions. As for Truman's handling of the Cold War, I'm one who shares the revisionists' view that Truman made a dangerous situation worse. We threw our weight around all over the world, propping up dictators here, there, and everywhere, yet Truman was irate when Stalin insisted on having a friendly-to-Russia government in Poland. The Russians had lost somewhere around 20 million people in the war - the equivalent of two Vietnam Wars (U.S. casualties) every week for four years. It was inevitable that any responsible Russian government would demand a buffer zone to protect itself from such devastation. (They had suffered similar slaughter in WW I as well.) Then there is Vietnam and the rest of the colonial world seeking independence. Yet Truman sided with the colonizers - France in the case of Vietnam - and we paid the price in the 1960s. FDR was, indeed, a great man, but Truman hardly merits the praise that McCullough and others have heaped on him."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough writes well but tends to leave out the negative aspects of his subject's personality traits. Truman was impetuous and suffered from feeling that the Presidency was too big for him. He permitted himself to be dominated at times by small town friends with their petty influence peddling. Truman never took complete control of the office to demand personal integrity of subordinates nor did he demand high quality performance from them. The fact that he got it from some people reflects the awe that the Office of the President imposes on those selected to serve. Truman's sense of his own \\"smallness\\" resulted in smearing his time in office with charges of corruption laid against his associates. McCullough avoided discussion of this aspect of Truman's personality and the important influence on his ability to govern.McCullough did the same with his John Adams' biography."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Well researched and very readable, McCullough has produced the best biography of Truman yet published.

If one has interest in a more objective view of the former president, by all means find another biographer. This book is far too long, going into minute details about trinkets Truman had around him in his office, an almost endless travelog of his !948 whistlestop campaign, repetitive adoration about Truman's concern about his appearance, his odd relationship with the four women closest to him, his firm decision making, to name a few. Truman apparently left a profuse \\"paper trail\\", and the author was content to select that which exhalted this president. Negative comments and events are briefly mentioned, if not dismissed.

I've definitely been misled. Things that are excerpts should be clearly noted. The illustration is for the book, so I assumed I was buying the whole biography.

This makes for very, very bad history. I have a recurrent mental image of Adams and Truman walking hand-in-hand, McCullough in the lead, over the waters into a golden sunset.

However, from the very first page I found it fascinating. For most of the 1,000 or so pages it read like a novel, a real page-turner. Because of the kind of time commitment necessary to read a book of this size, I read it in sections over a couple months, reading other things in between.Having lived through most of the significant events discussed in the book, I found them presented with accuracy. Mr. McCullough showed all sides of every significant conflict.The book gives a fascinating insight into the difficulties of public office and the setting of public policy. It also presents Harry S.

At first, I was intimidated by the sheer size of the book. However, I found that once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! David McCullough is, perhaps, the best American historical biographer alive today. His writing is crisp, clean, and entertaining. I have to admit that before I started this book, I was pretty ignorant about who Harry S Truman was as a person, as well as the contributions that he made to the United States and to the world as President. I was absolutely STUNNED to learn how influential and accomplished Truman was during his presidency. Truman left a legacy of good works that still impact the world in which we live today. Like one earlier reviewer wrote, I too had always been looking for a hero, someone who came from humble beginnings and made a lasting impact on the world in which he lived. I found that hero in the pages of David McCullough's book. As I finished the last page of this book, I felt like both crying (because I was saying goodbye to a friend that I had grown to love), and cheering (because I had found my American Hero in Harry S Truman). This book should be a must-read for every American!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Into the press of circumstance and the irony of history strode the diminutive and bespectacled Harry S. Truman, who promptly grinned his way into becoming the single most surprising President of the 20th century. Written off as a party hack of the Missouri democratic machine until very late in his political career, Truman astounded everyone by picking up the shambles left in the wake of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's sudden death and turning in a deft and remarkable performance against the most formidable of odds. In this best-selling biography by noted author and historian David McCullough (The Path Between The Seas), one is treated to a massively informative and yet immensely readable treatment of Truman's life and times. The author uses a treasure-trove of newly available archives, personal interviews, and historical records to show how the unassuming man from Missouri who everyone under-appreciated became responsible for everything from the successful conclusion of WWII to the Marshall Plan to the formation of NATO to the Berlin Airlift rose to assume the Presidency in one of our nation's darkest moments.From his first halting steps as a young man rising out of poverty and a farm family background to become a sudden war hero who led men bravely in combat, from his frequent missteps and failures as a post-war businessman to a first failed try for local political office, from his quick rise from county-level politics to become the darling and frequent benefactor of the quite colorful Pendergast political machine, this is the stuff of a momentous 20th century life, told as well as it can be by a master of historical biographies. Truman, who arose from a family beset by tragedy, missteps, and misfortune, was saddled before adulthood with the responsibilities and burdens that were so common for those coming of age early in this century. His is the story of a man who kept trying, arising again and again when life and misfortune knocked him down, and like the proverbial hero of one of Horatio Alger's novels, Truman's persistence and dogged courage before personal defeat eventually brought him to public prominence and to the United States Senate.Once established in the Senate, Truman quite rapidly (and totally unexpectedly) proved himself a consummate diplomat, negotiator, and dogged proponent for what was right, rational, and reasonable. In doing so, he earned himself a reputation as man with uncommon moral character and indefatigable energy. Later this strength of character and ability to do the hard things when pressed to do so proved invaluable, as in the decision to employ the atomic bomb against Japan and to fire that most vexing and perplexing of military war heroes, the legendary Douglas MacArthur. McCullough's treatment reveals for us the drama of Truman's sudden and unexpected tour as President; a terrifying, wrenching and extraordinarily difficult balancing act for someone left so singularly unprepared and unprepared as was Truman. Yet so masterful was his balancing act that he became a legend himself by simply being himself, a man who believed in all of the traditional verities and virtues, a man of the common people who was always unassuming, self-effacing, and quick to admit his own mistakes.This is truly a wonderful book, one I have read several times simply because I find its depiction of Truman as being quite inspirational. Here was a man who rose to meet the challenges of his life and his times, a most unexpected leader and role model who showed us, even in his death, that the role of the man of enduring virtue participating in public life is an achievable and workable goal, that we can have people with moral direction and the courage of their convictions to serve us and the country at large as President. Especially now, in the age of mental midgets and errant sons of former presidents running for office, it is wonderful to remember a time when an ordinary man proved just how extraordinary he could be. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I am a great fan of biographies of great men. This is the first time I have ached to spend time in the company of the subject of a biography. There is something about Harry Truman --underestimated, shrewd, fallible, magnificent, decent and straight-taliking -- that comes across in this biography. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough's Pulitzer Prize winning biography &quot;Truman&quot; is undoubtedly the best Presidential biography I've read in recent years. Written in a graceful and powerfully eloquent style, it is meticulously researched, and accurately captures the essence of the man who was the 33rd President of the United States.McCullough challenges a commonly held view of history that Harry S Truman was nothing more than a common man of mediocre abilities who became President almost by accident, and owed his political success to his loyalty to the Democratic party and the Kansas City political bosses. By tracing the life of this self-made man - a farmer, artillery captain during World War I, haberdasher, local politician, U.S. Senator, Vice President, and ultimately President of the United States - the author acquaints the reader with a highly intelligent, competent and complex man. Here is seen the highly principled politician whose ability to judge the character of others enabled him to select outstanding men like Dean Acheson and George Marshall to serve in his administration; a Chief Executive capable of making some of the most momentous decisions of the twentieth century, such as ordering the use of the atomic bomb against Japan in 1945, integrating the Armed Forces in 1948, and firing General Douglas MacArthur in 1951. But, here also is seen a man who remained loyal to personal friends and Democratic party bosses and tolerant of their often disreputable activities; and who, in a fit of petty anger, authored a threatening letter to a music critic who wrote unfavorably about his daughter.&quot;Truman&quot; is above all a fair and balanced portrait of one of the most unique and greatest of American Presidents. In my view, this extraordinarily well written book is destined to be the biography of Harry S Truman against which all others will be measured. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I'm normally not one to chat on-line or write reviews like this, but I had to weigh in to defend an unfair comment re McCullough's Truman. An earlier reviewer chastens McCullough for not writing a &quot;balanced&quot; biography.This is a false and unfair charge. In fact, this is why Truman is such a great book. It paints an accurate picture of the mere man, Harry S. Truman --- his frailities, weaknesses and outright blunders as a human being, all presented in light of his remarkable Presidency.A good summary of Truman's blunders (there were many) appears on p. 990 of the hardback edition. More in depth discussion of these and other misguided actions are found throughout the book. Harry T's scathing letter, written to a music critic who dared to tell the truth about Margaret's singing, is an excellent example (p. 829).All in all, this IS a well-balanced, beautifully written, engaging biography. It has all the credentials of serious biographical scholarship, yet it is wrapped in an elegant, warm style. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in understanding the plain-spoken man from Missouri."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I've read a number of other reviews and found that the rating tends to be determined by the reviewers' opinion of the man, rather than the book. Critics of Truman argue that McCullough has written a paean to his subject, which is why they give the book fewer stars. Nonsense. What makes Truman so appealing to me (and probably to many other reviewers who, like me, did not know much about him before reading the book) is that he was so very normal, so very human. McCullough makes it clear that Truman was no genius, that he held prejudiced views of blacks and other minorities, that he suffered from strong self-doubt, that he could be petty and selfish and weak, and that the stresses of the job often caused him physical suffering. Despite all of that, he performed admirably as President and established principles that were to guide U.S. foreign policy (and Presidents of all political persuasions) for the next half century.It is clear that McCullough has some affection for Truman, but it seldom colors his judgment. This is a great biography, which enables the reader to feel as if he truly knows the man. It is also great history, providing a well-researched and well-written account of the vanishing U.S. frontier, of small-town America, of metropolitan political machines, and of the genesis of U.S. Cold War policy. I submit that the distorting biases are not those of McCullough, but those of the readers who do not like Truman, either for personal or political reasons."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"While it's Ok for a historian to like the subject of the biography, he should not love him. David McCullough likes Harry Truman a bit too much. As a result he seldom takes a critical view of Truman's Presidency, politics or personal life. This is disappointing given that Harry Truman was the President at probably the key juncture of twentieth century - the end of War World II and the beginning of the Cold War. More time is spent describing the whistle-stop campaign of 1948 then in explaining the development of the containment strategy of Soviet expansion. He also dismisses Secretary of State Dean Acheson's January 1950 omission of South Korea as being in the United States defense perimeter as being the inspiration of the subsequent attack that June by North Korean forces. While it may not have been the inspiration, that statement along with troop withdraws in 1948 and 1949 were hardly discouragements.Yes, Harry was the common man who became President but McCullough glosses over the reasons for Henry Wallace being replaced by Truman as V.P. on the 1944 ticket. McCullough tells us that many Southern Democrats and city bosses were uncomfortable with Wallace, especially given Roosevelt's health. But the reader is left wondering why they were uncomfortable. Indeed many Democratic leaders were worried that Wallace and his advisors were too sympathetic to the Soviets and that \\"moderate\\" Harry Truman would take a tougher post-war stand against them than would Wallace.Still, McCullough has a good literary style and his account often reads more like a novel than a biography. This is especially true early in the book when he describes Truman ancestors, background and upbringing in western Missouri. And when he weaves in little ancedotes about Truman's personal life both before and during his time in the White House, McCullough is at his best.Harry S Truman was a genuine American, a patriot and a good President at a pivotal time in U.S. history. He deserves a more critical examination of his life and Presidency. After all \\"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.\\" Harry could stand the heat and give them hell back. David McCullough ought to know that."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough's intensively researched, thorough, and moving biography of Harry S. Truman is an accessible account of a president who is almost effaced by the times in which he lived. Remembered mostly (if at all) as a little gray man who fell somewhere between Roosevelt and Kennedy, Truman's accomplishments, failures and personality often fade into the background, against the likes of FDR, Churchill, Stalin, or even Joe McCarthy.McCullough's biography captures the man who inserted a civil rights plank to the Democratic Party platform, risking his presidency, and splitting the party; who fought in WWI, married his childhood sweetheart, failed at business, then succeeded beyond his wildest imaginings at politics; and who, yes, dropped the only two atomic weapons ever used in warfare. McCullough presents Truman in all his contradictions, and his affable, easygoing style. I went and read _Truman_ because I had profound ambivalence towards him, and his actions as president. While this bio did little to clear up my ambivalence, it was expertly and cogently crafted, and I found myself personally liking the subject, even though still troubled by him. In this world with few saints, this is the best one could ask for in a comprehensive biography.McCullough writes from his subject's corner--one can discern a genuine affection for the man in his pages. However, the author does an excellent job of presenting the evidence; of showing the reader that McCullough is a man of his craft; of demonstrating that, while &quot;objective&quot; history may be a myth (yes, certain things did happen, and others did not. What that MEANS, however, is up for constant debate), responsible history is not. Readers who detect bias in the biography are undoubtedly correct. The reason this is troublesome, though, is more that the author's bias does not agree with the reader's, rather than the sheer existence of bias itself. Not that this is necessarily a problem; it simply is the way of things.The last few years have seen an upswing in the reputations of Republican presidents--the renaming of Washington National Airport, and Oliver Stone's laudatory biopic of Nixon being two examples that come immediately to mind--, while Democratic Presidents, such has Clinton and Kennedy have, sometimes deservedly, sometimes not, come under fire. _Truman_ comes as a breath of fresh air to one who is increasingly disturbed by the tenor of our national historical dialogue.I recommend _Truman_ to anyone with an interest in the period or the man."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry Truman was never supposed to be President. He grew up in rural Missouri, the son of an unsuccessful businessman and farmer. He was backed by the powerful Pendergast machine for all of his state elections and was a consensus pick for Vice President in 1944, to an increasingly ailing FDR. When he assumed the office, he was unprepared and it showed. How he came to greatness all his own, as well as being generally considered among the best Presidents of all time despite leaving office with a disapproval rating of 66% (still the all-time record) is the subject of this extraordinary book. Truman was just a common man, some would say, but they'd be wrong. Our 33rd president was a man of great vigor and vitality, and most of all, courage. Despite being from the South he was the leading voice in the Democratic Party for legal equality for all Americans and an end to desegregation. The time had not yet come, but that didn't stop him from doing all he could to get the ball rolling, such as desegregating the Armed Forces in 1948, during a close election campaign in which the normally \\"Solid\\" South was being courted by recently deceased uber-racist Strom Thurmond on a Dixiecrat ticket. That campaign, against Thomas Dewey, was the biggest upset of the 20th century, and it just proved further never to count Harry out.As would be expected for a book with a subject so complex and fascinating as Harry S. Truman, this is a mammoth tome. However, it rarely drags. His childhood and adolescence are preceded with a little family history, then followed by his service in World War I, his failed garment business, his time in office as a county administrator in Independence, then the U.S. Senate, where he rose to fame by being a fierce investigator of wartime appropriations. He was one of the most popular and visible Senators because of his service on the Truman Committee, and thus was drafted by party bosses around the country to replace the excessively liberal and unliked Henry Wallace on the Democratic Ticket in '44. Public opinion toward Truman after FDR died was quite hostile, but as with all the other challenges in his life, he rose to meet this one. The major events of his presidency are all here: Civil Rights, the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan (which marked an end to the same old song of American Isolationism for good), the Berlin Airlifts, The Bomb, re-election, and Korea and the showdown with General MacArthur. The campaign stuff is especially great--Dewey/Warren was a 13 point favorite over Truman/Barkley, with Thurmond trying to break off the Southern vote and Wallace trying to snatch the liberal vote. Losing two components of his core constituency, plus facing an attractive, moderate opposition ticket while extremely vulnerable himself, indicated certain doom. However, Truman, through sheer force of personality, refused to give up and never seemed to doubt winning as he zigzagged across the country, throwing partisan fire and convincing average Americans he was one of them and would keep the New Deal alive, as opposed to his to-the-manner-born opponent, who was long on rhetoric but short on ideas and issues. The result, of course, was Truman's re-election and the end of Dewey's political career. Truman won without softening his record--for example, he was the first candidate to stump in Harlem, as the book notes. It's a recurring theme: Truman took stances that didn't quite resonate with his base, i.e. desegregating the Armed Forces, drafting the Coal Miners into the Army, etc., but he did them anyway. Although he was willing to admit a mistake, he was never willing to back down on his principles, and history has judged him well for it. Truman is rightly considered one of the giants of American History, although it did take us all a little time to figure it out.Ultimately, Harry Truman was no ordinary man. Following FDR, he was initially compared to the consensus pick for worst president, Andrew Johnson, who followed Lincoln and managed to bumble his way into politically-motivated impeachment. Now, he is mentioned in the same breath with his idol, Andrew Jackson. His nearly incredible reserve of energy and earnest desire to help all people make him a President for the ages."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I picked up Truman at age 16 and read it cover-to-cover in a little over a week. Today (at age 22) it remains the greatest book I have ever read. I can sit down on my couch, flip to a random page and begin reading for hours. Harry Truman lived through great times for America. He remains a beacon of light for those of us who see something noble in public service. This book captures that light and vision Truman had for America. Hands down, the greatest book I ever read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough's biography on Truman was a Pulitzer Prize winner and it is easy to see why. Harry S. Truman very worthy subject, the research of the subject was exhaustive, and the resultant book fluid, accessible, insightful, engaging, and educational. I found it a fully satisfying book for the subject matter it covered. I can't even imagine the amount of research that went into this book.Harry Truman was a haberdasher (men's clothing store owner) from the small town of Independence, Missouri, and probably as unlikely a possibility to be president of the United States as one could imagine. He rose through local machine politics to U.S. senator based upon his fine reputation as an artillery captain in WWI, and a few years later, Roosevelt took him on as VP to balance his ticket. Then, near the end of WWII, as we all know, FDR died and Truman became president and was faced with such great and difficult decisions as whether to drop the A-bomb on Japan, how to deal with a willful and highly adventurous General McArthur in the Korean War, how to massively airlift food and other supplies to communist-blockaded Berlin, how to deal with Russia during the Cold War. He even had to survive an assassination attempt on his own life.How did this plain, seemingly unsophisticated man grow so quickly into the most important job in the world at one of the most troubled and dangerous times in our history? How did such an underdog small-town outsider with only a high school education manage all this? What kind of a man was he close-up? These are questions David McCullough tries to answer for us. McCullough, in fact, succeeds in making us feel we are there in his meetings, his family get-togethers, his poker games, on his walks and drives. We also go along with Truman and wife Bess as they try to take anonymous vacations after he retired from the presidency - without security, believe it or not. I'll leave it to your imagination how long the trip remained with the former president going unnoticed.McCullough sketches the Truman experience from the early 1800's when his pioneer forebears moved from the east to Missouri, which was then the gateway to the western territories. He spends a lot of the book, as you might expect, on his presidency, and the surrounding people and circumstances. You get to know Harry Truman personally and also get some insight into Ike (less admirable than we thought), MacArthur (as arrogant as we thought), Joe McCarthy (as scary as we thought), and many other high-profile types in his administration such as the great Dean Acheson and George Marshall. McCullough had access to many of the letters Truman wrote to his family, friends, and associates, and, surprisingly, some of the letters Truman wrote to his self and never mailed, basically to blow off some steam about a particular situation. (You would wonder why he even kept these letters and how they ended up for public viewing.) You had to be impressed with his self-command under great and often unfair criticism, his ability and willingness to make a tough decision, his work ethic to learn the hardest and most difficult job in the world as quickly and thoroughly as possible. To be sure, Truman was a flawed human being (aren't we all?), but that makes him an even greater man for the things he accomplished. Also, He was often able to inspire great effort and loyalty from the people who worked with him, and was able to deal with some very important people outside his administration who were very difficult. In a word, he was quite a leader, and if he hadn't been, things might have turned out a lot worse for all of us. No doubt about it, his presidency took place in some very scary times!I was surprised how much I liked this book and heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas present. I had read McCullough's 1776 and John Adams and had enjoyed them both (although I was disappointed in the brevity of 1776). Still this book (Truman) stayed on my shelf gathering dust for over six months. I was initially overwhelmed with its length and afraid to tackle it (I had failed with Vidal's Lincoln and didn't want to repeat that result). I finally screwed my courage and cracked it open.Although the first 50 pages or so weren't extremely engrossing, after that the book quickly captivated me. I didn't know much about Harry Truman, and what I did know led me to believe that he was a fairly average president. What I learned is that he was an amazing overachiever who, when faced with the weight of the world, was at his best. McCullough really brought the man to life, and although Mr. Truman did some things that none of us would be proud of, McCullough didn't provide excuses for Harry - he did explain possible causes for Truman's behavior.After reading this book, you can't help but feeling that the United States was extremely fortunate to have Truman in the nation's highest office, and you can't help but wish you could have met the man.I wholeheartedly recommend the book as a must read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"\\"Truman\\" is a much praised book and deservedly so. There is hardly a need for another review, in addition to the 280 already posted here, so I will be brief.Above all, it is superbly readable, as entertaining as a good novel. I experienced a sense of regret having finished it today.It is a clear and balanced portrait of a leader and a wonderful study of understated, firm and steady leadership.I would rate it as essential reading for anyone wanting to understand key aspects of the world since WWII and which continue to influence events today."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry S. Truman has long been one of my favorite presidents of the 20th century, and I can honestly say that after reading David McCullough's thorough biography my appreciation for Truman's personal character and political philosophy has only grown. This is not to say that McCullough treats Truman with blind affection and mindless exultation. Rather, McCullough writes of Truman in full perspective, illustrating his failures and successes in both personal and public life. Indeed, in the case of Truman, a discussion focused wholly on his successes and victories would not yield the former president near as much respect and admiration.McCullough understands that in order to fully understand Truman as a man one cannot merely look at his life through the typical lenses modern presidents are usually viewed through: popular appeal, policy activity, and personal agenda. Truman, unlike most 20th century presidents, didn't feel popular appeal was of significant importance. His policies weren't made to simply please the people. And, while he obviously had agendas, Truman's actions were, as a whole, driven by the challenges of the times, not by his personal desire to gain power and woo the public to adore him.When reading the personal life of Truman, one might wonder where the usual, blatant and intentional corruption is hiding, but like George Washington, such a selfless civil servant yields little intentional wickedness in private. Therefore, the lens we see Truman under is highly personal in way that focuses on his intentions, afterthoughts, and beliefs about political roles and civil responsibility. Truman never wanted to be president and despised politics, so Truman's own personal views on morality and character simply seem incompatible with what is currently acceptable for an elected official--a trait McCullough doesn't ignore in painting his picture of the man.McCullough takes us through Truman's life from birth to death (as would be expected), with the narrative building with an ongoing tension. At the peaks of each of the three major wars Truman was involved in (WWI, WWII, and the Korean War) it feels as though there are three distinct climaxes in McCullough's storytelling. These distinct peaks in tension provide an enticing momentum throughout the book, giving the reader a constant pulse to ride on. Even before, after, and between these major milestones it feels as though Truman is still warring against someone or some group. His secure, independent moral nature is consistently present, from battling the constant Republican slander to rebelling against the prominent political machines of his own Democrat party. The seeming inconsistency of Truman's thoughts and actions are consistently engaging, and his passion and vigor as an individual patriot and moralist are likely keep any reader engaged. The fact the McCullough is the one writing about him is simply an added benefit.It should also be mentioned that along with McCullough's stunning biographical portrait of Truman, he also interprets many of the events in a socio-political analysis that considers the century as a whole. Truman's choices to drop the atomic bomb, start the Korean War, fire General McArthur, desegregate the army, and recognize the new Israeli state are all given contextual and long-term analysis that, while interpretable, is refreshingly objective. It is clear that McCullough has a true historian's integrity in the way he sticks to the facts of Truman's life, but in this book he shows the other side of the same coin of this integrity by also reminding the reader of the importance of past and future events. When considering Truman's legacy, such a light is not only insightful, it's necessary.McCullough has provided an insightful, fascinating, and timely biography of a president who was more concerned with what was right for the nation than politics and public opinion. Truman brought the image of the presidency away from the popularity-driven FDR. He realized that, like Abraham Lincoln, the policy that satisfies the public in the immediate is not always the best in the long run. Truman felt that his role was not to make sure everyone felt comfortable, but was to follow what was right and try to lead the country in that direction the best he could. Or, as Truman said, \\"I wonder how far Moses would've gone if he'd taken a poll in Egypt. What would Jesus Christ have preached if he'd taken a poll in Israel? It isn't polls or public opinion of the moment that counts. It's right and wrong.\\"McCullough recognizes the deepest motivations about Truman, and because he does, his book provides for a genuine and necessary lesson in perseverance. Truman should speak to every American in the way that, whether he is in actuality right or wrong, he pursues what he sees to be the road of truth. When that road comes to a fork filled with conflict and destruction, he showed us that we simply mustn't turn back."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I love this book and own it. I've read it several times, and will read it several times again in my life. Its many virtues include Truman's outstanding life story, McCullough's skills, and the window on the momentous events of World War II and at the dawn of the Cold War.What the book lacks, though, is real insight into what motivated his opponents. True, he had allies - both Republican and Democrat - both he had opponents on both sides as well, some of whom truly detested the man. Further, McCullough is forced to oversimplify many of the events. Truman's meeting with Hoover is well known, but the events leading up to the meeting were much more elaborate than this book, or Merle Miller's or the play \\"Give 'em Hell Harry\\" present it.I know its tough to ask for more detail in a book that is already a fair sized door stop, but Truman's Presidency deserves it - like him or not (and I like him) - he was a pivotal President, and deserves a multivolume biography, ala LBJ's treatment by Caro.At any rate, buy the book and keep it."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"After a slow start (on the history of Missouri and Truman's lineage there), the book just flows from one episode to the next. You don't even realize you're reading almost a thousand pages. It's over before you know it, and you desperately want more.The popular image of Truman is of the simple, humble, colorful man from Independence, Missouri, who took a forceful stand against Communism in a presidency bookended by two wars (World War II and Korea). As McCullough, in his characteristically beautiful prose, shows, Truman was far more complicated a personage than the simple, homespun, down-on-the-farm character of myth.Rising to the presidency under perhaps the worst possible circumstances (during the final months of a global war, succeeding a phenomenally popular president who led the nation not only through war but also through economic depression), Truman struggled to emerge from FDR's shadow and chart his own course, which he eventually did but not without occasionally challenging the old New Dealers, with whom he clashed personally even if he did agree with them on policy. Truman's domestic policies, moreover, sometimes get overshadowed by the events of the early Cold War, causing us to forget that he was a liberal and progressive Democrat who advocated national healthcare and civil rights, among other causes. We sometimes forget, too, that he (like FDR, although in a different, more subtle style) was a politician, capable not only of strokes of brilliance--such as the innovative Whistle-stop campaign of 1948--but also of nasty rhetoric; he once said that a vote for Dewey was a vote for fascism. Reading this in 2004, another election year, I was struck by a handful of parallels with the '48 race: nasty, personal rhetoric; railing against \\"special interests\\" (as ambiguously defined then as now, even if Truman was a true believer in the slogans); labeling Republicans as the party of Wall Street and the rich; and a national array of pundits who were completely wrong. Some things never change, probably.A truly complex figure, he was sometimes humble, willing to let others take the credit for policies that were his idea, and often not (such as his belief that he could influence Democratic politics after his departure from office). A great leader, Harry Truman occasionally stooped to low levels of anger and vitriol, penning seething letters he usually never mailed--the notable exception is the rant he sent to a music critic who panned his daughter's singing.McCullough conveys all this in straightforward terms, without frills, without fanfare, which is as it should be, considering Truman. This is a man and a book for the ages."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough continues to earn his reputation as an American treasure with his epic biography of Truman. Not only does this book reflect his skills as an exceptional researcher, but also his gifted mitchner-like prose. Thus, he not only presents the life of America's greatest presidents in exhaustive detail, but also does a commendable job of placing him in his context. McCullough gives us a wonderful history of the Truman family and explains how his particular milieu affected his particular sensibilities.Many readers are put off by this books extraordinary length. They should not be. To McCullough's credit, his work rarely drags, nor does he go into irrelevant detail. Unlike many political biographies, Truman's pre-political life must be covered in great depth, as he came to politics very late in life. Moreover, the author is well aware that most readers know little about Truman's service in the US Senate.What makes this work particularly extraordinary is the way the author &quot;connects the dots&quot; explaining how Truman's life before the presidency effected the decisions he made in the office. Nor does McCullough pull his punches, but like a good biographer is open to criticizing his subject. He gives Truman's strengths and his failings equal consideration and attention.With sweeping plots and larger than life characters, this book reads like a novel. That is a big part of the reason that it makes such great history."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"When building my personal library, I've always striven to aquire books that I could easily and willingly re-read. David McCullough's rich biography of one of our most colorful Presidents warrants such an evaluation. I have currently read this fascinating and entertaining history of populist American Politics three times and am eagerly awaiting time for the fourth.McCullough manages to wear many hats as he paints Truman's portrait. He is scholarly, critical, evaluative, praising and holistic while writing this biography as though it is an entertaining and escapist novel.As all successful biographies, McCullough places his subject within the larger historical contex thusly allowing the reader a broader spectrum of reference. America of the first half of the twentieth century grew at a cataclysmic pace and at the center of it was &quot;the walking President&quot;. Explorations of Populist Political Machines, The Two World Wars, Business and Agricultural practices and a detailed depiction of making a President coupled with a very detailed character study of a man who rose in a few short years of public life to the world's highest office make for a great read.Believe the all the other glowing reviews and add this to your library."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It's a different world than it was 50 years ago when Harry S Truman took us from the end of World War II and help set the foundation for the world we build today.

From birth through death, this exhaustively researched biography deals with the major crises and turning points of not only Truman's presidency, but of his life as well. Everything you think you know about Truman is in here in minute detail, and many more events in his life you didn't know are extrapolated upon as well.On the eve of the 2000 election, it's nice to be able to pick up this book and look back on a time when words like &quot;honor&quot; and &quot;integrity&quot; were words that could actually be used to describe some of those who aspired to political office. I can write for hours of the merits of this book, but the biggest compliment I can give it is that in the year since I first bought it, I've read it twice."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I grew up 10 minutes from Truman's Grandview farm and 15 minutes from his Independence home. It was common for my grandmother and mother to speak of their experiences of exposure to Truman. In my grandmother's case, Ethel Noland was her seventh grade teacher in the early 1930s. In my mother's Truman was a frequent speaker at junior school events in the early 1960s. These stories softened me to the legend of Truman, and made me want to read this excellent survey of his life and times.I can think of no better single volume biography of a president. McCullough brings Truman alive and propels a reader forward through the decisions that he faced as a farmer, businessman, and world leader. He was a true Jacksonian leader, and time and again, McCullough shows how his humble background played out in Washington and across the world. It makes for fascinating reading throughout."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This does justice to the man it represents.

While he could have been more critical of Truman's choices I don't feel as though I've lost anything in understanding Truman the man. This book is totally deserving of the Pulitzer Prize it won."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I've always been fascinated with Harry Truman, and a couple of years ago I finally decided to read a Truman bio. What a pick! McCullough weaves together a masterpiece here. This is the great work that led to my eventual decision to read a biography of every other US president in chronological order through Reagan, which I am in the middle of now.If you want an informative yet highly entertaining look at the life of Harry Truman, read this book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I was originally a little intimidated by this book due to its size (about 1,000 pages), but I bought it after seeing so many glowing reviews of it.I absolutely loved this book. It really is an extensive biography of the 33rd President of the United States. It starts out with Truman's grandparent's move to Missouri, tracks his life through childhood, his service in the Army during World War I, and then his return to Missouri and his involvement in Jackson County politics and the powerful Pendergast political machine. Truman is then elected to the U.S. Senate and explains his career there including the Truman Commission. It covers the election of 1944 and his brief stint as vice president.The best part of the book, and probably the reason it exists at all, is his presidency. Truman was a man who was vice president when Franklin Roosevelt was in the White House. His death was shocking to the nation, even though his failing health made it inevitable. Truman suddenly found himself with the weight of the world on his shoulders and the burden of the presidency itself. Throughout his presidency, the book looks at major decisions and events during that period. This includes the Potsdam Conference, the use of atomic weapons against Japan that ended World War II, the aid to Greece and Turkey as part of containment, the Marshall Plan, the decision to recognize the State of Israel, when he sent troops to Korea, his decision to nationalize the steel industry amidst an impending strike, among others. It covers the election of 1948 when Truman set off on his famous Whistle Stop tour of the country and his surprise defeat of Dewey. The final part of the book covers his post-presidency when he returned to Missouri to live out the rest of his years.The book really is almost like an epic novel of a man's life. A true American journey. The size of the book might be daunting to some, but for me it was a real page-turner. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Limited on time? Eye sight or mobility issues? Truman by David McCullough on disc is a super way to take in his work. A must read . . . or hear. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I bought this Truman biography for my 94-year-od mother-in-law at her request. And she read it immediately after reading another Truman biography that I also bought for her (and thank goodness received before this bio) by his daughter Margaret. As my mother-in-law had already concluded from Margaret's book that Truman was a great man because of his love for his wife and daughter, she was willing to stick out reading this \\"heavy\\" (and by that she meant weight not content) book - loving every minute of it. The delivery was timely. And the book arrived in very good shape. All in all, a very successful purchase."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The more US history I read, the more I am astonished how the decisions of one person can impact the course of human events so drastically. Following World War II, the US president was forced to make decisions that would impact the world for the next half century. It just so happened that the man in the White House at the time was a non college-educated regular guy from Missouri.This book brought to light a period of history that many in my generation (I was born in 1973) probably do not understand as well as they could. Truman, through his force of will, standing up to MacArthur and keeping the Korean war from turning into an all out war with China may have been his greatest achievement.All of the criticisms of this book, that it is too pro-Truman, that it doesn't delve into the details of the decisions Truman makes enough, are accurate and real. However, what McCullough has done is tell a story of a driven every day man from Missouri, who went to the White House and did the very best he could. It is a remarkable story, told with detail and care. It is also a true American story, and should be read by all."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This biography of President Harry S. Truman achieves what very few books of any kind ever achieve -- it combines being an irresistible page-turner, with great length (I bought the Kindle edition; the hardcover edition is big enough to use as a doorstop), and incredible thoroughness. When the reader completes reading this book, he or she will know about all that is worth knowing about President Truman, his life, and his political career. This time period was one of the critical stages of America's own social and political development, and this combines to make this biography by David McCullough a very important work, worthy of the reader's attention.The distinguishing feature of this biography is its readability. I simply could not put it down. And this is an extremely detailed book. It takes the reader through President Truman's young adulthood, his hardscrabble years as a farmer, his early political career with the Pendergast political machine in Missouri, and his eventual ascent to Senator, then President, then elder statesman. Few details are omitted, and as far as I could tell none that anyone would want to know.The times of Harry Truman were remarkable. As a young man, he spent ten years as a farmer on a modest farm, performing backbreaking labor, at a time when 9 out of 10 American farms had no electricity. President Truman's remarkable health and stamina, which were one of his hallmarks as President, perhaps derive from the fact that in his early years he was no desk-bound slouch. The book makes no bones about the fact that Truman's entry into politics was sponsored by the Pendergast political machine, which was no more honest than the Tammany machine in New York, or perhaps even the Chicago machine. And yet author McCullough makes a strong case that despite this, Harry Truman was known for his honesty even as a candidate sponsored by this political machine. Truman amassed no financial wealth from his involvement in Missouri state politics at a time when many of his colleagues were becoming rich through graft. This should help put to rest lingering criticisms of Truman that still surface from time to time, that he dirtied his hands in his involvement in the Pendergast political corruption. It simply is not true.McCullough's analysis of the Truman Presidency is nothing short of brilliant. General George Marshall, Dean Acheson, and other leading members of the Truman Administration literally come to life in this vivid and very thorough biography. One comes to see that America was very fortunate that Harry Truman was the man to step into the Presidency upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. And yet, McCullough dispels the myth that this was unexpected. To the contrary, both Truman and most other top politicians expected FDR to die in office, and in selecting Senator Harry Truman for the Vice-Presidency in 1944, many \\"in the know\\" politicians, including Truman himself, knew that they were selecting the next President, given the (correct) expectation that FDR would succeed in his bid for a fourth term of office. Indeed, when he met FDR so poor was the President's health and appearance that Truman worried that he would not survive to take the oath of office at his fourth inauguration.Truman's 1948 campaign against Thomas Dewey, the Republican candidate, is covered in amazing detail. McCullough seems to have covered about every top of the famed \\"whistle stop campaign\\" in which Truman criss-crossed the United States by train in order bring his campaign directly to the country. This was undoubtedly the last time any American politician will take his case so directly to the people, unfiltered by the media or indeed by anything. The country liked what it saw, and this resulted in what is still considered to be the greatest political upset of all time.When I reached the last part of the book, the Truman post-presidency years, I expected to be bored. Not at all. In some ways this was the most insightful part of the story. When the Truman Library was established, Harry Truman often worked there, five or six days a week. Imagine: early telephone callers to the library would often speak with President Truman himself, who would unselfconsciously explain the operating hours of the library, and give directions. Truly, this was a man who did not think that he was better than the rest of us.Rarely indeed have I had the opportunity to read something this worthwhile, with this much enjoyment. This biography is destined to be one of the great ones.

Really well done. A great book about a great human being."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"If I were able, I would actually have given \\"Truman\\" four and one-half stars instead of five. It's hard to argue with this book's enormous popularity - when it was released in the early 1990's it received generally rave reviews and became the best-selling presidential biography of the decade. And in most respects \\"Truman\\" deserves the praise it has recieved. David McCullough is a marvelous writer, as anyone who has read his earlier works (such as \\"Mornings on Horseback\\", his splendid account of the early years of Teddy Roosevelt) can testify. McCullough's research of Truman's remarkable life is thorough, and his writing style makes it seem as if you are with Truman on every step of his long journey towards the White House. Truman was the unlikeliest of Presidents - and he may be the last \\"non-millionaire\\", non-college-educated person ever to serve in the Oval Office. Compared to many of our great Presidents (a rank which Truman is now accorded, thanks in no small part to this book), most of Truman's life was totally ordinary. He was a farmer who scratched for a living, he adored his wife and was completely faithful to her, he had to put up with a demanding and snooty mother-in-law who thought he was never good enough for her daughter, and he was a failed businessman who constantly worried about paying the bills. Truman's life really took off when he served as a soldier in World War One, and he learned that he could effectively command large groups of men and earn their respect. He subsequently entered Kansas City politics, serving as an honest and efficient county judge (county commissioner) in an otherwise crooked and despised political machine run by Tom Pendergast, the nationally infamous \\"boss\\" of Kansas City. Despite the fact that Pendergast was eventually sent to jail, Truman remained fiercely loyal to him, even though it hurt him politically. Truman displayed this trait time and again, and while his personal loyalty was admirable, it also got him into trouble when his friends turned out not to be as honest and open as he was. I won't recount Truman's life here, as other reviewers have done so, but I do have one problem with the book, and that is McCullough's favoritism towards Truman. Although some other reviewers have claimed that the book is \\"even-handed\\", I would argue differently. Truman did have his flaws, but McCullough either glances at them and quickly moves on, or he just ignores the criticisms that others have made. One example is Truman's racial feelings. McCullough does briefly mention that in his youth Truman often spoke disparingly of Jews and Blacks, but argues that he \\"made up for it\\" by pushing civil rights for blacks and helping create the nation of Israel as President. What McCullough doesn't mention is that Truman's \\"conversion\\" to these ideals came in an election year (1948) in which he was the underdog and needed all the minority votes he could get. In the 1950's and early 1960's Truman also made some negative remarks about Martin Luther King and the civil rights marchers in the South, a fact which McCullough never mentions. Also, like many pro-Truman biographers, McCullough makes Truman into the underdog hero of the 1948 presidential election, when Truman shocked the pollsters and experts to defeat the heavily favored Republican candidate, Thomas E Dewey. What McCullough doesn't mention is that Truman's campaign was every bit as negative and divisive as those of later Republican candidates (such as Richard Nixon) who have been much criticized for their \\"dirty\\" campaigns. Truman, as has been proven by numerous memos and campaign letters, deliberately made personal attacks on Dewey and made wild, unsubstantiated charges (in one speech he came close to comparing Dewey and the Republicans with Hitler and the Nazis, a speech which McCullough doesn't mention). Truman's campaign deliberately played upon the fears and prejudices of working-class Democratic farmers and workers (just as Republicans such as Nixon played upon the fears of Republican voters). In my opinion, had Truman been a Republican candidate, he almost certainly would today be strongly criticized by historians for his 1948 campaign, but instead he is given the heroic role by McCullough (Truman's opponent, Dewey, ran a campaign that was a model of what most voters say they want - he refused to reply to Truman's \\"mudslinging\\", almost never mentioned Truman by name, and gave upbeat, optimistic speeches in which he refrained from personal attacks). In spite of these weaknesses, however, \\"Truman\\" is overall an excellent study of how a \\"common man\\" who was no different from your average \\"next-door neighbor\\" became one of the most important Presidents of the twentieth century. As \\"Truman\\" proves, there is a latent greatness in the average, taxpaying middle-class American citizen - a fact which should provide encouragement if this nation ever again faces the crises and problems which Truman himself had to face."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The size of the book is daunting indeed. Don't let it scare you off. A genius of a book and it flies by. I spent much of life looking for a true hero and I found it in this book. Truman is perhaps one of our finest presidents. He was tough, honest, and caught up in history. This book is required reading for fans of history and the 20th century. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Over the years I have read many biographies. None captures the essence of its subject as well as this one.Harry Truman was, indeed, a remarkable man. The author describes his modest beginnings,the son of a farmer to his military career, his days as a haberdasher and finally his entry into politics. Truman's character and integrity form the very core of this book. It was Harry Truman who gave the final order to drop &quot;the bomb&quot; on the Japanese and in one stroke ended the second world war. He was a man who was not afraid of going against the main stream and taking on public opinion. His &quot;stick to itness&quot; in taking on and firing second world war general Douglas MacArthur who in many peoples eyes had become a military icon of heroic proportions was an act of bravery that many of to-days politicians would never even consider. The absolute disdain he held for Senator Joseph McCarthy and his witch hunts during the &quot;Red Scare&quot; are another example of his sticking his jaw out in the face of public opinion and a mostly hostile press.Finally. after reading this book and marvelling at the man, I cant help but compare him to the &quot;hopefulls&quot; who are making a run at the White House in this Presidential Year. Alas,I see no Harry Trumans."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"When writing about this book, one has to distinguish between Truman the man, and Truman the book. It's very easy to get wrapped up in the life of the man, and confuse the value of his story with the value of the book.As a story, Truman's is remarkable: small-town boy, through the Democratic machine in Missouri, makes his way purely by chance into the Federal government and thence into the presidency. No one really wanted him to be president, but he did a pretty good job of it while he was there. In the meantime, he oversaw one of the most terrifying epochs in world history: the reconstruction of Europe, the beginning of the arms race and the Cold War, the war in Korea, Joe McCarthy, and on and on. Surely this is a story worth telling.In less capable hands, the story might never have come out. To read David McCullough, it seems that Truman has been systematically smeared out of the great-presidents pantheon over the years. During his life, McCullough suggests that his connection with the Pendergast political machine hounded him. After he left office, it sounds like history rewrote him as a crude little commoner.If anything will erase this conception, it is McCullough's storytelling. McCullough is simply a master of yarn-spinning. The man knows exactly when to toss in a pithy little tale, an appropriate quote from someone's letters (of which McCullough appears to have scanned thousands), or a brilliant change of pace. It's a gripping story, even if you already know how it's going to end (e.g., the bomb will be dropped on Hiroshima). That McCullough can make history this exciting is proof of his skills as an author, and helps explain why his books sell so well.On the other hand, I knew nothing about Truman coming in, and reading David McCullough is the last thing that a clean slate like me should do. He is forcing a story down my throat, and in the end that's my biggest problem with the book.In both _Truman_ and _John Adams_, McCullough's obvious purpose is to elevate a man above the lowly station where history has placed him. Adams has played second fiddle to Jefferson in the two centuries following the founding of the U.S. Truman lies below FDR in most peoples' list of the greatest 20th-century presidents. McCullough wants to recognize these men, not only because he believes they were heroes, but also because he wants us to realize the power that individual people can have in shaping history.The problem is that he's trying too hard to fix history's errors. George Will wrote in praise of _John Adams_ that \`\`McCullough does not write \`pathographies.' ... [these] biographies portray their subjects not just warts and all, but as mostly warts ... [McCullough] abandoned writing a biography of Picasso because he could not stand to be so long in the company of such an unpleasant man.\\" It's one thing to avoid needless butchery of your book's subject. It's quite another to avoid all criticism, which is exactly what McCullough does in _Truman_. His book is a literary manifestation of the portrait on its cover: Truman is all sunshine and Missouri farmland. There's no room in that portrait for a nuclear bomb, and the concept of \`\`Red baiting\\" doesn't fit well in a landscape.In short, I repeatedly yelled at this book (literally) for its habit of blatently papering over Truman's flaws and blatently pounding into my head that \`\`Truman was a man of character.\\" At least McCullough wears his biases on his sleeve; I'd just prefer that he wear fewer."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The question who is the greatest United States President depends on the political philosophy of the reader. There can however be little doubt that Truman was one of the most remarkable men to be elected to that office.In reality Truman's rise to the office was a freak. He was a man who had a mediocre career. Initially he ran a business that failed. He volunteered for military service in the First World War at the age of 33. After the war he worked as a minor elected official nominally called a &quot;judge&quot; but in fact his responsibility was more like that of a bureaucrat. Later in life he became a senator and attracted some attention because of his role on a Senate Committee looking into the war effort. His selection by Roosevelt as a running mate surprised most people and was related to short term political considerations rather than anything suggesting that Truman was of any political importance.One would think that with such a background Truman would have been overwhelmed by the responsibility of office. Yet he never was, faced by difficulties difficult to imagine he mastered the office and with a self-assurance that was amazing set about doing what he thought was right. And in the end just about everything he did was the right thing to do.After Roosevelt's death he had to make his first big decision and that was whether to use Atomic weapons. Looking at the issue objectively the fire raids prior to the dropping of the two atomic bombs were probably as destructive to human life as the nuclear bombs but that is an easy thing to say in hindsight. Truman had to weigh up the cost of using the weapons and look at if it would save lives. The use of the bombs has been debated but in reality it probably not only saved American but also Japanese lives. An invasion could have resulted not only in the deaths of American servicemen but also it would have been likely that the Japanese military could have killed many of their own civilians as they did in the Marinas.At the conclusion of the war Truman then had to deal with the Soviet Union through the Berlin blockade and the early years of the cold war. Roosevelt had to fight a war against Germany and Japan. Both of those countries had comparatively small populations with limited industrial capacity. The Soviet Union had an immense field army that had just been victorious in the greatest land battle of all time. It had swallowed Eastern Europe and China was about to undergo communist revolution bringing the worlds most populous nation into its orbit. Combined with the seriousness of the military threat there were the difficulties of realizing that a former ally was now an enemy. Truman again had no problems in realizing the danger and acting appropriately. Not only was Truman willing to measure up to the Russians he was responsible for the Marshall Plan the basis on which the reconstruction of modern Europe was based.By 1948 he faced his first presidential election. He faced a hostile press and it was universally thought that he would lose. He pulled of the last of the whistle stop elections were his ability to speak to voters and to galvanize them to his side led to a narrow victory. For his last four years he faced a hostile congress. He was then faced by the Korean war and problems with his supreme commander McAurthur. In the end he sacked McAurthur a person with immense popularity and prestige because of his failure to obey orders.Other countries tend to be skeptical of their leaders. The United States has always tended to have a reverence for the office of presidency that exists beyond party politics. Truman is one of the Presidents who stood so tall that his memory is cherished as being an ordinary man who could show that intelligence and decency can get one through.It in some ways would be difficult to write a dull book about such a story. McCullough's book is not dull and it writes about Truman in a respectful and intelligent way. A must read for anyone who is interested in American history or the cold war."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It is impossible to read this interesting biography without quickly developing a strong admiration for Harry Truman, born 1884 in Missouri, our 33rd President. Harry learned early that by getting along with people he could nearly always get what he wanted. He loved to read from an early age, especially history, skipped the 3rd grade, and practiced the piano 2 hours/day. He couldn't afford college, and West Point turned him down because of his eyes (far-sighted). Early jobs included that of watchman, bank clerk, and helping his father farm. Harry spent years admiring and pursuing Bess Wallace, his wife. He volunteered for WWI, helped organize a new Missouri artillery battery, and was elected 1st Lt. Promoted to Captain, he went to France as battery commander - 4 guns, 194 men, and quickly established himself as a firm but sympathetic commander - ignoring what he considered to be idiotic orders that were too had on his men. Captain Truman acquitted himself well, and while there met Thomas Pendergast's (K.C. political machine head, later convicted of tax evasion) nephew and defended him from what Truman considered were unfair charges.Returning, Truman married and opened a haberdashery with one of his Army associates. First year sales were good - $70,000, but the business failed in 1922, and required 20 years for Harry to pay off the debts. (Like his father, he didn't use bankruptcy.) Pendergast promoted Truman to run for judge (County Commissioner), and he was elected at age 38 with strong veteran support. Truman ran a very straight operation, ignoring requests for rigged contracts (past practice), and earned wide respect. Truman, however, was passed over by Pendergast as a gubernatorial candidate in 1932, then as a House candidate as well in 1934. Later that year Pendergast endorsed Truman (his fourth choice) for Senator, and Truman won. McCullough notes that Truman brought an inferiority complex to Washington, worked hard to understand the issues, and mostly kept quiet while supporting the New Deal. Senator Truman did not, however, support FDR on his 'court-packing' effort and on a few other issues. Opponents ran Missouri's then-popular governor against Truman in his re-election campaign, which Truman narrowly won.Driving across the country at his own expense, Truman became alarmed at signs of massive waste in the buildup for WWII, even finding businesses making agreements with their German counterparts to divide up the market and benefit Germany. Truman was successful in having his concerns addressed in a Senate investigation that he headed - over 50 reports were issued, all bipartisan and unanimous. Actions included getting rid of 'dollar-a-year' men that were acting as lobbyists for their home corporations, changing the organizational structure for procurement to make it more effective, and challenging/correcting issues involving negligence, cost-plus padding, and poor quality. Example - Curtiss-Wright had been delivering leaky engines and covering it up with forged inspection reports while the military protected the company by removing inspectors attempting to block the flawed parts from being installed. The committee is reported to have saved at least $15 billion (1940s dollars) and thousands of lives, and put him on a 1943 'Time' cover.Meanwhile, V.P. Wallace had become viewed as a liability, and eventually Truman was selected as the least damaging V.P. choice, taking labor, racial issues, and the South into account. Adroit maneuvering (eg. ending a session dominated by pro-Wallace emotions, derailing early enthusiasms for another via encouraging numerous 'favorite son' candidates) brought Truman victory on the 2nd ballot. (Truman did not want the nomination, and accepted only when asked by FDR.) Truman almost immediately then became alarmed by his observations of FDR's condition.FDR's death soon after his 4th Inauguration thrust Truman into the presidency - without any preparation time, or even personal knowledge of many of the key figures or the A-bomb project. Many worried Truman wasn't up to the job. He quickly put those fears to rest. Truman didn't like Hoover at FBI - saw him as dabbling in blackmail and wanted no part of it; Truman also didn't like anyone around him that was puff-up with self-importance. Showed his own humility by walking over to visit Congress, etc. Early on he invited over a group of Republican Senators - they hadn't been in the W.H. for 12-13 years. Again, worked hard to catch up - reading old memos, etc. Moving the Roosevelt's out required 20 trucks, while the incoming Trumans required only one.Considerable thought and analysis went into deciding how to proceed with Japan. Using the A-bomb vs. fire-bombing was one option, an invasion was another, and a blockade offered a third. A two-night raid on Tokyo in March, 1945 killed over 100,000. Three earlier raids on Dresden killed 135,000. The invasion of Okinawa cost 12,000 American lives, 110,000 Japanese soldiers, and 150,000 civilians. Costs-do-date developing the A-bomb totaled $2 billion, and brought another dimension of concern. Hiroshima brought an estimated 130,000 dead (immediate and over time), another 70,000 at Nagasaki. Hirohito overruled his generals and ordered the Japanese surrender. Thus, within 3 months of Truman's taking office, WWII was over. In Europe, Russia held the 'high cards' via the territory already occupied by its army. McCullough reports that Stalin came away from their Potsdam meeting with contempt for Truman - one can almost see the subsequent progression into the Korean War.Soon after the end of WWII, Truman made it clear that the New Deal was not dead - in fact, some saw him as even more ambitious than FDR. Immediate problems included housing shortages, strikes (railroad, steel, autos), businesses pushing for relief from price controls. Coal miners had struck twice during the war, and rail workers had also done so. Truman asked Congress for authority to draft the rail strikers - just before settlement came per Truman's earlier proposal. Things were not going so well, however, with the Russians or Chinese, and hatred of the Communists was rampant. Truman called for admitting more Jewish refugees to the British protectorate in Palestine, and ultimately granting Israel statehood via the U.N. His approval rating sank nearly 50 points to 32% as shortages grew to even include meat. (He lifted price controls on meat.) The Republicans then took control of both houses of Congress - for the first time since prior to the Depression; they also grabbed most of the governors' positions. The coal miners then struck, Truman sued and won major monetary damages for striking against a government entity - he earlier had seized the coal mines. Appointed General Marshal Secretary of State, a very popular move. Called for aid to Greece and Turkey to keep Communism out, and ordered a check of government employee loyalty, pulling a Republican issue out from under them. His approval rating went back up to 60%.General Marshall proposed aid to Europe to stop starvation and revive Europe. Truman approved and insisted Marshall get the credit - also saw that having his own name on it would create needless resistance. Truman publicly supported Civil rights, national health insurance, and the Berlin Airlift. Still, his approval rating sank again - down to 36%. Democrats (including HHH) launched an effort to Draft Eisenhower, Ike pulled the plug on it (Truman encouraged it). Truman then called Congress back into a two-week session, confronted them with his agenda, and when they did nothing, ran against the 'Do Nothing Congress.' Other problems included a splinter group headed by Wallace (Communist support), as well as a new Dixiecrat party that split out of Southern democrats. Truman issued executive orders ending discrimination in the military and the federal civil service.Early in the election Truman trailed in polls by as much as 30 points. Three weeks before the election a Newsweek poll of 50 political writers found all thought Dewey would win. Then Truman started outdrawing Dewey. Two weeks prior a Gallup Poll showed Dewey leading by 6 points; 65% of newspapers supported Dewey. An Election Day poll showed Truman still 5 points behind. Truman spent the night at a hidden location, asleep. Ended up winning by 2 million votes and taking back both houses of Congress - Senate 54-42, and the House 263-171; had been 51-45, and 248-185.Soon after the election the Berlin airlift ended, the Russians tested an A-bomb (1949) thanks to spying, and the Korean War began. At first it was thought the Air Force and Navy would be sufficient to stop the North Koreans, MacArthur, however, nixed that idea after a quick visit. He proposed the Inchon landing, such as the Japanese had done in 1904, U.S. military leaders had misgivings or opposed the plan. Truman's initial letters ran 20:1 against the war. MacArthur turned the tide of war after three months, and then crossed the 38th Parallel. Six weeks after Inchon brought the first Chinese opposition. Reports came back of MacArthur acting erratic at times, also taunting the Chinese just before Truman planned to try for a cease-fire. Truman's approval rating down again to 26%. Truman seethed and waited re MacArthur until the Joint Chiefs turned against him as well - erratic. Truman's concerns were maintaining civilian control, insubordination, and not wanting to widen the war - eg. bring in full Chinese and then Russian participation. 7.5 million attended the MacArthur parade in New York City. Congressional Republicans reacted similarly, though support faded after it became clear the Joint Chiefs opposed MacArthur; his strange answers in some instances didn't help either.Steelworkers threatened to strike; Truman seized the steel mills 4/8/52 after the workers accepted a panel's recommendations but management wanted a $12 price increase. (Truman thought $4.50 would have been more reasonable.) Truman lost 6-3 at the Supreme Court. After a seven-week strike military output was cut 1/3 for a year; they settled for about the same as Truman originally requested.Eisenhower abandoned Marshall (the man who made him) in the face of McCarthy, and promised to go to Korea. (McCullough saw this as demagoguery - he already knew everything that was going on and had had input.) Eisenhower went, and accomplished nothing. Eisenhower snubbed Truman repeatedly after the election. Back in Missouri, Truman refused all offers - his name was not for sale. He did, however, take a $600,000 book deal. Traveled to Europe, etc. - very well received. Proud of his library. Died at 88.Bottom-Line: President Truman faced a continual series of major decisions, confronted them, and served America very well."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I'm only about 100 pages in, but I find I resent having to put it down in order to tend to other business! Fascinating."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Alan Brinkley, who wrote the New York Times Book Review of David McCullough's Truman, came up with these rather remarkable words on the life of Harry S. Truman, \\"My God, he's in color!\\"You can bet your --- on that! Mr. Truman was indeed in color. This book by David McCullough goes into the very life and soul of a man who did what he thought was best for God and Country.Mr. Truman's humble beginnings in Missouri from a farmer, an Army Captain in World War I to a Judgeship traveling the back roads in rural Missouri show the way of a leader. Along the way he was a part owner of a men's clothing store in Kansas City with his wartime friend Eddie Jacobson.In 1934 Truman, through the efforts of the Pendergast Political Machine wins the Senatorial election as the Junior Senator from Missouri. McCullough goes into great detail of the trials and tribulations facing Harry S. Truman, common man who defends the Constitution and remains a no nonsense kind of guy.His selection by Franklin Roosevelt to be his Vice Presidential running mate in 1944 was a political surprise at the time. Only 82 days after Harry Truman took the Vice Presidential oath, he becomes the President of the United States.In the beginning even Eleanor Roosevelt thought that Harry S.Truman was out of his element. Wrong!! Instead we find a man able to make decisions, such as to drop the Atomic bombs on Japan. Harry institutes the Truman Doctrine in Europe to provide military aid. He encourages the Marshall Plan, to aid economic recovery in Europe. He develops NATO and initiates the Berlin Airlift.And oh by the way, he wins the Presidency by himself in the 1948 upset of Thomas Dewey. Give Em hell Harry!!Later, Truman's stance in the Korean Conflict and his dismissal of Douglas Macarthur stands as his true \\"Give Em Hell Harry!\\" declaration. His stance made him unpopular. Indeed he could not run for the Presidency in 1952 because of his dismissal of the \\"American Caesar\\". But Harry was indeed right! 24 years later good old Harry S. Truman was revered by the very popular group Chicago in their rendition entitled \\"Harry Truman\\". 24 years too late, historically Harry turns out to be one of the very best Presidents of all time.Of all the Presidents of the 20th Century, Harry S. Truman stands out as the best of them all! McCullough has personalized this in his 10 year effort. This is indeed my favorite book. 10 Stars! No Problem!!!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A great read about the man and times. Truman made some of the toughest calls to date about WW II, Korea, MacArthur, etc. This is a good jump off point to learn more about the times and other great figures of the day like Churchill and Marshall."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I can't add much to what's already been said in these reviews. McCullough is a fantastic writer, and Truman is one of the most under-appreciated figures of the 20th century. He lived during a pivotal time in American history, and presided over some of its greatest moments. If you read John Adams and liked it, you'll like Truman. (If you liked Truman, may I recommend John Adams.) As per his usual style, McCullough takes his time in telling the story (the book is nearly 1000 pages!), and stops to dwell on the characters involved. He does it so well. This is the sort of book that even casual readers of history could appreciate."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough has a knack of showing much respect for his subject. His well-researched historical biography of President Harry S. Truman, TRUMAN, is by far the most packed and detailed assessment of the former president that one will encounter. McCullough's writing and interest in history shows the human aspect of Truman from the time he was born, 1884, up to his death in 1972, and those who will want to read this book will see a side of Truman that has been overlooked or overshadowed by the events that he experienced during his administration, such as the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the controversial debacle with General Douglas MacArthur. On the other hand, he also spearheaded Civil Rights legislation for African Americans in the military, helped create the United Nations and NATO, and worked to unify foreign nations in Europe.All of the information in this book derived from an enormous body of records that derived from the Harry S. Truman Library, which was meticulously written and kept by Truman through his lifetime. McCullough includes his intimate thoughts that he wrote in letters to his wife Bess as well as conversations that show how Truman confided with his dear friend Secretary of State Dean Acheson, and the intense personality of a president who was known for his most famous quote, \\"If you can't stand the heat, you better get out of the kitchen.\\" No doubt, Truman was his own historian, and from reading this biography, he had a love for history as well as literature. Indeed, he was a man of arts and letters, and always referenced Abraham Lincoln and U.S. Grant, Mark Twain and Willa Cather. However, he as well as Abraham Lincoln and George Washington were among the respective presidents that did not attend college.The most interesting part of the book is the discussion of Truman's rise to the presidency. And the most sincere and somewhat sad part of the book is the concluding chapters when Truman is back home in Independence, Missouri where he did not want to be amongst the spotlight of Washington. McCullough describes Truman's long journey home.Nevertheless, one can see how one Missouri farmboy persevered. He fought in World War I, served as a US Senator, and became US president. His story is one that does not happen too often. McCullough succeeds in portraying Harry S. Truman as truthful as possible."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"An entertaining, enlightening and often provocative examination of the outspoken post-war president by one of America's most-respected authors. The audio book verision is true to the text and features straightforward but high production values."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"An absolute masterpiece.One of the best biographys ever written.Blew me away.Doesn't get any better than this. R.D. Morgan- author of \\"The Tri-State Terror\\""},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I own over 200 biographies of key Americans and have read almost 150 more in the last 30 years. Truman is by far and away the very best. While a large (almost 1000 pages) book, it reads very fast.You will feel as if you lived close to Harry S Truman all your life.Recommended reading for any Democrat, Republican or Indpendent. Not a bad idea if it were required reading for present and future Presidents."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A long (almost 1,000 pages) biography of Harry Truman. McCullough is very warm to his subject, defending him ceaselessly. No matter what the problem, McCullough always finds someone to quote who gives praise to Truman. The book is a popular biography, meaning McCullough does not attempt to analyze issues too much, but is more concerned with Harry, the common man who rose to the top. McCullough writes well and is very captivating (interest never flags, even at this length). Anyone with any interest at all in Truman will find this book rewarding and entertaining. For me, it also peaked my interest in Dean Acheson. Recommended."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"\\"Truman\\" is a fantastic biography and story. McCullough's choice of Truman as his subject was inspired. In writing a chronical of the man's life, he masterfully traces the United States' often reluctant emergence onto the world stage as a superpower. Harry S. Truman and the United States both begin this tale with no idea of the prominence that is in store for them. Both struggle with their acceptance of what their new roles require of them. Finally, both rise to the occasion and surpass expectations in their given role.The book features McCullough's trademark, history written in prose that makes it as engaging as fiction. Anyone interested in biography or in the history of the United States should invest the time in this one. At 1,100 pages, it will take time, but it never feels long or tedious. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This work is a true joy to read. McCullough, like his subject, Truman, has a knack for \\"telling it like it is.\\" I have quite a number of Truman Biographies in my collection and have read several others. This by far, in my opinion is the best. The author has been very ballanced in his study of this leader, showing warts and all. He does it nicely though. Now I must admit to being a big fan of Truman so I am sure my assessment of this work is flavored by that liking. Nevertheless, I do feel I know good writing when I see it, and McCullough's style is extremely readable. I would very much recommend this work for anyone interested in the life of this great American President, and would recommend it for anyone wanting to begin a study of his life and, just as importantly, his times. I really fell you cannot go wrong with this work. Actually, this is one you will probably want to purchase, because, like me, you may want to give it more than just one reading."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a truly wonderful book. McCullough takes this less than heralded subject and does a masterful job of telling his story. The reader feels as though he or she really knows Truman. It's almost as if you've been able to accomany him on one of his morning walks.I think what I most enjoyed is that Truman is not portrayed as a demi-god, but as a human being, flaws and all. To have accomplished all he did is truly living the American dream.McCullough does a suberb job of researching and documenting. When an assertion is made, you know if it is made by McCullough, Truman, or someone else. I've found this to be less than true for other, even highly regarded, biographies.A truly amazing book. This is probably my favorite biography of all-time. If you enjoy it, be sure to read Adams by McCullough."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Once you get through the first 50 to 100 pages of this book, it is almost impossible to put down. Even if you're not enchanted of politics or of politicians (as I'm not) you will probably find this book fascinating, moving, inspirational, humorous, and hard to put down.Harry Truman seems to have charmed and inspired loyalty in almost everyone who knew him well--and for fairly obvious reasons since he was loyal, hard-working, friendly, principled, considerate, and often wise. The author, David McCullough, seems to have fallen under Truman's spell to some extent, though he presents the facts needed for a reader to make his own judgment. You will read about some of the flaws of the man also; such as the fact that he was too loyal to some people who did not deserve his loyalty; the circumstances in which he ran his mouth, said stupid things, and caused scandal; his blindness to some of the realities (such as thinking that Joe McCarthy would soon fade away).In the end, though, I came away from the book feeling that David McCullough found the right tone and the right voice for presenting this remarkable man who was rooted in the best ideals of an America of an earlier time. One of the most remarkable things about Truman was that he rarely seemed to have a &quot;split personality&quot; as many modern politicians do. He was generally consistent and true to himself and his ideals even under great pressure to sell out and play political games. He took a lot of heat at the time for some of his stands, but seems to have fared much better in the eyes of later generations because of his fidelity and overall wisdom.Throughout the book I couldn't help rooting for Harry Truman. He's just so darn likable that you want to see him succeed. He's the underdog who comes out on top despite all odds and expectations. He's the hope that anyone can be great, can succeed, with enough determination and hard work. He's the seemingly ordinary man who makes good on his potential and becomes truly extraordinary.The reader gets the impression that no matter when or where Harry Truman had been born, he would have been a great man in some way because of his qualities of character. Somehow the George Eliot statement seems appropriate for such an unassuming, though famous person, that &quot;the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.&quot;Probably Eliot's statement seems so appropriate since it's often Truman's character, rather than any great or historic acts that make him so appealing. Any powerful person can do things of historical significance, but few can claim to have done them in such a sincere, patient, unassuming, and warm way.From an interview I saw with David McCullough, he mentioned that originally he started out to write a book about Pablo Picasso instead of Harry Truman, but decided against it because he felt that Picasso was someone who was difficult to &quot;be around&quot; for the long period it takes to write a book. Instead, he chose Truman because of the historical significance and the fact that McCullough's life would be made better by the experience, rather than worse or more unpleasant. After reading McCullough's book, I have to agree that this is a book and a biography of a person that most people would want to &quot;be around.&quot;"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Some very critical decisions reviewed. Good insight into Roosevelt's personality. On the negative, far too much exhausting detail to wade through."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I'm not that into history, but this makes it read like a novel. I really like Truman and I'm rooting for him!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough has written a page turning biography of one of the 20th centurys greatest men. The depth and details of Trumans presidency come alive with McCulloughs story telling abilities. This biography brings to light the depth and strenght of a man who was thrown into a position that he was not really equipped to handle but with self determination and the values that were learned in the nations hearland became one of our nations greatest presidents."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It is fascinating---full display of President Truman's character. Let along \\"the buck stops here\\" he was so clean although out of mud. In KC, as the county judge managing hundreds millions of dollars for construction contracts he could easily pocket millions. When he was sent to DC as the Senator of Missouri by Pendergast (the powerful big Boss) many on the Hill believed he was rich until a aid saw him took an apartment of $5 rent per month and took a loan from a bank to buy furniture. On the campaign road for his second term, he slept in his car because he did not have money to pay a hotel room... hope we can find today's politicians like that. It is a must read for anybody likes history."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This book is a very accurate and detailed chronicle of the Truman years. Anyone who was born after Truman was in the white house should read this book. You will find that he was one of the truly great presidents of modern times."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough opened my eyes to a period of history and a man I previously considered unimportant, at least in comparison to the WWII era. I stand thankfully and richly corrected. The writing is paced like a novel, and as I near the end of the story, I'm wishing there were more to be told. It's an intimidating length, but well worth the time!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Ashamed to admit, but I know little about American History from the Civil War forward. It seems in school we only had a focus on early U.S. history. I loved reading John Adams, so thought I'd try out Truman. I have not finished the book yet, I'm sure I will but my reaction the Truman himself, not the writing, is a bit negative. Still I would highly recommend this book. I'm learning a lot about a person and era in history I knew little of, some of our history is not all that pretty, but that's what I really like about McCullough, all little details really bring this book to life."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough is one of the best writers IN American history and OF American history. Harry Truman was certainly an excellent President. Together, they make an unbeatable team! At 992 pages, this book seemed initially daunting. However, upon conclusion, I found myself yearning for even more. This writer, this President, this book, has my vote for all-time favorite!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I enjoyed the book because I remembered many of the famous names and events of the time. As with all of David's books it was well researched and graphically detailed. I felt that the details were a bit overdone leading to its unbelieveable length of nearly a 1000 pages. But it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I read a lot of presidential bios, but this was the longest, most in-depth, and perhaps the best. I won't review Harry S. Truman's presidency too deeply, other than to say he was a Decider. Few if any have come across tougher decisions, and he generally made the correct and often unpopular ones, doing it with humility. Amazing. And yes, there is a lot of George W. Bush in HST, including the low approval ratings upon departing office which slowly rose once OBJECTIVE reviews were compiled. (Truman is anywhere from 5-7 today, whereas his approval ratings in 1952 were lower than Bush's in 2008 - for all the same/wrong reasons)The writing in this book is vivid, factual and thorough -- but what can you expect from someone like Mr. McCullough who spent nearly a decade poring over thousands of documents from hundreds of sources? He is a master.\\"Truman,\\" therefore, is mammoth; it is not a laborious read, however. The president's childhood and adolescence are preceded with a little family history; followed by his service in the Great War; his failed garment business with Eddie Jacobsen; his time in local politics and the US Senate; his drafting as Veep to replace the leftist radical Henry Wallace to join FDR's ticket in 1944. Truman met that challenge as he did others.The major events of his presidency are covered well: Atom Bomb that brought peace and saved millions of Jewish, Japanese, Chinese and American lives; Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan; Berlin Airlift; re-election campaign; Korea and the controversial showdown with the great Gen. MacArthur; capped off by a solid and melancholy chapter traveling from1953 until his death in December 1972.My complaint is that, like many bios, it is a tad hagiographic, ignoring some negative aspects of Truman, though McCullough does at least mention a few of the 33rd president's unsavory Cabinet members and connections with the corrupt Democrat machines (that still dominate that party today).And though \\"give 'em hell, Harry\\" railed against the GOP, much was false or clich&eacute;, and that was also the isolationist Ron Paul/Bob Taft Republican Party. Considering Truman's outlook on everything from religion, foreign policy and economics to socio-religious views (hated the spoiled brats of the 1960s) and basic personality traits, he'd be a Republican today -- likely a neo-conservative.Harry Truman of Missouri was not FDR the NY elitist-- and that was good. Truman actually cared about people, thought deeply and loved the country. This book confirmed my belief that FDR was mostly a tyrant, who pompously thought very little of Truman, \\"saved,\\" then destroyed the economy, packed the Supreme Court, interned the Japanese, ignored the Holocaust, likely would NOT have recognized Israel in 1948, and was so narcissistic he ran for a 3rd and 4th term.Thank Goodness for America than we had Harry Truman as POTUS from 1945-1953 and Dwight David Eisenhower for the eight years that followed. America would not be the same without them in charge for those 15 crucial years."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Because once you start, you won't want to stop, and this book is nearly a thousand pages long! &quot;Truman&quot; is the greatest biography I've read, without exception. It traces the life of Harry Truman from well-scrubbed Midwestern boy to war hero, from failed haberdasher to President. Along the way, we come to root for the farmer's son from tiny Independence, Missouri, a man who said, &quot;We can never tell what is in store for us.&quot; It is a book of morality, courage, and history. It will teach you more about leadership than a Stephen Covey seminar, and more about personal integrity than ten Sunday sermons. I finished it over six months ago, and it still affects the way I live.And by the way, this summer my wife and I will spend our vacation visiting Independence, Missouri."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"One of the best books I have ever read, and one of the greatest biographies. Deserves every bit of praise heaped on it.Here's the story of a small farmer who grew up poor and ended up the most powerful man on the planet at a time when the world was radically changing. When he left office he retired without any government help (no secret service!) and lived off his army pension in the same house he grew up in. Truman seemed born to be a great leader, failing at everything he ever did -- except helping make America the greatest power of the 20th century.Read it and it becomes an unforgettable story."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The history of Truman and his birth in the 1880s through WW1 & WW2 as well as the Cold War and Korea is remarkable. The evolution of a man from small town farmer to President of the United States and the weight of history thrust upon him at the expected death of FDR makes for a great read.I found the difficulties in the post WW2 era to be most interesting such as the strikes and the creation of the Truman doctrine and the Marshall Plan.The regular correspondance between Truman and his family provide insight into the decision making process as well as personal opinion to the process.The contrasts between the Roosevelts and the Trumans are also a treat."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I must say as a fan of history and American politics I have enjoyed all of McCullough's books that I've read to date and \\"Truman\\" is easily one of his masterpieces. However, I think McCullough fails to inform his reader of some important details while portraying the life of Harry S. Truman. For example, McCullough portrays Truman as a heroic visionary acting courageously to prevent the spread of communism into South Korea but fails to mention that the \\"democracy\\" Truman was protecting was a military dictatorship. Other than that, this book is a great read about a great man and admittedly McCullough's \\"oversights\\" are innocuous to the finished product.Almost immediately when reading this book you get the sense that from an early age Truman was too big for his surroundings growing up at the turn of the cenutry in Jackson County, Missouri - and clearly he was.Without-a-doubt, Truman was the \\"American dream\\" realized. Only in America could a young man, the son of a political savy farmer with what seemed to be perpetual financial problems, grow up to be one of the greatest statesmen of the 20th century.McCullough takes the reader through all the life-shaping events of Truman's life without a loss of enthusiasm be it Truman's time spent as a artillery captain on the Western Front in World War I, to his days as a county Judge in western Missori, his associations with the Pendergast political machine, to his subsequent election and rise to prominence as a U.S. Senator, the political maneuvering that put him on the ticket as VP with FDR, to the agony of the decision to drop the atomic bombs, the shaping of post World War II America, Truman's astonishing victory in the 1948 campaign, the Berling airlift, the Korean War, and ultimately Truman's return to private life.This is a great book and a great read. Not only is it a remarkable biography, but it is also a great study of an important era in American history and the man who shaped American policy towards communism, for better or worse, that lasted up until the end of the Cold War."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It is easy to see why most reviewers would rate this book highly. McCullough is a master of the narrative, and does a beautiful job of presenting Harry Truman as the main character of a fascinating drama. His discriptions of the day-to-day life of Harry S Truman give a remarkable picture of the man, very personal, very earthy, very touching. I cried when Harry Truman died, like I seldom do when a fictional character dies. I can't remember being touched by a portrait in this way in a long time.So why not 5 stars? In his effort to protray Truman an a person, McCullough creates on overpowering story line that tends to drown out the important historical background of Truman's presidency. In short, McCullough never stops for analysis. For example, with the famous come-from-behind victory in the election of 1948, McCullough talks briefly about the \\"soul seaching\\" the media went through when it discovered how wrong the polls were prior to the election. But Mc Cullough never asks why it happened. Why were so many polls so wrong? Was it just a fluke, or a systemic error in the polls? Considering how much modern politicians rely on polls, a sharp evaluation of the errors of the pundits was in order.McCullough also glosses over key points in foreign policy history. He throws around terms like the Truman Doctrine, the George Kennan's Long Telegram, and NSC-68 without ever explaining what they were and how they refected US-Russian foreign policy. Amazingly, the GI bill was only mentioned in passing and the Marshall Plan was never clearly explained. The key to the Marshall Plan was the way it was applied to help Europe recover and not one sentence was dedicated to this important topic.I can only guess McCullough felt coverage of these topics were done better elsewhere. Maybe so, but for completeness sake they should have been spelled out. I found myself running to the encyclopedia to fill in the details so I could understand the fullness of what was going on.Still, a very, very enjoyable read. But if you want to read a truly superb biography, in my mind two books surpass this one: Huey Long by T. Harry Williams and Washington: The Indispensible Man by James Flexner. Both of these authors do what McCullough does not -- they paint complete pictures of their subjects and present very throrough analyses of both the subject and the surrounding events."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"After reading 1776 - I decided to read truman and thought there would be no way it could even be anyplace nearly as good - i was wrong - I am a david mccullougn fan for life"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I was given this book for Christmas by my mother who things that I am interested in Presidential history simply because my cat is name \\"Truman\\".

IT'S OUTSTANDING!! Mr. McCullough obviously admires his subject, but he is objective and shows Mr. Truman warts and all. He had very few warts however. BUY IT and READ IT as soon as you can. You won't regret the time spent."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Today I completed &quot;Truman&quot; and I have got to say that it is the most fantastic biography I have read! Harry S. Truman is presented, warts and all, and the author gracefully allows us to judge for ourselves. The book reads like a novel, yet as a devoted reader, I wanted to read slow--sipping it like a fine bourbon. Unlike some of our more recent presidents, Harry S. Truman is someone who stands by his decisions no matter which way the Gallop wind is blowing and allows history to judge him. That is the true measure of presidential character and Truman stands with Washington, Jackson, Lincoln, and Teddy as a statesman who embraced these qualities. Hopefully some young man or woman can read this book, and believe again that anyone can be president, as long as you stand by your convictions and stay loyal to your friends and to yourself. I am not a fan of most 20th Century Democrat presidents, but I am now!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The author makes Harry Truman come alive.Certainly the current occupant of the Oval Office makes Harry Truman's integrity and honesty shine even more brightly in comparison. Truman was a much simplier man (a la Reagan) who knew where he stood, knew right from wrong and accepted the responsibility that runs with great office.This book captivates in part because there are many less ambiguities to Truman's life than seem to present themselves with other &quot;famous&quot; people. The facts of Truman's life story are interesting enough -- what sets this book apart is that the author tells the story in a fast-paced and engaging manner. He synthesizes the facts with just enough analysis to weave together a coherent book. He aviods the trap that many biographers fall into of over analysis -- letting Truman remain the story instead of having some interpretation of Truman become the story.Note: I get to speak at a number of Eagle Scout ceremonies and mention this book along with Morris's &quot;The Rise Of Theodore Roosevelt,&quot; as two inspiring books that can open up young minds to the possibilities available in life. Roosevelt for shear energy and action and Truman for persistance in the face of opposition."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCollough captures the era of this truly accidental president who rose to greatness during very difficult times.Thoroughly researched.

McCullough's great strength as a biographer is engaging the reader while accreting massive amounts of detail to bring the characters to life on the page.McCullogh's efforts are undermined by the physical production of the digital version of this book. As with many Kindle books I own, this one is plagued by typos every few pages, typos of the kind that interrupt the meaning of the sentence as well as more minor ones (&#34;often&#34; for &#34;of ten&#34; for example, or uncapitalized surnames). One expects and tolerates such errors in a free, or nearly free, Kindle book. They are unacceptable in a book one paid $15 for. To their credit, Kindle or Amazon or someone has corrected one badly typeset Kindle book I own and provided a free download of the corrected version. Let us hope they do the same for Truman out of respect to the author and the readers."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I had no idea how huge this book was when I ordered it. I was pretty overwhelmed when it arrived by its size. However, after opening it and begining reading, I loved it. I hate reading history books that read as nothing but fact after fact. This was not like that at all! I felt so close to Mr. Truman throughout the book...like I knew him personally...McCullough nailed his character and personality."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A superb portrait of American history, full of atmosphere ranging from the XIX century's race to the mid-west to the XX century's politics. Maybe a bit hagiographic, but dense of history and men who did the history in the XX century.No doubts one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Although it's a long read, this book provides an incredible look at history during very difficult times for the U.S. (World War 2, Atomic Bomb, Korea, Cold War, Berline Airlift, McArthur firing). I highly recommend it as many of the problems encountered back then are similar to the issues surfacing today.If you're a baby boomer, this book can really fill in your knowledge gaps of what occured politically and militarily between 1940 and 1950.McCullough's portrayal of Truman is fair, citing his strengths and weaknesses. He was truly one of America's greatest presidents.I'm now a fan of McCullough's style and plan to read more of this books."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough is skilled writer, and his narrative is so smooth you can read with the speed and absorption usually reserved for novels. I read this as a companion to Halberstam's \\"Korea: the Coldest Winter\\". Both books were generally consistent on Korea, Truman, and MacArthur. This book was wider in scope and time. Harry Truman was apparently easy to underestimate, but the more I read of him, the more impressed I am. He was far from a saint and he had the prejudices and limitations of his time and upbringing. He did have an insatiable appetite for learning and he made up in wide and varied reading what he lacked in formal education. He was ambitious and determined to be in the center of the action, and he made the most of his opportunities. For a man who never expected to be president, once he realized the job was his, he gave it his all, butressed by his learning, curiosity, judgment of people, and decisiveness. I know we had to develop the atomic bomb as our adversaries were. I think Truman made the best decision with the facts he had, the country's war weariness, and the likelihood of a sustained, bloody, and deadly course should we have continued island hopping to Tokyo. David McCollough hadles this all deftly, thoughtfully, and comprehensibly....What if, if only, etc,... regarding the bomb and thinking of how different the world might be if we had not used it twice on two different civilian centers, our claim to the moral high ground would have more legitimacy in this current age."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This was an excellent biography. Harry Truman's life is very inspiring and it is well presented here.I like the fact that a significant time is spent presenting his life before he became \\"important\\", thisis something many biographers fail to cover adequately in my opinion. The PBS documentary about Truman is also an excellent overview of Truman's life, though obviously much shorter!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough in the Pulitzer Prize winning work recreates the fiery Harry S. Truman for his readers. Once dismissed as just an accidental president, Harry Truman was considered to be just a seat warmer for the next commander-in-chief. Truman would prove to be one of the nation's best, leading the United States out of World War II and into the early days of the Cold War. McCullough's writes with the same brilliant narrative in this work that I had found in when I read his 1776.I have to admit, I read this book the same summer that I read Jean Edward Smith's FDR. In short, I found myself comparing Truman's career to Roosevelt's. In some ways this was unfair considering Roosevelt was about eight years older. However, I could not help but think, \`Hey the same time Truman's rolling around on his father's farm, Roosevelt's in the State Senate.' Another example is that when Truman was a company officer, Roosevelt was assistant secretary of the navy.McCullough begins by explaining the origins of Truman's home state, Missouri, and his family history. Citizens of the \`show me' state generally have a very down to earth feeling about themselves and the world in which they lived. Truman is a man who comes out of this world.Truman grew up trying to avoid being labeled a \`sissy' for having to wear glasses, he was \`bookish' in some ways a stereotypical nerd who read a lot of history and was widely considered by his classmates to the smartest kid in class. When grew up World War I started up and he went to battle, as a captain he had success on the battlefield leading his company. He would ultimately rise to the rank of colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve. When he got home from war, he married the love of his life, Bess Wallace, and they would have one child in Mary Margaret.However, despite success in school and the battlefield he was always a little behind in life, he failed at business and feel into debt. For a good deal of time, he would work on his father's farm. His father had a great deal of political ambition but little time and resources and John Truman would die feeling that he was a failure in life, something that would haunt his son until his days as the President of the United States.His friendship with the Pendergast family gave him a connection to Boss Tom Pendergast, and that would lead to his election in 1922 as Jackson County Court Judge, although this was not a judicial court it was more like a county commission. Truman became the presiding judge in 1926 and he held that position right until the Roosevelt Administration. Therefore, when Roosevelt took office as President of the United States his eventually successor was nothing more then a chief county commissioner.In 1934, Harry Truman would earn the Democratic Party's senate nomination and go on to defeat the incumbent Roscoe Patterson by a full twenty points in the election. As a senator, Harry Truman would earn fame on the \`Truman Committee' that would deal with corruption of military contractors fleecing the Armed Forces during a time of war.\\"Truman understood the potential peril in what he was proposing. From his reading of Civil War history he knew what damage could be done to a President by congressional harassment in a time of emergency, and the lives it could cost by prolonging the war. Abraham Lincoln had been subjected to unrelenting scrutiny by the powerful Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, which caused continuing trouble and delays. Its Radical Republican leadership had insisted even on a say in the choice of field commanders and battle strategy, and as often on a say in the choice of field commanders and battle strategy, and as often as not it was the Confederates who benefited. Robert E. Lee once remarked that the committee was worth two divisions to him, an observation Truman would often cite. He had gone to the Library of Congress for the Civil War records to verify for himself what mistakes the committee had made.\\" p.258Truman's record made the Democratic Party nominate him for Vice President in 1944, dumping Vice President Henry Wallace who many thought was closet communist. The Roosevelt/Truman ticket would go on to win and Truman would do on to be the Vice President of the United States. He would hold that office for less than three months, for in that time Roosevelt was dead.Truman came to office in the middle of the incredible events of World War II and had to make the most famous or infamous decision of his career: the decision to drop the atomic bomb. In August 1945, Japan was sent the Postman Declaration demanding their surrender or the bomb would drop. Japan refused, the bombs were dropped, and the war ended.As president, Truman would later become admired for making tough decisions that had to be made. Moreover, a lot decisions would have to be made, in his first term he had to deal with strikes, propose and fight for the Marshall Plan, help form the United Nations, create the Truman Doctrine of containment, initiate the Berlin Airlift, and recognize the state of Israel. A great deal of these things would not popular, at first, and would cost Truman politically and most considered him dead in 1948, but as McCullough explains, Truman would shock them again.\\"The Marshall Plan was voted on by Congress in April 1948, almost a year after Marshall's speech at Harvard, and passed by overwhelming majorities in both houses. It was a singular triumph for the administration, the ventral gem in the cluster of great and fruitful decisions made by President Truman,' as Arthur Krock would write. Indeed, it was to be one of the great American achievements of the century, as nearly everyone eventually saw.\\" p.583With Thomas Dewey once again the nominee of the Republican* Party running as an if he were an incumbent, Truman ran as if were the challenger, he ran a more vigorous and ultimately successful campaign for president, popularized for \`Given \`em Hell.'\\"His opponent, Truman said, acted like a doctor whose magic cure for everything was a soothing syrup called unity. And here were the American people going for the usual once every four years check-up.\`Say you don't look so good!' Truman said, acting the part of the doctor.\`Well, that seems strange to me too, Doc,' he answered, as the voice of the people. \`I never felt stronger, never had more money, and never had a brighter future. What is wrong with me?'\`I never discuss issues with a patient. But what you need is a major operation.'\`Will it be serious, Doc?'\`Not so very serious. It will just mean taking out the complete works and putting in a Republican administration.'The audience roared with laughter. He had made the cool, letter-perfect Dewey a joke at last.\\" p.700Truman continued being Truman though out his second and elected term as president. During this term, the Chinese Communists won their civil war with the Nationalists and this helped feed the fire of a man named Eugene McCarthy, a drunken fool and senator, who would sensationalize national fear, and ruin the lives of many innocent people and get very few communists. N.A.T.O. would go on to be successfully established and due to the invasion of South Korea by the Communist North, Truman would get the U.N. to organize a \`police action' against the aggressor. The events of the Korean War would get save the South from the North but it would also led to another famous Truman event the firing of General MacArthur.\\"In New York two thousand longshoremen walked off their jobs in protest over the firing of MacArthur. A Baltimore women's group announced plans fro a march on Washington in support of the general. Elsewhere enraged patriots flew flags at half-staff, or upside down. People signed petitions, fired off furious letters and telegrams to Washington. In Worcester, Massachusetts, and San Gabriel, California, Truman was burned in effigy. In Houston, a Protestant minister became so angry dictating a telegram to the White House that he died of a heart attack.\\" p.844-5Despite being from a family with Confederate heritage Truman moved more on Civil Rights then any president before or until Lyndon Johnson. Truman would form the President's Committee on Civil Rights and he would desegregate the military.\\"On racial maters, Truman had not entirely outgrown his background. Old biases, old habits of speech continued, surfacing occasionally offstage, as some of his aides and Secret Service agents would later attest. Privately, he could still speak of \`n-----s,' as if that were the way one naturally referred to blacks. His own sister told Jonathan Daniels that Harry was no different then ever on the subject. Daniels, who had gone to Missouri to gather material for a biography of the President, recorded in his notes that as Mary Jane drove him south from Independence to Grandview one morning, she turned and said, \`Harry is no more for n-----r equality than any of us'--a statement Daniels, as a southerner, found reassuring.But Mary Jane, like others, failed to understand that Truman knew now, if they did not, that as President he could no longer sit idly by and do nothing in the face of glaring injustice. The findings of his Civil Rights Commission, in a landmark report entitled To Secure These Rights, had been a shocking revelation.The murder of four blacks by mob gunfire referred to in the letter had occurred in Monroe, Georgia, in July 1946. Two men and their wives were dragged from a car and gunned down so savagely their bodies were scarcely identifiable. One of the victims, Truman knew from a report of his Commission, had been a newly returned war veteran, and this, like the account of the men dumped from the truck in Mississippi, and of the young black sergeant, Issac Woodward, who had been pulled from a bus in Batesburg, South Carolina, and brutally beaten and blinded by police, made an everlasting impression on Truman, moving him in a way no statistics ever would have.\\" p.588-9Despite all his success, Truman would leave office unpopular and would remain so until the late sixties-early seventies, when a popular resurgence for the thirty-third president would begin. This Pulitzer Prize winning work McCullough does justice to the great President Harry S. Truman.*He ran against Franklin Roosevelt in 1944."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This was a gift for my husband. He has not read it yet, but it was in excellent brand new condition!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I bought it a few years back but I only started reading it a couple of weeks ago. This biography is amazing and fully deserving of its Pullitzer prize. The only thing that I didn't like is that McCullough is a bit too much in love with its subject and seems to justify at every turn some of the things that Truman did wrong. In my opinion, there is a difference between explaining someone's actions and justifying them. But other than that, the book is very good and I was very impressed with all the research the author did. Also, Truman's story is very touching, very moving and, mostly, very human. Finishing this book was like saying goodbye to a good friend."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Author David McCullough gives us an in-depth look into the life of President Truman. He shows how he evolved from a simple farmer to become the President of the United States. McCullough pulls no punches in his biography, and yet, Mr. Truman comes through as a simple man who rose to the challenge of becoming a true statesman and world leader. A Very compelling read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is one of those rare biographies which pulls you in from the beginning and never lets go. It is an excellent look at one of the truly under-appreciated presidents. Truman was an amazing man and an incredible public servant. The sense of history that this biography brings makes it a must-read for anyone interested in American history and/or American politics."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"An absolutely fantastic biography. McCullough not only gives us an incredibly in-depth account of Truman's role in such momentous events as the decision to drop the Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Potsdam Conference (Truman's only face-to-face meeting with Stalin or Uncle Joe as he called him), the Truman Doctrine, The Marshall Plan, the Berlin Airlift, the Korean War, the firing of General MacArthur and so on, but he also succeeds wonderfully in injecting joviality into this rather thick tome through his unsurpassed ability to recount the human side of Truman, the quirkiness, the common trials and errors of a human being and the like.I am not an American, but I always tell my friends that if I were Truman would be my favorite president. This book only serves to reinforce my view. Overall, one of the best biographies I've read. If I ever became famous one day, I'd really love someone of McCullough's caliber to write my biography. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The book gets better as you get further into the book (that is not to say the start of the book is lacking anything). It does a great job staying focused on the man and not events of the time. WWII, The Atom bomb and other big events could have easily taken over this story and while the man of course had a big role to play in these things the book does great job staying focused on Truman and his life."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"For anyone who has ever cheered for an underdog or bet on a longshot, this is a great read. HST had no money, no family position and no formal higher education--but he did great things for America. McCullough gives us his best story yet, with all the rich detail and factual substance we have come to expect from today's greatest political biographer. If I could read only one political biography again-this would be it."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a good biography of President Harry S. Truman, the man from Independence, Missouri. What I found most surprising in the book is how little time Truman spent with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, even after being nominated and elected. This was especially disturbing in light of the fact that many of the gatekeepers at the White House knew that Roosevelt was in failing health and doubted that he would complete his unprecedented fourth term. Fortunately, Truman was basically a good man, despite his dependence upon machine politicians while seeking political advancement in Missouri, and he tried to conduct himself in an honest manner. He made his share of mistakes, but he meant well. He certainly was not a plaster cast saint, but on the whole he acquitted himself well. In recent years, Truman has been promoted as an exemplary member of the Democratic Party, but, as McCullough points out, when he left the presidency he was shunned and seemed to be destined to obscurity. His reputation rebounded twenty years after he left Washington."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This book is very informative and one of the most thorough and interesting biographies of Harry Truman that you will find. However be sure that you are looking for a book that is over 2 inches thick. That being said, if you are a quick reader or have a lot of time on your hands, then you will find this book to be outstanding. You will walk away with a very real understanding of Harry Truman as a person and as a President. But be warned, it is much much larger than the other books by David McCullough. Easily double the size of \\"John Adams\\"."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"If you want to know about Truman in excruciating detail, this book is for you. It will be a long time before I read another book about him.This book is a well written masterpiece but I would have enjoyed a more condensed version--a half marathon rather than a full marathon."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough delivers another knockout in this biography of Harry S. Truman. It is truly a complete study that shows how the president evolved as a person and became one of the best presidents in our history. He is clearly one of the most overlooked and few people realized the trying times he endured. In the first year of his presidency he weathered more crises then Lincoln, FDR or JFK. He did it with no knowledge of the resources at his disposal and achieved success through straight talk and honest decisions. Truman's background as a farmer in Missouri had positioned him as the common man in the white house. From bankruptcy in the suit business to a farm that was on the decline Truman rose through adversity. He married his sweetheart and served as an officer in World War 1. These struggles would prepare him for a life in politics. One of the more interesting parts that I feel has been overlook in other reviews is the time with the political machines in Missouri. The political machine era which was its peak in the Gilded Age was still strong in the 1920's and Great depression. Truman navigated the machine to become a senator and work his way by being the dark horse vice presidential candidate.When Truman became President upon the death of FDR, both the world and Truman were shocked and afraid for what might happen. He used the information at his hands and prepared for the Potsdam conference where he did as good a job if not better than FDR would have done. His decision to use the bomb is laid out in very clear detail in the book and despite the critics there were few if any people telling him not to use the bomb. The post war period is where Truman really shines and handles several domestic crises very well. The railway strike and coal minors strike threaten to cripple the country and Truman's use of political bluster is impressive. The recognition for the state of Israel also occurred under his tenure and was one of the most critical decisions a United States president would make. Although the republican congress that comes in causes problems it sets the stage for one of the most interesting reelection campaigns in history. Truman vs. Dewey was a reversal of almost any incumbent election. Truman was the one on the defensive and had to take his case to the people. He did an amazing whistle stop tour which visited towns across the country. He was forced to defend his civil rights record and the fair employment act and desegregation of the military. Although Dewey appeared the favorite Truman eeked a victory by wining several key states some by a margin of only 5000 votes. The famous newspaper is shown in the book and the results of polls and the press are described well.Truman's second term in office started off smoothly and was characterized by the successful resolution of the Berlin Airlift and the establishment of NATO. The Korean War was the defining moment of the second administration. It was Truman's chance to stand up to the Soviet Union and show that he was not soft on Communism. The height of the red scare demanded tough tactics. The war is covered with the right amount of detail as is the struggles with General McArthur. The final part of his presidency is taken up with another series of strikes. Truman also did more to establish the office of the Presidency than any other president. He cultivated the symbols such as the limo, plane, yacht and railcar. He spent millions redoing the White House and making it a true symbol of power. These factors contribute to one of the most interesting times in American history. For those who want to learn more about what shaped the modern nation this is the place to start. The book flows very well and is through in the information provided."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough has a talent for bringing these people back to life and seeing them--not as larger than life icons of history but as real people. The incredible investment in research of 1000s of documents and personal letters has paid off magnificently. Thank you McCullough for showing us how the values of an early era should mean so much more to us today. Great reading!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Surely the number one chronicle of Truman's life, the detail and scope of research behind this book are phenomenal. From humble, hard-working beginnings through the at times shadowy political 'game' and ultimately to the highest office in the land, Truman's development and rise to the top is interesting in the context of his own life and the context of that period of American and world history.This book is extremely long, so takes some patience and persistence to get through but for anyone with the slightest interest in history and the machinations of politics, a great read.From what I've read, McCullough hasn't written a bad book in his career and is one the best exponents of American history."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"When FDR died in March, 1945, the United States was still knee-deep in the Second World War, and the Democratic party was still recovering from a near defeat in the 1944 Presidential elections. Fast forward to January, 1953, and the United States, the Democratic Party, and indeed the world were in a much different place. What happened during this time? Remarkably, the man in the White House, a Democrat who never completed college, never held a state governorship and was not a member of one of the wealthy American families who dominated politics in the past 100 years, led the country through a quagmire of labor troubles, the beginning of the Cold War and the emergence of the United States as one of the two great world powers of the time.In his epic biography, David McCollugh follows Truman from his family's emergence in Western Missouri through Truman's adolescence on the farm in Independence, his service in France in the First World War and his fascinating political career. Through it all, the reader gets a great picture of Truman, a man of principle who believed in hard work and the principle that place of government should be to improve the lives of its citizens. McCollugh goes into excruciating detail to discuss Truman's life, his relationships and his career. The reader comes to know Truman in a rather intimate way. In doing so, the reader comes to understand the incredible challenges that faced the man from Independence, challenges that arguably surpassed those of any previous president since Lincoln. Like Lincoln, Truman was an unlikely man to hold sway in those turbulent times. And, like Lincoln, Truman guided the country in a way that exceeded anyone's expectations.The only criticisms that I would make of this biography are the following two. Firstly, the author is obviously in love with his subject. While one should not expect a biographer to be completely objective with regard to his subject, McCollugh could have provided a more balanced view of Truman. What were the criticisms of Truman's Republican, Progressive and Southern Democratic critics? The author discusses these in only a cursory manner. What about the arguements made by Truman's critics about the loss of so many nations to Communist domination, culminating in the triumph of Mao's Communists in China? Again, McCollugh is light on this topic. McCollugh focuses on the emotional toll that Truman's critics laid upon the President, but ironically he does not adequately describe what those critics had to say.My only other criticism is the excessive descriptions the author makes of Truman's presidency. He spends many pages discussing in agonizing detail the daily activities of the 1948 presidential campaign, for example. This book could have easily been 300 pages shorter and still have been just as thorough in its treatment of Truman. Just because the author has some compelling documentation from the archives does not require him to insert all of it into his narrative. Sometimes less is more.Overall, this is an excellent treatment of a very important topic. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Kindle edition is missing several pages. Amazon said they fixed it . I reloaded it after deleting the bad copy and problem still exists. I am returning it and borrowing a friends hard copy to finish it."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough's textured crescendo is so penetrating and readable that I would caution those of you seeking insights into leadership that you may find yourselves becoming a bit out of sorts... Truman embodies the kind of leadership so profoundly absent in contemporary American politics, and his trajectory is a progression through an era whose character and depth flies in the face of modern-day pop culture. I found myself at once both feeling better prepared as a student of history and aspiring leader, and melancholy at the remote prospects of ever seeing this type of personality in our political landscape again...Nonetheless, I consider it a must read. Forewarned is forearmed!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is the &#34;How To&#34; of the Office of the President of the United States. In one sentence: Tell the truth and do the right thing for the people, not your party or your reelection!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"In spite of the author's rambling sentences, often poorly constructed, he lays out a wonderful picture of Truman the man. I was often reminded of names of persons associated with president Truman that I had long forgotten. A great book if one ignores some of the construction."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I love David McCullough's work. His books are highly readable and enjoyable. I don't feel the author's opinions coming through, which is important when writing a historical text.It should be a read for history classes. Great recommendation"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much. A good biography accomplishes two things: it explains the subject as a person, and the historical setting in which he or she operated. I was born in 1961, and had a huge \\"donut hole\\" in my understanding of the period between WWII and Vietnam in American history. The Korean War was not taught at all, and if your first introduction to it was the TV series M*A*S*H, you did not get the significance of it. I certainly couldn't have told you a thing about Harry Truman before reading this book. I now see how much I was missing. This biography filled in so many gaps for me. I wish there were a David McCullough bio of every major historical figure!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I have never read a biography where I knew the outcome of most of the issues discussed in the book but, still could not stop reading the book. At the end of the book, when Truman dies, I was in tears. I felt as if I had lost a friend. McCullough was able to capture the end of Truman's life with such poignancy, that Truman's experience made me very aware of the mortality of life. I highly recommend this book as well of the other of McCullough's books. He is a rare author in being able to describe events and people in such a way that I felt as if I was personally involved in what was happening. I have also gained much insight into how history repeats itself."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Excellent portrait of a remarkable man and president, additionaly a very in depth description of the country back then and their circuntances. Is one of those books that allows you to put things in perspective."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough does a masterful job with Truman. He selected a sometimes overlooked President who is definitely worth studying. Although I am familiar with this time period in American History I had forgotten how many major events and decisions that come through Harry Truman as President. McCullough does an excellent job of showing how Truman could have very easily not been FDR's VP nominee in 1944. Truman had so many earth shattering decisions to make that it is incredible that he prevented a World War III. When Truman became President after the death of FDR he was truly overwhelmed at the responsibilities that he was facing and McCullough does a good job showing that Truman did not think himself up to the task but was determined to do his best. I admire the decisiveness and determination of President Truman, especially with his decision not to give up Berlin to the Soviet Union. The accomplishment of the Berlin Airlift is spectacular and speaks highly of American resolve. David McCullough is fast becoming my favorite biographer."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"For several decades I have read little except history and biography. Many about Lincoln and FDR, but nothing about Truman, except his daughter's book, which was not very good. I did not know Harry Truman before reading this book and could not know him better after reading it. It is one of the best biographies I have ever read. Sometimes, one encounters things, such as a given Beethoven sonata, or the final paragraph of Lincoln's First Inaugural, and one knows this could not have been better. This book is that good."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Truman, by David McCullough, is a biography of Harry S. Truman, former president of the United States of America. This book relates the entire story of Truman's life, from his humble beginning in a poor family to his presidency and even after he left the office after his second term. Truman's was a turbulent presidency, it began at the death of Roosevelt, and encompassed the end of World War II and the beginning of the conflict in Vietnam. McCullough talks about the roots of the Truman family, Harry Truman's formative years, the process by which he became a politician, and his years as a politician. McCullough goes into every aspect in great detail, there is nothing lacking in this book. The most interesting sections of this book are those that deal with Truman's presidency. Reading about the decisions he was forced to make and the process by which he made them is fascinating. This process is truly the way things in our country get done, and should be examined by all concerned members of our society. This book clearly shows the relationship of one man as president to the staff which he appoints, and the immense personal sacrifice that each political leader must make to serve the people. Truman was truly a common member of American society, and every person interested in political science, history, society, and the United States of America should read this book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"An astonishing achievement, this book captures the life and times of an outstanding President and fascinating man.

Mr Truman went to bed with me every night and to work with me everyday for 6 weeks. I LOVED this book. He lived by what his parents taught him. Trust in the Lord, work hard, do your best, speak the truth, assume no airs and have no fear. He did all these things whether he was plowing a field or making decisions of historic magnitude. He was no hick! He grew up reading, listening and playing classics. Once when a secret service man offered to set him up with a woman, he said, Son, don't ever say anything like that to me again. I married my childhood sweetheart. Any man who can't be faithful to his wife, can't be faithful to his country. What a Man! A lot like my husband."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry S.

The reader can feel the pressure of the monumental decisions that faced HST. The section on the termination of General MacArthur is in itself worth the price of the book. The book reveals the value of presidential character and makes an American long for a repeat performance. If the average American wants to know what our forefathers wanted in a leader, this book is required reading."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"My husband gave me this book as a present. He may have regretted it because I could not put it down! Being from Missouri, I have had an interest in Truman but never realized what a sensitive, moral man he was. His impact on our nation is still evident and I am amazed at his determination and stamina. To pursue issues that may have led to his political demise just because it was the &quot;right thing&quot; to do should be embarced by our present day politicians."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry S. Truman believed that history is made by people and personalities -- that people shape events and not the other way around. This biography illustrates that very well. Some people will say that it is not balanced, that there is not enough &quot;negative&quot; portrayal of Truman. I'd disagree. The acid test of any biography is to leave you feeling like you've met a real person -- all his greatness and all his weaknesses. This biography does that. If you read the rest of the reviews on this page you'll see that people are deeply affected by his story -- they feel like they just met a real person and not only that, someone who's story still speaks to them. What is clear from reading this book is that (a) it deserved the pulitzer prize because it is one of the great biographies, (b) Truman was, warts and all, a &quot;great man&quot;. When you pick this up, stick with it all the way to the end and digest what it has to say. You'll never get it out of your! head."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Informative, stimulating, McCullough at his best, and with one of his best subjects. Truman's exciting come-from-behind win in 1948 doesn't hurt the readability of this wonderful biography. Brings to life some other very fascinating individuals who had a tremendous impact on the times (as McCullough always manages to do) such as Marshall, Eisenhower, Dean Acheson, and Robert A. Taft. McCullough gets you hooked, then you have to go and read up on these other characters to get the full effect of McCullough's design - a brilliant plan by a brilliant author to challenge us all to learn more.Whatever people thought of Truman at the time, posterity certainly has been kind to him and his presidency. I highly recommend you read this book to find out why."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is still probably my favorite book my McCollough. What an author, what a subject, what an American story. A great narrative on one of our greatest presidents."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I did not know much about Truman before reading this book. Due to recommendations from friends, I simply wanted to read a book by David McCullough.The book is well written in story-style rather than a dry historical record. But, perhaps the greatest compliment I can pay to this book is that I am now as keenly interested in Harry S Truman as I am to read other books by Mr. McCullough.This is an excellent book - one of the best biographies I've read. Other excellent biographies I recommend are Katherine Graham's \\"Personal History\\" and Hillary Rodham Clinton's \\"Living History.\\""},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Are you scared of 1000 pages of non-fiction? I picked this book up out of desperation in a quick attempt to find something interesting while changing planes in Cincinatti. The author produces the biography lover's dream book here. Covering all sides, disecting Truman as well as can be done, all while telling a compelling story that you don't want to put down. Why? This man became President in the final year of WW2, perhaps the most pivotal time in history, and with no previous guidance from FDR, managed to make all the right big decisions and blow lots of smaller ones. By the time Truman assumes the Presidency the author has put you on almost intimate terms with Harry and you can't help but be fascinated by it all. This is the first 1000 page book I have cruised through in a lifetime. And for that, Mr. McCullough deserves a medal. I went on to enjoy 1776, John Adams, and the book about the Panama Canal just as much (and they are all much shorter). I intend to read everything he writes."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"There is an old Chinese curse that says, \\"May you live in interesting times.\\" Clearly this applies to President Truman. To review just a few of the issues that Truman dealt with as President:* The decision to drop the atomic bomb.* The formalization of the nations united against the axis into the United Nations dedicated to world peace and advancement.* The intellectual development of the theory of containment.* The implementing test of Greece for the theory of containment.* The birth of NATO and the communist bloc.* The decision to rebuild Germany and Japan as democratic countries.* The failed attempt to negotiate peace in China and the resulting split between the PRC and ROC.* The failure to have nation wide elections in Korea, the resulting implementation of North and South Korea, the Korean War, and the ongoing stalemate between North and South Korea.* The decision to support the founding of Israel.* The decision to desegregate the U S military. Something FDR never had the moral integrity to implement.Whether one loves or hates Truman, he served in a time of great change and crises. One can debate about his level of success in these challenges, but he responded with character and determination. A man of modest background and meager formal education, Truman set an example that while not perfect is inspiring and useful."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This book is over one thousand pages long while the audio is fifty-three hours long. The reason quite simply is that McCullough goes into great detail, often week-by-week and day-by-day. What is amazing is that it never gets boring! McCullough has emphasized Truman's own perspective, totally cutting out the middleman. There was a lot here I never really understood well, especially the importance of Truman as the paradigm for the second half of the 20th century was forming.Nelson Runger does a GREAT reading job."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is an outstanding book. It has changed my view of Truman as President considerably.The only weakness of this book is that the publisher did not spend much money on the binding and it has come apart on me even though I have not finished my first reading of it. This is with the hard bound copy, which one would not expect"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Although there is much left out of the abridged audio book, it partly makes up for it by including actual audio of some of Truman's speeches and even one melodramatic speech by Douglas MacArthur. The audio book focuses most on his early life, military career, the atomic bomb, his race with Dewey, and the Korean war. Unfortunately much of his private life, Israel, and the birth of the UN/NATO is short changed.What never ceases to amaze me about American History is how it repeats itself. The Korean War was the \\"wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time\\". Truman had to make tough decisions between taking North Korea and extending the Chinese conflict. Now NK is one of the most dangerous countries in the world, but would it have been worth the cost to finish the job as MacArthur wanted?"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I decided to read this book for two reasons. First, I was/am an avid supporter of Howard Dean, and he often cites Truman as his favorite president, and knowing so little about Truman, I was curious why. Second, practically the only thing I did know about Truman was that he made the decision to use the Bomb, and I was extremely interested in what sort of man it takes to make such a decision.The book is 992 pages long - daunting to someone whose only other 500+ page read had been Lord of the Rings.But I found each page interesting and riveting. Never did I find it slow or dull. I had no idea how much impact the Truman administration had on the country and the world. Not only the Bomb, but the start of the Cold War, the Korean War, the first push by a President for universal health care, the first push by a President for equal civil rights. Truman, an ordinary farmer from western Missouri, is the absolute example of the American dream.The book also answered both of my questions. The similarities in Truman's approach to politics and his agenda with Howard Dean's campaign for the presidential nomination are uncanny. And, to my surprise, Truman was not at all the sort of man I imagined making the decision to obliterate Hiroshima and Nagasaki.I feel like I've learned more from this one book than I learned in 17 years of schooling."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This was a book that let the reader see the totality of a great man. Truman represented the opposite of the arrogance that pervades today's White House. He was a common man from Independence, Missouri who rose to greatness. He was one of us, not talking to us from &quot;on high.&quot; He loved his country, and it was obvious from reading the book that his common sense approach to leadership was admired deeply by ones who followed him.America may never see someone like Truman again. He was truly one of a kind. I highly recommend this book.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown-Eyed Boy&quot;"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A very personal picture of a man who was put in the position of having to make some of the most difficult decisions in our nation's history.

However, what I didn't know was how insecure he was in himself and how he was rewarded for his hard,steady, work- ethic in all that came his way. My knowledge of him was of four things--1. his faIlure at a Haberdashery store, 2. his being chosen by Roosevelt as vice President. 3.His accession to the presidency,4.his decision to drop the Atomic Bomb on Japan. with a few tidbits in between.
