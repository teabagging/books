It was not Beard's last book, but one that subjected him to a veritable witch hunt and his removal from his position in historical societies and organization. A progressive of the old LaFollette type, Beard simply sought to tell the truth about how Roosevelt plunged the USA into World War II before any declaration of war or attacks on the USA by Germany, Italy, or Japan.Most of the material here comes from hearings in the US congress, some during World War II, and other shortly afterward.It is unfortunate that Beard did not have access to the materials that have been available in the last 10 or 20 years as war time records has become declassified. His concentration is on Pearl Harbor and the naval war against Italy and Germany (most who write about submarine warfare in the Atlantic neglect the fact that there was a substantial force of Italian submarines as well as German submrines), that Roosevelt launched in 1940. Yet, this is but the tip of the iceberg in Roosevelt's illegal war against Germany and Italy and Japan in 1940 and in 1941.Roosevelt ran the 1940 election under the slogan \\"I hate war\\" and on his many pledges not to send Americans to fight in the Second World War. As soon as Roosevelt won the 1940 election he secretly began to send American sailors, marines, and soldiers into the war.In November 1940, Roosevelt sent the US navy into the Atlantic to attack and sink German and Italian submarines in complete cooperation with the British. This was despite the fact that the German and Italian submariners were ordered to stay out of the Western Atalantic and to avoid American ports and ships so they would not provoke US public opinion. What the Axis submariners could have done if they targeted American shipping was shown in 1941 and 1942 after Pearl Harbor. Hundreds of ships were sunk within sight of the East Coast. Britain was seriously threatened with strangulation.The evidence that Beard prints in this book chiefly from Congressional hearings explains major incidents like the sinking of the Reuben James and the Kearny that were used to claim Germany was sinking American ships without provocation. Congressional hearings reported on in this book show both incidents were provoked by aggressive US Navy attacks on German submarines either separate from or in direct cooperation with the British and Canadian navies.Roosevelt had the US in a world-wide naval war with Germany and Italy by 1941. American Navy pilots worked directly with the British. In fact it was an US Navy pilot, not a British pilot who flew the plane that torpedoed the Bismark and left it unable to steer. The destroyer for bases deal not only supplied the British with destroyers, but sent US troops to the bases that protected British colonies in the Americas and Africa so British troops there could be sent to the war in the Arab East.The US Navy began to build a major base in Northern Ireland. By 1941 US Navy ships would attack, sink, or seize any German vessel they encountered on the high seas, not just in the Atlantic, but in the Pacific and Indian Ocean as well. The US fleet and \\"neutral\\" American shipping were used to convoy Australian, New Zealand, and British colonial troops from the Pacific to the US and Canada to be shipped to the British war in North Africa.American Marines relieved the British troops who had essentially invaded and occupied Iceland, an action not really favored by the Icelandic government which had tried to stay neutral. Those same Marines were originally to have invaded Vichy-controlled Martinique and Guadeloupe, but the Vichy governor of the islands agreed to allow US Navy officers to control passage of naval vessels to those islands, keeping French warships in port on these islands until the end of the War.In Asia, Roosevelt launched the Flying Tigers. Rather than being a mercenary program paid for by the Chaing Kai Shek government as the public was told until the relevant documents were released in the 1980s, the Flying Tigers were totally financed by the United States Army Air Force. All of the Tigers were serving Navy or Army pilots who were ordered to leave the Navy and the Army to accept positions with the Tigers. Generally, Army and Navy officers are not usually allowed to simply quit and take other positions before the end of their service, let alone in a period of coming war. Plans for the Tigers included building a huge American-staffed and paid for air force that would possess long range bombers to attack Japan. They barely had begun functioning in China before WWII began.In late 1940 joint commissions of the US military and naval general staffs and their British counterparts were set up in both Washington and London to plan a US-British war against both Germany and Japan. Similar arrangements were worked out with Britain, Canada, and the Dutch colonial government of whatr is now knows as Indonesia for naval and military action against Japan.Those who do not know the information Beard provides and the rest that has come out since his times, wonder why Germany declared war on the USA. They picture the German declaration of war as an erroneous and gratuitous act of solidarity with Japan. They miss the real question. The real question is why did Germany wait so long to declare war on the USA when the USA had been carrying on what American and international law clearly defined as illegal warfare against Germany since the fall of 1940.Beard's courage on this issue was symptomatic of his rigor and independence, his relentless desire to find the truth. Just as we are ignorant of the real origins of US involvement in WWII without this pioneering work, we are ignorant of who the founders of the US government were, and what they were afraid of unless we read his Economic Interpretation of the Constitution. Beard was not just a learned man, a dilegent scholar, and pretty good writer, he was a brave man who demanded to tell the truth no matter how unpopular it was. We should all be more like Beard!"},{"Title":"President Roosevelt and the Coming of the War, 1941: Appearances and Realities","review":"This book is a genuine classic by the greatest American historian of the twentieth century. It really encompasses three separate but related dimensions. First, Beard sets out to discuss the gap between &quot;appearances and realities&quot; in American foreign policy in 1941, leading up to the entry of the United States into the Second World War by way of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Secondly, he is concerned with the role of the &quot;open door&quot; world view in American thought which he believes set the stage for the Pacific conflict. And, thirdly, Beard raises questions concerning the conduct of American foreign policy relating to Presidential concealment and duplicity, the relation of means to ends in foreign policy, and the roles of the legislative branch and the electorate in the democratic control of foreign policy.All of these themes are highly relevant to the post-World War II Vietnam debacle and more current American interventionism. Written shortly after World War II, and making use of the Joint Congressional Inquiry on the Pearl Harbor Attack, Charles A. Beard's last major book does not contain all the answers, but it raises the important questions."},{"Title":"President Roosevelt and the Coming of the War, 1941: Appearances and Realities","review":"This is an important book by a respected American historian. The previously posted reviews fairly accurately describe Beard's discussion of the Roosevelt Administration's policies, especially in the Atlantic. Beard's book is an honest, fact based book, unlike the Pear Harbor conspiracy nut cases. What the reviewers do not discuss, however, is Beard's central thesis that the United States had no vital interests in Europe.One reviewer asks that it is surprising that Hitler waited so long to declare war on America. It is in fact hardly surprising. His whole approach was to knock off one enemy at a time. This is how he seized power in Germany. And he used the same approach in his foreign policy. He attempted to pick off one country at time. He got Czechoslovakia (and the vital Skoda arms works) because Prime minister Chamberlain saw no vital British interests. Much of the artillery and tanks that tore through the British and French in the German Western offensive came from the Skoda arms works. Fortunately for America, the British were too obstinate to admit that they had been defeated.What President Roosevelt realized (and Beard still did not) was that after Hitler had conquered Europe he would come after us. The NAZIs developed plans both for bombers and missels that could cross the Atlantic as well as a huge navy. And readers should ask themselves what would have been the cost in American blood had we had to fight the NAZIs without the British not to speak of the Soviets."},{"Title":"Behind the Mule","review":"This is a very important work in black politics and an interesting if complexing read. Check it out if interested in black political behavior..."},{"Title":"The Revenger's Tragedy, Second Edition (New Mermaids)","review":"OK. The jury has more or less decided that &quot;The Revenger's Tragedy&quot; is not by Cyril Tourneur after all, but by Thomas Middleton. This is on strictly scholarly grounds. Either way, it scarcely matters, as this play is strictly sui generis. It's like nothing else either Tourneur or Middleton ever wrote.The best way to think of it is as standing in a relation to the classic Jacobean and Elizabethan tragedies of Kyd, Shakespeare, Webster and Middleton sort of like the way Quentin Tarantino's early films stand in relation to previous Hollywood classics. Whoever wrote this, they were Taking The P*ss. The play starts in next-to-top gear, and accelerates into warp speed fairly quickly. Few other plays of the era (this is roughly contemporaneous with &quot;King Lear&quot;, to give you an idea) are so ruthlessly efficient. The basic plot is put in motion by two brothers, Vindice and Hippolito, who are a bit cheesed off because the egregious Duke (of wherever) killed Vindice's wife cause she wouldn't put out. From here proceeds a bizarre and increasingly unlikely series of revenges, climaxing in a frankly chortlesome mass slaying. Vindice is the juiciest role - a bit like Shakespeare's Richard III, he guides the audience through the action, but with far greater economy and far less wrangling of conscience, not that Crookback Dick is noted for his remorse.By the end, the stage is littered with bodies, and Vindice and Hippolito cheerfully go off to execution, with barely a qualm in sight. This is truly the most cynical and the funniest of all Jacobean tragedies. Whoever wrote it, be it Cyril or Tom, was thinking along the same lines Howard Hawks was on when he (Hawks) turned &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; from a Western into a chamber comedy. It's all thoroughly reprehensible, and great fun. You want depth, try John Webster.There aren't many four-hundred-year-old plays that I laugh aloud at whilst reading, but this is one of them. Pace the opinion below, it couldn't have less to do with Jonson's careful layering of reality if it tried. It's a brisk, bleak, savage cartoon. Full marks, whoever you were."},{"Title":"The Revenger's Tragedy, Second Edition (New Mermaids)","review":"Brian Gibbons, editor of the New Mermaids second edition (1991), describes The Revenger's Tragedy (1607) as a minor masterpiece. Judged against contemporaneous revenge plays like Hamlet and King Lear (and even Titus Andronicus), the term 'minor' certainly does not imply inferior. Minor or not, I agree with the four previous reviewers: The Revenger's Tragedy deserves five stars. Also, it is much easier reading than most Elizabethan and Jacobean plays.Despite its title, The Revenger's Tragedy is no more bloody than Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy (fifteen years earlier) and it is certainly not as insanely gruesome and brutal as Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus (1594). No dismemberments and no cannibalism. Bloody, yes. But not excessively so.Nonetheless, we learn of a murder, a rape leading to a suicide, and yet another aggressive seduction (or rape, if need be) that is in the planning stage. So ends Act 1. Revenge and mayhem follow.The plot is not unduly complex. Vindice desires revenge for the poisoning death of his betrothed, Gloriana, by the lustful, aging Duke. Vindice also indirectly blames the Duke for his father's death, though \\"he died of discontent, the nobleman's consumption\\". Vindice is perhaps obsessive; he has retained Gloriana's skull and sometimes speaks directly to her.In disguise he provokes discord between his enemies and leads them to plot against each other. (This ruse reminds me of Malevole's subterfuge in John Marston's play, The Malcontent.) A poisoned skull, a mistaken execution, and a murderous banquet highlight the later acts. The play concludes with an ironic twist, possibly added as a moral lesson, or simply to surprise the audience.Hats off to either Cyril Tourneur or Thomas Middleton, or whoever may have authored this fascinating revenge play.Update July, 2007: I recently encountered reference to this lesser known play in a murder mystery. Cecil Day-Lewis, Poet Laureate from 1968 until his death in 1972, wrote sophisticated mysteries under the pseudonym Nicholas Blake from the mid-1930s to the early 1960s. Thou Shell of Death (1936) is a revenge murder patterned on The Revenger's Tragedy. In the first scene Vindice speaking to the skull of his dead mistress says: \\"My study's ornament, thou shell of death, Once the bright face of my betrothed lady ....\\""},{"Title":"The Revenger's Tragedy, Second Edition (New Mermaids)","review":"I adored this play. So did most of my classmates when we discovered it!Not a tale for the squeamish!!! Very dark, but it is specifically an avenger's tale (same subgenre that _Hamlet_ is). If you liked Sondheim's _Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_, you'll love this too! It is different from most avenger's tragedies, and is witty and scary both. I don't get scared by Hamlet; I get mad at him for his indecisiveness. Lack of decision is not a problem in this play!If you've read Jonson, you'll get a clue to the characters here the same way, for their names tell you their nature. The style of wit is also reminiscent of Jonson, along the lines of _The Alchemist_ or _Epicoene_ perhaps.I am sorry, but I don't care who wrote this [Cyril or Thomas]--but I appreciate whoever did enormously."},{"Title":"The Revenger's Tragedy, Second Edition (New Mermaids)","review":"This dark tragi-comedy resonates with the dramatic potential of Hamlet, but and edge particular to Jacobean Drama.

I don't think the background to the play in the introduction is quite as thorough as it could be (the Oxford being more complete I think in that regard), but his notes are helpful and his history of production, though short, is revealing. I tend to side with those that attribute this play to Middleton, but who knows? The play itself is a wonderful mixture of the melodramatic revenge plot with a surprisingly comic over-view of the world in which it takes place."},{"Title":"The Revenger's Tragedy, Second Edition (New Mermaids)","review":"PreShakespeare, but a lot of fun to read!

Anyone not wholly tonedeaf, i.e. anyone not a 'scholar,' should be capable of recognizing that it is not written by any of the usual suspects, or by any of the candidates canvased by scholars. It's no good fantasizing that Middleton or Tourneur suddenly turned stylistic backflips to produce this masterpiece - just read the verse!! Only someone who never wrote a play, a novel or a poem could fail to recognize authentic stylistic character and idiosyncracy. These can't be adopted like a Halloween costume.

One quote will illustrate the whole method of this work,&quot;The most serious mistake we can make with reference to expiation and atonement is to assume that htese are ecclesiastical concerns whose sole reference is to a particular institution, the church or Christian synagogue, and its doctrine of Christ . . . . Whether or not men believe in God, they are inescapably tied to Him in all their being . . . . By his sin and unbelief, man makes himself morally estranged from God, and at war with God . . . . [I]n spite of himself, man cannot depart one iota from the conditions of life and being as they are ordained by God (pg. 563ul).&quot;In other words, it's not simply a matter of whether we will have a god or not, atonement or not, justification or not, infalliblity or not. We will have all of these either as God has intended them or as counterfeited in some way. These are inescapable concepts.Rushdoony illustrates at length that Christian doctrine is not something academic or simply for church. Rather, it is the key to understanding the life and movement of God's world, our own psychology, and the life of every society."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology (2 Volume Set)","review":"This is a good book.

I listened to the ones on &quot;justification&quot;, &quot;guilt&quot;, and &quot;atonement&quot; years ago. They were profound. As they show up in the book now, they lack the same force and read more like random newsletter articles than ideas which connect and build on each other. Don't throw away your other theological tomes, but supplement them with this one."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology (2 Volume Set)","review":"Rousas John Rushdoony (1916-2001) is the extremely controversial founder of the \\"Christian Reconstruction\\" movement; he has long advocated a need for a systematic theology (see his earlier book,The Necessity for Systematic Theology), and in 1994, the work was finally released.He states in the Introduction, \\"This study is titled 'Systematic Theology' because it is an effort to apply Scripture systematically to various spheres of faith and life.... It is a serious mistake to see theology as an academic exercise ... it is the duty of the theologian to understand it AND to apply it to every area of life and thought.\\"Rushdoony eschews the traditional six- to eight-part divisions of most systematic theologies, dividing his work into nineteen categories (including besides the usual categories, \\"The Covenant,\\" \\"Theology of the Land,\\" \\"Theology of Work,\\" and \\"Authority\\").Rushdoony's comments are often (to put it charitably) rather acerbic. Here are some representative quotations (with which I certainly do not agree), to give you an idea of what the work contains:He considers the differences between superlapsarian, infralapsarian, and sublapsarian positions to be based on a \\"blasphemous presumption.\\" (Pg. 69)\\"The goal of ideas is not criticism but action.\\" (Pg. 101)\\"If the Bible is true, then, whether a man is a male prostitute or a cynical critic of the Old Testament text, his is a moral and a religious problem, not an intellectual problem.\\" (Pg. 114)\\"I freely and happily confess that I am ignorant about many theologians, but I am not ignorant about God.\\" (Pg. 198)\\"Colonialism is another source of guilt trips.... all Europeans and whites are asked to see themselves as racists and exploiters, and therefore guilty.\\" (Pg. 464)\\"All men outside of Christ are guilty men, and guilty men are dominated by sado-masochistic activities.\\" (pg. 603)\\"Women have imitated men, and the feminist 'liberation' movement is a demand for irresponsibility, and hence its close ties to the sexual revolution and to the homosexual and lesbian causes.\\" (pg. 685)\\"If God is not the determiner of all things, there is no point in prayers to Him; if God does not hear and answer prayers, there is again no point to prayer. This involves a mystery, but life is full of mysteries.\\" (Pg. 834)\\"The new covenant is ... at one and the same time a covenant of grace and law, a covenant of works. WORKS belong to the covenant, irrevocably and fundamentally.\\" (Pg. 884)\\"The anti-Christianity of modern humanism has led to an hatred of both God and man, and a readiness to sacrifice man to nature.... The Bible separates man from the rest of creation because man is God's image-bearer and is called to exercise dominion. The environmentalists separate man from nature as the destroyer who must be restrained and suppressed in his dedication to dominion and development.\\" (Pg. 957)\\"The church at its worst has never equalled the modern state in its tyranny.\\" (Pg. 1036)\\"Secondary authorities are very real; they are God-ordained, and they are important.\\" (Pg. 1177)Interestingly (for one so designedly controversial), Rushdoony avoids several controversial issues, such as the validity of charismatic gifts (pg. 337), and the \\"real presence\\" of Christ in Lord's Supper (\\"I have no intention of entering into that dispute, nor any interest in doing so\\"; pg. 738).I certainly would not recommend this book as a work of Christian Theology, or of Systematic Theology (stick with the classics, like Hodge, Strong, Berkhof, etc.); however, if one is interested in studying Rushdoony and his ideas, this book is definitely \\"essential reading.\\""},{"Title":"Systematic Theology (2 Volume Set)","review":"Just like the theology fo work, of land, of time.

Political and military branches are in a power struggle for possession it, but they all agree that Madge and Drake should work together and unravel its mysteries. Madge and Drake realize that should the device fall into the wrong hands anything could happen. Therefore, not trusting their own superiors they report only enough to keep the bosses happy while they study the machine. The machine can not only go forward and backward in our time, but it can also do so on any planet in any solar system and galaxy!When delay is no longer an option, everyone is present for the first real test. Drake is chosen to travel back in time to the year 1880, America. The trip is only a few hours for Drake. But over a year has passed when he returns. Nothing he did changed the present, however, Drake returns to find himself Brazil instead of the lab. Madge, fearing the superiors, had slightly altered the return plans so the higher-ups would believe the time device, and Drake, were lost forever. Now Madge and Drake will take full responsibility for keeping the time travel machine safe from the world, which is not ready for it. However, Madge must make one trip back in time to 1901, England. Otherwise, she may never exist! To make matters worse, the people from the future know that the machine failed to return (of course) and aliens are looking for the time travel machine.

There are no chapter numbers. Instead, each new section has a brief title, such as \\"Genworld\\" and \\"The Trial\\". It is a stand alone story, but has the potential of becoming a small series if the author so chooses. One word of advice to readers: Do not read the back of the book. It tells too much of the story and could spoil it for you. Simply open the book and begin reading.All-in-all, this is a very good book to curl up with in front of an open fire on a cold, rainy afternoon. No sub-plots to detract from the tale, just fun possibilities. This is author D.E.

And if you'd like to also read a great fictional account of \\"old Florida,\\" I highly recommend \\"A Land Remembered,\\" as it brings out the \\"Cracker\\" era of Florida in a wonderful way."},{"Title":"The New History of Florida","review":"The New History of Florida is a great read for those seeking more information about the history of Florida. The book is divided into twenty-two chapters each written by a different scholar in their field. There are bits of overlap in some of the chapters, making it a bit duplicitous, but not overly so. It does provide valuable insight on topics from the original inhabitants of the state, to becoming a US territory, to a brief modern history. This book doesn't tell the complete story of Florida, but it puts a lot of the pieces together."},{"Title":"The New History of Florida","review":"Overall this was a wonderful history of the Sunshine State. Having have lived in Florida for 10 years dating from 1990 through 2000, I had the chance to witness a lot of economic, cultural, and developmental change. The final chapter of this book was more along the lines of what I was looking for...a history of modern Florida (1920-2000). While I did enjoy the book and it was very informative, I was hoping to hear more about recent events. Development and change in the State of Florida has happened at such a rapid rate since 1950 that about three quarters of this book seemed to be about another place! I guess what I was hoping for was more detail about land development and the growth of cities: Orlando, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale and the fall of the Everglades."},{"Title":"When Nature's Not Enough: Personal Journeys through In Vitro Fertilization","review":"This book made me quite angry. In the most general critique, the writing was mediocre. On the subject, the author complained throughout the book and was incredible ungrateful. For someone who was provided with two healthy twins on her first round if IVF, she had many things to complain of including the comment \\"I will always resent my children being born via IVF.\\" I purchased this book as a resource and a means to help me through the choice of IVF and instead found a woman who cannot count her blessings and fails to see the beauty in what she and medical science has given her."},{"Title":"When Nature's Not Enough: Personal Journeys through In Vitro Fertilization","review":"I liked the idea that this book would deal with the emotional side of IVF, but the ending was just too bitter and pessimistic for me. It seems the author blames every problem with her pregnancy and babies to IVF just because she can't get over the fact that they were technically conceived outside her body. Even though one should be aware of all the difficulties of this procedure, I prefer to read something more optimistic since I am about to start this process myself and I need all the hope that I can take."},{"Title":"When Nature's Not Enough: Personal Journeys through In Vitro Fertilization","review":"I have read many books on infertility and IVF. I found this one to be poorly written. The author uses interviews with infertile couples attempting IVF. She writes word for word from their interviews. It is confusing as she jumps back and forth between their stories and her own. The writer also has a very negative attitude toward IVF even though the process helped her to have healthy twins. It seems she is trying to work out her insecurities and doubts through her writing. As I am still pursuing parenthood, it was difficult to read a \\"poor me\\" story from a woman who seems to regret IVF even though it worked a miracle times two for her."},{"Title":"When Nature's Not Enough: Personal Journeys through In Vitro Fertilization","review":"This book made me realize there is SO much more to IVF than just the procedure. My husband and I have just started down the road of IVF and by the personal accounts in the book I do feel better prepared. I never took into account all the emotions we will have to deal with on matters such as the embryo being formed outside my body. It is always good to know someone else's story who has walked in your shoes, so even the fears of a mix-up in the lab or even how an IVF mother feels more \\"delicate\\" during the start of her pregnancy, was a comfort to read.I like that the book is written about personal experiences, but like others have said it was a little hard to follow when word for word was written from conversations. Sometimes the people's thoughts jumped around so it left the reader to fill in the blanks.I really liked the book, but found the ending to be very disappointing. The author was still dealing with the emotional side of IVF when the book was written. So the last part of the book is of her negative thoughts. Even though I flew through the book it took me a couple days to finish the last chapter simply because I found it to be a downer compared to every chapter before it.I am glad I bought the book and would do so again even knowing how it ends."},{"Title":"When Nature's Not Enough: Personal Journeys through In Vitro Fertilization","review":"I bought this book prior to my own try at IVF to get an understanding of what to expect during. Boy is this woman very bitter and resentful! I hope her children never read this book when they get older! Throughout the whole book she complains about how \\"unnatural\\" the whole experience is and how she felt this someone had just put these \\"things\\" ( thats what she calls her babies) inside her. I felt so angry when I read this book! I have reread this book now that a friend is also going through IVF right now and again I was angry at the author. I went through a very similar experience with my IVF and my pregnancy with twins and never once was I bitter about the way I had to get pregnant. IVF is the most heart renching and amazing experience that I have ever gone through. I wish that it was something I didn't have to do but I would do it all over again to have my babies. She needs to get over her anger and look at what she got. she has two healthy beautiful kids on her first try at IVF, some are not so lucky."},{"Title":"When Nature's Not Enough: Personal Journeys through In Vitro Fertilization","review":"Finally, the personal side of IVF! I've read a ton from doctors and psychologists on the web, but this book really gets to normal people and their day by day experiences with IVF. I particularly like that the interviews are told in their own words. You get the whole experience from start to finish and from many different scenarios. A great resource if you're looking for answers your doctor can't give you."},{"Title":"When Nature's Not Enough: Personal Journeys through In Vitro Fertilization","review":"Authors: Diana M OlickPublisher: Lyons PressISBN: 1-59228-542-2Out of the three IVF books I was to review, this book is in the middle of the spectrum. One book was deeply personal to the writer (IVF: The Wayward Stork) and one was very clinical and matter of factly full of information on the procedure (The Couple's Guide to In Vitro Fertilization). This book has several patient stories about their trials and tribulations as an IVF patient.There is no glossary or resource guide list but it does have a very good way to touch your heart. While not every story will mirror the reader's own story or reason behind exploring IVF, but it does have several accounts so that you will seethe similarities and the differences between the individuals.At 16 chapters, it is very thorough. Out of the three, it is definitely one I'd keep near as a reference for futher questions to the IVF doctor. It is one to keep with you at each stage of your own personal journey through IVF. It is a good solid guidebook that should be on every fertility-challenged person's shelf."},{"Title":"When Nature's Not Enough: Personal Journeys through In Vitro Fertilization","review":"I found this book very helpful up until I was given then news that I did not get pregnant. In this book four couples became pregnant the first time out. One couple eventually gave up. Another couple was introduced off the cuff as the \\"try again\\" set they were not even given names, but referred to as wife and husband. It seems that a good quarter of the book is devoted to the pregnancy, which I never got to. I am glad that this book is out there. It covers the process and is helpful for positive outcomes. I did not find any solace in the negative outcome here. Also, all the couples are childless before IVF. As a person with secondary infertility, I would have liked the book to cover children during IVF."},{"Title":"When Nature's Not Enough: Personal Journeys through In Vitro Fertilization","review":"I've now read several books on IVF and this one stood out to me on a really personal level. I'm pretty well informed already on all the medical info and statistics, but this book gave me a real understanding of the emotions and the real-life situations involved in doing IVF. The author gives several different stories of couples and while none of them was my exact situation, they all touched on some of the same feelings I've had and not only offered good advice, but helped me to feel like I'm not alone. I think it was beautifully written as well, and the author, while tackling a tough subject, made me laugh. I'd recommend it if you're thinking about IVF, going through it, or even if you're trying to understand what a friend is going through."},{"Title":"Simple Sermons on the Second Coming","review":"this is a awesome book that broaches the subject of revelation in a fresh and easy to read and understand way. the book is a short one and can easily be read in a matter of a couple of hours. the reader is referred to specific scriptures throughout the book."},{"Title":"Simple Sermons on the Second Coming","review":"For the Pastor that need resource material to help in preparation for sermons, or Bible study on the Second Advent this is a wonderful resource.

It is a long but engaging story of Emma Woodhouse who lives in the fictional village of Highbury 16 miles from London. The novel is in many ways a \\"bildungsroman\\" as Emma changes and matures to win her man and a place in literary lovers' hearts.The major players in this Jane Austen classic are:Emma Woodhouse-Emma is the spoiled daughter of widower Woodhouse. She loves playing matchmaker to young couples resulting in disastrous results!Emma is flawed but lovable and good hearted.Mr. Woodhouse-One of Austen's most hilarious characters. Mr. Woodhouse is a foolish nincimpoop always worried about the temperature and catching a cold. He does not want Emma to marry since he prefers she stay home and take care of his fussbudget needs. He reminds this reviewer of a character who could have fit in well in a Dickens novel.Mr. Knightley. This wealthy landowner has been in love with Emma since she was 13. One of the charms of this comedy of manners is the conversation he engages in with Emma. He is a wise man and good judge of moral character. Emma foolishly thinks the merchant's daughter Harriet is in love with him. His name says it all for he is a knight in shining armor!Harriet Smith-Emma seeks to mate her with the odious Rev. Mr. Elton but her plans go awry with he weds the foolish Mrs. Augusta Elton. Harriet is an innocent young lady who wrongly allows Emma to advice her on matters of the heart. She will later wed the mundane farmer Robert Martin.Frank Churchill; He is the son of Mr. Weston a local landowner. Weston had married Ms. Taylor who had been the maid at Emma's home for 18 years.Frank is a charmer with a weak character. Emma is briefly infatuated by him but learns his true nature from the faithful Mr. Knightley. He is anything but frank in explaining his past amours to Emma and Harriet.Jane Fairfax is a lovely lass who has been secretly engaged to Frank Churchill. As the novel ends this pair wed. Jane is lovely but strikes this reviewer has lacking mental strength!Miss Bates-A minor character who has the gift of gab! She rattles on withlittle thought in several of the novel's chapters. I see her as an early form in English fiction of stream of consciousness monologue later mastered by such masters as James Joyce and William Faulkner.Emma is usually rated alongside \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as one of the two best novels written by Jane Austen. I enjoyed it immensely but note that there is a lot of talking and not much action. Austen liked to take a few country families and discuss a love affair or two in her narrowly focused works. She is the indisputed queen of romance fiction and is as popular today as she was when the book was published in 1816. This fall Masterpiece Theatre will be airing dramatizations of all six novels. We Janeites are a growing army of devoted fans. Jane only wrote 6 books but each is a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Genteel society in early 19th century England proved resourceful in conjuring up their own rural entertainment. Dinner parties, amateur musicales, cards, charades and balls provided indoor amusement, while picnics, local excursions or taking the waters in fancy resorts took the restless upper crust out of doors. Lacking telephones and even telegrams Austen's characters relied on local mail delivery by their servants or trusted in the efficiency of the British Post to bring detailed, epistolary news into their information-starved lives.While the men discussed politics and their farming interests, most ladies devoted great mental and verbal energy to schemes for romance-encouraging or quashing. The fair sex plotted and surmised about their neighbors and relatives'affections for one another. In true Victorian style pregnancy was hushed over, but village gossips took great delight in pondering such weighty matters as one's birth, social station and probable inheritance.In addition the whims of older relatives must be humored at all cost, since they held the of purse strings which could make or break the success of a young person's suit. Marriage after all was still more in the interest of the parents than for the sake of actual love.Twenty-one-year old Emma Woodhouse is the younger daughter and mistress of the home of her elderly father. Having recently lost her young governess/companion to marriage, Emma undertakes a new social challenge: to mentor in her turn 17-year-old Harriet-a recent graduate of a local boarding school. The plot revolves around Emma\`s subtle attempt to mold Harriet's immature heart in certain directions, indicated by insincere behavior on the part of various young men. Having frustrated what she considers an inferior proposal on Harriet's behalf, Emma gradually learns that she has meddled too much and caused needless unhappiness.Several young couples court and become engaged in the course of this light novel, but all is not as it seems on the surface, due to a secret engagement and surprising twists of Cupid's darts. Harriet's heart is easily swayed by suggestions and appearances--without direct, verbal confirmation--so it is Emma who matures the most. She has long been sensitive of the good opinion of her 31-year-old neighbor, Mr. Knightly, who on two occasions finds it necessary to reprove her thoughtless behavior. What does she care, since she has already declared that will never marry-which would mean deserting her doting butdoddering father.This novel is Austen-lite, though in extensive format (over 400 pages), with many long letters which fill in the off stage action--which proves to be wherever our Emma is Not present. The heroine's own tender heart is swayed first by this man, then by another. The advent of young persons into the village of Highbury is welcomed by local society-ever appreciative of newcomers to the social mix. Inside these pages one encounters the typical village gossips and snobs of course, who make everyone's business their private agenda. Ah, how will these impetuous young persons sort out their feelings andrelationships? Especially without antagonizing or distressing their elders? EMMA is almost a sly treatise on early Victorian social and moral restrictions, delightfully disguised as a novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Although I enjoyed the novel, I believe it is really a matter of personal preference. If you like this kind of books that don't take place in our century and are common to Austen's style (that is, long and elaborate expositions and extensive character development), then Emma is a perfect read. However, if those books are not exactly what you enjoy, then it would no longer be as captivating for you."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is a must read for Austen fans. Filled with the wit, the scandal, the light-hearted fun and the 17th century morals we have come to expect. Yet Emma is no Lizzie, and if you are expecting it to live up to Pride and Prejudice you will be disappointed. Not her best work but worth a read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I, unlike other readers, was forced to read this labouriously lengthy novel for my HSC prelimernary Related English course (fiction section). My teacher loved it and boasted about it's greatness. I was very disturbed because, I read it.....got through the first four chapters and went into a coma.... BORING! This story not only lacks any action or plot of sorts but insists on spending copious amounts of pages on meaningless blabber. I had to make a summary of the novel. It took only 1 page. My teahcer could not criticise my summary. I had covered EVERYTHING in the novel! I found Emma to be one of the most irritating characters ever created, for those who boldly state she is the greatest 'heroine', I will say, Joan of Ark was a heroine, Mary mother of Jesus was a heroine, Mother Teresa was a heroine, EMMA is a pretentios, self absorbed, controling, spoilt, BORING individual and should be left in her time and not studied in ours. In Austen's own words, &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom NO ONE BUT MYSELF will much LIKE.&quot;, Here, here!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I bought this book because my book group had chosen it for a &#34;classic&#34; read. I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time and money on this book. I could barely get through the first 50 pages or so until I gave up on it. As far as I'm concerned, the characters were worthless and their activities were pointless. Why anyone still reads Jane Austen is beyond me. If this book is an example of her writing, it is terrible! People in my book group said her other works are better but I won't be reading them."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"You must have patients to read this book. The basic story line is really good.Emma lives in Highbury and has a way of getting into everyone else's business. She's witty, popular, rich, and beautiful. If you've seen Clueless then you'll know the ending and the major points of the story.It's one of those books where when you need something to read it's there. Pride and Prejudice is better."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Yes, that's how I feel about the book. I absolutely LOVE Pride & Prejudice and Northanger Abbey, so I thougt: time to re-read Emma. And boy did I have to push myself to finish it ! Like another reviewer said: it looks like a blueprint of the movie Clueless. But less funny and al lot more boring.But maybe I'm being to harsh on Jane Austen. Not all books survive the teeth of time like Pride and Prejudice. If that is what life was like for a lot of high class girls in the early 19th century, than I am so gratefull that I'm born at the end of the 20th century !!! Miss Bates monologues were kinda funny the first few times, but after that... The same goes for Emma's father with his hypochondriac tendensies.We see Emma growing up during the book, from a spoiled girl who likes to matchmake her best friends, into a (still spoiled) woman who has given up the matchmaking after she realizes that time after time her meddeling in the love-life of other people did a lot more harm than good.Also not of this time (I hope) are the class-differences. Of course, we still have them, but it is not like they cannot mix, these days. Or that we still have those rules about visiting and inviting. or at least nog were I live."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I'm sure for some people out there, this book's a godsend, and I'm sure some people actually like Emma. Me personally, the book's not all that great, and I despise Emma. Why?, you may ask; because a) too many words, there's at least twice as many words to describe one thing as there is necessary. Yeah, so maybe I don't feel like 'hard reading' but it doesn't leave much to the imagination, and I'm a person who likes to have my imagination do the driving. The other reason I didn't particularly like the book - well, I don't get my kicks from reading about manipulative, immature women, which is my opinion of Emma. Manipulative, because she assumes it's her right to make matches, immature because she doesn't see anything wrong with it, especially when she's confronted with it. she has the 'i'm always right' feeling you'll sometimes find in a five year old. Other than that, for people who like wordy books, and as someone else said, like soaps, then read the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"This book tell us such a simple story.

The pages are uneven and look like they were cut when the blade needed changing or sharpening or cut with too many at once.I am returning it to Amazon, the only good thing is that I bought it with Amazon, they are paying for return shipping. I have to say that I am very pleased with Amazon's CS. I am a frequent customer and will continue to be."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"If you have not yet read this book, and are not a regular reader of literary fiction, be forewarned. Though Jane Austen has skyrocketed in popularity these days (what with all her novels being made into movies) do not think that what you have seen on the screen is what you will get between the book covers. Emma Thompson did not get the Oscar for BEST ADAPTATION for a screenplay for nothing (Sense and Sensibility).Contemporary readers are used to being drawn immediately into a story and kept interested by a novel's action. Emma does neither. Emma was written at a time in history when there was no film industry, television, or radio to compete with a leisurely journey through a book. For those of us born in the 20th Century, Emma is boring at times. Emma is confusing at times (did she say that or did Frank Churchill?). And Emma is sometimes too subtle for the backwoods American public to pick up on (I'm being cute, not derogatory). I personally will admit to liking the movie (with Gweneth Paltrow) better than the novel. Emma is the third Jane Austen novel I have read, and I oh, so long to feel like Meg Ryan does in &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; wondering if Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy will get together each time she reads Pride and Prejudice. But I don't. I just want to know when I'm going to be finished.And this is coming from someone who studied Shakespeare in college and found it so frustrating that I couldn't share his hilarious jokes with my roommates because they never understood them. So I'm not as uncultured as I seem (to all you Jane Austen fans).Historically, however, Jane Austen deserves to be read. Her rhythm and her magical way of putting together a sentence are things to be experienced. She deserves the place she holds in Literary History. However, a Jane Austen virgin must come to the table with that understanding. You must read for the experience, read for the erudition, and expect to push through some dialogue that runs longer than one page.As for what the book is about-- Well, read everyone else's review! :)"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Wow. I watched the movie before I read the book and just love what Jane Austen does to make this wild woman come to life."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"It was a most interesting story line.

The character has flaws that she takes a long time to realize, showing a very real situation that happens to all of us. We all become pretentious when we do something right and we tend to want to repeat feats without considering the particularities of each condition. We want to be observers without look each situation with attention and we want to be wise without learning to listen."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen's works are an extreme favorite of mine but this is not my favorite. Emma is really snobby and a meddler. Hers is not a personality I would want others to emulate but she is well meaning. Mr. Knightley is the best character of all. There are several very fun characters in this novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, author Jane Austen tells us in the very first sentence, was handsome, clever, and rich, and blessed with a happy disposition. In her first page, she suggests that the young Emma has perhaps had her own way in things too often. In her first chapter, we learn that Emma credits herself with having arranged the fortunate marriage of her governess to a wealthy neighbor, and believes herself more than ready to manage the social affairs of her hometown of Highbury.\\"Emma\\" is perhaps Jane Austen's most delicious romantic comedy, built around the match-making attempts of Miss Woodhouse, and the mangled relationships and social disasters that ensue. Although Emma means well, she ignores the advice of her good older friend Mr. Knightley to leave well enough alone, begining with her attempts to raise up the social status of her friend Harriet Smith. In the end, amid the ruins of her plans, Emma may face some difficult choices, and a fateful but priceless conversation with Mr. Knighley about her future.The comedy ripples through every chapter. Austen's supporting cast is well-chosen and well-written; this is a fun novel, and much more than a comedy of manners. Along the way, the reader will be treated to Emma's education in life, a worthwhile journey with an interesting ending. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is somewhat of a flip from Pride and Prejudice. Not as good, but still worth reading. Emma is the privileged one in her society and as she tries helping a less fortunate friend find love, she discovers that she is not as wise as she once thought. With a steady flow of characters and a great growth depiction in Emma, I just might read this again.The beginning dragged on a bit, you really have to get past 60% before anything particularly interesting happens, and I even really disliked Emma at first. However, she changes slowly (as opposed to the ever upsetting sudden growth that happens so often in other books) and even finds the classic romance of her own. Austin has a way of depicting things that describe so much more than she says. By the end I loved Emma, and even her most annoying companions. Don't read for a fast moving story, but if you want something that is relaxing and refreshing, Emma is your thing."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Beautiful Deluxe Edition!

This is one that is better in film IMHO."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I read Emma by Jane Austen. In this case, the title Emma means snobby, rude, and self centered. This meaning portrays itself throughout the book because of the way the main character, Emma, acts. This story takes place in the small town of Highbury, England in the early 1800's. This is significant because the story would have been very different if it took place in Draper, Utah in 2010. Manners and social standing would not have been as important as they were back in the 1800's. The language, dress and customs were so different back then but human nature is still the same. The protagonist of this book is Emma Woodhouse. She is a wealthy, snobby, clever girl who is content with the way her life is. The antagonist is Mr. George Knightley; a trusted friend of the Woodhouse's and is the only person Emma knows who is openly critical to her. Emma lives with her father at their estate called Hartfield. She was not interested in marriage because she feared that if she did marry, her life wouldn't be as wonderful as it was at the present time. Miss Taylor, Emma's governess however, did want to marry. Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse had a friend named Mr. Weston. Emma encouraged his visits and introduced him to Miss Taylor. After long talks and numerous dinners, Mr. Weston proposed to Miss Taylor. Emma decides she needs another project and puts her sights on her friend Harriet. Emma, over proud of her match making skills, tried to match Harriet with a man named Mr. Elton. He showed signs of really liking Harriet, but in the end he was in love with Emma instead. Emma finally realized she needed to end her career as a matchmaker after hurting many people along the way.The style of Emma is a satire of social class. Jane Austen makes fun of the importance of social propriety with her characters. For example, Emma felt that the Cole family was beneath her and wasn't willing to dine with them until she found out she wasn't invited to a party they were having, and then she wanted to go. Also Mrs. Elton was constantly made fun of because she was too informal. Jane Austen does a really good job of describing the characters and the scenery. I have a very vivid mental image in my mind of what everybody and everything looks like. The theme is \\"Love is complicated and doesn't always go as planned.\\" Emma had to learn this the hard way. I would recommend this book because it is unpredictable and even though it is set in a different time period people are essentially the same regardless of time and place. Human nature is ageless."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"When I first picked up \\"Emma,\\" I was expecting it to be as charming and alluring as Austen's well-known \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". What I found, however, was it didn't quite measure up to my expectations. Although I had high hopes for this book, and anticipated it's spectacular outcome, I wasn't as thrilled with it as I thought I would be. I found it hard to connect with Emma, the main character. At first, she seemed like a sweet young lady, caring for others and rarely found at fault. But once I learned of her snobby disposition, wealthy pride, and little care for the feelings of others, I wasn't as fond of her. Her character was set up as the stereotypical \\"snobby, rich girl\\" we think of today--one of whom makes sure to always get her way. The idea of the upper-class's success and how they are, evidently, the most intelligent of people, was the way Austen seemed to portray her character. Because of Emma's lifestyle and family setup, she was able to get most of what she wanted, most of the time. Although she wasn't always arrogant and rude, she certainly did have her flaws.Emma delighted in matchmaking, but, while doing so, didn't think of the feelings of others--which would later lead her into trouble. This \\"hobby\\" of hers often caused misunderstanding and, ultimately, ended in heartbreak. When Emma recognizes her \\"gifting\\" in this area, she uses it to her full potential. Even though she would try to turn things in the favor of those she was closest to, she often ended up in control of their lives. She went along assuming the emotions of others, when in reality, their feelings were not at all what they had seemed. Emma's assumptions led her nowhere. But, through all the distress she caused, she discovered a great deal about herself and her unrecognized love.When Emma's only mother figure in her life--Miss Taylor, the family governess--gets married and moves away, Emma becomes distraught. However, this discomfort soon gets pushed aside when Harriet comes into her life. Harriet is an orphan who becomes a friend to Emma. But, this relationship doesn't do good for either of them. Emma takes advantage of Harriet as her \\"pet\\", pulling her around and using flattery to make her do things. She puts things into Harriet's mind that aren't always true, trying to give her a hope of love.Throughout the many complicated relationships of Emma and her friends, there is one particular friend who stood beside her the entire time. He was Mr. Knightley--an old friend who steps in whenever he thinks Emma is taking things a little too far. She rarely listens to him, though, and must suffer the consequences. Even as smart as Emma was, she didn't have the intelligence to understand the feelings of others. She hardly put anyone before herself."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Thank you for the quick shipment!

Book was in condition stated, which is great!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"One of the better audiobook readings of any Austen novel. Prunella Scales is particularly fine at delineating the voices of the various characters: the forthright and sensible Mr Knightley, the self-satisfaction of Emma, the tremulous old-womanish Mr Woodhouse, and the silliness of Harriet Smith, are all definitely and exactly given utterance. The dialogue has all the crack and vivacity you could ask for.However, Scales is slightly less convincing in the author's own voice. She doesn't always fully characterize the many distinctions the author makes but her reading still remains on the happy side of neutrality because it never intrudes: it understates rather than obscures the point of Austen's writing. Even so, delicate reticence is always more welcome than brazen misreading of which, alas, many examples abound."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma\\" is a multi-layered tale of self-deception and self-discovery; as claustrophobic and at the same time as sparkling as the interior of a glass Christmas tree ornament. At one level it's a telling of the familiar \\"what you wanted was right there all along\\". But much of what we see is filtered through the thoughts of Emma - and she is such a deliciously unreliable narrator. She's clever, and knows herself to be so, which makes her (often willful) blindness about almost everything all the more delightful.In the hands of a lesser author Emma could be loathsome. Because this is Austen, we can smile at the happy ending that Emma's machinations have kept from her for so long."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Though far from my favorite Austen work, Emma is still laugh-out-loud hilarious in its ironic and witty prose and dead-on-accurate portrayal of human behavior, character, psychology, and society. Emma is certainly Jane's most social novel, dealing so greatly with class and courtship, the definitions of proper behavior and manners. It also has her most deeply flawed heroine in Emma Woodhouse, a brilliant, imaginative, yet snobbish, shallow, and socially-retarded (as in, she is oblivious to social cues) young woman who knows next to nothing about the human heart, least of all her own, yet so delights in creative matchmaking. Luckily, Emma is contrasted with Miss Bates, who knows and understands all, and her love-interest, Mr. Knightly, who tries desperately to guide her behavior. Though Emma has been criticized due to its class-consciousness and its seeming sexism (i.e. in Emma's treatment at Mr. Knightly's hands), these are unjust when Emma's character development is traced. Emma also has the distinction of boasting Jane's most charming \\"villain\\" in Frank Churchill, the gentleman who delights a little too much in deceit. Emma is absolute Jane, but certainly not my favorite (Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey come far ahead), but it's Jane. It's charming, it's thought-provoking, it's hilarious, it's introspective, it's filled with all-too familiar characters. So, what more can you ask for? Grade: A"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"This book is light-hearted and fun to read if you have a decent attention span. Emma is proud of her recent match-making success and sets out to do more. After a few awkward setbacks, she learns not to play Cupid, and that love is random and spotaneous, and can't be forced. In some places, the book can be kind of slow, but if you keep going, it gets better.

I find the language and story etc. boring. Emma, is actually the exception to that.Emma was written in the late 1800's by Austen who is known for her work Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a young woman who prides herself on setting up her friend/governess with her new husband. Emma decides to continue her matchmaking skills by taking on a new protege. Her new protege has a crush on Mr. Martin whom Emma deems as not acceptable. Emma tries to persuade Harriet's interest to others and well it is a fisaco. The first man actually likes Emma. The second man Harriet is interested in ends up being the man that Emma herself discovers she likes. Of course all ends well with all the characters getting what they deserve.It is an amusing read. The theme seems to be that although Emma in the beginning seems like a shallow, selfish girl, in the end she realizes that she was snobby and wrong and tries to rectify her mistakes. She doesn't want to hurt her friends and realizes that what she thought was best for them was wrong.If you are looking for some &quot;quality fiction&quot; or if you have a school report to write, this is an excellent book to read. you won't be bored."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Having recently read Pride and Prejudice in under a week, I expected Emma to suck me in and spit me out just as easily. It didn't. I had to work to read Emma.For starters, I didn't like Emma, the character, very much in the beginning. She came off as stuck on herself and very know-it-all. But, I was determined to give her a chance b/c a friend of mine named her daughter Emma for this book. So, I trudged on, and did begin to like the girl. I also read the commentary on the book and constantly compared it to scenes from Clueless (since Clueless is a modern-day Emma).The story dragged on a lot longer than I normally would be comfortable with, but once I got into a good pace for reading, that was fine. More than anything, I just wanted to know what was going on with Jane Fairfax. The outcome was very welcome, and I enjoyed Emma's love-life conclusion.It was a very enjoyable book, though I wouldn't call it &quot;the most perfect of Jane Austen's perfect novels,&quot; as was written on the inside flap of the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"In Jane Austen's Emma, there is an abundance of irony that can clearly be seen. This can be seen in several parts of the book, and is at work throughout it. One example is the web woven between Emma Woodhouse, Mr. Elton, and Harriet Smith. Another is Frank Churchill's secret engagement to Jane Fairfax. Yet another is Mr. Knightley and Emma being in love. Austen usesirony expertly to keep us, the readers, guessing.Austen's use of irony between Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Emma is obvious. She uses it when Emma paints a portrait of Harriet for Mr. Elton. Referring to the portrait, Mr. Elton says, \\"\`Letme entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend'\\"(38). There is verbal irony and situational irony in this because Mr. Elton was intending to compliment Emma's artistic skills, but both Emma and Harriet took it as a compliment to Harriet's beauty. Mr. Elton also sends a riddle that indicated he wanted to court Harriet when all along he intended to court Emma.There was very apparent irony in a entanglement between Emma, Jane, and Frank. We think that Emma and Frank are meant for eachother and will end up together. There is a considerable amount of flirtation between Emma and Frank, and, at one point, Emma fancies herself in love with him. All along though, Frank is involved in a secret engagement with Jane.Lastly, and probably the most significant, is the irony of Emma and Mr. Knightley being in love with eachother all along. Austen strategically refrains from telling us he is in love with her and Emma never knew she was in love with Mr. Knightley. Their love is portrayed to be of a brother and sister. It is ironic that while Emma is trying to set up all her friends, she is unaware of her own love for Mr. Knightley.The irony in Emma is necessary to create the confusion that makes this book so splendid. With all the irony throughout the book it makes it almost impossible for the reader to realize whatis actually going on. This adds to the surprise ending. How Austen uses irony makes her a great writer and her book worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is not such an easy read. The plot is enough to cure anyone's insomnia.But if you really think about it you can get alot out of it about human character. Funny enough Austen never married as Emma planned to never marry and both for the same reason. They wan't to stay and take care of their fathers.I particulary liked the character Miss Bates. She was a very realistic character. Where ever you go there will always be a Miss Bates and a Miss Fairfax. Well, the book was certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Unlike some of Austen's other famous works, EMMA centers around a beautiful young woman, quick and clever. Though at twenty-one, she is sitting a bit high on the fence as regards marriage, this is of little importance. Emma the character professes not to desire marriage. This is a decision of privilege, and one that is not seen much in many female characters appearing in novels of this time. The reason Emma has the luxury to refuse marriage is not her strong will or great intelligence, it's her great fortune. Emma need not marry because she does not need the money and thus security that a husband would usually bring a woman of lesser fortune and social status. Emma will inherit from her father, and she already enjoys a high position in society. It is therefore not necessary that she marry for any reason beyond love, and when we first meet Emma, we find her skeptical of love and determined to progress slowly into old maidenhood. Long before Maslow developed his Hierarchy of Needs in the field of psychology, Jane Austen understood intuitively that one had to remove physiological need and want before one could get to the greater things of life, like love and self-fulfillment. The beauty of Austen's setting and the social status of her characters, is that since the accumulation of wealth by any one character is virtually a given, and that to speak of money directly is an almost unpardonable social error, these characters are freed to go about their vain, frivolous lives completely unencumbered by thought of where the next meal will come from, or whether or not it is prudent to send one's child to school or to keep him at the farm. Actually working for one's living is definitely unfashionable, and the best position to have is one where you've accumulated so much wealth that you can sit on your estate, live off the interest and not discuss how much money you have or where it came from. True, social status counts for much, and much of social status is determined by the amount of money in one's bank account-but the greater determinant of social rank lies in birth. The daughter of a character with little money but a good name might still be a good catch. The daughter of character who has amassed a great fortune, but done it in some vulgar way or not married well is not such a good catch. In either case, it is not really the amount of money one has, but one's position on the social ladder that Austen wants us to pay attention to.As usual, Austen addresses her characters with great wit. Of her title character in EMMA, Austen wrote \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\\" and sets about doing her best to fulfill this prediction. From the first, Austen seems to regard her character with a smirk and a wink. Within the first few paragraphs she is characterized as \\"handsome\\" and \\"clever\\", yes, but Austen also speaks \\"of the real evils of Emma's situation,\\" namely \\"the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself.\\" Yet it is clear that by the end of the novel Emma's character will have changed from one of vain frippery to that of a good, noble woman, modest and sure of her true responsibilities. You always know how an Austen novel will end before you even start it; the fun is in GETTING that far. EMMA is no different. An excellent read for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read. The way Jane Austen displays Emma is funny.

Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Lovable Emma Woodhouse, Pretty, bright, and rich, not to mention a little mischievious.

Her Emma is so clueless, so innocent, yet somehow loveable. I finally decided to pick up the classic novel to see if the movie missed anything and to get the full story straight from the author. The book delighted me just as much as the movie did, as I am pleased to say.Emma Woodhouse is a young, rich woman living with her germaphobe father in the town of Highbury. Bored and eager for some sort of excitement, she decides to matchmake her new friend Harriet Smith with the local vicar Mr.Elton. Emma is convinced that her matchmaking skills are among the best, wrongly taking credit for pairing her governess Miss Taylor with their neighbor Mr.Weston. Many mishaps occur, and many hearts broken and confused, but in the end all is well, with all three of the main couples finding happiness.It took me a little while to get in the vocabulary of the time, but once I did the book breezed by.

Oh wait, perhaps most important is the love story--or love stories--that touch the readers' hearts. Or at least touched mine. All of those elements are there, and so I enjoyed the book. While not my favorite book of Austen's, Emma is far from my least favorite (ahem, Mansfield Park)."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I have always loved \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and wanted to expand into more of Austen's works. This one did not disappoint! It is a fantastic tale with all the usual Austen humor and wittiness that work so well in her stories! In fact, it is now up there with \\"Sense\\" as my favorite Austen work!\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"The first sentence in the novel really sets the stage for all the mistakes the main character makes throughout! This novel tells the story of Emma Woodhouse, a privileged young lady who, with nothing else to occupy her time, loves matchmaking among her friends. She loves it so much that she doesn't pay any attention to her true love right under her nose! Of course things don't go the way Emma would like and there are the usual misunderstandings but things work out in the end and everyone ends up with who they are destined to be with.This had been called one of Austen's best works and I can agree with that. I really loved this story. This certainly is the \\"lightest\\" of Austen's novels as you will not find any lives ruined or huge scandals that ruin reputations. It is simply (and wonderfully so) the story of a small, English village where the inhabitants really have nothing substantial to occupy their time; none more so than Emma. I think one of the things Austen is so marvelous at is her ability to really focus on her characters and their everyday lives and none of her novels do this as well as Emma. As there is no serious \\"action\\" the story must therefore focus on everyday occurrences. You could call this a comedy of manners as the characters revolve within a very strict code of behavior and etiquette where everything should move along very smoothly but of course, because of meddling (mainly Emma's) things always go completely wrong! The novel is full of the usual, heavy Austen dialogue and description which I'm sure can get tedious for some readers (I did find myself skimming over some of Miss. Bates' extended ramblings) but, as in her other novels, it does not get in the way and can really help the reader come to terms with a time very foreign from our own. Many modern readers find the \\"elitist\\" attitudes in Austen's books a turn off and condemn the novels. However, Austen is not intending to make these attitudes seem wonderful; if some readers would look closer they would realize that she is really satirizing these attitudes and showing them for the silliness they really were. The main character, Emma, can be a bit annoying at times, but she is so open about her own faults and weaknesses that its hard to dislike her. In fact, you do see her acknowledging in several places her mistakes and is able to laugh them off and learn from them. Austen herself said that Emma was a character that nobody would really like but herself; I disagree.Yes, she can come across as snobbish, arrogant, and overly conscious of her place in society but what can you expect from a girl who has been raised by a doting father and governess? Mixed with those slightly irritating qualities, though, is a sweetness and a true desire to be helpful which really makes her endearing. I highly doubt Emma's personality is that much different from other young ladies of the time. I think the true shining star in this novel, though, is Mr. Knightley, Emma's close friend and true English gentleman (supposedly this was Austen's favorite hero as well and created her ideal gentleman in him; his name is no accident). He is kind and thoughtful, witty and intelligent, but blunt and always ready to bring Emma back down to Earth. Their bantering back and forth is really charming. I only wish we knew more about Mr. Knightley's background and that we could see more of him in the novel! The rest of the characters in the novel are all brilliantly drawn and even though they are not the focus of the story, you come to know them as well as the two mains: the eccentric and hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, sweet and naive Harriet Smith, the kind Westons, slightly foppish Frank Churchill and the very reserved Jane Fairfax, the kindly Miss. and Mrs. Bates, and the exceedingly arrogant Eltons.This is a wonderful and delightful story and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a light and charming story about a slightly flawed but kind young lady (and who among us is not flawed?) who, through a series of blunders, grows and matures. It is also a humorous story poking fun at the strict code of behavior and the social classes of the day."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen's novel Emma has been well known since it's publishment. In the 90's, a successful chick-flick movie, Clueless was based on this novel. Even though the movie does not in any way depict the intelligence of Jane Austen, it serves the main characters' personalities. The book by far was absolutely and brilliantly written while easy to understand in fairly relatable modern English. This book is a great read for literature analysts because it serves a wide variety of character traits within their society. It can also be used to analyze the socio-economic stereotypes and lifestyles of their time. The plot and storyline were at a consistent pace with a surprising climax and turn towards the end. Because it is a love story, it does follow the usual typical love story scenes. However, love is depicted differently by each couple and character, which sets it apart from other cinderella-like stories, which were popular during that time period. It is a very relaxing book -- not an intense read. It is also a classic even though not as widespread or as known as other Austen's novels such as Pride and Prejudice. It is definitely a recommanded read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Many literary critics have proclaimed Emma to be the most accomplished of Jane Austen's novels. That may well be, but I don't personally number it among my favorites. That said, it easily deserves its five-star rating; I haven't read an Austen novel yet that doesn't.Emma is, of course, the story of beautiful, young, wealthy and accomplished Emma Woodhouse. Of her, too many kindnesses can not be said. At least, that is the attitude displayed by everyone around Emma. She's heard nothing but praise and exaltations her entire life, and has come to quite believe her own billing. And while she generally means well, Emma has grown into an unforgivable busybody and snob.Emma lavishes most of her attentions on her dear friend Harriet Smith. While Harriet is of a lower status and desirability than Emma herself, Emma feels confident she can improve upon Harriet, introduce her to all the right society, in short, make her a most advantageous match. Never mind the perfectly nice farmer who is already in love with her.And so, Emma insinuates herself into the affairs of Harriet and several others around her. She is certainly not the most sympathetic of Austen's heroines and my feelings about her tended to fluctuate from chapter to chapter. Nevertheless, no conflicted feelings got in the way of the joy brought about by a patented Austen ending. Additionally, Austen proves yet again that humor based on an intimate knowledge of human nature is timeless. I defy you not to laugh over the antics of Emma's possessive and gruel-loving father. Austen's social satire is as sharp as it ever was."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Her mother has died and she lives with her father and her governess. Her family is at the very top of social standings in town, and Emma is all too aware of it. The starting point is her governess's engagement to a good man, which Emma imagines she has engineered by herself. Consequently, she thinks she is the ideal matchmaker, and makes this \\"skill\\" her vocation, which creates all sorts of intrigues, equivocations, and comical situations for all the unfortunate people who surround her, especailly her young and poor protege, Harriet, whom she corners into rejecting a decent fellow in order to get her someone \\"better\\", someone she will be able to receive at her home. So, Emma becomes trouble, and the initial success is hard to repeat. Emma proclaims that she will never marry, as her role in life is only getting other people to marry, besides the fact that she must take care of her old father. Who, by the way, is an unsympathetic, hypocondriac, complaining, and blackmailing man, who has utterly spoiled Emma. Her elder sister, by contrast, is married to a rich banker and lives in London. The rest of the characters is also very well rounded, especially the family friend Mr. Knightley, who is always lecturing Emma about her meddlesome habits; Mrs. and Miss Bates, a couple of neighbors who are poor but close to the family (Miss Bates speaks constantly and erratically, which makes many people avoid her), and the unlikable Elton and Frank Churchill, who Emma believes is in love with her.The book is funny and written with the mastery of Austen, who manages as always to create a closed world, bounded by very strict rules of conduct and prejudice, in an ecnhanting setting. Emma is definitely a spoiled brat, kind but arrogant, and her delusion about matchmaking unbearable, but nevertheless she is an attractive character, and her youth makes the reader forgive her faults."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"While this novel is certainly a cut above most modern fiction, Emma is not Austen's best work. In contrast with Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey's tight narrative structures, Emma is long and rambling. The narrative presents many insignificant details even as it leaves out more important scenes. For example, we are privy to several examples of Miss Bates' idle chatter, but Harriet's capture by the gypsies and Robert Martin's proposal happen offstage. Although Miss Bates is supposed to be a lovable character, I found myself putting the book down during one of her conversations and not returning to it for several months (which is unusual, as I read Northanger Abbey in a day).Nevertheless, the novel does have its redeeming features. Several people have noted that they disliked Emma's snobbishness, but we're not meant to adore her, and the author gently pokes fun at her elitism. Prior to the book's publication, Austen wrote that she feared no one else would love Emma as much as she did, so the protagonist is not intended to be a likeable character. Her flaws balance out her good traits, such as her wit and liveliness. Her dialogues with Mr. Knightley and even Harriet contain subtle zingers that may not be readily apparent to a 20th century reader the first time around. If you think you didn't like this book, you will appreciate it more on a second reading (and you can always skim the boring parts, like poor Miss Bates!). You will learn a great deal about the classist ideology lurking beneath Regency Britain's prim veneer. And if nothing else, reading with the intent to pick up on the characters' oblique but witty repartee will help you sharpen your own wit and social skills."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I think Emma is a sparkling, witty and engaging story that beats a lot of modern works hands down.

I am 18 years old and have read this book several times, surprisingly enough before any films were released, and can honestly say that it was my favorite novel ever written. Obviously those who only gave it one or two stars are more at home reading such low class literary works as Stephen King novels, which certainly have more excitement but don't actually require any real thought. I don't believe that the responses of such people to real literary works would really have any true value in my opinion since they quite apparently have no real intelligence or taste in literture whatsoever. My advice to such people would be to avoid real books and to stick to what they are actually capable of understanding."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I've always been a fan of the British actress Prunella Scales and already own some of her readings of classic novels, including Cranford which she handles delightfully.So it was a big disappointment to find that she seems to have completely misjudged her narration of Emma. One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"In the constricted world of Jane Austen's EMMA, there is a general lack of a sense that anything exists beyond that which Emma can see or Austen can relate. Emma, her family, and friends live either in the small town of Hartfield or its equally miniscule environs. The action of the novel is more or less coterminous with the very real events of the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, or even just some whooping and hollering of some village bad boys. This smallness of space is matched by a smallness of psychological depth. Austen tacitly assumes that good is ubiquitous, and where good seems to be lacking, its normal contrary is not evil at all. Those who show a deficiency of good either are merely mischievous or are incapable of doing no more than sputtering about their evil. Further, those who sputter do so in isolation and do not seriously disrupt the social order. They are neither punished nor remorseful. In the interactions among the characters, Austen in EMMA makes a marked change in the basic makeup of her cast. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, for example, she shows only the landed gentry. But here, Austen presents a definite variation in character. It is this wider cast of type that allows Austen to play the magician and make the reader think that Austen's world is bigger than it is. And at the center of this static world is Emma herself, who, in the canon of Austen, is the heroine only in the broadest sense of the word.For the first time in any of her novels, Austen gives the reader a heroine who has numerous grievous faults. Emma is a young headstrong woman who comes across as a huge snob. Emma describes Mrs. Elton, who is more purposeful in her mischief, as \\"self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred.\\" Emma might as well have been talking about herself. Readers who note Emma's genteel manner allow that surface patina of gentility to suggest that there is a basic difference between her and Mrs. Elton. This difference is more a matter of degree than in kind. In her harsh treatment of Harriet Smith and disparagement of Jane Fairfax, Emma is more than thoughtless; she is downright sadistic. The best that can be said for her is that in the benevolent atmosphere of Jane Austen, nastiness is not permitted to materially affect the outcome. Those who are nasty are rendered impotent in their nastiness, like Mrs. Elton, or are allowed to improve by degrees through a slow process of self-realization, like Emma. And it is this growing understanding of Emma's own faults that is at heart the theme of the book. The plot, which is really an incredibly contorted series of misunderstandings based mostly on Emma's constant misapprehensions of who loves whom, is the hook by which the theme comes into play. Regardless of who tries mightily to set things aright, the only one who can teach Emma to look inwardly for wisdom is Emma herself. The comedy that results from all these miscalculations sets up the satire which arises from the contrast between the way Emma misreads relationships and the way that the readers do not. Despite the fact that some readers complain that the smallness of setting renders the smallness of the morality as insignificant is to misunderstand why each new generation of reader finds Emma to be an uplifting vision of the regeneration of a woman that is probably not unlike many of her readers."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Had this story been written in a more contemporary style, my review would have been totally favorable.

How can one stand a hero or heroine who is never, ever wrong? We'd rather have someone like Emma, who, for all her flaws, or maybe because of them, is a delightful creature. She's a hopeless busybody, meddling and interfering in everyone's lives, too much the lady of the manor for her own good; but she means nothing but everyone else's good. Unlike Austen's other heroines who are barely in the leisure class like Elizabeth Bennet or one step away from poverty like Fanny Price, Emma Woodhouse is comfortably well-off; she doesn't need a husband to support her because she'll inherit a fortune from her widowed father, so she's free to cheerfully attempt to marry everybody else off according to her own inclinations. And her main project is her friend Harriet, the child of an unknown father (an enormous social stigma in early 19th-century England), whom she attempts to pair off with a snooty, social-climbing vicar, unable to see the damage she is doing to both. Fresh from one blunder, Emma races headlong into another, and yet another, until you want to yank her chain and bring her up short. And she almost undoes her own self when the man she realizes she has loved all along, her neighbor Mr. Knightley, begins to see potential in Harriet himself.We know the mess is going to get sorted out sooner or later; Austen has a genius for untangling messes and getting everybody back on the right track, but it's fun to watch Emma racing from one hairbrained scheme to the next and getting caught in the traps of her own devising. And we like her none the less for it. Because Emma, wrongheaded as she often is, doesn't have a mean bone in her body. She genuinely wishes everyone well, even though it's on her terms. It takes an older, wiser and more experienced head like Knightley's to help her see the error of her ways. Knightley is the perfect foil for Emma, with a wit and intelligence as sharp as her own, but providing maturity and stability to balance her free-floating exuberance.&quot;Emma&quot; is not Austen's best work; just as Emma is a somewhat airheaded creature, &quot;Emma&quot; lacks the depth of Austen's later books such as &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Emma, along with Elinor Dashwood and Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my three favorite Austen heroines, but Emma lacks the insight and maturity of the other two. Too often acts without thinking, but it's just this quality that makes her so endearing at times, even while it makes her so aggravating. Emma is probably Austen's most humanly fallible heroine, and maybe that's why we like her so much. Perfection is for gods and saints; Emma is for real."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I must admit, I had really high hopes for this novel.

Having practically memorized P&P; and Persuasion as a child, I found this near impossible to believe, especially as I couldn't get into Emma's dense text. Well, it's been 7 years hence and I'm eating my words. Emma is by far Austen's greatest literary achievement. The style and language and overall concept display her restraint and command as an author. Every word is perfectly chosen and placed - a brilliant feat that doesn't excite, but soothes the soul. The work isn't quite as plot-driven as P&P;, or even S&S;, and everything revolves around the ingenue, Emma Woodhouse. If there was such a thing as an epic about one simple person, Emma would be it.Love her or hate her, Emma is quite a creation. She's somehow both the heroine and anti-heroine, sincerely generous and wildly selfish, preternaturally poised and childishly weak. While Emma is not spared when she is wrong, it's very clear that Austen loves her - the sharpness of her satiric voice is soften by the overall tone of complacency and fondness. Never do you worry that Emma will turn out badly.In addition to the remarkably controlled and polished language and structure, Austen's voice is more in evidence here than in any other novel, much to her credit. The lack of a precise plot, makes the author's tone much more important - you feel with Emma, while also being able to judge her. Austen inhabits Emma's head, giving you her particular slant on things (with remarkable nonchalance and neutrality), but also looks at the world of Highbury at large, giving you the chance to also see things as they actually are (and gently laughing at Emma's egocentricity). Emma isn't the darling Elizabeth Bennet is, but neither is she so nearly one-dimensional. Elizabeth is a latter-day Emma - too right, too cool, too witty. Emma is more graceful, but human, conflicted, young. Sometimes seeing a character's gradual growth is a worth more than watching her get from Point A to Point B.The lesser characters set off Emma as the heroine more than her own actions do. They are seen as the typical flawed humans, who will stay irredeemably mediocre. Emma isn't really as perfect as she thinks she is, but she can and will grow beyond her immaturity. It's abundantly clear that Elton, Mrs. E, and even Harriet will never do so. As for the character who spouts off the mind-numbing chatter in all Austen's works, Miss Bates is the best of the bunch. What is amazing is how logically it all flows together. Genius.Emma is a princess, a do-gooder, a child-woman becoming a woman. While Emma is a bit hard to love, she is Austen's ideal: warm, sincere, graceful, teachable, and thinking. Her counterpart in her metamorphosis is Mr. Knightley. He's the everyman version of Darcy's integrity and presence, but approachable, wise, eloquent, and practical. His semi-role as Emma's teacher bothers some readers, but given their difference in age and experience, it's only natural. After all, he can't still be learning life's lessons at his age, unlike the young group in P&P.; All in all, Emma will be appreciated by readers who care about authorial voice and respect her more mature grasp of language. It's really quite impossible to compare P&P; and Emma - so to avoid disappointment, I don't recommend fixating on a rehash of a boy-meets-girl plot. This story is richly told and is most definitely about the girl."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Lively, vivid rendition of my favourite Jane Austen novel. Prunella Scales interprets the characters with great individuality and spirit."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"EMMA is a joyful read, made even more entertaining through Prunella Scales's vocalization of several characters and through her interpretation of the text. Her complementary pace actually improves the listeners' appreciation of Austen's comedic plot. Austen's novels, a treasure any time, are given a fine aural performance by Ms. Scales."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma by Jane Austen is truly a very enjoyable novel dealing with the upper-middle class women of the Victorian Era, and it gives us an illuminating insight on the way of life of the people of that time. Emma is a comedy in the sense that the novel ends on a happy note with three marriages and also in the sense that it gives themes such as marriage an exaggerated importance. Also, the novel as a whole in conceived in a spirit of irony - irony in incidents and irony in characterisation. In the novel, Jane Austen depicts her view of people as social animals who live by a social code based on a set of moral values. Thus, in Emma, Jane Austen shows, in a good-natured way, the disastrous consequences caused by human follies and stupidities, leading to the violation of the social code.The very fact that Emma is looking for \`would-be' grooms for girls she takes a fancy to is undoubtedly a trespass of the social norms existing at that time - a clear example of a folly. Emma's other folly may be said to be her excessive pride. Her pride leads her to dominate, and to see the lives of others as extensions of her own ego, and therefore deny the other characters their human autonomy. Ironically, we see that she, who delights in using others, discovers that she, in turn, has been used, or more correctly, duped.Emma also deals with the follies of arrogance and self-deception. While reading the novel, we find Emma adopting what may be called a \`know-all' attitude. She is utterly self-important and presuming. She pays no heed to Mr. Knightley's advice either with regard to Mr. Elton or with regard to Frank Churchill. She thinks that she can successfully handle the affairs of others, and the high regard the Highbury society has for her only makes matters worse. Hence, through the character of Emma, Austen warns against the dangers of influence and interference. Emma, through her actions of meddling in everybody's affairs, finally achieves nothing good, and even causes harm to her own self.Also, Austen gives marriage such an undue importance that the title character, in her pursuit of husbands for others, overlooks social norms existing at that time and gives more value to marriage rather than crucial human relationships. Thus, in a comic way, Austen depicts Emma's greatest fault in breaking social norms and overlooking crucial human considerations in pursuit of petty things such as marriage.Comedy also emanates from the narrator's treatment of Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Bates as \\"comic characters\\". But through these characters, Austen explores another facet of human follies. Through the character of Mr. Woodhouse, we are brought to see the negative aspects of indulgence - indulgence of the same kind that has caused harm to Emma. And the character of Miss Bates, while depicting the pitiable state of unmarried women, acts as a kind of test for Emma's power of responding to \`socially inferior' people. Mrs. Elton is another comic character, amusing us greatly by her airs of self-importance and her social snobbery. She has too high an opinion of her own elegance, accomplishments, and social charm that she thrusts herself upon everybody without inhibition or hesitation. She also breaks the established social rules by calling Mr. Knightley \\"Knightley\\", not giving him his gentleman's worth. In fact, we may say that Mrs. Elton is used to portray the very evils of Emma's character in a somewhat extreme way.Hence, as we have seen, Austen deals in an intellectual way the follies and stupidities of humans. We learn particularly through our understanding of Emma's faults, and by learning above all, how significant and fundamental these values are. For Emma's aloof relation to others, her willingness to treat other characters as toys - these become significant betrayals of human considerations. The social and moral universe of the novel takes a greater significance because it provides a context in which Emma's faults are not minor ones to be treated lightly, but total violations of a whole established system. The agents of retribution in this world are Mr. Knightley and Austen herself as the narrator.Thus, Austen condemns certain human foolishness such as snobbery, excessive pride and a disrespect for established moral and social values. These are the human stupidities which are purged, through Emma's process of self-analysis and redemption. It is only at that time that Austen makes her heroine rise above such human foolishness and stupidities to become a more moral and less petty human being. Hence, it may be said that the novel persuades us, through a very entertaining and comic plot, the importance of self-knowledge, a true regard for self and others, and also to consider every human action as a crucial, committing act of self-definition."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen said of Emma Woodhouse (in a letter) that she had written a novel with a heroine \\"whom no one would like but myself\\". Indeed the first sentence (another sterling first sentence by Austen. How does she do it?) paints a picture that is easily understood as a spoilt little rich girl:\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich, with a comfortable house and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"At the same time we have to disagree with Miss Austen. Readers have fallen in love with Emma (both novel and heroine) since the novel was published, and with good reasonRonald Blythe states in his introduction to the 1966 Penguin Classics edition of \\"Emma\\" that it is \\"the climax of Jane Austen's genius and the Parthenon of fiction.\\" I do not dispute it for a second. This novel is my favourite work from my favourite author.The book has a plot so timeless than even translating it to modern day Hollywood and casting Alicia Silverstone in the lead still gets you a hit movie, Clueless. OK, it's obvious from the first chapter who is destined to marry Emma but our dashing hero, Mr Knightley, is still the only person who ever criticises Emma, indeed he spends a large part of his time in the novel telling either Emma or her friends about her flaws.Austen wrote to her niece Anna (writing a novel at the time) that \\"Three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on\\" and stayed close to this for most of her own works. Yet at the same time, in a letter to her brother Edward (another incipient novelist) she played down her concerns as \\"the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush, as to produce little effect, after much labour.\\" 'Emma' is certainly the novel on the smallest piece of ivory with the finest brush, yet it pokes as much fun and wields as savage a knife on the social conventions of Austen's England as any other novelist of the time.Austen was capable of writing novels with genuine popular appeal at the same time as she flouted the conventions of fiction. 'Emma' is a marvellous example, an easily read, enjoyable novel with a heroine who is in charge of her own destiny and who marries for no other reason than she loves a good, strong man.Everyone deserves to read a novel this good. Just because teenage girls will adore this novel and swoon over Mr Knightley doesn't mean the rest of us should be stopped from this marvellous read. I enjoy Austen immensely and this is my favourite. I probably read it once or twice a year.When you come to choosing the edition I once again find myself recommending the Penguin Classics edition for its Introduction. This time it is Fiona Stafford who does such a good job (though I think the '66 edition Introduction by Ronald Blythe was a fraction better.)"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"The present novel is about the young women, Emma Woodhouse, who lives a pampered life with her father in Sussex. The family is well off financially and one of the wealthiest in Hartfield, part of Highbury. Her mother has passed away and her sister has married and left the home. Emma's governess, who is her best friend as well, has gone leaving Emma alone with her father. The story revolves around Emma's social life in the town and the development of Emma as a person. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the four novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.From what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and by way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" The read is slow and a bit diffuse since there is no clear set of protagonists other than Emma, her brother-in-law, her reserved father and a few other residents of the town. The novel wanders for 350 pages, then comes together strongly at the end. Overall, it is a delightful and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book at all. It is a very good read, in a very standard binding. You get a good introduction to it and some nice notes which are helpful.This is set in contemporary times to Austen, and was the heroine which Austen least liked. Emma Woodhouse is young, rich and single. She lives a life of wealth and privilege in a small village just outside of London. In her world, and in her village she is queen. However there are flaws in her character which will be tested.Austen liked to write about small things, about daily life, and the petty things which people in small communities become obsessed with. And so into Emma's life come the scatter-brained Harriet Smith the daughter of \\"someone\\" who cobbles together what learning she might at a local ladies academy. Emma adopts her and tries to help her make her way in the world by finding her a good match.Emma's fine world is disrupted when first Mr Elton moves to the village, and then marries a rather smart but upstart woman who wishes to manage everyone's life.Austen's skill in reflecting Emma and her machinations for good, against Mrs Elton and her machinations for her own good are gloriously done.Emma is a brilliant novel and its themes are universal and timeless, it is all about the things in life which never change - love, pride, marriage, status and money.Don't watch dreadful movie adaptations of this book (like the one Gwyneth Paltrow did) the book is much sharper, wittier and subtler. It is greatly enjoyable reading. The introduction may (or may not) help you to greater understanding of her ability to write with a light, sharp pen. Hopefully the story will stand out for its brilliance."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"i had to read this for my english sophmore highschool class and while most of my peers *hated* this book, i found this book very intriguing and esp. realistic to even today in highschool. the subjects of vanity, friendship, honesty, control, reality, self-desire, relationships, status, and maturity is all incorporated in this book and deeply and straight-forwardly depicts the life of any teenager in any century then or now. Emma struggles to understand her intentions and learns what her mistakes were all about and the reader sees her mature through experiences and constantly learning and realizing her mistakes and flaws and misconceptions. though it was a long story and had a lot of old-language narration, i have to say, Emma is part of the epitome of what ever teenager goes through, female and male. while this is mostly a chick book, guys can find themselves related to the situations that Emma deals with with the other men in the book. i highly recommend this book for people who have patience and are open to the ideals of aristocracy back then. it's amusing, witty, and shocking. really great book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I'm in the fellowship of the \\"unashamed.\\" That is, I'm a whole-hearted MALE fan of all things Austen. It all began when I found my daughter's dusty college copy of Emma from our library because I was bored and could not find anything else to read. After struggling through the first 100 pages and trying to make sense of Miss Austen's enormous character list, I was hooked. What hooked me? First and formost was the very intertwined plot, much like a romantic \\"whodunit\\" or \\"who's gonna do it\\" mystery. The plot thickens with subtle clues as to who loves whom and the comedy surrounding the heroine's naive' and fumbling attempts to become a matchmaker to anyone in her circle that is marriage material. Never in my life have I read such succulent and appropriate dialogue. I was so enthralled I literally roared through the book to find out what was going to happen next. A second reading is mandatory for the first-timer because part of Miss Austen's genius is that a more deliberate reading mines the depths for the clues that lie beneath the surface of the story. Like the tip of an iceberg, the reader can storm through the book and enjoy it thoroughly; then do a re-read and luxuriate on how much richness and delicate detail lie below the surface. I was so caught up that I found myself talking to the characters alternately encouraging them and warning them on what they were scheming. The heroine Emma is one of the most charming, yet frustrating heroines in all of English literature. Give it a \\"go\\" as the English would say!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I found this book extremely interesting, and it held a very unique story line, which seems at times hard to come by in many recently published books. I enjoyed the main character, Emma, whose character was so incredibly... fun, (mainly) mature, rommantic, and exciting all in one.

No matter what she narrates, her voice weaves a golden web, entrapping the listener with great charm and ease.Shaw's narration of Emma is no exception.

You hear Mr. Knightly chide Emma for her recklessness and &quot;poor Miss Taylor&quot; speculate that Miss Fairfax and Mr. Knightly are &quot;a couple.&quot; Their voices come alive entrancingly.Austen's story is wonderful to read, but Fiona Shaw makes it an even greater treat to listen to. I give her narration the highest possible recommendation. Here's to more from Ms. Shaw!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"EMMA, Jane Austen's fourth novel was published in 1815 and dedicated to the Prince Regent, later King George IV. Austen privately abhorred the Regent for the treatment of his wife Princess Caroline and his dissipated lifestyle. In 1813 she wrote to her friend Martha Lloyd, \\"I suppose all the World is sitting in Judgement upon the Princess of Wales's Letter. Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman, & because I hate her Husband.\\" She did however recognize the value of his name and agreed to the dedication. Upon publication EMMA also had its own share of critics. What impressed early readers was not that it lacked energy and style, but that its story was dull and uneventful. Even Austen's famous publisher John Murray thought it lacked \\"incident and romance\\" and Maria Edgeworth, a contemporary author so greatly admired by Austen that she sent her one of the twelve presentation copies allotted by her publisher, could not read past the first volume and thought \\"there was no story in it.\\" Ironically, what these two prominent and well read individuals attributed as a weakness is actually EMMA'S greatest strength.If one looks beyond the surface, EMMA is an intricate story focused on the astute characterization and social reproof which Austen is famous for. Emma Woodhouse is a complex character that on first acquaintance is rather a pill. Austen gave herself a great challenge in creating \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like.\\" In contrast with her other heroines, Miss Woodhouse does not have any social or financial concerns and thus no compelling need to marry. Therein lives the rub. We have no sympathy for her whatsoever. She's rich, she's spoiled and she's stuck up. Who indeed could possibly like such a \\"troublesome creature\\"? During the course of the novel we witness her exerting her superior notions of who is suitable for whom as she match makes for her friends with disastrous results. It is no wonder that Maria Edgeworth gave up reading EMMA after the first volume. At that point we have met most of the characters in Emma's insular world and are coming to fully understand her ignorance and misguided perceptions in relation to them. She is truly exasperating. Austen tests our endurance fully as the novel progresses and her heroine continues to make mistakes. It is a testament to her skill as a writer and deft comedian that she holds our fascination with the \\"busy nothings\\" of every-day country life in Highbury, a small village filled with endearingly flawed characters. The transformation of the heroine from spoiled and insufferable into a contrite, mature and likeable young lady that you want to root for, is nothing less than remarkable. It is truly a shame that Edgeworth could not recognize the genius of Austen's sly sashay of characterization into a world that could be your own neighborhood. We can only account that, \\"One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\"If you liked the new BBC/PBS miniseries Emma (2009), enjoy the original novel with all of Austen's resplendent language in this expertly produced audio recording. Read by acclaimed British actress Juliet Stevenson, viewers of the 1996 movie adaptation of EMMA will remember her superb portrayal of the vulgar a vacuous Mrs. Elton and know you are in for a treat. Adding equal measure of energy and humor to each of the characters, Stevenson's perfect blending of a classic novel and a sensitive interpretation enhanced my enjoyment greatly. Pop this one into your CD player or iPod during your commute to work.

While the Bennett women were certainly by no means perfect either (the crazy mother immediately took away any hopes of that), they always seemed rather flat to me.

She is the protagonist and makes a hobby out of match making. By doing so she injures her companion, because she is blind to other peoples' feelings and opinions. Emma is a benevolent character, but she is incredibly misguided. The only person who can criticize her is Mr. George Knightly. They have grown-up together and their relationship develops as the novel progresses.Most of the plot is propelled by Emma's antics and schemes to contro the people around her. Comical witticisms pervade the novel. The more Emma attempts to steer her peers toward certain paths the more she discovers her own lack of direction. The theme of marriage is evidents as it is the central focus for nearly every character. Some renounce it while others advise prudent matches. In the end, Emma must stop wielding others and concentrate on her own ambitions regarding marriage.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Emma. I also read Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. Both of these paled in comparison to Emma. I found myself with a perpetual smile on my face as Emma got herself in and out of mischief. She is so likable that I was constantly rooting for her. She was great because of her fallibility. Her mistakes weer always out of good intentions.The novel is romantic, yet not in an effusive way where there is some Adonis spouting sonnets. It is more subtle and underplayed. It is above all a story about society. I learned a lot about the role of women in this time period. Emma is extremely intellectual and her only outlet for her intellect is in trying to play Cupid. Also, a woman's solitary means of advancing her situation is though matrimony. This explained the emphasis on connections.The only character that slightly peeved me was Mr. Knightly. He is the handsome \\"prince charming\\" and mentor to Emma. It is his infallibility that makes him so aggravating. Knightly was always right and Emma was always wrong. I wanted her to be right for once and laugh at him for being precocious. This, of course, never happened. Ultimately, Emma is one of my favorite historical fiction novels."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I am a burgeoning literary scholar, so it may be rather unfashionable, as I am told, to say that I am a Janeite - though I have never gone so far as to throw a tea-party in her honour, I will say that I am exceeding fond of her novels, her style, her characters, and her corrective social satire. If she were not dead, lo, these last 185 years, I would positively send her an elegantly written letter declaring my love. At any rate.&quot;Emma&quot; is a fine novel, as though it lacked only my approbation to make it so. In it, Austen explores the vagaries of the marriage plot in the way only Austen can, with all the humour and satiric bite of which she is capable. She imagines a solipsistic community, Highbury, &quot;a crowd in a little room,&quot; if you will, where everyone knows everyone else's business, and Emma Woodhouse, the 21 year old mistress of Hartfield, presides socially over all. Through and around Emma's point of view, Austen examines the various social, class, and economic relationships that hold the community together.&quot;Emma&quot; begins with a very Doodian rhexis - the cut - Emma Woodhouse and her sedentary old father's society is broken up by the marriage of Emma's governess/best friend, Miss Taylor. Creating a sort of void in Emma's life, a newcomer to Hartfield, a 17 year old girl named Harriet Smith, becomes the intimate friend and a reclamation project of sorts for Emma. Emma, convinced the &quot;natural daughter of somebody&quot; must be, like Fielding's Tom Jones, related to someone of wealth and influence, tries tirelessly to play the matchmaker, filling Harriet's head with delusions of grandeur. Throughout the novel, Emma must face the chastisements of her landed neighbour, Mr. Knightley, the quiet support of Mrs. Weston (Taylor), and the temptations of a relationship of her own, while learning the limitations of her own understanding of the world in which she lives.As in most of Austen's novels, &quot;Emma&quot; focuses on the changing nature of the English economy, and how it trickles into even the most secluded of English towns, forcing a reckoning and acknowledgment of the shift in English society from primarily aristocratic hierarchy to the moneyed-middle classes. That Emma is a young woman indicates that the transition must happen immediately, with the present generation, which is difficult, especially from Emma's privileged, though not exactly aristocratic vantage point, to understand and accept. The intrusion on Emma's peace by such characters as the young, ambitious vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton, the up and coming interests of the merchant Cox family, the industrious farmer, Robert Martin, and the incessant bombast of Miss Augusta Hawkins (and her associations with Bristol, epicenter of the British slave-trade) provide a range of perspectives on the possibilities of the rising and increasingly influential middle classes - and the impact they have, even in so small a village as Highbury. Austen asks us to read the microcosm as in some ways, importantly representative of the macrocosm of England.I think in all of these points of interest, at least to me, I've forgotten completely to say how deftly Austen presents these critical issues with such decided humour, grace of style, and flawless execution of plot and character development, as to make the most glaring philsophical and social issues seamlessly blend into the comic forefront of the novel! One finds it difficult not to laugh straight through the first three or four chapters altogether. Her characters, from the delightfully disturbing hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, to the initially unreadable Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax (who must foreshadow Jane Eyre), and the irrepressibly vociferous Miss Bates - are all well drawn and memorable. This review is getting really long and pretentious now, so I'll stop - go, start reading &quot;Emma&quot; this instant."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"The problem is that Jane Austen is so popular - her books are the only 200 year old novels to stay in the Amazon top 5000- that people come to her expecting easy reading. This is 200 year-old English and takes persistence and I get upset when readers are disappointed. It's about a young woman in an English village trying to make matches for all her friends and getting into trouble. Deaths and sex take place way off stage. Some critics complain that Jane Austen ignores them but she is sharply aware of them. When Mrs Churchill dies it's a joke (People's opinions of her improve because she proves her ailments were not imaginary) The death of Emma's mother takes half a sentence and she is replaced by &quot;an excellent woman as governess&quot;.

I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.&quot;Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, &quot;Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.&quot;&quot;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world!&quot; -Jane Austen, EmmaThe edition of Emma that I just finished has a lovely portrait of a young woman on the cover painted by Josef Stieler. So as a coworker walked by my desk she asked : Are you reading a chick book !?I quickly protested it was not a chick book--one has one's pride after all--but the cover and her question raise the question : why is it not a chick book ? Why are the novels of Jane Austen, dealing as they do with the machinations of English gentry of marriageable age and their convoluted courtships, so popular among all readers ? We well understand why she should have been a favorite of Henry James, but why did Winston Churchill continually reread her also ? These questions are directly related to another which plagues modern arguments over Jane Austen : do her novels have political ramifications ? The answers to all these questions are to be found in Emma, which is my favorite of her novels.At the outset let me admit that this only became clear to me when watching the terrific movie Clueless, which is based on this novel, but I now believe Emma to be one of the greatest political novels ever written. Austen predicted of Emma Woodhouse : &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.&quot; She was quite wrong; Emma is exactly the kind of misguided busybody with a heart of gold for whom, unfortunately, we have trouble nursing much dislike. The plot of the tale is presumably too well known to need much rehashing here : suffice it to say that Emma is a pleasant and well-intentioned young woman who fancies herself a matchmaker, having successfully joined her governess and Mr. Weston, and so proceeds to meddle in the romantic lives of those around her despite eschewing the idea of marriage for herself. In particular, she takes Harriet Smith, a pretty young girl of dubious social station, under her wing and tries finding her a husband. There follow the expected misunderstandings and hurt feelings before true love finally outs and Emma realizes that not only did she not know what was best for others, in fact she did not understand her own heart's desires.Now, at first blush that may not sound all that political, but the fundamental point Ms Austen conveys is actually not dissimilar to the argument of the great political philosopher F. A. Hayek in The Road to Serfdom (read Orrin's review). Hayek's devastating critique of the modern state and centrally controlled economies argued that no government bureaucrat could ever effectively make decisions for other people because it is impossible to process all of the information that goes into other people's decision-making. Only the free market, which allows for the greatest flow of information that humans have thus far devised, can even begin to approach the levels of efficiency that a complex economy requires to function smoothly. Likewise, Jane Austen, over a hundred years earlier, warned us of the unsatisfactory results to expect when one person sought to make decisions for others, even when acting with their best interests at heart. There will always be those among us, like Emma or like Hilary Clinton, who wish to manipulate our lives (always, we are assured, for our benefit rather than for the joy they take in the exercise), but the results are seldom salutary and never what the manipulators intended.The idea of poor Jane Austen having to hide her writing when a family member entered the room and confined to the novel of manners is nearly totemic to feminists. They decry the system of oppression which restrained her talents to insignificant topics and sentenced her to writing about romance. In reality, Austen, at least in Emma, demonstrates that simple human wisdom knows no bounds and is as likely to be found in a comedy of manners as in any scholarly journal. In its own way Emma is as stern a rebuke to centralization and authoritarianism as can be found in the Western Canon. That her books are wonderfully witty and evoke images of an inviting pastoral past is merely icing on the cake.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I love this book, it is a fun must read if you love Jane Austen's writing.

Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes.

Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Emma prides herself on her matchmaking ability. The happiness of the marriage of her former governess is her obvious proof. When she takes on Harriet Smith as her charge and determines to find the perfect match for her, her attempts fail time and time again. Disappointed in the outcome of her attempts, she resolves to only contribute to Harriet's happiness as her friend. In the end, when it seems that a match for Harriet may finally be made between Harriet and Mr. Knightley, only then does Emma realize the truth she has denied for so long and the folly of what she worked so hard for may cost her heart.Emma is a classic by Jane Austen and this is my first time reading one of Austen's works. I certainly understand why the book is considered a classic. Austen engages the reader who wonders about the outcome until the very end. The style in which it is written requires thought and time to truly understand the story. It is definitely not one that can be read through at a high speed and still comprehended at a high level.

I often listen to books when I commute and this did keep me occupied for many miles. I appreciate much of Austen's writing and her interesting character portrayal. It's also very interesting to note the rigid social structure of that time and place. However if I had to have read this in print, I doubt that I would have gotten through it.As others have said, the central character, Emma, is just not very likable. She is very rich, very spoiled, an only child who was pampered by a governess and a highly indulgent father and is granted the highest respect from everyone in their town due to nothing but her fortunate social position. This is not a person who is plagued by self-doubt! She believes that she is the cleverest person around and has no qualms about manipulating others. When not manipulating, she is abundant in her very, very snobbish judgments of others. True, she matures somewhat in the year that the novel covers, repenting of her past misdeeds and promising to become a better person. Still it's too little/too late for my taste and I can only wonder that the \\"hero\\" who appears to be a candidate for sainthood, has chosen Emma as his beloved. I think he would have been better off with any of the other women in the novel.There are so many other novels of the period that far surpass this one; don't waste your time on Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"My first Jane Austen and I loved it!! A story of hope in a hopeless situation. The ending was a bit far fetched. All in all a delightful read that I will read again. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of Emma, is often very hard to like. She is spoiled, impulsive, conceited, and rich. However, Austen's writing is, as always, richly detailed, light-hearted, and sharp-witted, which makes this classic book a must-read for anyone who has ever watched Masterpiece Theater, read women's or historical fiction, or dreamed of living in a time where women were oppressed but sure looked pretty doing it. If you read Austen in high school or when you were younger and found yourself bored to tears, I would suggest going back to give it another try. I read Pride and Prejudice when I was a young teen, and thought it was incredibly lame--who writes a romance without a long, passionate kiss? However, when I went back to Jane after watching a few of the movies, I found it surprisingly playful and humorous, with strong female and male characters, some excellent dramatic moments, and solid comic relief.Emma is definitely not my favorite Austen book. Emma is simply too manipulative and naive at the same time for me to really root for her or against her. But the quality of the writing alone is worth the trip. I've read this a few times now, and I always find something fresh in the dialogue, the observations, the interactions between female characters, and female and male characters. So, if it's been awhile, you're looking to read it for the first time, or you're simply looking for a well-written diversion, this is a great choice."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma was such a character who in my opinion, was a little bit too conceited - she had thought to know of the feelings of other people that made her feel very confident of her match-making skills; and yet, when these matches failed to be, she thought the failures were all her doing too! Just the same, as in any chick-lit novels, everything was well and as it should be towards the end.It took me almost three weeks to finish this book, and I questioned myself why. It just didn't have that pull on me that I sometimes found myself browsing the net rather than reading the book. It's always a struggle for me to read 18th century writings; I always have to go back and reread for a more thorough understanding of what's being said. This is my second book by Jane Austen, and I'm probably getting tired of all the ceremonious ways of her period. Still, I could not fault the writing, being from a long ago era and true to it; it also elicited \`hate and like' feelings towards the characters which is a sure indication of good literature...But still, I labored through it...so three stars to be fair to Ms. Austen and to myself."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"It's not my favorite, but I was still struck by how Austen knows the human heart so well. During the first part of the book, I wanted to spank Emma Woodhouse on several occasions. She was annoying, exasperating, conceited, arrogant, and so sure of herself that is was hard to read about her. However, underneath all that, Emma is really a kind, good, generous person. She treats her father with such tenderness and concern; that was a beautiful thing.But, I know women like her and when they discover their faults, they are full of recrimination. I just loved Austen's insight into women and their natures. Some of the characters are so real, so rich; Mrs. Elton, Miss Bates. But, I'm not sure there is someone as saintly and good and patient as Mr. Knightley; he was just not totally believable to me.However, over all, I enjoyed this book. I think Jane Austen is a remarkable writer; verbose, yes, but perhaps that is the way people talked then. At any rate, Emma is a book to read and enjoy if you like period literature!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma\\" isn't the most sophisticated or complex of Jane Austen's book but is my favorite by far. The characters, especially Emma, are funny and moving. I'm such a romantic and this is just delightfully fulfilling."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"EMMA\\" may very well be my favorite Austen novel :) \\"PERSUASION\\" may be a close second, or possibly a tie for first!Jane Austen was so witty and engaging. I really come to care about her characters. It may be harder to read for someone who doesn't enjoy the language of period pieces.The social structure is also sometimes hard to stomach!AND, I might add, that anytime a classic is \\"free\\" for kindle, you should at least give it a try! How easy it has become to be \\"well read\\"!!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I purchased this copy of Emma and it was the first time I read it. The second Jane Austen I've read. I must say that I enjoyed Emma much more than Pride and Prejudice. I absolutely loved the humor in Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"When Jane Austen sat down to write Emma, she had a tall order. Her previous work, Pride and Prejudice, is one of the great masterpieces in English literature. Unsurprisingly, Emma does not measure up to P&P, but is still a delightful read in its own right. The same themes that readers have come to associate with Jane Austen are all present in Emma: courtship, marriage, Victorian reserve, and, of course, social status. The biggest problem I had with Emma is that the characterization is not near as solid as in Austen's previous work. The only truly interesting character is the main protagonist, Emma, whose wit and vivacity sparkle throughout. The only fair way to read Emma is to do so without comparing it to Pride and Prejudice. Doing so, this book stands just fine upon its own merit. Just don't expect lightning to strike twice."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"My mom got this book from the library not long after we saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow. She found out in the movie credits that it was based on a book (we caught the movie on TV by chance) and found out it was by Jane Austen. Since her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice (which she had tried to get me to read for years without success) she read the book, as I did soon after. It's funny that even though Emma is one of Austen's longer books, it took only one movie to render it perfectly, whereas the much shorter Pride and Prejudice needed seven videos altogether!However, this is a review about the book, not the movie. Ahem. The book was great, and like all Austen's books never loses your interest. It is a bit drawn out and your mind may wander a bit during the course of the story, but it was a great story. Emma, the character Austen said no one would like, is much more likeable to me than the pathetic sop that is Fanny of Mansfield Park. She is much different than all other Austen characters; she is rich and has a thirty thousand pound dowry (at least I think so, I forget exactly; I read the book a while ago) which is a lot compared to the other penniless heroines who have at the most a thousand pounds. She is twenty-one, handsome, and though her snobbery is a turn off at the start of the book, you can't help but fall for her charms. She is, as the reviews say, irresistible. And Mr. Knightly is just like most other Austen heroes; a real dreamy guy -sigh- I'm so jealous of these girls. He's not romantic though, and unlike other books, the romance is a minimum, with barely an, \\"I love you\\" in sight.The situations are original and entertaining, and the mismatches of Emma the would-be matchmaker (with no sight in mind of marriage for herself) are very amusing. I would recommend this book to any Austen fan, but for beginners I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or Northanger Abbey, as they are shorter and much lighter, funnier stories. Emma is a bit more quaint. My only complaint is the speeches of that girl who talks too much, what's-her-name; she talks for pages on end, interrupts herself and is in general much more boring than amusing. Highly recommended, buy it now!!!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I confess: I often read Jane Austen as an exercise in self-discipline. However, caution should be exercised in reading her books. Little surprises turn up which force a certain circumspection of all characters and events. In \\"Emma\\", we meet with the practice of \\"giving up\\" children, illegitimacy and the concomitant existence of, and suspicion of, extra-marital sex, flirting clergymen who, naturally, view courtship as a Machiavellian enterprise, egotism, snobbery, hypochondria and maybe even a little attention deficit disorder--heroes, heroines, villains alike. It is a great tour de force. Austen draws her characters well--who hasn't met a Miss Bates or a Mrs. Elton in their lifetime? Finally, also watch out for those little dollops of wisdom interspersed throughout--they pop up, wake you up and then are gone, leaving you in the midst of the question of just what is the best way to prepare a piglet's leg."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen's book Emma is creatively woven together with the characteristics of Emma Woodhouse, a young lady with much prestige. Even though the flaws of her character are questionable, her intentions are clear. Her role as a matchmaker during a unique time period creates a diversion from reality in the high social class where Emma resides. The encouragement by one lucky guess pushes her to create absolute non-sense. A reader only hopes to read faster in order to reveal and figure out the out come of all her mistakes. Emma hooks readers, addicting them to the humor and \\"tangled mess\\" in which she finds herself. This beautifully illustrated book quickly creates an exclusive impression every time it is read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"As with all of Austen's novels, the reader will find the breadth of human character within the cover. The novel demonstrates a biting wit as well as a sentimenal side. I first read this book when I was fifteen and I was absolutely captivated. If you have not read this book then you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"This book was wonderfully uplifting and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely, and I believe you will as well, if you like amusing stories dealing with romance, confusion, friendship, matchmaking, and true love. Do not listen to some of the other reviews that say this book is a rip-off of Clueless. Obviously the people who posted those are incredibly ignorant, especially since Emma came out a very long time before Clueless, and if anyone was eligible to sue, it would be Jane Austen (if she was still alive) suing the makers of Clueless. Again, this was a very enjoyable book, and I would definately recommend it to anybody!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Actually, every Jane Austen is essential, so the title of this review is pretty unnecessary.I just finished Emma. I've had this book on my shelf for over a year, hesitant to read it because I've seen the movie (the Gwyneth version) about 100 times. I was worried that there would be no suspense in the book for me, having memorized the movie characters so well.I needn't have worried. Books are never the same as movies. I found even more to love about Emma as I read this book, and grew to like other characters (such as Jane Fairfax) more, and other characters, such as Frank Churchill less. While this book did not hold the suspense for me that Pride and Prejudice does (still!), it was nonetheless a great read and I can't wait to reread it next summer."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I am not normally a fan of this type of novel (hell, I read science fiction), but I read this book for an English AP class this summer, and I must say that I liked it. As a snapshot of English social life at the time it was written, it is faultless. The plot, while somewhat inconsequential by today's so-called &quot;standards&quot;, is entertaining, and leaves the reader in a state of suspense up 'till the conclusion. The dialogue is also very charming, witty, and definately a product of it's time, but relevant. There are novels throughout the history of literature that stand as epoches for certain time periods, and Emma can be realistically called one of them. It wraps up the early 19th century English social life period very well, and more realistically and less sense of being dated than Pride and Prejudice or some of Jane Austen's other novels (or those of her contemporaries.) If you like this type of novel it is a must read, or, if you're like me, it is something interesting to pick up when you want something different from what you usually read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I absolutely loved this novel!! I'm also glad that before reading this novel I read Jane Austen's other famous works because I had practice with Austen's confusing vocabulary. Once I got used to it I was able to appreciate what was truly happening with Emma. I highly recommend this book to young girls that have a pedestrian outlook on love, because after reading this novel I learned that love isn't always about emotions but you have got to be sensible as well. Emma is a woman to be emulated, not because of her match-making attitude but of her convictions and strenght. She does not need a man to complete herself, but after finally allowing her eyes to open she does find bliss with the man she loves. I can go on and on about this novel, but then what would be the use of reading?? Get yourself a copy now! You won't regret it.."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"This was a book that I 'tried' to read in 5th grade and fell asleep, now years later I decided to give it another shot. To my suprise, Emma was a delightful book. At times it may seem boring, but at those times I learned to savor the details that I did read. I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters and plot twists. Jane Austin is an absolutely amazing author! I do not reccomend this book to younger kids who have trouble reading or get bored easily, but it is perfect for teenagers and up, esspecially girls. :)"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Having been a devoted fan since early childhood, I have read all of Miss Austen's books at least twice, and I find this the most endearing. 'Emma' is a dazzling combination of wit, not-too-dreadful mishaps, mild drama, and affectionate, though insightful, looks at society.Emma, though a little petted and given to overconfidence in her intellect (brilliant people often struggle so), is definitely endearing (even more so than Gwyneth Paltrow). And, of course, Miss Austen's inventive method of relating dialogue is delightful. Of Mr. Woodhouse, the definitive hypochondriac: &quot;He was afraid they should have a very bad drive...He did not know what they had best do...&quot; Jane Austen has a splendid way of drawing the characters through such dialogue - it is almost as if they come alive.If you ever read one book of Miss Austen's, read 'Emma'!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"By E.G. (AP)\\"Seldom, very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken...\\" This was a hard lesson for twenty-one year old Emma Woodhouse to come by. Emma takes on the role of a matchmaker, believing it is in her power to arrange marriages. Predictably, Emma eventually fails at her task. Failure causes Emma to lose innocence and become less ignorant to what in fact she can control.Emma is of a rich family; she's good looking, and she's clever. Emma is held in awe by most, especially her father who believes she is flawless. With such qualities and ideals at her disposal, Emma has very little to distress or vex her. The same circumstances convince her that she will never marry and promote naivete making reality a hard concept for Emma to grasp.Emma lacks knowledge of societal expectations especially where marriage is concerned. Taking place during the Victorian time period, one was expected to marry inside his class. Emma doesn't grasp this ideal which leads to failure and disappointment in her pursuit of making matches.Emma tries to acquaint Mr. Knightley with Harriet and to a certain extent, Jane. Emma discovers that she's once again led herself and Harriet astray. This instance in the book along with the knowledge that Mr. Knightley is one of few that can see faults in Emma, foreshadows an eventual change in plot. This is also the point in the story that a change in Emma's character becomes evident.When reading Emma, allow yourself plenty of time. There are many intricate details Involving who's interested in who that are interwoven into the plot and would be easy to pass by if not reading leisurely. It may be helpful to read a passage twice if you find yourself questioning what just took place. In order to fully enjoy the story; don't hurry through the book.A few of the characters have similar names. Sometimes the only thing separating one person from another is a subtle Miss or Ms. This can be frustrating if you don't fully grasp whom the book is speaking of. Again, read slowly and reread a passage if there's confusion about who the talked of subject is.Some characters are void of the story for an extensive amount of the book. This is also frustrating, as it may be hard to recall what role the character plays. It's beneficial to jot down character names and a few descriptors about them so when they reappear, their role can be recalled. Or, you may want to take time to flip back in the book and reread the scene in which they first appeared.Jane Austen did an exceptional job of writing satirically in order to portray silly ideals that Emma and society held. The standards for which marriages were arranged by become superficial and absurd through Austen's diction. Because it is apparent to the reader that Emma is chasing a dead end with her beliefs of who has taken interest in who, it's humorous when Emma comes to this realization herself. Austen chose exaggerated adjectives of perfection to describe Emma this creates a snicker because obviously Emma is not perfect but rather nave.Emma recalls memories of high school dance date set-ups that went wrong. It's comical to think back on either playing the role of matchmaker or having been the victim of a matchmaker when the quest for a date to the homecoming dance or prom is thrown into full effect. Most times the involvement of a third party misconstrues things much like Emma did. Feelings can be hurt similar to those of the characters in Emma making the matchmaker feel foolish but hopefully providing a lesson to all involved."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is a great story, the heroine, depicted to be a selfish woman, who has been raised to believe she has no flaws, shows us through the book, how she learns tobe a woman that many people would dream to be. She shows true nature, adn acts as any human would. Her ongoing task to matchmake all her friends end in disaster, but in the end all is well. She handles her problems as one should, adn learns not to think so highly of herself. People say that it is too &quot;worldy&quot; but the book is one of the classics, Jane Austen outdid herself, this is my favourite Jane Austen book, it shows us that we all have flaws,a d that no one is ever perfect."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I really thought this book was wonderful! It was the first Jane Austen book I've read and I loved it! It was easy for me to keep the characters staight because I saw the movie first but totally enjoyed it the book too. Most people who gave this book a bad review called it, &quot;boring&quot;. One thing you should know: Jane Austen is not a writer of action novels. She likes to spread the story out. For anyone who have read her other novels, you know what I mean. If you found this boring, you should wait until your a little older to read this one. Although I like P&amp;P better, this was definatly not a bad book if your in the right mode to read it."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I love this book because it's timeless. True, it's set in the 1800's, but this book could have been written today. I know it's hard to sympathize with Emma, but deep down she just wants to see everyone happy. I love the part where she finds her own match right under her nose. I recommend this book to everyone who likes historical romances."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I'm just wondering what kind of a world those clueless people live in, to think Jane Austen is robbing some 90s movie of its story?"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"On a personal note I loved the book as I do all other Jane Austen classics, but I'm not going to trash anyone else's opinion. No one book can ever be loved by everyone. For other readers that enjoyed this as much as I did don't get upset when others don't like it, they just don't WANT to have to translate the different dialect from a different country over a century ago. It's not that they can't, but the more modern setting suits them better. It is true you do have to be a serious reader to get through this novel. If you loose hope in the first few chapters you're not giving it enough time, at this point you've just been introduced to the characters, dialect, and culture of these people. The first 4 or 5 chapters are the hardest, but that's because you're having to learn so much with out any aids to guide you. For everyone who did not enjoy this no one should scoff at your taste, but in the future don't trash mine either. We have different taste neither is betteror worse, just different. For anyone interested, yes, their is a plot but you have to understand Jane Austen's style to see it. If you like a challenge and you like to have your heart pounding in tune with the characters this is a book for you. Bye the way, I am now 16 but I read three of Jane Austen's novels as a freshmen in high school. It's not impossible but it's not easy either.I also recomend &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Predjudice&quot; also by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"As one of the few teenagers who will read Emma voluntarily, I'd just like to say that, thought the length is daunting, I loved reading it all the way through. I first found out about it through the movie and was hooked! I would recommend this book for anyone who likes a good plot with a good, happy ending."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Many writers and critics consider Emma, the last of Austen's novels published in her lifetime, the climax of her genius. Dominating the novel is the character of Emma Woodhouse--vital, Interesting, complex, and predisposed to playing power games with other people's emotions. Austen called her a heroine &quot;no one but myself would like,&quot; but she endures as one of Austen's immortal creations. Charting how Emma's disastrous foray as a matchmaker precipitates a crisis in the small provincial world of Highbury, and in her own heart, this novel of self-deceit and self-discovery sparkles with intelligence, wit, and irony. In fact, as critics say,Emma is indeed a fine piece of work which was was written, surprisingly, by someone who lived a rather secluded life. It has all the Austen trademarks, as the constant concern over marriage and social status, which was a poignant and true characteristic of her time."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen was a truly gifted author whose simple stories, memorable characters, and insights into human nature make her writings as relevant today as they were in the early 1800's.Emma is the story of an attractive and fortunate young woman who has never had anything really bad happen in her life, and who believes herself to be much more wise and worldly than she actually is. For one who has led such a sheltered existence, never leaving home or intending to marry, Emma believes herself possessed of incredible powers of perception and feels that she knows what is best for those she loves far better than they could possibly know for themselves. It is this belief of hers that causes her to meddle in the affairs of those close to her, creating chaos, confusion, and misunderstandings everywhere. Her well-intentioned interference produes comical results and eventually teaches her a valuable lession about minding one's own beeswax.I was sorry to see this book end"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I have read few books written with such a brilliant pen. There is more than a touch of sarcasm when Austen writes of society, but this is perhaps what keeps this book so alive. It is surprising how little society has really changed since the Victorian era. Emma comes across as a spoilt child, but lovable, as there is a shade of Emma in all of us. We all share the need to be involved in everything, and meddle with everyone's affairs, and there is a tale of unrequited love in all of our histories, even for a short time. I have not yet seen the film, as I am not sure of whether or not this would spoil it, as though there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Hollywood, Jane Austen should be present to direct it"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I can't remember the last book I disliked as much as I dislike Emma. GoodReads informs me that I have been struggling through this book since the middle of October, but in actuality this book has been haunting me for at least ten years. I bought it sometime before I went to boarding school. Though I remember starting it several times, I never made it past page 30. As I vociferously complained about this book as I was reading it this time, both M and my mother asked me why I was reading it if I disliked it so much. I didn't really have a good answer at the time, but now I know. Leaving this book unread for so long was haunting me. I really don't like leaving things undone, and I wanted to challenge myself as a reader. As an apprentice-writer, you are supposed to read as much as you can. If left solely to my own devices, I would mostly read YA, so Classics and Modern, Adult Lit are good for me.Usually, I like reading about Austen's heroines. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. Northanger Abbey was a fun read. But Emma Woodhouse makes me want to hit people. Okay, mostly I just want to hit her. So what were my issues?In Northanger Abbey, the heroine is also fairly naive and kind of creates the problems in her life. But you know what? She feels badly about it! And she learns! Emma's excessively high opinion of herself pissed me off beyond belief, and though she feels bad for a minute or two, in another 30 pages she'll be doing exactly whatever it was that got her into trouble last time. In fact, I don't think she focuses too much on starting the rumor about Jane Fairfax being in love with a married man. If she even thinks about it, it wasn't for very long. In fact, she focuses more on making a catty comment to Jane's aunt (whose ridiculously chatty dialog is *painful* to read), and that's primarily just because Knightly chastises her for it.Which brings me to my other issue: Knightly. Not a super-hot Austen heroine, in my opinion. Call me a crazy modern woman, but patronizing guys just aren't attractive to me. Now, I think he's perfect for Emma, who continues to act exactly like a spoiled child/Mean Girl, but I couldn't get 100% behind a relationship predominately based on him trying to fix her and get her to grow up. Maybe I'm missing something, and I'd love to see your thoughts or defenses of the book in comments. But really I'm just glad I accomplished that. Hopefully my other 10+ year book that is haunting me, The Phantom of the Opera, won't be as painful.Rating: 2 stars-- At least I will never have to start this book again."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen has a lot of fans. I am one of them. My wife is another. People have been arguing the merits of Austen's novels for quite a number of years now; some people love her work, others do not. This is as it should be. We can take this premise of love/hate Austen a step further though. It has been my experience over the years that there is conflict even among those who love this writer's work and that everyone seems to have their favorite novel. This is also only right.The problem is though that I have found people who read Jane Austen are also a very opinionated lot and quite often harsh words are spoken when discussing the strengths, merits, flaws, dislikes, etc. of Austen's various works. Alas, I have to report to you that this is the case in our household; a normally peaceful place filled with tranquility and marital bliss...about 49 years of it...thank you very much!Yes, we are a family torn asunder. My wife (silly girl) feels that Emma is Austen's best work, while I, who am far more knowledgeable of such matters, prefer her novel, Pride and Prejudice...of which I am sure most of you will agree....me, not her, i.e. my mistaken wife. (Emma, bless her heart, is such an aggravating little twit).Anyway, this is really not a review of Emma, the work (I will admit that it is a very fine read worthy of multiple readings ever few years), but rather that of the actual book edition on sale here. I felt sorry for my wife when I saw her ragged copy stuffed into one of her already overly stuffed bookshelves and felt a new edition was in order. I bought this one for her.For the asking price of this book, including S&H;, I cannot for the life of me figure out why people are disgruntled and unhappy with it. It is very well bound, the font is extremely readable, the quality of paper is quite good, the dust jacket is extremely attractive and all the pages were present. I check the binding very closely when the book arrived, and again, for what I paid for this thing, it was excellent! Trust me...I know about such things. Hey folks, this is not advertized nor is it a leather bound first edition! This is a workable, useful book for everyday use.Now I have both this work and P&P; down loaded to my Kindle. The chances of my wife ever using one of these reading machines are as about as likely as pigs flying next mayday. It ain't going to happen. Therefore, she now has a new hardback book; one that will quite likely outlast both of us; It did not cost me a fortune. She can read her copy; I can read mine and the war between us that has been going on since we were in our early teens can continue.Bottom line...this is a good buy. And I must tell you, my wife was delighted with it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I must start by admitting I did not get \\"Emma\\" the first time I read it. Or even the second. I did not really begin to properly understand \\"Emma\\" until after reading an essay by the great P.D. James, \\"Emma Considered as a Detective Story,\\" which forms a chapter in herTime to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography(a wonderful piece of writing too). And even after that, I have to confess, it took a while. This is a novel that does not give up its secrets easily.Although the outward plot is simple enough (some reviewers have found it tedious, and I did too, initially), the real genius of this book is that all the really exciting and dramatic stuff -- Jane Fairfax's agonized secret engagement, Frank Churchill's game of misdirection -- is happening both offstage, as it were, and under our noses. There is a very exciting, melodramatic romantic story here, but that's not the one Jane Austen tells us. She hides it in plain sight, however.All the clues are there (just as in a detective story) but we don't see them, because we are seeing the world through the eyes of Emma, who is, as the 90s remake wittily reminds us, clueless: self-absorbed, naive, convinced the world revolves around her. But aren't we all?The book itself is a kind of conjuring trick, and once you see that, it is impossible to ever see it again in the same way."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"These books are wonderful! I love feeling like not only am I reading a delightful classic but I am doing so with a piece of art. They are truly treasures on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen's Emma was published in December 1815, when she was forty years old (just 19 months before she died). It is thus a work of her mature period, and is something of a favorite among her devotees.My admiration of Austen's work is partly for her insight into human nature but also for the sheer beauty of her prose. It has a poetic texture. Her sentences can be long and complex, with some confusion of pronouns, so that they need to be lingered on, their sense teased out of them, until their structure and meaning is revealed, exactly as one would do with poetry. The effect is immensely satisfying.She spends almost no time on descriptions of place, but when she does she shows herself capable of describing a scene succinctly and effectively. Her main focus is on character. She describes her characters and their motivation at length, and reveals them through dialogue. This emphasis on dialogue makes her work eminently suitable for dramatization, so it is no surprise that there have been so many adaptations of her work in cinema and televisionEmma is unique among Austen's novels in that the heroine is a spoilt rich girl, with definite character flaws. The reader is challenged to judge her and to choose to like her or not.One or two of the plot elements are somewhat contrived, but that befits a comedy of errors, which is what this essentially is.I would advise reading as little as possible about the book before reading the book itself, for fear of spoilers. In particular, you should avoid any introduction, because editors of classics very generously provide complete synopses of plots in their introductions, presumably to spare the reader any surprises. Introductions are best read after the story or, in the case of the Barnes & Noble Classics edition, not at all. The introduction by Steven Marcus is verbose, meandering and thoroughly confused. If you want good editorial input, choose another edition.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, I greatly enjoyed this book. It's actually my favorite of Jane Austen's novels. Emma, to be sure, is a little frivolous and silly, but she's meant to be, as the book shows how she goes from hapless matchmaker to happily matched herself. The book is at times laugh-out-loud funny, and gives charming insight into life during that time period. Poor Harriet is a very amusing character, and Emma's father is a hoot. The many misunderstandings and romantic confusions only add to the story. Give Emma a chance...you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"The title character of \\"Emma\\" is unique among the heroines of Jane Austen's novels. She is \\"handsome, clever, and rich\\" and at twenty-one years of age, inexperienced in life. Further, for most of the novel, Emma is not actively seeking a husband. The grim economic necessity that made finding the right husband so important for Lizzie Bennet and her counterparts in the other novels does not apply. Emma can therefore be allowed to be foolish in her social forays, even to fail, without impairing the audience's ability to enjoy the resulting romantic comedy.Emma lives at the estate of Hartfield with her doting but hypochondriac father. Their social status as the leading family of Highbury is unquestioned. The recent marriage of Emma's governess to a close neighbor prompts Emma to wish to arrange suitable matches for her other friends and neighbors. Her immediate target is Harriet Smith, an amiable young woman of uncertain social status. Against the advice of Emma's brother-in-law and confidant Mr. Knightley, Emma persuades Miss Smith to refuse an offer of marriage from a Mr. Martin, a upright hardworking farmer of no social distinction. Emma then tries to match Harriet up with the ambitious young vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. This scheme fails, hilariously, when Mr. Elton proposes instead to a horrified Emma.Mr. Elton soon brings a new Mrs. Elton to the village, a vulgar social upstart who presumes to arrange the social life of Highbury. Among her targets is young Jane Fairfax, once the paid companion of a gentlewoman, now forced to make her own way. The arrival of the charming and handsome Frank Churchill creates additional complications. Emma, after getting over her own initial infatuation, presses a match between Frank and Miss Smith. She is also provoked by Frank into passing rumors about Jane Fairfax and the husband of the woman she formerly accompanied. The climax of the story may be an unfortunate picnic at Box Hill, where everyone seems out of sorts. Emma thoughtlessly insults the silly but harmless Miss Bates, for which she is very properly upbraided by Mr. Knightley. Emma then learns, in rapid succession, that Frank has been engaged to Jane Fairfax all along and that Harriet believes she has gained the affection of Mr. Knightley. Emma is mortified to have misjudged both Frank and Jane, and to have inadvertantly pushed Harriet towards a man she now realizes she loves herself.Emma must take responsibility for her mistakes and make good her relationships with Miss Bates, Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith. Her fear of losing Mr. Knightley leads to a fateful conversation with him in the garden of Hartfield, in which Emma's fear of losing his friendship works at cross-purposes with Mr. Knightley's real agenda.Austen's subtle and witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful. \\"Emma\\" is the least heroic of Austen's heroines, but her undoubted charm and her very human efforts to mature have endeared her to generations of readers. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen's novels as perhaps her most polished romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a a mess of things as she tries to manage the affairs of others.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Austen's masterpiece, Emma deserves distinction as a work of wit and fun. Austen wrote about the misfortunes of a high-minded philanthropist (\\"Emma\\" was perfectly translated into the 90's by the movie \\"Clueless\\"). In \\"Emma\\" Austen poked fun at the way Emma feels almost obligated to help her associates \\"better themselves\\" but did not realize until the end that she needed to work more on herself.I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it. If you are new to Austen then I recommend you start with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Honestly, if I had not read Pride &amp; Prejudice first, I would have thought that I did not like Jane Austen's writing style. Emma is extremely slow to begin with though it picks up about half way through. The story centers on Emma Woodhouse, the unmarried daughter of a man obsessed with ailments to be potentially caught from drafts, rich foods and just about anything that is part of ordinary life. Consequently he does not go out (as a rule) and depends on Emma substantially for companionship and general well being. Despite his eccentricities, he is well loved by the community and is a very genial character. Emma, resolved not to marry, takes up matchmaking after her governess, Miss Taylor, marries friend and neighbor, Mr. Weston and Emma feels that she had contributed to making the happy union come about. Against the advice of family friend and mentor, Mr. Knightly, she \\"takes under her wing\\" a young girl at the local school to groom and bring out into good society in hopes of finding her a husband - specifically Mr. Elton of the vicarage. Despite her unknown parentage and lack of good expectations, Emma convinces the girl, Harriet Smith, to aim high in her expectations of a husband and to reject the advances of those of her natural social set in preference for a gentleman.This goes on for so long that I was convinced that this was going to be the whole of the book. Joyfully, though, the Mr. Elton angle blows up catastrophically and simultaneously several more interesting characters are introduced. The icily reserved Jane Fairfax comes to visit her grandmother and aunt before hiring out as a governess. Though she had been taken in by the Campbells and raised very genteelly along side their own daughter, she has no fortune of her own. The same age as Emma, they are expected to be fast friends but Emma's resentments of Jane's superior abilities and deportment do not bode well for this. Then Mr. Weston's son, Frank Churchill, who was raised by his aunt and uncle after his mother's death, comes to meet his new stepmother and makes a splash in Highbury society. Mrs. Weston has designs for Emma and Frank. Emma meanwhile has designs for Harriet and Frank. No one can figure out Jane's designs though Emma suspects improper attachments between her and her benefactor's daughter's new husband. Mr. Elton then brings in a new wife whose forceful manner and arrogant air threaten to turn everything upside down against Emma when Mrs. Elton tries to force a relationship as Jane's benefactress. Similarities between Emma's presumptions with Harriet and Mrs. Elton's presumptuous behavior with Jane are unavoidable and provide a relatively subtle irony.In this last half as the intrigues play out, the story takes on the flavor of Pride and Prejudice and becomes infinitely more interesting. Though the first part was slow, it did serve to really build the character of Emma and she becomes very real through her actions in the second half. It also serves to humanize Mrs. Elton's character to some extent while softening Emma's.This really is a very, very good book and I would have given it 5 stars except for how slow it was in the first half. A patient reader will enjoy this but readers who don't have patience with character studies or slow bits would do better to read Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"After reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility, I could not help but read another one of Austen books. The merits of the book lie mostly in character development. Emma, a girl of 21, is altogether too absorbed in the dangers of matchmaking, which result in several devastating consequences for her friend Harriet and her own continual blindness to the true feelings of the men around her. The reader encounters various characters of interest that form a better &quot;tangle&quot; of plot than Pride &amp; P/Sense &amp; S has to offer. I admit that the first 2/3 of the book left me questioning Jane Austen's work. I could not admire Emma Woodhouse (whom I thought to be at first a silly girl who misinterprets everything) as much as the other &quot;heroines&quot; in Austen's other books, but she proves to be sweet and naive, but clever at the same time, and she always has the best intentions at heart, especially for her loved ones like Mr. Woodhouse. It appears that Jane Austen always saves the best for last--I found the last 1/3 of the book delightful. Throughout the whole book however, Austen's talents and satire shines in various characters, particularly Mrs. Elton, who represents society's perpetual desire to be upper-class. Austen also sheds light on the social stress of class, power, connectinos, etc, without overwhelming the reader.I highly recommend reading this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"&quot;Fffftt!&quot; Cupid's arrow, once again, pierces the hearts of two unsuspecting people. Causing two people to fall in love, Cupid is known for his matchmaking. Similarly, Cupid is portrayed through Jane Austen's Emma. The protagonist, Emma, tries to find her best friend, Harriet, a husband. Emma is a well thought out, insightful novel. Despite the time gap between the time that Austen composed this novel and present day, the reader can still relate with characters. By developing a setting for Emma, Austen uses a realistic setting. For example, in the village of Highbury, class rank, reputation, and family background are major factors in marriage arrangements, which was a harsh reality during those times. Austen also develops Emma really well through her actions and decisions. Because Emma is a life-like character, she too makes mistakes. In addition, Emma also chooses to make decisions that make readers love and despise her. Creating unique love triangles, they contribute to the interesting and complex plot. For instance, Harriet has affections for Mr. Elton, however Mr. Elton has feelings for Emma, and Emma is trying to set up Harriet and Mr. Elton together. Using symbols, Austen is able to help readers recognize affections between characters. Showing his love for Emma, Mr. Elton keeps Emma's portrait of Harriet and makes a riddle for Emma and Harriet. However, Emma interprets Mr. Elton keeping the portrait and the riddle as his love for Harriet, but in fact symbolizes feelings for Emma. Also, Austen's themes are well carried out in arrogance and self-deception, and marriage. Thinking she's a perfect matchmaker, Emma is constantly proud of herself and her setups. However, she is unable to realize that marriage can't be playing around with. Ultimately, Emma was a very good book because of its great setting, characters, plot, symbols, and themes."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is definitely Jane Austen's most captivating heroine. Emma may be flawed, but her character is the most enjoyable. I loved this novel. Throughout the story, Emma overcomes many personal hurdles. A synopsis would ruin the book - this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Watching my favourite sitcoms or a worthy comedy on the big screen I may be moved to laugh out loud. Books have a much more arduous task. Very few authors have managed to make me laugh. Roald Dahl has, so has Harper Lee. Now I can add Jane Austen to the list. Emma is more of an entertainment than an art. It is structured very much like a romantic comedy of the 90's. The characters are introduced and beautifully developed while the reader wonders who will end up with whom. It is a tribute to Jane Austen that we care for Emma even though she causes so much trouble. She is unique in that we enjoy her failings as they lead to so many embarassing situations. In fact the Emma at the beginning of the novel is a much more interesting character than the polished Emma at the conclusion. Plot? There is very little. It is characters that Austen succeeds at. We remember Knightley and Emma; Frank Churchill and Mrs Elton; Mr Woodhouse and Harriet Smith. They are all well defined characters and like any good book you miss them when they depart. Oh and the line that forced me to laugh out loud: &quot;Mr Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs Elton's beginning to talk to him&quot;. If you don't get it read the book, I guarantee you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I loved Emma by Jane Austen. I think that the best aspect of Austen's writing is her witty irony that is featured in all of her books. I thought that Emma was a touching and funny story about a young woman whose lot in life is to play the matchmaker. She tries to fix the world to her own liking, but it does not work. Finally, she stops being so critical and realizes what is standing right in front of her. If you enjoy the book (which I think you will), buy or rent the movie starring Gywneth Paltrow. It is just as funny as the book. If that is not your fancied genre, check out Clueless, starring Alicia Silverstone. It is loosely based on the novel and also very funny, with a modern twist."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Though Persuasion is my sentimental favorite, I regard Emma as Austen's finest novel overall. She is at the top of her game and everything works: the dialogue, character development and, did I mention, the humor? While teaching Emma in my AP English class this year, I realized that many less talented readers read right over the irony and scathing remarks. Jane Austen is so very funny that she makes better readers out of those who take the time to read her carefully. I have to admit that the movie version of Emma with Emma Thompson is quite good and does the novel some justice. It also helps a first time Austen reader get a flavor for how things looked and sounded in this time period. If you haven't yet started to enjoy Austen, pick up Emma and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I've been reading ever since I was younger, and have always enjoyed it.. After reading all of Nicholas Sparks novels, I decided to go in a different direction and read some classics.. I decided upon Jane Austen after reading reviews of her novels.. So I bought Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, and Emma.. I choose Emma to read first because I thought it would be less interesting than the others.. How wrong I was! I absolutely loved this book, it's the best novel I have ever read.. Now I fear that the others will not be nearly as good as this one.. I agree with the others that the beginning is rather slow, but it picks up towards the middle so just stick with it! You will not be sorry.. I have no other words to describe this book other than amazing!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen's Emma was a wonderful book. I think it gives Pride and Prejudice a run for its money because you get to see Emma grow as a person from being arragont to being kind.Now here is a basic Readers' Digest summary. Emma Woodhouse, a bright and wealthy young woman, and her father lose Emma's governess, Mrs. Weston(\\"poor miss Taylor\\") because she has gotten married. Emma brags to a good family friend,Mr. Knightley, that she predicted the match herself. She then wants to be a matchmaker. However, Mr. Woodhouse decides to disapprove of every marriage.To replace Mrs. Weston, Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young poor girl wiht no record of her real birth mother. The two become good friends. Emma finds a wealthy man, Mr. Elton, that she thinks would be perfect for Harriet. Harriet grows to love Mr. Elton, but the feeling isn't mutual.A poor old maid, Miss Bates has her niece, Jane Fairfax, visit the town. Emma is envious of Jane because Jane is everything Emma wants to be: respected, elegant, and musical.Frank Churchill, Mrs. Weston's step-son, visits the town. Charming and handsome, he pays much attention to Emma. Many speculate the two as a perfect match. While others approve, Mr. Knightley is determined to think ill of him.Well, I'm sorry, but I hate giving away books, but believe me, this book is worth it. I will warn you that Austen tends to ramble on, but if you hang in there you will love it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Once you master the difficulty of the language(some in our reading group never did), you can focus on the story and relate to the witty and impudent Emma. In one incident Emma and her best friend and former governess share a non-verbal communication by stepping on the other's foot under the table when something wild is happening! So many of these &quot;modern&quot; exchanges take place, that I was able to drop my misinformed presumptions that the english gentry class of the nineteenth century are so different from me. There are moments of great cruelty (such is the case of class struggle) and there are two hilarious characters; the gossipy neighbor who barely catches her breath, and answers her own questions, and Emma's worrisome and overprotective father. The story seems to be one party after another -- from parlor rooms to ballrooms to picnic luncheons -- you will be amazed at how much time these people have on their hands! Oh, the leisure class. Emma goes through some humbling changes, and there are surprising turns of events. I found myself wishing for Emma's world -- where your neighbors are intimates and you alternately visit and are visited upon, and work isn't in the picture."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is priviledged. Very priviledged. She comes from the richest, most important family in her small town. Everyone looks up to her, including her indulgent governess and even more indulgent papa. The theme of her life, from the time she was small, has always been \\"Emma knows best\\". Emma takes this to heart when she takes an interest in young Harriet Smith, the beautiful, empty-headed daughter of, well, someone. The book follows Emma's misadventures as she tries to marry Harriet off to the local parson and meddles in the lives of her friends and neighbors, eventually learning that perhaps she doesn't always know best.This is, I think, one of Jane Austen's less popular works, perhaps because there isn't a great deal of romance in it. It is, as I titled the review, more of a character study, as well as a study of society at that time. On first reading, I didn't care for the book or for Emma's self-centered goodness. After reading it again, I grew to enjoy the book as much if not more than her more popular works, like Pride and Prejudice. The wit is sharp as usual (and maybe slightly more ascerbic), and more thought seems to have been put into the secondary characters. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Like all of her novels, Jane Austen's EMMA is essentially a comedy of manners, a work in which the characters move inside a highly restrictive code of conduct and must walk a fine line between the socially acceptable and unacceptable if they are to survive, much less reach their goals. But at the same time the central character, Emma Woodhouse, is a marked departure. Not only is she a young woman of considerable wealth and social standing, she is, as critics are fond of pointing out, &quot;flawed.&quot;The nature of Emma's flaw is essentially Austen's observation of the great failing of the upper-class: an assumption that what they think and do is inevitably correct. And although Emma is quick-witted, generous, and kind, she suffers the effect of this blind arrogance when she comes to believe that she is gifted as a matchmaker and can order the romantic lives of her circle to suit her own liking. The result is a series of seriocomic entanglements and disasters that touches virtually every one with whom Emma comes into contact.The story requires considerable exposition, and consequently the action is slow to gather; add to this the fact that Emma herself is so overbearing and self-assured that you frequently want to give her a slap. The result is a novel that many, including Austen fans, will find an uphill read. Even so, Austen is writing very close to the peak of her powers here, and her amazing talent for observation, subtle irony, and flashing wit endow EMMA with tremendous charm and interest. In many respects a remarkable novel, but one that I recommend more to determined Austen fans than to casual readers.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I definitely recommend this book to first time Jane Austen readers, and especially to young girls, for it is so cute and so amusing. I wish I were &quot;forced&quot; to read this in High School for I would have surely written good papers on it. I can't see how anyone can dislike this classic. Jane Austen's character &quot;Emma&quot; has her faults of course, be she is a true character that is amusing and utterly charming, unlike those characters in Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, which by no doubt are wonderful books, but Emma truly has to be my favorite Austen work. It is predictable, even without having seen the movie that was based on this work (that mind some of you was written over 200 years before Alicia Silverstone existed...gosh!) but the predictability of it made it all the more enjoyable, like a sort of mystery in romance. I definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 or 12. I know I'll make my kids read it some day. It is superb!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"If I could do it over again, I would read Jane Austen's Emma before I read her Pride and Prejudice. Unfortuanately that was not the case. I loved it nonetheless. Emma combines witty humor and a fun cast of characters that makes for very enjoyable reading. It does not read as quickly or as easily as Pride and Prejudice, but it is still great fun!If you have seen the movie Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone, then you know the basic plot. The 1995 movie was adapted from Jane Austen's novel, which was published in the 1800s. The Miramax version of Emma is done very well and should be viewed after reading the novel, not before. It would make the reading even slower.Emma Woodhouse is a young woman who is the socialite of her small English town of Highbury. She is beautiful and wealthy and popular; everything that girls nowadays want to be or imagine themselves to be, so she is not terribly hard to relate to. She is not terribly smart but humorously clever and witty.This novel displays this young woman's journey to self-discovery and love; along the way she humorously meddles in everyone's lives. Her romantic blunders are extremely fun to read about. I recommend this novel to any avid reader, but I should caution you against reading Pride and Prejudice beforehand, but if it is too late, do not hesitate to read it. And even though it may drag a bit, bear with it; the ending is reward itself!Needless to say Emma will always have a place in my heart and on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Of all of the books by Jane Austen this was my least favorite. The central character is not likeable and you can't sympathasize with her. It is a long and tedious book and it was constantly set aside to read something else when a new book arrived. If you are truly a fan of the 18th century period writings yes go ahead and read it but Pride and Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility and Northlanger Abbey are far better reading."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I'm reading Emma again for the third time. It happened like this: I thought I'd try an audio book on CD for the first time, something to listen to in the car besides music. Scanning the shelves at the local bookstore, I saw loads of contemporary best sellers, self and financial help, new age and evangelical Christian spirituality, and Jane Austen's Emma in MP3 format, all on one disc. Austen! Water in the desert! I scooped her up.For the last week I've been listening to her in my car. At the beginning it was without much concentration. Over the next few days my attention gradually increased. Now I'm hooked. Down the throat. Through the gut. Again. It happens to me every time I return to Jane. I just can't get enough. The last two nights I've gone to bed reading ahead of where I've listened. Even though the story is coming back to me, I'm still taken by it, hook line & sinker. Jane's reeling me in, and the line is utterly slack.Now, I am a guy. I break out in hives if I happen to accidentally brush a romance novel. As far as I am concerned, bodice rippers where the tall olive skinned duke inevitably has his forceful yet gentle way with the heroine are good only as ammunition with which to tease the women in my life who enjoy such tripe. Having said this, I realize a lot of people also refer to Jane Austen as \\"Chick Lit,\\" equating her with the likes of Nicolas Sparks. For the record, those people are on crack.Austen is much more a comedic writer than a writer of what we call romances. She is simply a hoot. Subtle disjunctures and ironies build to exquisite crescendos. She has me laughing every other page. Her characters, even her unpleasant and ridiculous ones, tend to breed sympathy. Like most of my favorite books, she creates worlds, or a world, really (all of her books are set in the same historic and geographic milieu,) which comforts and gladdens. The feeling I get from her is much like the feeling I get when I read Tolkien describe the Shire or Last Homely House, or something like the children's book Frog & Toad to my niece.It's an eating poached egg on toast snuggled up inside under a quilt on the couch with a cup of tea on a rainy day kind of feeling. (Don't you just love English prepositions and phrasal verbs? Try doing that in French! Austen and phrasal verbs: two of the many reasons English speakers ought to rejoice in their language, I say!)Anyway, during all of her stories, including Emma, Europe was being blown apart by the Napoleonic Wars, and the only oblique references in any of her stories to that maelstrom is that Great Britain has a mobilized Army (Pride & Prejudice) and an active Navy (Persuasion.) The reason the military is important has nothing to do with Austerlitz, Waterloo, Trafalgar or any of that nonsense. Rather, it is that both services have officers which make very suitable suitors for women of her heroines' social positions (Lt. Wickham & Capt. Wentworth, for example.)Some brand this awful: elitist, sexist, parochial. I, for one, find it beautiful. Small, intimate, ordered, secure, anchored. Very human and sane, that is.What matters most is not what some silly diminutive one armed Corsican with maniacal delusions of world conquest is doing; no. What really matters is whether and how Mr. Woodhouse takes his gruel, or if Mr. Elton will propose to Harriet. Or if Mr. Knightly and Mrs. Weston have come to visit yet, today. Will Mr. Frank Churchill come, and what is he like? Has Emma truly foiled Mr. Martin's advances on her friend, he being an entirely unsuitable yeoman farmer? Harriet must marry a gentleman, you see.Just so. Indeed, these are truly the things that mattered- and still matter- most. Don't let the history books and the reverse snobbery of some critics fool you.Instead go read this book, and every other that Jane wrote, and prepare to be enchanted."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is Jane Austen at her best, the work of a writer in her prime. While earlier novels such as Northanger Abbey and Pride and Prejudice are extremely witty and well-plotted, none are as clever, interesting or satisfying as Emma, in its depiction of the frivolous preoccupations of the landed gentry in eighteenth century England.The plot centres around Emma Woodhouse, the young, beautiful and clever daughter of a hypochondriac father, who amuses herself by attempting to play cupid to her friends and neighbours - with predictably painful results. Austen's characterisation is delightful: characters such as Mr Woodhouse and Miss Bates are brilliant comic creations but are never in danger of becoming caricatures, like Dickens' characters sometimes do. Meanwhile Emma herself is a complex mixture of intelligence and thoughtlessness, kind-heartedness and self-satisfaction, and is superbly realised. Austen's dialogue is as delicious, and frequently hilarious, as ever - she reveals the finer nuances of her characters through the things they say, intentionally or otherwise - and shows how intuitively insightful and compassionate she was.As in most Jane Austen novels, all situations resolve themselves into a happy ending, though whether this tendency was prompted by a genuine positivity and warmth of feeling or a playful sense of irony, nobody is sure. Regardless, Emma is a tremendously satisfying read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen wrote some of the most remarkable romantic novels in English, and Emma is said to be written at the height of her powers. Like all her novels (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility), the narrative is simple, straightforward and the story develops through seemingly commonplace conversations and events. Emma is twenty one year old daughter to rich Mr Woodhouse, \\"full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\\" The story captures how Emma comes to terms with her own errors of judgement, and how she discovers her liking and love for one of the chief characters of the novel. (Perhaps giving his name away here would be sacrilage on my part!!). The cast, the locations, the conversations are set in distinct Austen style, rooted in rural English counties. The romances are Victorian, and progress through delicate, slow developments that a through, diehard romantic is bound to like. Emma's actions are governed by her own romantic fantasies, where she tries to bring people together playing a matchmaker, and her failures as well as successes make this novel an interesting read. A treat for Austen fans!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Buyers be advised that, though this page as of 08/30/2005 does not specify, this is ABRIDGED. So for those of you that cannot stand the thought of missing out on something that should have been left in (like me), just keep browsing for a different edition. I found out the hard way."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I don't know which book of Jane Austen, I love more. Sense and Sensibility is just so romantic. Pride and Prejudice is awesome and Emma is just fabulous. To think that Jane Austen wrote those books so long ago just goes to show that women have felt pretty much the same about love for always."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"After reading this novel, I realized how entertaining/touching an old book could actually be. The story was about a woman (Emma) who despised marriage, and felt that there was no need to dedicate her life to only one person. I felt that Emma was a very strong character, she knew what she wanted and would not let anyone alter her decision about marriage. However, at the end of the novel the character succumbs to societal pressures and marries the man (Mr. Knightely) that desires her companionship. That shows that her character's personality is not as strong as it seems. Throughout the whole novel she lets the reader believe that nobody could ever modify her view on marriage. Yet, I feel that the love story was very touching, not many people are dedicated to a person to the point where they will wait for them for as long as needed. Love conquers all is a saying that I have always wished to be true, but never thought that it was possible. Emma swore that she would never change her mind on this issue, but after admitting to herself that she was in love with this man, she desired to be with him as much as he did with her. After reading this novel, I realized that people can have soul mates, and that if you really love someone, never let them go because you never know what will happen. I feel that everyone should read this book, because even though it was written over a century ago, individuals now are able to read it and feel like they can relate to the characters, at least I felt that I could."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is a wonderful story. It's a timeless story and worth reading. Very light and amusing."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I can't believe the people who found this book too long and too hard. Not that it doesn't have its difficult places, but come on ...This is a fine book, great for someone in their early teens who want to read some classics and who have half a brain in their heads. For the rest of their peers, I hear Jewel has a book of poetry you can try out."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I was amazed to read all those reviews by people who gave EMMA ratings of 1 and 2. they obviously missed the point of the novel and were too ignorant to understand it (which I find hard to believe considering I'm only 11 and I read it when I was 9). EMMA made me laugh, cry and everything in-between. It's a classic worth reading over and over again."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is twenty years old, living in the countryside of Victorian England. Her father is a wealthy hypochondriac, constantly worried about his own health or the health of others. He dotes on Emma and can see no wrong in anything she does. Emma's mother died when she was a small child, and her older sister married and moved away some years ago. This leaves her as the mistress of her estate, with much leisure time to interact with her socially acceptable neighbors and to try her hand at matchmaking.At first Emma's schemes seem to be going well. She decides that her new friend Harriet, although not of the same social level as Emma, would be perfect for Mr. Elton, a well-connected neighbor. Everything seems to be as Emma had hoped.... until it all falls apart in misunderstanding and hurt feelings.Emma is stubborn, though, and refuses to give up even when things among her social circle get more and more confused. Will she be a successful matchmaker? Will she decide to give up her determination never to get married?I found the characters in this novel very dull and shallow. I didn't find Emma at all appealing, nor did I like any of the other characters in this book. Some of the writing is beautiful and it was interesting to get a glimpse into what life was like at this time, but I found the plot utterly predictable and was a bit frustrated that it took so long for all of the mistakes to sort themselves out."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"True to Jane Austen's prediction that with the creation of her character Emma was a person that not many people would like, Emma is one of the least likable characters in British literature.This snobby, rich and manipulating heroine was despicable to the end, yet the book was hilarious to read. The characterizations were complete and read like real and interesting people. There were the irriating Bates', the hypochondriac Father, the dashing and elegant neighbor and brother-in-law, the accomplished Jane Fairfax that Emma is fiercely jealous of, and the fawning lower class friend Emma wants to &quot;set up.&quot;The comic exchanges between characters, the complexity of the plot and the witty back-and-forth between the &quot;players&quot; makes reading Emma a lot of fun indeed. You don't have to like or agree with Emma the character to enjoy this great piece of literature. If not for Jane Austen's intriguing use of the English language that just sucks you in and holds you captive, I could have never gotten through this book with so much joy and entertainment for my clear disdain of the puppeteer Emma.However, that's what makes the book a masterpiece and why we still enjoy it 200 years later. For a more true, well-rounded heroine, I prefer Anne of Persuasion and Elizabeth of Pride and Prejudice. Both novels have likable leading characters created by Jane Austen.Emma is rich with complexity and rife with interesting, funny interludes and dialogue between the characters. Depite it's flawed main character, it was highly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Those who gave this book a three or lower must not know how to appreciate formal writing.

Hey, go out and read Remains of the Day. That was about a butler. And it was great. Emma was a good book. It's a good story. But I guess some people are to busy staring at the TV screen to notice.

However, this book was absolutly boring. Out of all of Austens works, which are not all to exciting themselves, this has to be the most boring and drawn out. There are long pauses of nothing but tea and long walks, and once in a while Emma will set up one of her friends. This match does not last long, however. Personaly if I were her &quot;friend&quot; Harriet, I would think myself better off without her companionship. To my knowledge Jane Austen wrote this &quot;little gem&quot; for the prince of England whom she did not exactly admire. I wouldn't be surprized if his didn't admire her so much after he finished reading it. If you are looking for a exciting and gripping book do not choose Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I hate it. So boring.

I wanted to slap everyone in the book. The only happy ending for this book would have been for all the characters to lose all their money and have to get jobs and actually do something for a living. Yes, I understand the points that Austen was trying to make about social mores etc., but those points were clearly made within the first 20 pages; the remaining 480 were superfluous. I wanted to rate this book higher by saying that \\"although the characters and plot are insipid, annoying, and boring, the writing was wonderful,\\" but I can't, because Austen's writing is almost as annoying as her plot."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Yep, that's about the only claim to fame of this shallow, eye-batting bit of fluff and nonsense. Needed some sex to spice it up and maybe a few curse words or a little war, courtesy of Napoleon across the Channel. Sex 'n violence, that's the key. I mean couldn't Emma have been ravished a little by one of the courtly fops who paid a call and couldn't she have gouged an eye out with a hairpin or red-hot poker in defense of her virtue? Helllooo, action and excitement, like Clarissa had a century earlier with Richardson? He knew a thing or two about keeping a bored middle school honors English class going. Yep. It would've helped. I've held a grudge against this insipid it's-somehow-great-because-it's-old bubble-headed tripe since it was forced on me like a bad blind date in the 8th grade. I hated this book. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of lower is that it did have a few redeeming moments and plus anything from another age that gives us a small peek into the lifestyles of the past (even a shallow and vain group of peasant-exploiting petty aristocratic-wanna-bes from the past) is worth something. Oh, plus there was the whole Clueless spin-off thing. Yeah, Clueless was so huge to us in the mid-90's we even used to go, \\"WWAD?\\" (What Would Alicia Do?) So I can't let myself utterly excoriate this headache-inducing, bulimia-inspiring, plot-thin-as-supermodel-tale from the dim brain of Miss Austen, a woman deeply in need of a good love affair. (If you catch what I'm saying.)It mystifies me they managed to make a passable film version out of Emma ten years ago during the Austen craze in Hollywood.

First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic.

If I can suffer through 10 pages a day, I think I'm doing well. I plan some type of celebration once I'm done.One of my graduate students used the word \\"tedious\\" to describe Jane Austen. I agree 100%. Sometimes you must read a sentence a dozen times; then, maybe, you have an inkling of what Ms. Austen is trying to say. Maybe not. She simply goes on and on and on.Personally, it's novels like \\"Emma\\" (or any other novel by the outdated Ms. Austen) that turn kids against literature.

When I got it in late August, I got about twenty pages and had to put it down. Now, I picked up where I left off, and I really enjoyed this one. I don't know why I couldn't get through it before. Maybe I was just in the mood for a different genre.Emma is the story of Emma Woodhouse \\"handsome, clever, rich\\". She is also extremely spoiled, and her favorite pastime is making matches for all her friends; pairing them up with men. Her beloved tutor, Miss Taylor, was recently married to Mr. Weston. Now Emma's attention has fallen on Harriet Smith. She pulls Harriet away from Mr. Martin, the man she truly loves, and tries to match her up with Mr. Elton, a wealthy handsome young vicar, with disastrous consequences. That's the main plot.There are several other side-stories: that of Jane Fairfax, an orphan taken in by a friend of her father, Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son who was adopted by his uncle, and of course, Emma and Mr. Knightley, a long-standing friend.Emma is a character that you don't like; I kept wishing that she would just mind her own business. Mr. Knightley redeems her a bit; he's smart, and realizes that Emma should not be interfering. But there's not much he can do about it. But he is a great character. Austen's writing is very light and witty, which I enjoyed.I read the Penguin Thread (Deluxe) edition, and I've got to say, it was just beautiful. Seeing the image doesn't do it justice. Penguin uses 3D imaging to scan a woven pattern. So basically, you can feel the stitches on the front of the cover and the back of the cover (and the back side too.) Beautiful, beautiful design, and I look forward to reading some of the other books from this series.Emma was an enjoyable read; though I didn't love it as much as Pride and Prejudice, I definitely liked it more than Northanger Abbey.4.5 stars.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen is a master storyteller.

Its main character is lovable but incredibly flawed. Her saving grace is that she is prepared to acknowledge her repeated errors. The other characters are also both interesting and believable, though the hero Mr Knightley is a bit too good to be true - but then most of Austen's heroes are a bit bloodless except for Darcy and perhaps Willoughby. Emma, the novel, is also a mystery. Both the two subsidiary leads, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax seem to have secrets which are not revealed until the end of the novel. The backdrop of privilege and patronage with its ever present snobbery and prejudice are gently but critically presented.

Emma is a very imperfect heroine, but Jane Austen was wrong in supposing that no one but herself would like her. I find Emma to be refreshing as a heroine, and she stands is stark contrast to Fanny Price in Mansfield Park (my least favorite Austen heroine). There is none of Fanny's timidness or inability to stand up for herself. Emma is independent and strong, and much more modern than other female characters in classic literature. Her mistakes in pride and arrogance are such as we all make on a daily basis. She presumes to understand people's emotions and thoughts and thinks she has a right to order things as she would have them be...very type \\"A\\", in my opinion. But, as her intentions in every case are good, as she only wants those she loves to be happy and prosperous, one cannot really blame her.The other characters in this book are also very satisfying, particularly Jane Fairfax and Mr. Knightley. Jane is the poor orphan on whom everyone in Highbury, the village in which Emma lives, dotes upon. Emma, of course, can't stand her at first, but only because of the knowledge that Jane is superior to her in many ways. How many of us have declared that we don't like someone simply because they're better at something than we are? Mr. Knightley, Emma's neighbor and long-time family friend, is her conscience, calling attention to those errors in judgment that Emma constantly seems to make. He often lectures her, but only in an attempt to set her on a better course. When faced with the prospect of losing him, Emma must confront her own feelings and question her own situation in life.It's altogether an enjoyable read, with plenty of twists and blunders, and should appeal to any fan of Jane Austen...or just anyone who wants to read the real version of the movie \\"Clueless\\"."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled.Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings. Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

For all its pleasant enjoyability, however, the novel is also a fascinating character study of one woman being elevated to a nobler level by being taken down several notches.In this respect, \\"Emma\\" is a prime example of the fact that although many see Jane Austen as something of a proto-feminist, she often gave her male characters the most admirable constitutions of her entire cast. Although the female Emma may be the heroine we hope will triumph, the male Mr. Knightley (like Colonel Brandon of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\") is the unimpeachably noble person, and the one who helps Emma ascend to a higher plane of virtue when she might otherwise have been left in despair at her failures. In the end, Austen's fourth novel (and the last published during her lifetime) is not a feminist manifesto. Rather, it transcends the gender wars and remains a touching comedy of errors with a profoundly subtle commentary on human pride and folly."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"In a letter to a relative Austen once wrote \\"3 or 4 families in a country village is the very thing to work on \\"She knew this world intimately and well and it was the subject of her best novels of which Emma most assuredly is one .Emma Woodhouse is young,lively and thoroughly spolied .She is complacently sure she knows what is best for all her friends and acquaintances ,especially in matters of the heart .She is a self-appoinited matchmaker to all her friends and she particularly interests herself in the affairs of the young and naive Harriet Smith,an unassertive and timid young woman .Emma is convinced Harriet would be ideally matched with the local minister Mr Elton not knowing that he despises Harriet for her lack of social graces and standing and that he is set on wooing and winning Emma herself .Emma is idly contemplating a dalliance with a newcomer to the village ,Frank Churchill ,but her real feelings are for the local squire George Knightley .Knightley is an amused and exasperated spectator to the meddling which is second nature to Emma.The novel deals with the way Emma's plans for others collapse and she as a consequence comes to a new and painful degree of self-awareness.She knows less about herself and others than she fondly imagines .The book is a very tough-minded piece of work and has universal themes to do with human motivations and self-deception.It shows the manipulations and strategems of the marriage market as supremely important in society .Emma is essentially about growing into self awareness rather than a romantic comedy as so many other Austen novels are .It is why it still retains its impact so many years after its original publication .The support cast is well drawn -Elton,in particular being a great sketch of an odious snake who has somehow been born as human being .Any society in which people meddle in each others affairs is one in which Emma is still a valid book"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"A classic gem done full justice by the superb reading of Prunella Scales.

Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"*Warning: there are some plot spoilers in this review!*Jane Austen has a reputation as a witty, humorous writer with a keen eye for human folly and failings, and with this novel she certainly lives up to her reputation. While Emma isn't as popular as my personal favorite Pride and Prejudice, I believe that Emma is so popular, and can be considered \\"literature\\" (that is, a piece of art) because the story really has a universal quality to it. The fact that we can relate to the situations and characters in Emma some 300 years later is what makes it seem so timeless, and why the Emma movie with a \\"modern twist\\", Clueless, was so wildly successful. When you compare both Emma and Clueless they show how little has changed and that privileged teenagers (and young adults) will find themselves in the same situations and social patterns, whether they are in 19th century England or 21st century America.Of course, while the wealthy and bored teenagers in Clueless might try to set up their friends on dates, the stakes were a bit higher in Emma. Emma (the heroine) attempts to match her new friend Harriet Smith with the new minister Mr. Elton not just for dating, but for marriage as long as they both shall live (remember, divorce was rare, if not nonexistent in early 19th century Britain.) Unfortunately, this plan backfires when Mr. Elton becomes interested in Emma, not Harriet. The problem was that Emma (already conceited because she successfully \\"guessed well\\" when she matched her tutor Ms. Taylor with a local widower Mr. Weston) failed to get to know Harriet and Mr. Elton well enough to figure out if they were, in fact, right for each other. Emma shows her class-snobbery when she (through some very adolescent mind games) convinces Harriet to reject the proposal that she receives from a local farmer (Mr. Martin, the man Harriet likes and eventually falls in love with), in the hopes that Mr. Elton will propose. Emma was too self-centered and (to steal the phrase from Amy Heckerling) clueless to notice that Mr. Elton was not, in fact, interested in Harriet, but in herself--a fact that leads to Harriet's heartbreak. Of course, this is only one part of the multi-faceted story that Jane Austen created about the life of a \\"handsome, clever and rich\\" woman living in Highbury, England, but it gives you a sense of the life and times of Ms. Emma Woodhouse (as we see them in the book)Fortunately, all is well in the end when Emma learns her lesson about matchmaking and toying with emotions and discovers that she loves her brother-in-law and well loved family friend Mr. Knightly. This is a classic \\"happy ending by way of falling in love with the best friend that you had all along,\\" but with a slightly dated feel. First, he is sixteen years older than her and he, in a way, helped to raise her (at least, in principles). The fact that he admits openly to having been \\"in love with (her) ever since (she) was thirteen at least,\\" slightly bothered me. Who, in the 21st century, would admit to having a crush on their 13 year old sister-in-law? In the context and time of the novel it's romantic. Now Mr. Knightly might be described as a pedophile. However, the dated dialogue (like the above) is the only qualm I had about the book, and I hope that it doesn't discourage anyone from reading Emma. Overall, I would recommend this book to any Clueless fan, romantic-comedy fan, or anyone who wants to read the wonderfully universal writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Very much like Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Emma, a novel by Jane Austen, is a tale of confusion and intrigue over the universal topic of love. The reader's feelings of befuddlement and captivation, while nonexistent at the beginning of the novel, will grow exponentially until the climax. At the end of the novel, everything finally makes sense and the characters live on happily ever after. This is a very satisfying ending, clearing up all earlier confusion, although it leaves little room for wonder and thought after the reader has finished the book. Though I found this novel very confusing, and therefore unenjoyable at times, the intrigue and vivid setting and characterization overpowered my initial dislike. I would recommend Emma, to seventh through ninth grade students who are capable of deciphering meaning from complicated words and are able to pick out the essential subject matter of passages that do not state the meaning strait out. Readers will enjoy the frenzied, almost comical, characters in all their confusion over who loves whom, as well as all the wonderful descriptions, and the satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is another one of Jane Austen's novels. It's a good book, however I don't believe it's as good as Pride and Prejudice. The protagonist, Emma, is a very bright and handsome young lady. It seems that the protagonists of Jane Austen are always female, intelligent, and pretty. The characters in this book are complex. For example, an elderly well-known bachelor suddenly falls in love and took a wife of about the same age as he. His reason for marrying is also strange, because he simply wanted to have a wife. And Emma was the person who started and encouraged their relationship. The plot was interesting too, a few surprises here and there.My problem with Emma is that it wasn't as engrossing a story as Pride and Prejudice. But this is a different style of book, so it's really unfair for me to say that Emma is not as good as Pride and Prejudice. Other than that, it's a wonderful book.I recommend it to readers who want dialogue-based novels."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"It's not that I don't like Emma as a character, I do! It's great that she's a bit flawed and gets into messes because of her arrogance, and I even liked the storyline (though to be honest it's probably only because of \\"Clueless\\") to a certain extent - I just felt it was a little dull.Nothing ever really seemed to happen. People just talked. A lot. And I felt that the whole 367 pages (of my copy) could have been cut down to 150 - at least! The one possibly exciting part (Harriet and the gypsies) you didn't see happen, as it was only ever talked about. Like the rest of the book.It's the first Austen I've read and has - I hate to say - slightly put me off trying any of her others, although I probably will in time.If you like charming books of light humour and romance - or just Austen - I'm sure you'll enjoy Emma, but if like me, you are used to a bit more excitement and adventure, you might want to try something else.

The story takes you back to old Enland (I guess 1800s)..the main character Emma, is a smart young woman from a well to do family in England. The story pretty much revolves around our heroine in her attempts at matchmaking, the social norms of England in those times etc. Though it borders on romance, I would say it is more of drama. Of course, Knightley (though old) is an adorable character in the story. Though Emma might seem a little...spoiled to some readers, I would say she is a sensible, likeable heroine.

The characters that she creates come alive on the page and even though nothing terribly exciting happens besides the usual day to day, I find myself drawn into the lives and events anyway.In the introduction to my version of Emma, there is a comment that Emma is basically a book about nothing. While this is true in a way, Emma is about a lot more than nothing and gives the reader a fascinating glimpse into the world of Emma's England. There is also the great intrigue (insert tongue into cheek a bit) of whom will be matched up with whom and when these courtships will commence, etc.Ms. Austen's easy to read style and sense of humor really do make this an enjoyable book to read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lighthearted frolic through classic literature in old England."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"If you have not read Emma since you were in high school or college, read it again!! A wonderful story which held my attention from beginning to end. I read it on my kindle and could not put it down. The recent movie follows it very faithfully."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"As a reader who is tired of cliche romances and characters, I really enjoyed Emma for the unstereotypical main character. Emma is neither wonderfully good with dreadful circumstances (like Jane Fairfax, Jane Eyre, etc.), nor rich and intolerable (like Mrs. Elton, Scarlett O'Hara, etc.), rather she is like many of us today, a well-to-do girl who is nice but has faults. I loved how she grew through the story, slowly realizing more and more of her fundamental issues. Mr. Knightly is the perfect gentleman to everyone and a wonderful friend to Emma because he loves her enough to correct her for her faults. Even so, he grows and improves in the book as well. All of the characters have many facets to their personalities and characters and Austen weaves a beautiful web through the story. Emma is a lighthearted, fun read, yet has depth and relevant themes.I recommend reading this book twice so that it can be fully appreciated."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Now that I have all my computer business sorted out (and at home sick today) I'm going to try to get moving on my Jane Austen reviews. Emma was the second Jane Austen book I read, and the only one I read for school. I was 15 at the time and actually wasn't all that fond of the book. It was funny, yes, but I found Emma herself absolutely insufferable and the relationship between her and Mr. Knightley kind of squicky (fell in love with her at 13???) but watched the Gwyneth Paltrow movie and liked it. A couple years later, I gave it another try and loved it!It's probably second or third favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. I still find Emma to be very irritating at times but she is a very amusing character to read about. Like Elizabeth Bennet in a way, she is so sure of herself and her impressions of people and turns out to be totally wrong at just about everything. I like how she learns her lesson when some of her matchmaking attempts go awry. And I realized that Mr. Knightley wasn't serious about falling for Emma when she was only 13, thank heavens. I like that Frank Churchill, the \\"bad guy\\" of the book, isn't exactly a villain per se, but still a total cad.Most of all, I like the element of mystery. Who sent Jane Fairfax the piano? What secrets are the characters hiding? It wasn't a crime novel or anything, \\"only\\" a romance, but throughout there was a sense that things weren't what they seemed, which I enjoyed. Of course, now there's no surprise to learn of Jane and Frank's engagement but it's fun to pick out the all the hints or \\"clues\\" that Mr. Knightley picks up on but Emma is totally oblivious to.I like Mr. Knightley as a character, but he's not exactly my type. Emma needs someone to keep her on the right track, but I'd be afraid he'd be nagging me all the time. I guess it's of no importance, since he's a fictional character and all, but it's still fun to think about."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Before reading the book Emma by Jane Austen, I made the mistake of watching the 1999 movie version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. For some reason I just did not like this movie and I found that I could not sympathize with our heroine Emma because I just plain did not like her. I found her childish, self-absorbed and meddling. Since watching this movie I have been a bit prejudice with the story and I never really wanted to try my hand at reading the book itself. I have been lately re-reading most of Jane Austen's novels and I realized what a disservice I have been doing myself all of this time by not reading this book. I dug out my copy of Emma and I began to read. The basic plot everyone knows and not a lot happens but I realized that the writing is wonderful and what a truly fantastic heroine Emma is. She is flawed, probably the most flawed of all of Austen's heroines but the best part about Emma's personality is that this makes her more human and more like us. She is able to see when she does wrong and she tries at the end of the book to atone for some of the mistakes she made about people's characters. Of course the novel is filled with Austen's wonderful characterizations of human personalities, and I think that since Emma is one of her later novels she had perfected her art of characterizing people and making them such wonderful individuals to read about whether they are more for comic purposes than to be a main character.This addition also contains some wonderful supplemental background information of Jane Austen as well as some of her letters and also what other writers have thought of her works and of this book in particular. I love reading other's opinions on Jane Austen and what they feel she thought or felt since we can't ask her ourselves so I found the information in this addition excellent."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"It was hard to like the main character but it is supposed to be.

I was actually surprised that the book was so similar. It features one of my favorite Jane Austen characters, Emma of course. She is a joy to read about. The dialogue was easy to follow and it was a quick but fun read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"The fourth, longest and last of Jane Austen's books to appear in print during her lifetime, Emma is considered a classic romantic comedy and was first published in 1816. Written almost 200 year ago, it's inevitable that the dialogue may feel a bit stilted at times. However, this adds dimension and depth to the story that focuses on 19th century social hierarchies and the interaction between various social classes.Miss Emma Woodhouse is a shining example of a 19th century socialite. Beautiful, clever and wealthy, she fancies herself a master matchmaker and sets in motion a laundry list of schemes to pair off the Highbury residents. Convinced a makeover would elevate her new friend Harriet's social standing and thus her marriage potential, Emma, fueled by her feeling of superiority, plotted and planned, all to no avail. Failing to realize the extent of her shortcomings and the consequences of such hurtful behavior, Emma was finally confronted by Mr. Knightley. Afterwards, embarrassed and ashamed, she reevaluated her life and began to make amends, in hopes of becoming a better person.Emma is a beautifully written, classic, laced with wit and sarcasm. Through a vastly differing cast of characters, each delightfully inspiring in his or her own way, Austen vividly captured the heart of a community. Everything is neatly tied up at the conclusion, as things literally come full circle...ending much the way it began.A subtle, yet significant message is hidden just below the surface--the beginning and the ending are just definitive points in the journey, in between is where we write our definition of happiness. There's a depth and sincere honesty written into the very fabric of this story-that must be recognized to fully appreciate the artistic genius of Jane Austen.Like a vintage automobile, Emma is a slow, leisurely read, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.Armchair Interviews says: What more can you ask of a book, even if the story is 200 years old."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I really enjoyed this a lot. It's not quite as good as Pride and Prejudice, but it is better than Sense and Sensibility. It still has a lot of things to say that are still very much pertinent to modern times.

Although overlong, it's still a really, really entertaining read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen is one of the greatest women writers in history, and Emma ranks among her best. The characters are rich and varied. For anyone with an interest in Victorian literature, Emma is sure to be a hit."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I tried to read this book when I was in middle school and quickly returned it to the shelf when I found it slow and boring. I decided to give it another try and couldn't believe that I hadn't enjoyed it before. \\"Emma\\" is not a work of deep and intense literature, but Austen deftly explores human motives and emotions. Emma is consumed by the class system and buys into its importance, much like Mr. Darcy in \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Emma feels she has the power to change the system, especially where her friend Harriet Smith is concerned. Emma must find out the hard way about class distinctions and friendship.I'm not an avid Austen reader, in fact I'm quite a novice as far as she is concerned. Maybe after I've read some more of her novels I won't value \\"Emma\\" as highly, but for now, this novel is high up on my list, and I enthusiastically reccomend it."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Ms. Austen wrote very well about headstrong, intelligent young women. All of her books are wonderfully warm, but they show a tendency to light irony as well. Ms. Austen describes her world of early nineteenth century England so very well. In this book her heroine is Emma Woodhouse. She is the younger daughter of a wealthy landowner. She has a good heart, but she is spoiled. She also sticks her nose into other people's love affairs with some disastrous results. Miss Austen does a wonderful job describing life in a busy English village. The village in this story is Highbury. The characters in the book are wonderful, but it is the spiritual development of Emma that carries this book. Somehow she manages to grow and learn while staying within the strictures placed on her by her father and by English village life. Your journey reading Jane Austen's work is not complete if you do not read this book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"This is a book about Emma, a rich girl's mischievous struggle in her own little fantacy world. This book is a bit boring and dry in the sense that everything is just always so beautifully fitting. Even in the worst moment when Emma's ill judgement turned into chaotic love triangle, the story went on and worked everyone's fate for the best. Since I don't read much of Jane Austen's works, I guess her style tends to be light and comic. So, if you are looking for a book with lots of heart throbbing drama, this is definitely not the one."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"When I first tried to read this book (almost ten years ago, when I was around 13), I found it incredibly dull because there is little action. I finally decided to reread Emma and realized that the appeal of this book (in addition to Jane Austen's writing style) is in its characters. Emma's setting is a small town full of an assortment of delightful personalities.At the center of the story is Emma Woodhouse, an intelligent and wealthy young woman, who believes that she knows what is best for everyone around her. Emma takes the orphaned Harriet Smith, a pretty but simple-minded girl, under her wing. The consequences are disatrous for all. I found it pleasant to watch Emma grow throughout the book and learn about the way the world works.The other characters include the loquacious Miss Bates (and her silent, elderly mother), the constantly distraught Mr. Woodhouse, and the handsome and affluent Mr. Knightley. There are also Jane Fairfax (who the movie portrays a little bit more negatively than the book) and Frank Churchill who show up later on in the book to make life a little more interesting.These people and many others add to the richness of Austen's narrative. The best part about them is that all are real people who have both good and bad points, and make mistakes. I found that a lot of them are similar to people that I know today in the 21st century.The second time I read through this book, I found myself aching for more. I felt delighted every time I find one of Jane Austen's little witticisms (and there are a lot!). These little gems are enough to make her my all time favorite author."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is easily Jane Austen's most annoying character. She's young, knows absolutely everything about everything, is the judge of everyone's good character and takes those around her for granted, despite frequently praising her friends and relations. She is, for all intents and purposes, the 18th century version of daddy's little rich girl.How can a book about such a person be so captivating? The short answer is simply: because Jane Austen wrote it. The long answer is several hundred printed pages and well worth the read.Much of the story is the typical Jane Austen framework, but the character of Emma is entirely different from many of the other main figures in Austen's works. While her other heroines have plenty of outstanding qualities and several flaws, Emma has plenty of flaws and several outstanding qualities. It's the central, exceptional qualities that make Emma a worthwhile character, but the flaws - and her growing consciousness of them - that make her loveable.Countering Emma is the younger, and more gullible, Harriet Smith. She becomes Emma's project when Emma learns of her situation in life and is determined to improve it by befriending her. Emma's increasing awareness of her own flaws footnote their friendship, as she is forced to admit to being something of a snob, and a meddler.There are all sorts of loud and obnoxious people in \\"Emma\\", and Austen's orchestration of the interaction among them is, as always, brilliant. The character of Mrs. Elton alone is one of my favorite \\"bad examples\\" of all times. This is perhaps the downright funniest of Austen's books, but in ways it is also the happies and the saddest. Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith are in the throws of adolescence, where everything is either tragic or blissful.I typically say that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Northanger Abbey\\" are my favorite Austen works, but secretly it might be truer to say that \\"Emma\\" is. It's not as clever as \\"Pride\\" or as satirical as \\"Northanger\\", but the way in which Emma is forced to open her eyes to the world - and the way it continues to revolve, and evidently not around herself - is really something most of us can relate to all too well.Incidentally, the movie version of \\"Emma\\", starring Gwyneth Paltrow, isn't bad, but if you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself the favor of reading the book first. As always, there is so much in the pages that is ignored on the screen. Then, when you're done reading, watch \\"Clueless\\" again, which isn't nearly as true an adaptation, but is a funnier movie."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I did my best to read this book but I just couldn't get into it.

Nonetheless, at this stage in my life I was not motivated to finish the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I just recieved my copy of this wonderful work by Jane Austin and, even though I have hardly had time to crack open the beautiful cover, I must say the edging on the pages is exactly as they say: It is uneven and roughly cut. Just as you would have seen in Jane Austin's time. If any of you have grandparents and have stumbled upon their editions, their's probably looked the same. I don't think this is due to the fact that B&N; doesn't care how their books look, but because they wanted to keep that feel that you were reading an older book, from a different time. After all, they didn't have computers and things to measure the print paper perfectly back then.I can't wait to dig into the witty, wonderful world of Jane Austin. It's always a treat!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Although Austen's longest novel, Emma is a lot of fun to read. It was areal challenge to make us truly care about this spoiledand meddlesome character. I guess it because it is Emma's depth of feelingand her reactions to all the chaos she creates throughout the book that reallyendear her. That and the fact that in the end everything works out as itshould (no major spoiler that), and all her messes are resolved happily orcomically.I can see why many consider this to be Austen's best work: it has many of thebest qualities of the other work, but it also builds into a mysterywith a surprising resolution, and many characters turn out to be quitedifferent from what we initially suspect."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I love historical novels and Jane Austen holds a special place in my heart. Even so, I have issues with Emma. I adore much of the writing style, but the plot and characters irk me.Let me start by saying that Jane gets kudos for trying to do something different here. In other stories she had not-well-off young women who were desperately trying to get by in life, to thrive in the world they had been born into. Emma is Jane's efforts to focus on a new kind of heroine. Rather than being poor and worried about her future, Emma is quite secure. She is wealthy. She has a father who dotes on her, a house she loves, and she is perfectly content to live like this forever. She has no need of a husband or really of a partner at all. This is an interesting diversion from other stories.Emma, aged 21, grew up without a mother and with a loose-handed governess. So she is spoiled and very aware of her class and status. It might be hard especially for American readers to relate to just how stratified English culture was at the time. Some situations - like how Emma treats farmers - might be seen as cruel. It's important to put this into context. This was \\"normal\\" at the time. Heck, for a few societies on the earth this is \\"normal\\" even in modern times. You can't really judge it as right or wrong.Mr. Knightley, aged 38, has been pretty much an uncle to Emma her entire life. He was a teen when she was born and was always there to watch over her and correct her. He tries to guide Emma as she plays romantic match-making games with the people around her, but Emma thinks she knows what is best. She manages to bungle a variety of relationships. To her credit, she does feel badly right away, but then she plows ahead with a new scheme.SPOILER WARNINGOne of the key issues I have with this book is the VERY creepy idea that Mr. Knightley has been lusting after Emma since she turned 13. If I had a young daughter and a male family friend in his late 20s started following her around as soon as she hit puberty, I would be quite irate with him. Again, I realize gigantic age gaps in this time period were normal. As they say in the story, men weren't expected to take on a family until they hit age 30 and had the financial strength to support a family. Women were supposed to marry in their late teens / early 20s so they could kick out as many kids as possible. Even so, though, to have a person that was almost an uncle to Emma stalking her as soon as she started showing a womanly body really bothers me a lot.Also, I realize Emma is written to have her be spoiled. Jane Austen tries to give her some humanity by making her dote on her father and feel remorse each time she does something wrong. However, to me it just doesn't get past the way-too-spoiled aspect of her personality. Interestingly, I enjoy some of the movie versions FAR more than I enjoy the book because in the movie they alter the storyline just enough to make it much more palatable. They smooth out some of Emma's annoying traits and make the Emma-Knightly pairing a bit less creepy.Still, if you're looking to start reading the Jane Austen series of books, I wouldn't start here. I'd start either with Pride & Prejudice or with Sense & Sensibility."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Frankly I am puzzled by the criticisms leveled at this edition. There is another edition [also by Barnes and Noble] and it is cheaper, though the quality is very flimsy and I wonder if the other reviewers were confused with that edition?This edition of Emma is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Emma, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms.

Quality of the pages is very good (acid free should you wish to keep it and, smooth texture)."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"It is difficult to imagine how a book written in 1816 can still be relevant and emotionally viable, after so much change in literature. And while female gender roles have evolved and broadened (causing certain things to become irrelevant- like the drastic choice between marriage or condemnation), Emma remains one of the most complex and ambivalent characters in literature. Perhaps because Austen's major theme- pride- is a rather timeless attribute in humans.Austen was quoted as wanting to create a character \\"no one but [her]self will much like,\\" and Emma certainly answers that promise. Emma is a talented, highly intelligent woman who carries so much pride, that she deems every man an ill-suitor for her, while an under-adjusted adolescent side of her secretly resents such men for being turned off by her harsh arrogance, smugness, and severity. She acts as a match-maker for her less fortunate common friends, bringing them together with men whom she despises; thus ridding herself of her own ingrown desires while condescendingly \`helping' her girl-friends meet men who share their mediocrity. As difficult as it is to like Emma, readers will find her mysteriously compelling, perhaps because there are moments of confused kindness, where our heroine is able to transcend her vanity and truly feel happy for the couples she brings together.Enter Mr. Knightley, who after a tiresome handful of preceding men, is able to gain Emma's respect and affection simply by not buying into her mind games and calling her on her actions. Austen's genius is most manifest in her witty dialog, and the dynamic between Emma and Mr. Knightley- in their bantering flirtations veiled under intellectual stimulation- are testament to that.This novel is about self-image, and for a woman in 19th century patriarchal society that is all she has. Emma owns her self-importance until the men notice, until it becomes real (and despite early feminist tendencies, this only re-confirms female's subordination to men in that social context). Regardless of how readers feel about Emma, the novel is superbly written with wit, irony, and an almost ruthless emotional verity. If an author's goal is to gain her reader's empathy, Austen set out for herself a highly ambitious goal, one that was improbably executed with grace."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Maybe it was the way Jane Austen drew the reader into the story, or possibly the twists and turns of the plot, but whatever it was to add the extra flavor it worked. The book demonstrates a perspective on love that can only be seen through the eyes of a person who involves themselves as a whole in the book. It has a way of making it an impossible task to put it down. This story stands the tests of time and will surely work it's way into the hearts of millions more.

Liked it then, love it now. After every movie adaptation, I feel compelled to return to the sour ce and have always found Austin's presentation the best."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma, written by Jane Austen is story about a clever, rich, and high society woman, named Emma Woodhouse. Throughout the beginning of the novel, Emma is portrayed a nave child, with a broad imagination. Due to her broad imagination, Emma bases her own happiness solely upon her matchmaking abilities. However, although Emma has the best intentions, her actions eventually lead to the worst results.Through the key marriages of Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, the theme of self-revelation through the actions of marriage is revealed in the novel, Emma.Emma attempts to make a match between When Harriet Smith and Mr. Elton. However she is blinded in noticing Mr. Elton's love for her. Mr. Elton does declare his love for Emma, which leaves her bewildered. After this incident, Emma's first revelation is that her matchmaking abilities are flawed and resolves that she will no longer match-make.Emma then meets Frank Churchill. Emma soon begins to realize that she might be in love with Frank Churchill. However, soon after Emma learns of the impending marriage between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.However, soon after this event, Emma's third revelation begins to arise. Emma recovers from the disappointing event concerning the marriage of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, and finds herself suddenly appreciating Mr. Knightley. Emma now begins to realize at this point in the novel that Mr. Knightley is her true love.In the beginning of the novel, Emma Woodhouse is portrayed as a conceited and imaginative child, who lacks the knowledge of true love and self-respect. At the end of the novel, through the events of marriage between Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, Emma ironically becomes a mature and selfless woman. Although Emma's character throughout the novel changes dramatically from a spoiled heiress to a mature and selfless woman, I believe that Emma's endurance and triumph of numerous obstacles of oppression, gave her the strength to liberate herself from her stereotypically society, thus allowing her to realize and attain her own desires and dreams.In conclusion, I would consider Emma a very good book. However, I think the novel's only faults are that it was extremely long and at some points very difficult to understand."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is a great classic novel and probably one of Jane Austen's best!

Upon the marriage of her governess, a match Emma purports to have arranged herself, Emma next turns to finding a suitable husband for her new young friend, Harriet Smith. She encourages Harriet into an infatuation with the vicar, Mr. Elton. Her plans fall apart, however, when Elton reveals to Emma that she is the true object of his affections. Rejected, Mr. Elton flees to Bath and finds a wife almost immediately. When the long-awaited Frank Churchill finally comes to visit, the entire social set of Highbury is swept into a tangle of suspicion, charm and deceit. Although Frank is commonly viewed as a perfect match for Emma, she feels only friendship for him, and views him instead as a potential husband for Harriet. In spite of Emma's multiple failed attempts at matchmaking, there are two couples married and one engaged by the end of the novel.Jane Austen was one of eight children, the daughter of an upper middle-class clergyman. Although her family was not wealthy, they led comfortable, socially respectable lives. Well-educated and with a love of reading, Jane Austen began to write at the age of twelve. She never married. Her first novel, Sense & Sensibility, was published in 1811, followed by Pride & Prejudice. All of her novels were published anonymously. She died in 1817, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral.I found this book to be as charming and delightful as the film, which I first fell in love with long ago. Jane Austen's wit is very much in evidence throughout the novel, and greatly improves what might otherwise be a somewhat dry style. Austen referred to Emma as \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like much.\\" However, I found Emma to be engaging and delightful. I recommend this book to all fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"So what does a &quot;handsome, clever, and rich&quot; girl like Emma Woodhouse do when she has no professional aspirations and no intention ever to marry? In addition to painting, playing the piano, and condescendingly visiting the poor, she is what might be called a social organizer, which primarily means finding husbands for single women and arranging all the social details involved in doing so. Her decision not to marry stems from her opinion, conceited but sincere, that there's not a man out there who could entertain her as a lifemate; and besides, with her mother pushing up daisies and her older sister Isabella living away in her own marriage, she already has a husband: her father.Jane Austen's novel weaves a group of several characters, balanced almost equally between men and women, into a web of romance in which the reader is led through various scenes and situations in a guessing game of who will end up with whom. Emma makes herself the prime mover of this group, but she is not as infallible a love broker as she would like to think. After she has successfully matched her childhood governess Miss Taylor with an affluent man named Weston, she turns her attention to the naive and impressionable Harriet Smith, for whom she has identified the young vicar Mr. Elton as a suitable beau. But then Elton declares his love for Emma, who of course is not interested in him, and...oh, what a mess.The plot thickens when a pretty girl named Jane Fairfax arrives in town to inspire Emma's curiosity and jealousy because she, unlike Harriet, is charming enough not to need Emma's assistance and tutelage. The main heartthrob among the women is Frank Churchill, actually Weston's son from a previous marriage, an impulsive and not totally honest young man whose amorous unpredictabilities shake the foundations of Emma's schemes. The man designed to be a traditional hero is George Knightley, sixteen years Emma's senior, who acts as Emma's moral anchor and monitors her matchmaking endeavors, gently cutting her down to size when her head gets a little too big, such as when she tells him that Robert Martin, a farmer, isn't of the proper class to be Harriet's husband.Austen maintains the right narrative pace, giving her major characters just enough room to develop themselves plausibly through interactions with some colorful minor characters. Emma's father, the slow-on-the-uptake Mr. Woodhouse, a man of extreme sensitivity to gastronomical disorders and temperature fluctuations, is an innocuous but amiable fellow who appreciates his daughter's loyal devotion but is judiciously content to remain in the background of her life and activities. The Highbury seniors are represented by the elderly Mrs. Bates and her slightly less elderly daughter Miss Bates, who has a marvelous talent for prattling about trifles in which nobody else is interested. She can be outdone only by Miss Suckling, the annoying chatterbox Elton decides to marry after being jilted by Emma.Emma is not a bad or cruel person--she genuinely feels guilty about Harriet's continual romantic misfortunes and her own momentary sarcastic behavior towards Miss Bates. However, it cannot be denied that she's a snob whose goal is a Perfect Society with all the right ladies married to the right men, and to hell with all those other little people (the farmers, the servants, the unattractive, etc.) who don't fit into her master plan. But Austen herself admitted this much, showing that Emma is far from perfect herself and allowing her to learn a lesson in humility by the end of the novel, for which she is duly rewarded--the denouement is a little too neat, but of a style so familiar to us by now that &quot;Emma&quot; seems nearly two centuries ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I can never decide whether Pride and Prejudice or Emma is my favourite book by Jane Austen. Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Yes, Emma the heroine is a flawed human being. She is a spoiled little rich girl always trying to manage other people's lives, an effort that never turns out well. For example, she convinces her less-well-off friend, Harriet Smith, that she deserves better than the honest farmer who loves her and whom Harriet loves, and almost upsets Harriet's chances of happiness as a result. Emma continues in this vein throughout the book, at times being on the verge of doing serious harm, until at last the moment of enlightenment comes - a moment filled with shame and confusion.Of course, the overall plot in this as in all other Austen novels is the problem of getting married, and in that respect these books represent the original \\"chick lit.\\" The difference, of course, lies in Austen's brilliant satire of characters like Miss Bates, the village gossip, and in her glorious ability to make the words sing."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I felt that Emma was a great book and an informative look into the past, when it was written around 1815. It was interesting to read how everyone called the other Mr., Miss, or Mrs. It was a little confusing because of this, because, for example, there is a Miss Bates and a Mrs. Bates, and sometimes it's hard to remember which is which!The story is a good one, a great novel that pulls you in, but with lengthy descriptions, and once in awhile it drags. Throughout the story, my 21st century \\"hurry up\\" mode would prefer it to move along more quickly.The storyline, similarly, is also a bit slow at times, but it's a wonderful romantic novel with a human character like Emma. She has flaws, but is enchanting, as are the rest of the characters in the book. it's also very humorous and has a great ironic twist.

It is truly a joy to read such wonderful writing and be so sweetly entertained.The character of Emma is so fully realized and believable. Her ineptness as a matchmaker simply adds to her appeal, and makes you love her even more for her shortcomings. And the inevitable romance that finally comes to be near the end of the novel is so completely rewarding, that you will be smiling broadly as you read the last few pages.Of Austen's novels, I've only read Emma and Pride and Prejudice.

Now if I can find a man as gentlemanly, handsome and kind as Mr. Kingley."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder.Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol or marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults.Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

Unlike all the others, Emma is a wealthy young woman who does not have the pressure of making a good marriage to ensure her happiness and in fact is determined never to wed. Likewise, due to the affections of her father and governess, Emma has been indulged and encouraged all her life into behaving just as she pleases, and as one of the few members of nobility in the small county of Highbury she is a big fish in a very small pond. Due to this, she considers herself superior to others and confident of her own perception of things: to put it simply, she is a snob. Yet she is not dislikeable - she is loving, well-mannered and kind, and deep down she realises that many of her actions are folly - it just takes her a while to get to these conclusions.Crediting herself for the recent marriage of her governess to the estimable Mr Weston, Emma takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for Highbury's society. Her eye is fixed on the eligible clergyman Mr Elton as an excellent match for her new friend Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure birth and minimal wealth. Despite the cynicism of Mr Knightley, an old family friend and the caution of her dear Mrs Weston, Emma is too wrapped up in her own opinions of how human hearts work to heed their advice...Further irony is found in the fact that whilst Emma is busy organising the hearts and minds of those around her, she has utterly no regard for her own and finds on many occasions that her perceptions of people were completely mistaken. But this is where readers' affection for her lies: she is beloved *for* her faults, not in spite of them, and such imperfections make her a rich, understandable character. Furthermore, these faults give her room to grow and improve as a person, and she is not the same Emma at the end of the book as she was at the beginning.\\"Emma\\" is also filled with many memorable supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes. There is the talkative Miss Bates and her niece Miss Jane Fairfax (who Emma is cool toward due to the fact she detracts attention away from herself), the pretentious Eltons, Emma's sister and brother-in-law, and the and the dashing Frank Churchill, (Mr Weston's son) on whom rest many hopes by his family of an alliance with Miss Woodhouse.Austen writes in beautifully delicate language, which is filled with many of her best moments of wit and insight into the human condition, especially in her themes of social hierarchy and acceptable forms of manners. It is a common belief that authors of the past are hardly ever critical of their own times or station - Austen gloriously proves these narrow-minded people wrong as she weaves together her characters and their various ways of life with commentary on them all. Like all such reads, it's not for a lazy reader as it needs your constant attention and care. But like all truly good literature, it is well worth the effort and considered the best novel in the Jane Austen canon."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Written by renowned author Jane Austen, Emma is quite an intimidating book to attempt at first glance and takes some patience to read; yet the patience is greatly rewarded. 21-year-old Emma Woodhouse is young, beautiful, rich and witty. She finds satisfaction in her successes and pleasure in the art of matchmaking for others. In her arrogance, she believes that she knows what is right for everyone, and is determined to \\"set the world straight\\", appointing herself cupid for all of Highbury. Fortunately, Emma is eventually \\"enlightened\\", drawn out of her self-delusion, and everything works out in the end. Jane Austen's admirable style and incomparable charm gets away with the happy ending without seeming like a sappy soap opera.The characters in Emma are many, yet all incredibly human. Through wonderfully witty dialogue, these characters are depicted with amazing clarity. Emma's confidence in her knowledge of the world and ability to plan out the lives of others is simply hilarious! It's impossible not to fall in love with her wit, humor, good intentions, and ignorance. Of course, the paranoid Mr. Woodhouse, the talkative Miss Bates, and the innocent Harriet are also memorable characters.

This is a story about a girl named Emma. She is pretty, wealthy, and a little bit haughty.

Even though she had such superior airs, I still couldn't help but liking Emma.She tries to play matchmaker to a new friend, and it's a disaster. Despite her actions, I couldn't dislike the character of Emma. She does feel guilty and remorse when she realizes her actions causes turmoil and pain for others. She feels horrible when she realizes her misconceptions of others. She is contrite and sorry for the trouble she causes to those around her.I think one of the things I liked best about this book was the characters. There were so many places where I laughed aloud at Emma's father for his eccentricity and odd behaviors, or reading Emma's thoughts on certain people. It was really a delight to read!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Almost universally, I find books to be far superior to their movie version, and I think most avid readers would be inclined to agree. However, in this case, without having seen the film first, I never would have considered reading this book because I often steer away from classics, finding them difficult to understand and hard to follow. I was quite enamoured with the highly romantic film Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam that I felt inspired to listen to this audiobook. The reader did an outstanding job of making me feel as though the story was happening around me and I was a part of this community, and actively participating in their festivities.Of course, my analytical mind couldn't help comparing and contrasting the book with the film. There are so many different characters, many of whom had very minor roles, or were spoken of but never appeared in any actual scene. Having seen the film first, it was far easier to \\"know\\" who everyone was, and how they related to each other. The book had many more scenes that filled in more details and had deeper character development, which drew me into the story more intensely than before. There were aspects of the film that seemed more romantic (the interactions between Emma and Mr Knightly, for example), and I preferred the way the film ended as compared to the book. But in both versions, Mr. Knightly was extremely swoon-worthy!!!I feel very inspired to read the book in print, now that I am sure to understand and appreciate it to its fullest. And I have just ordered the DVD film version starring Kate Beckensale, which is reputed to be the most romantic of all!! I have officially been \\"turned-on\\" to Jane Austen, and plan to read her other books, comparing and contrasting them to their respective film versions as I have so enjoyed doing with Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Siri Amster- OlszewskiAugust 24, 2006Emma, by Jane Austen, was one of the most enjoyable books I have read recently. I chose to read Emma because, having read and loved Pride and Prejudice by the same author, I wanted to explore her other books as well. The characters in Austen's stories are both intriguing and comical and her description of the era in which they take place creates a clear view of society in those timesI was enchanted with Emma because Austen beautifully blends together a simple story of a girl and a documentation of the societal behaviors of the time. It provides insights into the life and social customs of a lady living in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.One of the book's principle topics is marriage. The main character, Emma, approves of matchmaking for marriage and, through her, the reader gets a view into the different motives for marriage. For some people, marriage was simply a way to advance in social status; for others, marriage was for love. In Emma's time, marriages had to be matched according to social status. One could not marry below their status. Marrying too far above one's status could end up disastrously.The book tells the story of Emma Woodhouse who is a pretty, wealthy, poised, and clever young woman. Her mother died when she was too young to remember or miss her and was raised mainly by her governess, Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor behaved like a best friend rather than a governess due to her mild temper and love for Emma. Therefore, Emma grew up without any firm rules or structure. This freedom caused her to think quite highly of herself and of her opinions. It was her excessive self-confidence that led her to often make mistakes creating misfortunes for others and embarrassment for herself.Jane Austen, by the style of her writing, creates some well-defined character while including other character that are left more open to the reader interpretations. For example, while Emma's faults are very apparent, I found her innocence to be charming and it created sympathy for her character. Other examples of characters like Emma are Jain Fairfax, Harriet Smith, and Mr. Elton. In contrast the character of Mr. Knightly, the family friend is set in stone. Within the first few pages of the book he is established as the moral role model of the story. Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. Weston, Mrs. Weston (the former Miss Taylor), Frank Churchill, and Miss Bates are all other characters that give off a particular feeling, the feeling that Austen intended. These characters all have good and bad qualities, all of which are left up to the interpretation of the reader. The novel is written in third person, however the detached narrator often sees through Emma's point of view. Having the effect of a not so neutral bystander.I highly recommend Emma to anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, witty book that captivates and enchants. While reading this book you will find yourself captivated in the pages of one of Jane Austen's masterpieces."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I admit, it has been a few years since I read Emma. I haven't gotten to read the rest of Austen's works (yet!), but I think she is a fine writer. As a writer, that's a high compliment. I don't mean to say she's, well, fine.. I mean she is fine and honed and respectable.. and great.I picked this book up at my library when I was tired of random teen angst-based novels about first boyfriends and horrible pasts. I wanted something written with real language, with a style. I wanted something old and truly good, like the classics I had read and been read as a young child. I wanted something with SUBSTANCE.Because of this, it took me awhile to get back in the habit of really reading. For a week or so, Emma lay in a drawer, only partway read. It was difficult not to skim and my head would swim with the small print and dark pages. I lamented, but shrugged it off as life got busy.I came out of the shower one day, with an urge to get back into it, and ended up standing, hair wet, in front of my dresser, book rooted up out of the confines of my underthings, and wasting time.I read it constantly until I finished it, as I always do when reading a new book, but this one was different. This one invoked a hunger in me, and I was definitely satisfied when it came to an end.The constant little subplots and dramas surrounding arrogant, but rather good-natured Emma, the engaging characters, with such distinct and memorable personalities, and the wonderful twist of the ending (everyone else says they were so sure, but I, for one, was surprised, I admit) were all...wonderful. Austen is, I say again, a fine writer, and no wonder she is of the classics.I have heard, as well, that she did not think anyone else would love Emma. I ask, how could you not? The people who are so vehement about her flaws clearly have many of the same.

The long, twisted plot carefully and slowly develops each character using rich detail that makes the characters come alive with personality.

Emma is very much like Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility in style. The characters are beautifully developed as with Austen's other novels. There may be a bit too much emphasis on understanding one's place in society. Emma's pickings become very slim making her eventual engagement predictable, and her attempt to play matchmaker and improve a friend's standing is met with disastrous results. Bottom line - if you like Jane Austen, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I love Jane Austen and Emma is one of her better works.

I have found that as an adult, wow, people used a LOT of words to say something simple back then.The story is the classic tale that I have long loved, but reading it is a bit tedious."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"This is a novel written a long time ago. A lot of the terms and expressions need explanations for the modern reader. This edition of the masterwork by Austen does not have footnotes at the end, nor does it have an up-to-date scholarly introduction by some University professor."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I needed this book for a college class and it held up just fine. For the price, I was very pleased."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"It seems as though there is a law that every edition of one of Jane Austen's books must be published with a painting of a formal lady or ladies on the cover. In the case of Emma, such a painting is, perhaps, most appropriate. Emma, unsurprisingly, tells the story of a young woman named Emma. She is, as we are quickly told, spoiled and head-strong. And, as is always the case in Ms. Austen's heroines, young and unmarried.Emma has recently lost her sister/mother-figure to marriage and appears doomed to a lifetime of seclusion with her kindly, but odd and hermited father. To avoid such a result, at least for a time, Emma sets to matchmaking. She finds a neighborhood girl with only limited prospects and attempts to launch her into the stratosphere of an advantageous marriage. Irony abounds.This novel reads much like Jane Austen's other materials. The text is dense, but witty and, at times, quite funny. The action, such as it is, is slow paced and revolves around the joining together of various singles into couples. The themes are, as is often said of Austen, private. The manners, speech and attitudes are largely dated.I do not consider myself a great Jane Austen fan, but there is no doubting her greatness in crafting this novel. The characters are as lifelike as ever an author has produced. The plotting is intricate. Indeed, only a second or third reading reveals the many hints and suggestions laid before the unknowing reader on his first journey through the book. The text absolutely sparkles with wit - there are, in fact, moments where one might laugh out loud. This is without reservation a book that any reader would do well to peruse and study.That said, I find it difficult to overlook the attitudes of an earlier age and that impacts my enjoyment of the book. The casual tyranny of Jane Austen's protagonists is jarring to the modern eye. Indeed, much of Jane Austen's value system is repugnant to me. Of course, one tries to read the book with respect to the time at which it was written. In doing so, one finds a beautifully written book about a delightful set of characters who comedically come together. Ghastly prejudice, however, is very close to the surface, particularly in this book of Austen's."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Well, Jane Austen was not a Charles Dickens. This work lacks the superb construction of Charles Dickens' novels. The images are there, but Austen does not put you there the way Dickens can. Also Austen's work does drag at times even though it is only about half the length of Dickens' full length books. But aside from that, it is a pretty good novel. The book is pleasantly funny with some touching moments. Emma herself is well drawn as a young woman who thinks she knows what is best for everyone, and later learns that sometimes it is best to let people make their own decisions. In all honesty, this is not uncommon at all. I find it very interesting that the recent movie &quot;Clueless&quot; was able to portray this story in a modern day setting. (The names were all changed, but anyone who read &quot;Emma&quot; could tell the movie was based on it.) Mr Knightley is memorable as the embodiement of reason. Harriet is fine as the poor girl caught in the middle. If you like this book, I suggest the movie with Kate Beckingsale as Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma was a very well written book in the Victorian era.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening&quot;, Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, &quot;Nectar in a Seive&quot; by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; by Zora Neale Hurston.

We all know more or less what is going to happen at the end of the book - of course the hero and heroine are going to fall in love. Austen's use of irony is not exemplary either - is there anyone who didn't realise that Frank Churchill was hiding something, if we weren't sure quite what?

Big mistake. Stevenson's reading is energetic, precise, and diverse. As a very accomplished actress, she skillfully conveys a different and appropriate voice for each of the many characters. She easily glides from the whining Mr. Woodhouse to the pining Harriet Smith; from the jabbering Miss Bates to the judicious Mr. Knightley.I selected this audio volume of Emma because the box clearly states that the reading is _unabridged_. Naxos has published unabridged all six of Jane Austen's novels, and all are read by Juliet Stevenson except Pride and Prejudice, which is read by Emilia Fox, the actress who portrayed Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.

If you like sweet, romantic stories then you will like this. It might take you a while to get into the way it is written, but take the time to do that as it is well worth it."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Nothing struck me more about this book than its pre-occupation with class boundaries, dwarfing even its other principal obsession - the question of matrimony.Coming from a society often criticized for its rigid caste hierarchy, I cannot help wondering whether comparisons of social equations in India and England in the 18th century would yield many remarkable differences. Emma's disregard for the &quot;insignificant&quot; classes would do the most caste-conscious Brahmin proud.One of the questions that stems from a first reading is the position of Ms. Austen herself. Emma's character is obviously intended to come across as more than moderately conceited. Is the opinion she, and other characters imbued with the darker shades of gray, hold, of the importance of nobility and high birth, intended to reflect the authoress' own disapproval of the social rigidity of pre-Victorian England...or is it merely the use of an existing social situation as a tool to bring into focus, the underlying moral theme of the ills of conceit and indiscretion?Either way, it is a little disappointing to note the apparent indifference which marks the book's attitude towards the same class distinctions which it so effectively delineates. It would have been considerably more interesting for instance, if Ms. Austen's sparkling prose could have been employed to contrast the characters and social circumstances of Emma and Jane Fairfax, who is superior to the eponymous protagonist in merit but inferior in social standing, instead of restricting her role to a supporting one."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I thought Emma was a deligtful book with a great ending i knew it would end that way but it was fun to read and jane austen is now my hero."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"This was the second of Austen's books I had read, The first being 'Pride and Prejudice'.

I see such a realism that only Austen seems to have mastered in her characters.

Jane Austen created a charming and hilarious heroine in Emma. The comic timing and great characterization proves that Austen was -- and still is -- the most sought-after and influential author ever! (Just look at the work of Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes and other female authors of this era.)Emma is a force to be reckoned with. She takes it upon herself to play the role of Cupid. She chooses her candidates according to social status, age, charm, etc. The irony, of course, is that Emma doesn't have a lover of her own. What happens when one of her conquests as Cupid goes terribly wrong? And will Emma find her own knight of shining armor? This is one of the funniest situations in the book.If you love Jane Austen, and if you haven't read this novel, please do!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"An intellectually stimulating piece of literature, which challenges one's beliefs and enlightens one's mind with inventive theories concerning life-- if this is the type of commentary that peaks your fancy than I would not recommend reading Jane Austen's Emma. Indeed, the book is a coming-of-age story illustrating the comical mishaps of Emma Woodhouse, the novel's heroine, who takes destiny into her own hands. Particularly, she makes it her purpose to find suitable mates for her close acquaintances. As one might imagine, at times this creates a slightly awkward situation for the parties involved. Therefore, readers are introduced to a strong set of supporting characters inhabiting the small commonwealth of Highbury.Undoubtedly there is one amongst the bunch that the reader is able to identify with. For instance, Mr. Woodhouse, the town hypochondriac, who fears any situation which could spark the onset of illness; therefore, he virtually never leaves the comfortable confines of his home. In addition, Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton, the village gossips, who make it their business to learn all the comings and goings of the townsfolk. Besides the previously mentioned characters, there are a host of others who take you into their hearts and homes within the pages of the Jane Austen's novel.In fact her strong characterizations were perhaps the most compelling factors that kept me turning the pages. Indeed, Emma lacks the complex nature of many other novels written today. It is, however, a timeless example of the dynamics of human interaction. Yet the book's strongest claim to attract readers is a carefree amusement ending with a happily ever after."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"How could Jane Austen have thought that the character of Emma would please no one but the author?I was charmed to enter Emma's world, amused by her wit, stunned by her complacency, sympathetic when she made her mistakes. I finished the book with a real affection for this character, drawn so finely and so lovingly by a truly masterful writer.I had seen the movie version starring Gywneth Paltrow before reading the book. I expected to read the entire book with Paltrow's raspy laugh and swanlike neck in mind. Yet Austen transported me away from my cinematic preconceptions. There is so much more to &quot;Emma&quot; than a movie can capture: the incisive social commentary, the near perfect grasp of human nature, which hasn't changed much since Austen's time, in all its ugliness and sublimity.There has been much discussion over why Austen remains so popular with readers today. After all, her characters are geographically and socially isolated, immensely concerned with money, and (with a few exceptions) have no discernible occupations other than hunting for mates. It is hard to find similarities between these lives and those of modern Americans. What Austen does so well is to depict her particular place and time with astonishing clarity. Through Austen's (and Emma's) eyes, we see the commonalties that exist among all people, no matter the time or place."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; is definitely Jane Austen's best and most humorous book. The quirky characters, comic faux pas, and Emma's adventures in matchmaking keep you very entertained. Although it's funny, the vocabulary can be challenging. (Austen had an astounding vocabulary for never even having gone to a secondary school!) If you need a classic and want some laughs along the way, &quot;Emma&quot; is the book for you."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"'Emma' is the first Jane Austen novel I've read in 20 years. My earlier experiences (with 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility') were disappointing; they seemed to be overly genteel and without substance. Was 'Emma' any different? Er,.. no.The first thing that grabs you about 'Emma' is that it reads like a play. It is almost all dialogue. No action, no flowing descriptions of the early 1800s England country ... just talk. This makes for a very tiresome read.Worse, the story (about a sweet young thing who busily plays matchmaker without any consideration of her 'victims' or her own love life) is rather [bad]. Any dramatic moments are very tame. Emma's high society world is so devoid of emotion it is any wonder they bother living at all. And in Emma's world there are no bad guys, no poverty, ... and no one seems to work for a living. Think 'Ozzie & Harriet' transported back 150 years and plopped into rural England and you've got the idea.So why bother with 'Emma'? Purely out of respect for the author, and her legacy as one of the founding female writers of modern English literature. She attempts, although not very successfully, in writing on matters other than soap operatic tosh (\\"gothic novels\\") her female peers did during that time. True, other woman writers have since greatly eclipsed anything Jane Austen has done. But she was the pioneer. So please give at least one of her novels a try."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Some of my friends like Jane Austen, but I really don't understand why. I know she's an important part of literary history because she was the first writer to use third-person narration instead of writing novels in the form of letters or diary entries, but an innovative form does not make up for bad content. I don't think I dislike it because of the time period - I like Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. I don't think I dislike it because of the everyday activities of the characters - I like L. M. Montgomery, James Herriot, and Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine. It's just boring. Emma is a whiny rich girl whose problems are on the same level as Miley Cyrus getting the wrong car for her sixteenth birthday.Emma is the only JA book I have made it all the way through. I had to read this book for a high school Lit class, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. I have seen at least one movie for all of her books, though, so I know none of them are my cup of tea. Pride and Prejudice is the least aggravating. Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, and Lydia are sort of funny I guess, but not much. The part where Lydia elopes is okay, because it is the only time in her entire career that JA makes her characters show any strong emotion. And Mr. Darcy is kind of hot in the six-hour movie, but so what.Maybe I would have liked Jane Austen if I had been introduced to her when I was thirteen. There's nothing in Emma that pisses off the moral guardians, but at least sex and violence can be entertaining when they aren't too gratuitous, whereas shallowness and materialism ... are ... just ... boring. JA's heroines don't seem to think about anything other than finding rich husbands and wearing fancy dresses to the local ball.In the words of Charlotte Bronte, \\"Anything like warmth or enthusiasm, anything energetic, poignant, heartfelt, is utterly out of place in commending these works: all such demonstrations the authoress would have met with a well-bred sneer ... ruffles her reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him with nothing profound ... Jane Austen was a complete and most sensible lady, but a very incomplete and rather insensible (not senseless woman).\\""},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"...However not nearly as bad as _Sense and Sensibility_. The characters seem a little less sterotypical here, and while _S and S_ was harshly critical of the snobbery of the upper class the main heroine in _Emma_ is herself one of these people, which makes it interesting. She is a busy- body who meddles in the affairs of others and thinks she alone can judge the motives of everyone else with exactness. Although she is very proud, she is not overbearing or mean (except to those she snubs) and we like her.The plot doesn't hold much to it, though. It is filled with what has become typical plot devices of the romance novel-- the comedic misunderstandings between people as they miss each others meanings completely, as well as the \\"knowing/not-knowing\\" and the \\"does she love me/love me not\\" devices which are utterly over-used and stale to most contemporary readers.

Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen, to my knowledge, lived a somewhat isolated life. How could she write a book on a topic which she doesn't know about. This further mocks the upper class leaving the point of this book as being entertainment. Why put us through 500 pages of pain.

The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered. There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing.

It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Endowed with wealth, brains, and good looks, Emma Woodhouse (twenty-years old) busies herself with other peoples' lives as she --thinking herself worldly and clever-- goes about scheming and conjuring up romantic liaisons.But it will turn out that she's neither worldly nor clever, but nave! And that in the end the only love match that really matters is her own. Dialogue supplies an immediate image of Emma. In reply to Mrs. Weston's question: \\"She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\\" Mr. Knightley responds: \\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\\" he replied. \\"I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.\\"From the very beginning we can see that neither beauty nor vanity seem to be the theme of the story but--meddling. When Emma's governess-companion marries and leaves the Woodhouse household, Emma finds herself on her own; that is without a female voice of wisdom. Soon, she befriends a 17-years old illegitimate girl named Harriet, taking upon herself the duties of a matchmaker.Though Harriet is a sweet girl, she isn't so well-read or bright. Emma has her own opinion of her: She had always wanted to do everything, and had made more progress, both in drawing and music, than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to. She played and sang -- and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting.Next, Emma prevents Harriet from marrying farmer Robert Martin, who though decent, Emma thinks he's \`beneath' her. The novel depicts the British social system of hierarchies and inequalities, where titles of nobility and the landed gentry are the regents of the majority of the population. Intrigues, conspiracies, and much cleverness fill Emma's head as she cooks up schemes upon schemes to guide the docile Harriet.For this Emma proclaims her maxim: \\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to \\"Yes,\\" she ought to say \\"No\\" directly.'\\" Having formed an opinion of Emma, at this point, readers can see how misguided she is. Emma's father is a feeble old man given to whining and wishing everyone to see the world as he himself sees it.Although he's a benign character, he proves incapable of giving sound counseling to his daughter. So father and daughter agree, \\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\" To all of Emma's interventions, Mr. Knightley --a man of reason, common sense, and much nobility of heart-- disapproves, and once in a while warns Emma of her meddling. When Emma goes beyond her childish trickery and insults the town's spinster, Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley reprimands Emma, causing her to realize that she had turned into a selfish and careless brat. Much self-knowledge will come to Emma from this episode.The mysterious characters Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax add much thickness to the plot, which in some parts reads like a detective novel. The interaction between Emma and Frank and Jane helps Emma grow up and find a spiritual center.When Harriet tells her that she is in love with a man of a higher social standing and that he is being corresponded, Emma believes that man to be Mr. Knightley! Expecting to be told that Knightley will confirm his love for Harriet, she's awakened fully to the pangs of love when he --instead-- declares his love for her.And all is well that ends well: Harriet marries Mr. Martin and Emma Mr. Knightley.Although I admire Jane Austen's novels, I cannot help but to cringe at the British caste system that she describes. Titles of nobility, hierarchies, landed gentry, inequality, advantages over the common people, and so forth are all in my view detestable.The founding fathers of the United States of America wrote in the Constitution: The constitution of the United States provides that no state shall \\"grant any title of nobility; and no person can become a citizen of the United States until he has renounced all titles of nobility.\\" So, let's keep it that way."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Matchmaker, Matchmaker,Make me a match,Find me a find,Catch me a catch,Night after night in the dark I'm aloneSo find me a match,Of my own.- Fiddler on the RoofIn this romance, all the married characters are perfectly matched: Mr. and Mrs. Weston, John and Isabella Knightley, the reverend and his wife, and the list goes on. No wonder there is a friendly cupid in the village: Emma Woodhouse. This story explores the different aspects of love.Harriet Smith is Emma's friend. Miss Smith falls in love with three men in one year; quite a record even for Highbury. Hardly a flirt, Harriet Smith's heart is pure and indestructible. Bad advice makes her ditch Robert Martin, but a chance encounter reveals that her feelings for him are unchanged. \\"Unconditional\\" is the best word for this kind of love.Mr. Knightley's love is unrequited. For years he's been longing for a woman out of reach. And Emma does not even know she is in love. She only finds out when Harriet lays claim to the one man her heart desires.And the case of Mr. Woodhouse reveals a bizarre and unhealthy obsession. He refuses to believe his family and servants can ever find happiness away from Hartfield. But this actually reveals his own dependent form of love. When Emma marries he won't let her leave the house, so unfortunately her husband has to move in till Mr. Woodhouse dies.But it is not a tale of love unless the green-eyed-monster makes an appearance. Emma's jealousy is the most obvious. Jane plays the piano better than she does. Jane does almost everything better than Emma. It is no wonder that Highbury's most eligible bachelor is enraptured by this pale beauty. Needless to say, Jane Fairfax is an infrequent visitor at Hartfield.Miss Fairfax in turn discovers her jealousy of Emma at Box Hill, when Emma flirts loudly with a man who unbeknownst to her, is Jane's secret lover. Jane decides to break all ties with Emma. This might have been the best plan, because until matters turn right, sickness makes Jane paler than ever which may frighten visitors.But perhaps the worst culprit is Mr. Knightley whose disparaging remarks concerning Frank Churchill at first seem to be the wise counsel of a man of the world. Frank found true love as a young man while Mr. Knightley is fast approaching middle age unable or unwilling to find someone to marry. His constant criticism of Frank ends abruptly when he finds a woman willing to marry him.Highbury's cupid is in some ways similar to Jane Austen. They both are strong independent women who believe that marriage with the right person can create happiness. This is a light read. For the most part, Austen avoids physical description in favor of dialogue. It is amazing how depth of character can be portrayed this way. Jane Austen's ability to make fiction appear real is a rare talent."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I'm so sorry, but I simply fail to see what's so wonderful about Jane Austen.

The use of some of Austen's words and phrases from 19th century England (around 200 years ago) may make it somewhat incomprehensible for many readers, though. Since this book is focused more on characters than on the plot, and Jane Austen's own style is very elaborate, it tends to drag on with detailed descriptions of people and events. This can get very tiresome and tedious. So, if you're going to read Emma, you may need to save quite a bit of time because it might be necessary to read some parts a few times to understand them. Because Emma is such an old tale, there has been a movie made of it to make it easier to understand. Of course, it is not as detailed as the book, so the movie can not replace it. The movie Clueless, a modernized version, could also help decode some of the tough parts; just remember, watching it doesn't replace reading it; as characters were added, and names changed. Also, if you are looking for ways to create more effective characters in a story you may be writing, this would be a good story to find examples in. There are many characters who have very distinct and individual personalities in Emma. In this way, it relates to another of Jane Austen's novels, Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a long book with many creative characters, settings and plot twists.

I find her works very interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Some might think I'd be ashamed, giving to this celebrated Jane Austen novel a mere 4 stars. But with the greatest, the classic authors, I use a special yardstick, awarding the ultimate prize only to their absolute must-read works.Indeed I do think EMMA is done with more elegance of finish than PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. But it cannot match that 5-star work for drama and characterization. Looking back on EMMA, is there very much to the story that really stands out? Rather, isn't it the writing that's the star? Doesn't the craftsmanship, and particularly Jane Austen's gift for managing the flow of narrative, stand out even above the narrative itself?! Very odd.The story is essentially that of Emma Woodhouse's miscalculations regarding everybody and everything -- and, I guess, how in the end these do not matter anyway. The one big dramatic turn in the book is where young Mr. [withheld] is revealed to be engaged to Miss [withheld]. It's a testament to Austen's creativity that this revelation has the cataclysmic effect it does on the reader. Thus does she make a great big universe out of her tiny local ecosystem in which people are wholly absorbed in discussing and planning and brooding over other people's relationships -- that little world in which matrimony is the ultimate destiny.Only one character comes back to me as having been memorably etched, and that's Mrs. Bates, mother of Miss Bates. Her train of conversational irrelevancies is comically rendered in some of the longest and best speeches in the book, giving quite a realistic effect that, incidentally, doesn't advance the story in any way I can tell and therefore subtracts just a bit from the marvelous consistency of the whole. Of course Emma too is someone we can look back on and remember after we're finished reading the book, but that's a little different because we're always seeing her from within, hers being the central intelligence of the story.Striking passages abound throughout the novel. One can make a fun exercise out of just savoring the narrative effect of her chapter openings. Here are two of them, picked totally at random. Chapter 33's: \\"Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\" Or Chapter 38's: \\"No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.\\"But suddenly now I must take something back. I almost omitted mention of what is actually the biggest dramatic turn in the book, and one which provides its very crux, \\"It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. [withheld] must marry no one but herself!\\" That does indeed come as a shock! So yes, now that I think of it, EMMA contains somewhat more of dramatic highlighting than my above reflections would suggest. And definitely, the more I page through the book at this moment, reviewing my red underlinings in it, the more I get drawn back into Jane Austen's world of exquisite prose."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I am a huge Jane Austin fan and was not disappointed with Emma.

The youngest of two sisters, Emma lives alone with her father, doting on him, after her sister Isabella marries. Their mother is long deceased, and Emma has grown up with a kindly governess, Miss Taylor, who bestows strong motherly affection on her.Set in 18th century rural England, the novel affords us a picturesque, detailed view of the daily tenets of English life at the time, complete with carriages, gowns, housekeepers and social traditions. Austen weaves a delicious web of Emma's life and that of her friends in Highbury, where they live. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, is a gentle, kind man with an excessively considerate compassion to others that often borders on paranoia. He is constantly afraid of catching cold, or falling ill, and lectures those around him incessantly on the need for precaution. We learn of Mr. Knightley, a long-time, close neighbor of the family, whose brother is married to Isabella, and of the Westons, Bates, and Perrys, all families of the area, as they intermingle in Emma's world.Harriet, a girl of less social advantage, is taken by Emma under her wing. Emma's favorite hobby is matchmaking, and we watch her make one blunder after the next to poor Harriet. When Robert Martin, a young farmer, proposes to her friend, Emma retaliates very sharply, advising Harriet against marrying him and \\"falling into lower circumstance.\\" Harriet is miserable, but appears to be convinced. Mr. Knightley, ever present in Emma's life and home, scolds her sharply for her interference, but Emma stands her ground defiantly, insisting that she knows what is best for Harriet.When a Mr. Elton appears on the scene, pouring lavish attentions onto them, Emma is convinced of his being far superior to Mr. Martin, and does all in her power to coax Harriet into returning his feelings. All the while, she is smugly telling Mr. Knightley that she predicts a far better outcome for her friend than his preference of Mr. Martin. Harriet becomes attached to Mr. Elton, and all is going to plan, when Emma receives a tumultuous shock: Mr. Elton asks for her own hand in marriage. Emma, horrified, asks him about his feelings for Harriet, but he denies vehemently, saying that all his advances were meant towards Emma! Our heroine then sinks into utter guilt and mortification, watching Harriet's heart break due to her own wheedling and landing her in this mess.Mr. Elton wastes no time; he soon marries another rich woman, obviously keen to secure a fortune. Meanwhile, Emma's attention is caught by Mr. Frank Churchill, a recent arrival to Highbury, but she comfortably assures herself of her immunity to love and marriage. She flirts with him, but does not entertain any serious ideas towards him--only to find herself duped, again, when his secret engagement to her neighbor is revealed.Overwhelmed by all her blunders, Emma is feeling a great deal of confusion and remorse, but there is a final blow that she is unprepared for. Out of the blue, Harriet shares her new feelings for Mr. Knightley with her, and her hope that these feelings may be returned.Emma's world crashes at that moment. She panics and feels extremely agitated, which suddenly leads her to realize her own love for Mr. Knightley, a love unknown and unacknowledged by her. As she stares into herself, she reflects on his constant presence in her life, her attachment to him, her extreme care for his opinion. The thought of losing him is too painful to bear, and Emma, for the first time in the story, is plunged into total misery. But the tables turn yet again. As she awaits his breaking the news to her, of his attachment to Harriet, Mr. Knightley comes forth with a powerful declaration of love for Emma, a love he has had for years. In a very touching scene that causes the reader's heart to soar, Mr. Knightley, normally not a man of many words, pours his feelings to Emma in anguish. He asks her to marry him, with a pained conviction that he will be refused. Emma is overjoyed, assures his troubles away, accepts without a second thought.Amidst her shock, and just as she is dealing with the conflicting emotions of her own extreme happiness, and great mortification for Harriet, Mr. Knightley saves the day by encouraging Mr. Martin to approach Harriet again. The girl's feelings for him, which had never ceased, finally prevail, and the couple are united.Despite her haughty airs and egotism, Emma is \\"faultless despite all her faults\\" in the eyes of Mr. Knightley, and we can't help liking her, too, for she is always trying to do good, and her heart is in the right place. Mr. Knightley himself, kind, generous, sincere and honorable--a close reminder of Mr. Darcy--wins us over, and we breathlessly wait for things to work out between him and Emma. The author, with a remarkable talent for making us hold our breath, turning the tables and providing unexpected turns, concludes the book with happy endings for all, leaving us smiling.Austen's language, two centuries ago, is as delicious as the novel itself, the quaint writing taking us on a foray into older English and its idioms, structures and expressions. One of my favorite novels, Emma is a delight to read, from start to finish, and a story that captivates the imagination right until the last page."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Written in a very different dialogue, sometimes hard to understand what she means the way she express's her thoughts and feelings.

I also liked Harriet Smith because she had a simple and almost innocent way about her...the way she blindly followed Emma and molded the desires of her heart according to Emma's approval. I felt a connect to Harriet in that way...especially thinking back to high school...the popular girls trying to get you to think a certain way and telling you would make a good boyfriend.Emma Woodhouse is a likeable character. She is a matchmaker who gives up on the hobby due to her matches never fall for each other and drama is the result. The secound half of the book is about Emma finding out her own heart.The reason I only gave two stars was because to me this was an okay read. I saw some of the new movie and the theme interested me...so because it was free on my Kindle and because I wanted to try a sophisticated and chic lit type read...I read it.If you can keep up with drama and who likes who...and if you enjoy a well written novel with a long letter thrown in for the juicy details you crave...than leave the gossip behind and stick your nose into one of Austen's lesser known novels. As for me I prefer Dickens and anything with a bit more action."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I bought this book to be a decoration on my shelf.

However, I reviewed this book as a 4 star simply because it lacks the strong story that other books from Ms. Austen display.Emma is a bit scheming and conniving and the story actually is more about events that just happen because of her medling ways. When I reviewed Pride and Prejudice I wrote how I loved the language - and this is no different. The word structure is exquisite. If it wasn't for the fact that I find Emma sometimes a bit too nosey I would love this book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have.

As a teacher, I would love to offer a course in Jane Austen in general; in the current educational environment, I doubt that will happen. If I were allowed to do so, I would have students compare this novel with Pride and Prejudice simply because I think the papers would be interesting to read.

I figured them to be drab, sappy, overly sentimental and trite. How wrong I was! Upon urging of friends, I picked up \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and enjoyed it immensely (though I disagree with another poster that it was faster paced than Emma). I immediately purchased \\"Emma\\" and was delighted. The character, as is mentioned, is flawed...but charming BECAUSE of these flaws. Emma is a wonderful character and the book is a joy to read.

It's my favorite novel from Jane Austen followed by Pride & Prejudice. In fact I only like those two novels out of the six she wrote, but anyway, Emma was a really good read. The best part about this novel is that it isn't about a girl who is looking for love, it's about a girl who unexpectedly finds love where it has been all the time. Talk about right under your nose. Emma is friendly, kind, naive, smart, loyal, whitty, clever, innocent, and definatley worth reading. I truly love this book because I love romance in it's purest form, true love, when you know that these two characters will spend the rest of their lives together and will love each other faithfully! That's why I love this book, and Pride & Prejudice is the same way, maybe I'll write a review for that too, hope this helps you out, and buy the book!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Highbury, England early 1800's a quiet and pleasant place to live. Where Emma Woodhouse takes residents with her father. Emma is clever and yes, rich. She enjoys many of the same things young adults do today do including match making and visiting friends in 1800's fashion.Emma is the main character as you probably can tell by the title of Emma. She has a bad habit of match making just ask \\"poor\\" Harriet. Emma attempts to stop threw out the book but always ends up going back. She vowed never to marry early in life. Besides her father Mr. Woodhouse needs her and she enjoys calling on her single friends. If she had a husband to complicate things she could not go see those friends. Unless the man she married enjoyed calling on those same friends.Emma seems like she could walk off the page and appear in the 21-century, even thew she lived in the 1800's. Her habits are the same as many young women today of not marrying and the dreaded habit of match making.Emma is full of personality even thew she can be a little mean to long time friends and not relies it without someone telling her. But Emma appears real and grounded.I would recommend Emma to young women who are fast readers and who know someone or they themselves enjoys match making. Because Emma learns control the desire to mess with people's feelings.Get Emma today even if you don't read it you can tell your friends you own on of the classics by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I first learned of 'Emma' by watching the movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow - I was instantly captivated by the high-class style of that era, Emma's life and her relationship with Mr. Knightly. After watching the movie probably 16 times, I went and read the book and was so glad I did! It's become one of my all-time favorite books simply because I love Emma's character and get lost in her life and world every time, and come back later craving to read it again! The book expands and clarifies so much we don't get to see in the movie and gives you the original view of Emma - apart from the movie. As a woman, I love romance and tales of older times where nobility and class presided yet values were down to earth, respectable and loving. 'Emma' combines both nobility and the 'down to earthness' in Mr. Knightly. If you love romance, strong female characters and getting lost in another world of balls, dances, society - definitely read this and watch the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow! It's gorgeous and guaranteed to uplift you."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Though not her favorite novel, Austen's Emma shines as one of her most beloved.

This particular edition is a great keepsake, one you can pass down to your own daughter."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Because of its popularity, I believe the literary merits of &quot;Emma&quot; are perhaps overlooked. So much more than a mere &quot;romance&quot; novel, it is also one of the most humorous works of fiction ever written, rife with some of literature's most memorable and beloved characters. &quot;Emma&quot; remains my favorite of Austen's books and is a testament to my opinion that she is one of the greatest novelists of all-time, male or female."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, as I do all of Jane Austen's works. The narrator is an interesting character, making comments on the action and people around her. I was surpised at how much the narrator disliked her heroine at the beginning of the story. The growth of Emma throughout the novel gives hope to every spoiled child or even prideful adult. My only regret is that I saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow (and even Clueless) before reading this. I think I would have enjoyed it even better not knowing what laid ahead. I highly recommend saving the movies for after the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Though exhasperating at times, Emma enchants us all. It is through Emma's repeated blunders,imprudence, and vanity that she becomes one of the most charming heroines of all times. Jane Austen has created a hilarious set of characters: the preposterously overprotective father, the poor chatterbox neighbour, the pretty, lighthearted proteg&eacute;, and the man of reason whose love finally dictates against his logic (to name a very few). Although the plot is at times made dreary by Miss Bates' prolongued monologues, the novel is otherwise a light read. One must not expect to turn the last page having learnt some universal truth, but rather having enjoyed a few good laughs, some heart-leaping, and a few sighs. Emma is an outstanding proof of Jane Audten's wit; the candour and modesty in her novel make it a truly refreshing read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read. The way Jane Austen displays Emma is funny. Emma's faults make her realistic and someone you can relate to. The way she relates to the other characters makes the book very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I purchased &quot;Emma&quot; about a year ago and finally picked it up about 2 weeks ago. I was engrossed in the story from the beginning. Although it does take patience to get through some of the less exciting parts of the book, it is a very enjoyable book to read. By the end of the book, these characters will feel like your own family. I learned a lot about English culture and about how the upper class families used to live. Jan Austen is a very good author and could be classed with the best of them. Oddly, this book has a strikingly similar plot as the movie &quot;Clueless&quot;. After you read the book you will see a resemblance between Cher and Emma, Dion and Mrs. Weston, Elton and Mr. Elton, and Josh and Mr. Knightley. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"A good read.

I had recently read (correction 're-read) \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" which undoubtedly rated Jane Austen's finest and has been a favorite of mine for years! It was actually one of the reasons I had delayed so long to start another by Austen for though I had heard great things about \\"Emma\\" (as well as others) I found myself very reluctant to start for fear of being disappointed. I was very bull headed in believing I would not like Emma the main character going into the story because I hate when female characters for lack of a better word \\"meddle\\" in other characters business. Boy was I wrong.I came to adore Emma and only wish I had not gone into the book so stubborn to dislike her! For this reason I am tempted to start reading it again without the previous false pretenses. So to those who were like me and are nervous due to what they have heard, please don't be!

She thinks she knows it all. But really it's just she hasn't experienced the world. But this belief makes her get involved in the problems of others and disrupts her peaceful life.

The only difference is that Emma is a story written in 1816, and Clueless is, like, a totally 90's story. I didn't know that Clueless was an adaptation of the classic novel until I read an article, and hey, the writer did a good job of updating Emma. 'Course, both Emma and Clueless are terrific and funny stories about the trials and triabulations of mediocre matchmakers. Additionally, I think Austen does a great job of creating characters that you love and hate with a passion. This is one of the funniest novels that has been written by Jane Austen. I like Emma, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know the story upon which Clueless was based."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"This book is one of many by Jane Austen that will put you into a total field of happiness.

The English is a bit hard to read but once you get into the book, the English becomes easy to read."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I enjoyed the quaintness of Emma's society. The heroine, Emma, was hilarious, especially when her schemes backfired. However, Austen's EMMA resembles modern day soap operas. As an example the heartbreaks of Harriet and the maliciousness of Mrs. Elton can be found on any episode of _The Young and the Restless_(granted, though, without the strong sexual content). Just like a soap opera, EMMA and the contents wherein get tedious. Suggestion to the would-be reader: don't linger in Emma's world for too long; the story will be better if done so."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I'm writing in reference to the Kindle version of this book. Since I like the book itself, I gave 2 stars; however, this version was lacking in extras. I was seriously disappointed to find no footnotes, no introduction, no nothing.

I certainly would have chosen another one of the available editions."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I guess I am an exception. I found the book, Emma, to be overly long and tiresome. The book focuses mostly on social calls between Emma and her neighbors and their dialogue. Emma is just so snobbish and aware of her high status that it was hard to find her likeable at first. I found myself liking her more towards the end of the book as she saw the error of her ways. I loved Pride and Prejudice...but this book just didn't really click with me."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Austen weaves a brilliant tale of Emma Woodhouse, a young socialite, and her community in Victorian England. Emma cannot resist inserting herself into the affairs and pursuits of her neighbors and dear friends and the resulting chaos is delightful. Emma is indeed a flawed character, but so are the others in this tale, which makes it all the more authentic. Emma's belated realizations of the results of her machinations are humorous as well as often disastrous. Feeling she must match her new protogee, Harriet Smith, with a suitable husband, Emma manages to mangle the situation not once but three separate times. Of course in the end it all comes out well but it is a wonderful ride. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I downloaded Emma for free on my kindle from amazon. This book is about Emma a vain wealthy and confident young woman who lives in a small town in Highbury, England. She cares for her father who is worried that she is not going to get married. She plays match maker for her friends and acquaintances by setting them up with different suitors. Emma realize that her matchmaking skills was not good and cause a lot of grief. So she vowed never to get marry, but ended getting married to a very unexpected person .This book is a typical romance comedy friction novel. It started of slow and then the pace pick back up again. You will see Emma finding herself and becoming a better person. I think the Emma character means well and wants her friends to be in high society like her, but she comes of snobby and meddlely. while reading the book I keep saying to myself girl just fall back and fix your own self up.

While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"As much as I love Jane Austen, Emma is a horrible read. This was the only one of Austen's books I couldn't finish in college. I thought I'd try it again a decade later and I still don't like it (although this time I did finish reading it).Like some of the other reviewers have stated, Emma is just not a likeable character. And unlike most of Austen's heroines, she seems to have no redeeming qualities, making it incredibly hard to read about her for hundreds of pages.I guess one could argue that the book is well written by virtue of the fact that I despise Emma so much as a character. But I'm not arguing Austen's merits as a writer. I am simply stating that this book is not worth reading when there are so many other classics out there that you might actually enjoy!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"A lot of people have said that Emma is one of their favorite books but I would have to differ. This book put me to sleep every time I picked it up. It was dull and boring, this is only my opinion. I would not let this book effect and make me not want to read Jane Austen again. Since it is only one book out of many of hers. I felt this book was for a different crowd of people. Maybe I should have waited till I was older and grasped the concept more.Miss. Taylor Emma's good friend and governess get's married and move's out. Emma has no clue what to do with herself. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, gets upset and thinks Miss. Taylor now known as Mrs. Weston is making a huge mistake of leaving the family and things will never be the same without her living at the house. Emma then meets a girl named Harriet Smith, who is not as smart as Emma but she likes how she is willing to learn and listen to what she had to say. They went on daily walks around the town. Mr. Martin a very dull farmer that Emma's brother-in-law works proposes to Harriett who has had a crush on him before Emma tried to set her up with Mr. Elton. Emma influences her to refuse the offer of marriage, so she does. This was before n and got to know each other very well.Emma thinks she can match anyone up with love, if they gave her a chance. She herself has vowed to remain single. She tries to set Harriet, up with Mr. Elton, but Mr. Elton likes Emma instead of Harriet and wants to marry her. Emma refuses and Mr. Elton leaves and gets married to some person who nobody thinks is worthy of him. When Emma finds out Mr. Elton got married she doesn't want Harriet to find out since she is still hung up on him they found out Mr. Elton had married. Emma is very controlling when it comes to love, and this is one reason why I didn't like the book she aggravated me.Mrs. Weston's stepson is coming she is nervous he won't like her and confides in Emma. Emma is out for a carriage ride and she gets stuck. Mr. Churchill Mr. Weston's son comes and helps her get out, he doesn't tell her who he is till after and she is amazed by how good looking he is. She is confused with hr feelings for him after that. She thinks she may be in love but she doesn't feel like she is. Mr. Churchill likes a woman named Jane who is staying with Miss. Bates, a dear friend of Emma. Emma doesn't really like Jane since she always has one over her. For example at a party that was thrown they asked Emma if she would like to play the piano, when she is done Jane is asked to play the piano and everyone loved Jane's when people only like Emma's performance.At a picnic with Jane, Mr. Churchill, Miss. Bates, Mr. Elton, his wife, and Mr. Knightly, Emma's very good friend. Emma insults her friend, Miss. Bates. Mr. Knightly tells Emma off. Emma realizes she loves Mr. Knightly but is worried he loves Harriet. They secretly have feelings for each other but neither of them do anything. Finally they do confess there feelings and they get engaged. Harriet ends up with Mr. Martin and Mr. Churchill ends up with Jane.Mrs. Weston becomes pregnant and Emma does not want anyone to know about her and Mr. Knightly's engagement until the baby is born. Jane and Mr. Churchill are also keeping their engagement a secret.I couldn't really relate to this book. I would have done a lot of things different then what she did. For starters I would not have gone and meddled into every ones love life. Its their life and people need to respect that and not mess with it. I understand she thought she was helping everyone but truth be told she wasn't and it just was annoying to see how she kept going off and doing that throughout the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I've read it a million times, it was purchased as a gift for someone; but, since I never received the other two books, I didn't bother giving it."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"This book arrived new and in good condition.

The book is timeless and the needlework cover will be as well. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"When I first opened the novel, I realised that the book was split into three volumes, which comprised of eighteen chapters apiece. I wondered how long it would take me to get through the read. As it worked out, the organisation of the novel, and the clarity of the language makes the novel a very legible read, and can flow through the chapters in each of the volumes with much ease. It could take less than three to four days to complete one volume, in nine by nine chapters, with active concentration.As the volume chapters are split, volume one makes for a very interesting read, as divided in between the chapters, we're almost immediately introduced to Harriet and Emma's relationship, and Emma's designs on how she plans to interfere in Harriet's relationship, and make her wed mr Elton, of Emma's choice, not mr Martin, of Harriet's choice. As she breaks up Harriet's relationship with mr Martin, we find ourselves sympathising with Harriet, but with Emma a lot less, and our opinion of her schemes, makes readers feel critical of her.In volume two, we sympathise with Emma a lot less than we are critical of her. On first read, volume two can get extremely tedious, because the themes run on, and have a lot less in common with volume one. By volume three, we get a better understanding of volume two, and the themes eventually link together, into something more conclusive. On first read, however, volume two can get quite tedious, and more put-downable as readers opinion grows colder towards Emma, because of how unfairly she breaks down Harriet's relationship, and also because of her prejudices towards miss Jane Fairfax, whom we find ourselves liking, and is through the novel a lot nicer, and more consistent than Emma.By volume three, our understanding of Emma grown warmer, as her feelings towards not wanting to ever be married begins to change, as her understanding of mr Frank Chruchill, and mr George Knightley begins to change. She finds herself going to balls, and centred into some flirtation between these two men. By the end of the novel she discovers Frank Churchill has been secretly wed to Jane Fairfax, and we are also surprised to see that Emma's marital status also concludes with a wedding to George Knightley, although Mr Woodhouse, Emma's father was to a certain degree against this union of the two, believing that Emma had vowed never to get married to anyone, so that she can continue looking after Woodhouse, and not leave.If there were any further protests to the conclusion of who got married or not, or if there were ever any intentions for the centreing married couples to divorce, this is not identitifien by the author, because of the cosy-close ending of the novel, centred about the characters getting married, and divorce is never a theme that has ever been explored in Austen's novels, even in less happier, eccentric, or less committed relationship.Overall, with a little patience, the novel is a very good read, especially, if readers can get through the tedious themes of volume two, and into the merits, and warmer themes in volume three."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

However, I can recommend this one as it has a great ending."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"The theme Jane Austen has in Emma aims to explore the psyche of an adolescent teenager who is past the blush of being a child, but could not cope with the traumas brought on by the war. It explores the emptiness of being without a mother, and at the same time the writer must be writing from the perspective of a young person who knew all the right things to say but coming out short. Essentially, Emma wishes to be the person who has given her birth, but is left alone with her \\"peacock-personality type\\" father who was constantly jealous of her mother's friendship while living. Her father could not survive the lost of her mother again, but at the same time, knowing this allows her to marry Emma to marry off Mr. Knightley, an equally jealous \\"peacock\\" man who would again retell the tale of her mother's marriage."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I was needing to read the book for a book club within a month. The price was reasonable. The book arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is the fourth published Jane Austen novel. Emma Woodhouse is the spoiled, rich, younger daughter of the widowed Mr Woodhouse. Her father, Henry, is nave, self-centred, a borderline hypochondriac and the ultimate pessimist. Emma lives at home with him, looks after him and has no plans to ever marry because of this. She is a strong-willed and snobbish 20-year-old with a rather dull life who fancies herself an excellent matchmaker. Most of her friends and acquaintances indulge her. Only George Knightly, the elder brother of her sister Isabella's husband, John, is critical of her behaviour. He takes her to task for meddling in others' lives. As with all novels of this era, compared with today's offerings, the reader has to be patient and allow the story to build. There's also getting one's head around the language used. It took me a few instances of the word \\"nice\\" to realise that what it meant then (foolish, stupid, senseless) was not what it means today. The garrulous Miss Bates is a source of humour and there is plenty of talking at crossed purposes. This novel seems to point to the importance of status and appearance in Miss Austen's world. Another Austen classic."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"While this isn't the only great narration of \\"Emma\\" available, I've enjoyed it for years. Prunella Scales' Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton are especially wonderful. Not every actor can do a creditable West Country accent, but Scales' redition of Mrs. Elton is one I recommend to people as just right. I think that you'll very much enjoy this version."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I am currently reading Emma for my book club. I had to watch the movie to understand who certian people were but the book is even better. She is wity and funny. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"When commenting about the brilliant Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice is the most commonly discussed. Though I must admit that Pride and Prejudice is my undisputed favorite from among those novels I have read by Ms. Austen, she does have many other great works. Emma is yet another example of her unparalleled skills as a writer. Most people find Austen's themes of romance most interesting but her novels, Emma in particular, are peppered with a great deal of satire. Austen manages to not only create an engaging story but also to criticize the ridged society in which she lived. In all of the Jane Austen novels that I have read she has created a humorous character who seems to talk far too much and make herself ridiculous to everybody; that character in this story is Mrs. Bates. Though Mrs. Bates long speeches did often get annoying they were not without humor and it seems obvious that Austen was poking fun at many of the women in her society. Though it took me a while to get through this book I did thoroughly enjoy it and was further convinced of Jane Austen being one of the greatest writers to ever live. This novel rather contrasted both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility in the fact that the heroin was not an underprivileged young woman who was lifted up from inferior circumstance. Instead, Emma was born into a high circle of society and a great deal of money. It was not her who was looked down on but she who looked down on others and while she was generally well meaning she was not without her pride and sense of superiority. I had a bit of a difficult time relating to Emma's character as opposed to those of Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood who were both more level headed and loveable. I always enjoy Jane Austen's novels and I am very glad that I read Emma. I would most certainly suggest it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Received book in excellent condition and fast shipping. I am enjoying this book, what a great read! Thank you."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma was the first Jane Austen book I've ever read &, originally, I liked it much more than Pride And Prejudice but I've since changed my mind. While I love this book, it's not my favorite anymore.Emma is such a fun character because she is so sure that what she's doing is right when all the while she's just making a mess of things. The best part about her is that when she sees that she is wrong, she can laugh at herself & learn from her mistakes.Mr. Knightly is one of my favorite Austen characters. His name says it all, \\"knightly.\\" He is the perfect gentlemen...possibly moreso than Mr. Darcy, even.The characters in this book, as in all Jane Austen books, represent both the follies & goodness in human nature, which is what I love about her writing. This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend for anyone new to Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is in need of a new particular friend now that her governess has married. As luck would have it, she meets pretty and artless Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure parentage. Emma is convinced that Harriet is a gentleman's daughter (after all, she did attend a good boarding school), and takes it upon herself to teach her the ways of a lady and to introduce her to a good eligible gentleman that would elevate her station in life. Harriet has her eyes set on a simple farmer, but that is not enough for her, at least not according to Emma. She knows what's best for everyone around. Emma fancies herself a matchmaker. In fact, she takes credit for introducing Mr. Weston to her former governess. And, at twenty-one, she has no intention of ever marrying. She has to look after her father and their Hartfield estate. She is an heiress to thirty thousand pounds and is well respected among her peers. What more could she want? But Harriet needs Mr. Elton. A girl like Harriet cannot become an old maid like the tiresome Miss Bates. Emma is determined to make it happen, and she doesn't care what Mr. Knightley, her brother-in-law's brother, has to say on the matter.Jane Austen is known for creating flawed characters, most of which are not central in her stories. The closest Austen came to creating an anti-heroine was Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility. But the novel is told mostly from Elinor Dashwood's POV, which makes Marianne seem less insufferable. Emma is Austen's official anti-heroine -- a young woman who thinks she knows so much when she actually knows nothing. She is essentially clueless to everything that goes on around her. Mr. Knightley is always there to scold her and set her right, of course. Emma, though not my favorite Austen, is a lovely story. The theme is very popular and it has inspired many authors and Hollywood producers throughout the years. (The 1995 teen flick Clueless is a modern-day adaptation of Emma.) It has also inspired an infinite number of sequels written by new authors. Austen does sort of drag the story a bit toward the end, which is why I take away half a star. That, in a nutshell, is the only drawback in this book. The rest is wonderful. You will get all of the Austenian elements here: a shocking match, irritating snobs, hilarious social commentary, balls and assemblies, silly ladies and suspiciously charming men. Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Miss Bates, Harriet Smith, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax are my favorite characters -- after Mr. Knightley, of course. He is my third favorite of the Austen men (after Mr. Darcy and Captain Wentworth). If you're new to Jane Austen, then Emma is a good way to start. You won't be able to resist reading her five other books. I read this several years ago, but the experience was more enjoyable this time around. Jane Austen is as addictive as chocolate and I look forward to reading Mansfield Park soon."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I haven't read a Jane Austen novel in years. The last time I read one of her novels I was very young and it was not by choice. If you want to rediscover Jane Austen, start with Emma. This novel is about a very snobby, spoiled, and at times malicious young lady by the name of Emma Woodhouse. Emma lives in the village of Highbury with her hypchondriac father. After Emma's Governess, who throughout the book is known as Mrs Weston marries, Emma is left with a lot of time on her hands. I'm afraid she does not use this time wisely.Emma finds a new friend and protege in Harriet Smith, a young lady with an unknown past who Emma takes under her wing. Emma brings it upon herself to give young Harriet somewhat of a social makeover. She induces her to aspire to greatness and put on airs proper to a lady of Emma's class, although she's not even sure what class Harriet belongs to. When Harriet is offered marriage by a farmer by the name of Mr Martin, Emma is horrified! She convinces Harrriet that such a man is hardly worthy of her and intices her to find romance with the handsome but vain vicor, Mr Elton. Emma's disasterous matchmaking decison is the focus of the book.I found this novel incredibly amusing! Emma's unbashed snobbery, Harriet's ignorance, Mr Woodhouse's constant worry of illness befalling every character in the book. This book is literally laugh out loud funny at times. The novel features many other equally amusing characters. Mr Knightley, Emma's sister's brother-in-law, who is the one person in the novel to always tell Emma how it really is. The chatty and annoying Mrs Bates, the insufferable Augusta Elton who is almost as full of herself as Emma.When Jane Austen wrote this book she claimed no one but herself would like Emma Woodhouse. Emma is conceited and selfish, but the beauty of this book is that Emma is forced to come to terms with what her behavior has caused her and those she loves. The Emma you meet at the beginning of the novel is not the same Emma that you say goodbye to at the end.If you want a simple description of what this novel is about I will tell you that it is about a young lady's road to maturity and growth. Jane Austen isn't for everyone, but if you are curious or want to give her novels another try, start with Emma. It's guaranteed to renew your interest in one of the greatest writers in English literature. Five stars!!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"After reading 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and loving it I decided to read all of Jane Austen's works. 'EMMA' was second on the list, if I am being honest, because I loved the movie 'CLUELESS' and although I believe 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' will always be my favorite Jane Austen novel, so far (I am only three novels in) 'EMMA' is a close second.I found 'EMMA' to be extremely witty, intricately woven and definitely kept me on my toes! The way Austen set the stage for the many different interconnecting aspects of this book just proves why so many readers adore her. If you are interested in reading Austen , I am sure many would say that you cannot go wrong with any of her novels, however this reader highly recommends both \`EMMA' and \`PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and hope that you will enjoy them as much as I have."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Like most of Jane Austen's novels, the theme is around young women and how to obtain marriages with suitable men and be in love with them at the same time. In Emma, we have a heroine who not just sits around and speculates on who would pair up with who, but actively strives to influence and guide the matchmaking. She takes on a protege, Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage and sees into every interaction with the various gentlemen, more than is actually there. Unfortunately for poor Harriet, whose emotions get tangled around various men \\"who are all above her socially\\", Emma learns that manipulation and scheming is doing more to hurt her dear friend than to have left things alone.The reason I read this book as a mystery, is that the reader is left to speculate (without peeking) which man would pair up with which lady. There are red herrings, where the characters other than Emma, misspeculate, to lead the reader into examining the clues to see if it were the case. Also, one of the male characters purposely set out to mislead where his affections are placed, and there is also a misunderstanding between Emma and Harriet on which gentleman she admires, with Emma giving encouragement because of mistaken identity.The scheming finally crashes to a sequence of revelations brought about by a sequence of events. One after another, the couples pair off with a sequence of marriages, assuring the reader that the correct matches were made and happiness for the future guaranteed. Even though the middle of the book is very slow, the reader can go back and look at the clues and events after knowing the ending to see where inclinations rested and secrets lay buried."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Who can deny the fact that almost every earthling has taken up the fancy of arranging others' lives as roles of puppets? &quot;Life is a stage&quot; so Shakespeare claims, Emma Woodhouse just finds herself enthralled to such dramatic performances, and being so confident of her &quot;directing&quot; skill, scene after scene of Highbury romantic comedies come alive under the hands of Emma before she is even aware of them herself.A charming sample of Austen's lighter works, Emma presents the story of a Victorian era Cher, busy meddling with the love-conquests of her young apprentice Harriet Smith, fumbling into a carelessly-knit net of pretence, then rising to find her Prince Charming in a quiet corner of her throbbing young heart."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"The divison of opinion on this page is interesting but probably not surprising. Emma is a book for serious readers and if you go in expecting an easy-to-read page turner, then stick to Danielle Steele. (It is beyond depressing that two people who wrote reviews were somehow of the amazingly ignorant opinion that Jane Austen ripped off Alicia Silverstone's Clueless.....Rather difficult seeing as she was alive in the early 1800's .....hmmm.) Emma takes patience but it's a rewarding read, with all the complications, misunderstandings andbanality of your average soap opera yet shining with Austen's trademark subtle wit and mordant intelligence which has made this novel a classic.Books do require a little more time, effort and thinking than sitting mindlessly in front of Alicia Silverstone, but what you take away from the experience is a much wider understanding."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"As good as this book is, it is slow to start does not really pick up until after the 150 pages or so. But stick with it. However, those looking for an introduction to Jane Austen might be better suited with faster paced Pride &amp; Prejudice and gradually make your way toward this one.Two things that I liked very much about this book. The lead character is a likable but strong willed heroine with fixed ideas and the author is not afraid to use that to a disadvantage. Emma is flawed and it makes her interesting to read. Also, you get a stronger sense of community in a small victorian town and how they relied on one another found here than any of her other works that I have read. It's a very charming enjoyable aspect that works in the books favor. As far as premise goes, this is one of the more cohesive and linear of Austen's works and I can see the reason why this has been this has been adapted to film and stage so many times.What I liked about Bantams edition was there was no droll introduction or afterward by a scholar indicating why the book and author are important and lets the work speak for itself. What they did have was useful footnotes when the characters were referencing now obscure objects, writers and poets making the book more accessible.But as well as the book starting slowly, the other problem I had was that I found myself not emotionally investing in the characters. Emma is likeable, as stated before, but that was about it. Despite her appeal, she has no impact. Same goes with everyone else save for Miss Bates. The town spinster had me in stitches with her rambling monologues and sweet nature. When someone picks on her, it does make an impact.A nice story, just not a great one. Outside of the reservations mentioned, I'm glad I read it and recommend it."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma by Jane Austen is one of her more unknown works, and yes, it does seem tedious to read. However, those readers out there who say that they are &#34;very disappointed by emma&#34; are not thinking the right way.If everybody in the world were disappointed by books that are &#34;boring&#34; or &#34;tedious&#34; to read, nobody would ever have read Moby Dick or Les Miserables. (Not saying I think those books are boring, but in today's increasingly unappreciative society those books are considered boring to read).The real charm of classic books is digesting it and comprehending it, and in Austen's case, simply enjoying the satrical humor and wit that she subtly managed to sneak into all of her works.I know, as a middle school student, how easy it is to wander while reading or to just skim over the pages. Just keep on trying and one day you won't be disappointed by Emma. Just read slowly and get all those little gems of humor that Austen employed in her books.Also, who ever said you need to like the main character? Of course, everyone loves characters like Elizabeth Bennet. She's personable and likable. However, main characters are &#34;imperfect&#34; for a reason. What is the point of using literary examples in an essay if the literature doesn't depict realistic characters?Yes, Emma can be a snob, ignorant, and a little vain, but appreciate her for the human being she is and enjoy the classic Jane Austen book!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites.

She starts out, not as a good girl with some faults, but as a vain, selfish, silly young woman, and comes out by the end of the book deeply and believably changed.one thing I particularly enjoyed is that since Emma was always so wrong in her guesses, it was up to the reader to figure out what was really going on, and who was in love with whom.

Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world,.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her. Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

The plot is amusing, and it kept my interest from beginning to end. Indeed, I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. For those who think that it is too difficult a read, try it. I was only 12 the first time I read it, and I enjoyed it immensely. Also, I would like to set the record straight concerning the movie Clueless, which was based on &quot;Emma&quot;. Clueless was made in the 1990's, while Jane Austen was born in the late 1700's and died in her forties. It is rather obvious that &quot;Emma&quot; came first. I know this at the age of 17, and can only wonder where certain reviewers were during English class. Back to the book, though - I loved it and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Emma is the first Jane Austen novel I ever read, and 13 years later it's still my favorite. It's also the most accessible, easy to read Austen novel. I literally could not put this book down. I thought all the characters, especially Emma, were wonderful. The title character, whie arrogant, was well meaning in her attempts to play matchmaker for the people around her. I could really relate to her, because I recognized that I've met people like her. She was at once funny, well intentioned, spoiled, controlling, and sweet. This book is really funny. The introduction is very useful in helping the reader keep all the events of the story straight. As well, it gives readers insight into the times, and into Austen's views about society. I really appreciated having the cast of characters printed at the beginning of the book, because there are alot (sometimes, it seems, too many) characters inhabiting the book. Because each person in the novel is so distinct and well drawn, the occasional confusion is worth it. I highly reccommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" is a good read. I consider Austen a mistress of dialogue and of creating very colourful, vivid and almost touchable characters. These two points make \\"Emma\\" a very enjoyable novel.The only thing I found weak - as it is in other Austen's books - is the sudden turns in the story, events that have an incredibly atrificial (or deus ex machina) taste to them.It almost feels like Austen has tried to twist the entangled situations in such a way as to ensure a undisputable happy ending.Despite of the shaky storyline, the main character - Emma Woodhouse - comes through as credible and realistic. She has her faults, she makes mistakes, and inspite her wit and intelligence, she is young and inexperienced and this makes her very much like any other young woman in the 21st centrury - a young woman who has to go through some blunders in order to learn about life and herself.It is Emma's character that makes the whole book worthy of purchasing and adding to one's library.

I have just re-read it, and realized that I just didn't get it first time round. Fun is being poked at Emma the entire time by Austen - Emma's words and thoughts are her own, reported through the ironic medium of Austen's prose. It is Emma who is too snooty to go to the Coles' party, for instance, and Emma who is mocked by Austen both for that and for her fall from that supposed high ground when she sees that she will be bored and alone if she doesn't go. Austen doesn't say it, she merely reports Emma, and we have to work it out. It is all perfectly done; the perfection of it makes me catch my breath. If you didn't like it, try it again."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"For me, reading Jane Austen's novel EMMA is a delight. However, not all readers have been in agreement with me over the years including Jane Austen herself who warned her family before publication \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.\\" She was of course making fun of herself in her own satirical way; - her critics on the other hand, were quite serious. When the book was published in 1815, Austen sent a copy to her contemporary author Maria Edgeworth who gave up reading the novel after the first volume, passing it on to friend and complaining, \\"There is no story in it.\\" Others had mixed feelings offering both praise and blame for its focus on the ordinary details of a few families in a country village. One important advocate of Emma was Sir Walter Scott, whose essay published in the Quarterly Review of 1815 represents the most important criticism on Austen's writing during her lifetime. Even though the review was published anonymously, she must have been quite giddy when the reviewer heralded her EMMA as a \`new style of novel' designed to \`suit modern times'. Heady stuff to be sure. When it was later learned that Scott had contributed the review, it would placed Jane Austen in a whole other league of writers.EMMA can be enjoyed on different levels, and for pure humour and witty dialogue it may reign as Austen's supreme triumph. Just Google quotes from EMMA and you might agree that it has the best bon mots of any of her novels. Modern critics claim it as her masterpiece, and I do not doubt it. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE may be the most beloved and well know of her works, but Emma represents Austen at the height of her writing skill and power as a story teller. Like some of Austen's contemporaries, the modern reader might find challenges in its minutiae and supposed lack of story. Not to worry. There are many sources available to assist in understanding Jane Austen's subtle and often witty dialogue, her unique characterizations, and help place the novel in historical context.One source to consider is the new 2008 edition of EMMA, by Oxford World's Classics. Recently revised in 2003, this re-issue contains the same supplemental and textual material with a newly designed cover. For a reader seeking a medium level of support to help them along in their understanding you will be happy to find a thoughtful 23 page introduction by associate Professor of English and Women's Studies Adela Pinch of the University of Michigan. The essay contains a brief introduction, and segments on Shopping and Suburbia, Narrative Voices: Gossip and the Individual, The Politics of Knowledge, and Emma: Much Ado About Nothing?. Her emphasis is on understanding Austen's choice of writing about the ordinary and extraordinary aspects of the lives of its heroine Emma Woodhouse and her circle of family and friends in Highbury, a small English village in which she sets about to match make for all of its singletons blundering hilariously along the way. I particularly appreciated Prof. Pinch's positive comments throughout the essay.\\"Austen makes voices stick in the mind through her use of free indirect discourse, which makes character's voice seem indelible, capable of soaking into other beings. But she also uses the same technique for representing thought. Her cultivation of this mode of representing her heroines' minds has made her novels crucial to the history of the English novel, markers of a movement when the novel as a literary genre perfects its inward turn, and begins to claim human psychology as its territory. Above all it creates the feeling of intimacy with her heroines that many readers prize.\\" Page xvii-xviiiIf I may be so bold and interject as the everyman Austen reader for a moment, parts of this essay are scholarly and touch on areas beyond my immediate understanding, especially when she delves into the philosophical and psychological pedantry. For the most part, Prof. Pinch's essay is written in accessible language and is reverent and admiring to the author and the heroine. I found this outlook refreshing since the heroine Emma, and the novel EMMA have received some criticisms for their shortcomings over the centuries. The novel is about so much more than the \\"no story\\" that Maria Edgeworth hastily condemned it to be. I especially adore Emma's little friend Harriet Smith and think her much maligned in the recent movie adaptations, and well - can there ever be enough praise bestowed upon Mrs. Elton? She is comedic genius and worthy of a nomination to the literary comedy hall of fame.Professor Pinch has also supplied the helpful explanatory notes throughout the text which are numbered on the page allowing the reader to refer to the back of the book for explanation. Honestly, I prefer them to be footnoted at the bottom of the page instead of riffling back and forth, but that is a quibble on convenience. The remainder of the supplemental material; Biography of Jane Austen, Note on the Text, Select Bibliography, Chronology of Jane Austen, Appendix A: Rank and Social Status, and Appendix B: Dancing are repeated throughout the other Jane Austen editions in this series.This Oxford edition is a sweet little volume at an incredible price if you are in the market for a middlin amount of supplemental material from reputable sources containing an authorative text edited for the modern reader. If you enjoy matchless wit and irony, unforgettable characters, and a unique story that turns the everyday imaginings of a young Georgian era woman into an extraordinary story filled with a comedy of manners and romance, then take note; - Miss Emma Woodhouse commands you to purchase this book immediately!Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"Prunella Scales is wonderfully talented. Good separation of characters. Her rendition of Miss Bates is incredible - leaves one breathless."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I've read Sense and Sensability, Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, and most recently Emma, and while all of them are wonderful, this one was, to me, the most engaging. The characters are all really well developed, especially Emma, who is portrayed as incredibly human. You always like and sympathize with her, but sometimes you want to slap her. The story is, briefly, about Emma, who lives with her father Mr. Woodhouse. She has vowed herself never to marry, but loves to play matchmaker. She has just matched her former governess, &quot;Poor Miss Taylor,&quot; up with Mr. Weston, and is quite proud of her success. Mr. Knightly, a neighbor and the brother of her older sister's (Isabella) husband (Mr. John Knightly), warns her about meddling, but she doesn't take him seriously. Soon Emma befriends a young girl of unknown parentage (she is illegitimate and her father, while providing for her care, remains anonymous) named Harriet. Harriet is in love with a farmer named Robert Martin, but Emma thinks that he is beneath her, so manages to talk her out of accepting his marraige proposal. Instead, thinking that she would be a perfect match for Mr. Elton, another local gentleman, encourages Harriet to set her sights on him. Harriet actually talks herself into being in love with him, until everything is ruined because Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma instead. She turns him down and he leaves town, soon returning with a wife, whom no one likes.Meanwhile, Mr. Weston's son (Mr. Frank Churchill), who was sent to be raised by his aunt when his mother died, comes to visit his father and flirts constantly with Emma, who is flattered and flirts back. She begins to think she might be in love with him, but when he leaves town again to go back to his aunt and uncle, her feelings cool down. Another out of town visitor, Jane Fairfax, who is the niece of the rather irritating Mrs. and Miss Bates, has also come. Jane is destined to become a governess because she does not come from a wealthy family. Emma and Frank had been speculating about her, because Emma thought she was secretly in love with her friend's husband and that was the reason for her coming, and Frank said he agreed. Emma is jealous of Jane anyway because she is more talented and accomplished than Emma, but whenever she says anything against her to Mr. Knightly, he defends her. Mrs. Weston tells Emma that she thinks Mr. Knightly is in love with Jane, which horrifies Emma because if Knightly marries, then her nephew would no longer be the heir of his estate. Meanwhile Frank Churchill returns and Emma thinks that Harriet is now in love with him. Harriet does say that she has feelings for a certain gentleman that they both know, and that she thinks Emma knows the one she means, and asks for advice about whether she has a chance and should persue it. Emma encourages her, and meanwhile realizes that she has feelings for Mr. Knightley. Then another problem arises. I don't want to say too much more because I don't want to spoil the story if you don't know it, but the plot becomes even more complicated before everything is resolved. But it's a great book and if you are only going to read one Jane Austen novel, this is the one to pick."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Signet classics)","review":"I read this book in college and I reread it every so often. Emma is a funny, light story that is more than a little touching.

From misplaced question numbers, misplaced decimal points, more ambiguous questions and answers and much more.This is the second Princeton Review book that I have found many errors on.Just like the previous reviewer. I am also not buying anymore products from \\"The Princeton Review\\". Take my advise and save your money."},{"Title":"Math Workout for the New SAT (College Test Preparation)","review":"I bought this book based on the Princeton Review's reputation for being a leading name in the SAT preparation business. Having taken most of the math classes required for the SAT in middle school, I figured this book would provide a nice quick refresher to help jog my memory about all those mundane algebra and geometry rules. What I found, however was so disappointing that I am planning on writing a letter to the editor to voice my discontent.It would appear that the folks who wrote this book did not have a very good editorial team. Problems I had with the text ran the gamut from grammatical blunders and misplaced decimals to unbalanced equations and gross typographical errors. In one example illustrating a method for determining which of two fractions is larger, the fractions given were (I swear) 5/7 and $/!!. Either there is some radical new math movement going on out there or this book's editors were completely incompetent.Due to these highly irritating fallacies, I stopped reading the book about halfway through, so I'm sure there were more errors that I just didn't get to. Personally, I find it a bit insulting that the Princeton Review staff didn't care enough to fix obvious mistakes. Perhaps I'm being too harsh on them, but things like matching question numbers to answer numbers really should not be that difficult. Hopefully, they will re-edit this book before future publications hit the market, although I for one will never be buying another product from the Princeton Review."},{"Title":"Math Workout for the New SAT (College Test Preparation)","review":"I'm teaching SAT math, and am finding these quick quizzes and problem sets helpful as warmups.I just had to put this for the record:While there are a number of errors, the situation isn't as dire as previous reviewers have painted it. Some of these are typographical errors which can be corrected easily from the context. The errors do not seem much more frequent than the errors present in the answer key in the appendix of your average high school math textbook (sad to say).The laundry list of errors compiled by an earlier reviewer has some errors itself. A sampling: The reviewer has confused \\"subtract\\" with \\"subtracted from\\". (Page 18, Page 149 #5) Page 133 #8 is actually correct.

It's one of the only books out there with math drills that are written like real SAT questions, and that are organized into distinct categories (fundamentals, averages, geometry etc.), so that students can focus their efforts.The Princeton Review's main SAT prep book organizes its teaching section well, but for students who then want to practice, say a dozen percent problems so they can really internalize and grasp the concept, they're out of luck. The only practice materials in that book are in the form of diagnostic tests which, rightly, mix up all question types. This is a useful supplement.Many reviewers have complained of errors and typos, and if I remember correctly there may be one or two mistakes still in the book, but I'm pretty sure most have been fixed in subsequent printings.Finally, the difference between the drills here and in a more typical math textbook are crucial, as these problems are constructed like actual SAT questions, not like problems from math class... and there's a huge difference.My only criticism of the book: not enough problems. I wish it had twice the volume of material.

Maybe the newest printing that I own did smooth out all the editing kinks that were mentioned in those bad reviews. I have gone through about half of all the problems myself and probably found only a couple potential mistakes in them (though my reading has been cursory I must admit).To make it short, if you want to take practice exams and get the feel for what kind of questions you may encounter in the \\"real\\" exam, there is absolutely no substitute for working with the copies of real exams or using the prep book published by whoever makes the real exam (i.e., ETS). I high recommend that approach.However, I strongly think that Princeton Review delivers here in developing effective test-taking strategies and techniques. While I was in need of taking SAT, I did superbly on the math part without knowing these things, since I had a strong math background already. Now I am tutoring and reviewing these weird trick questions for which ETS is known for, I must say that the techniques work even for the students without strong mathematical foundations, and probably save a lot of time without doing full algebra.On the book, I feel the harder problems tend to be a little more difficult than what the real SAT would ever have. There are also quite a few problems that are a bit obscure, perhaps due to Princeton Review's attempt to imitate the funky ability of ETS to make up weird questions, which test whatever ETS thinks is the \\"scholastic aptitude.\\""},{"Title":"Math Workout for the New SAT (College Test Preparation)","review":"The 2nd edition of this book seems to have fixed a number of the typos that other reviewers noted. But while the problems are nice (although far too few), the explanations are very poor.Algebra is a very rich subject, with a great many tools for solving problems, yet the author seems to think the best strategy to use is \\"plug it in.\\"If the five multiple-choice answers have values, then the author recommends plugging them into the problem (essentially wasting up to 4x as much time as the problem really needs). If the answers don't include values, she recommends making up values off the top of one's head, and (you guessed it), plugging them in, THEN checking the result against the five multiple choice answers.On an actual SAT, the student does not have the luxury of wasting so much time! Plus, resorting to plugging it in demonstrates little mathematical mastery, which is what I'm wondering about the author of this book."},{"Title":"The Cocktail Handbook","review":"This is a really good book, with lots of recipies.

Lord John Rawlins poses as a butler in order to help his friend, the Viscount Lyleton, catch a blackmailer. Born on the other side of the blanket to a housemaid and a Duke, John has a deep dislike of the Ton. He was knighted for bravery in battle and rewarded with a home and land in the countryside. Little does he know that Lady Sarah Thorndike, soon to be betrothed to Lyleton, will steal his heart.Though Sarah is the legitimate daughter of a duke, her parents treat her shabbily. More like a piece of property, they mean for her to marry a title with money and finish supporting her. She is the last child still at home and they are tired of her. She was raised by nannies and servants; hence the reason for her kind and empathetic personality. Neither she not Lyleton want to get married to each other and they do their best to cause their parents grief. At this point, this traditional regency asks the reader to stretch their imagination.At some times the reading was slow. I wanted more contact between the hero and heroine.

Actually, they found his parents, the Earl and Countess of Lavesly, who were, coincidentally, also looking for a marriage partner for their recalcitrant child.Unfortunately, this young man is much more fond of clothes, the ton, gaming, and any number of other things than he is of the idea of marriage, let alone the actuality. It was something he knew he'd have to do someday, but preferably not for another ten or twenty years.The two sets of parents contrive a summer visit of some two dozen acquaintances at the Viscount's own estate, Charlisle, so that the two young people can meet, get accustomed to each other, get betrothed, and then get married a month later.

Only when a G clef is placed with the \\"G\\" on the second line from the bottom of the five lined staff does the word treble come into effect, and then it's only because the staff is now a treble staff. The G clef symbol never has a name other than a G clef. This book is the only place I've ever seen or heard it taught correctly.

Where as most of his books deal with beginnings, this book deals with endings. There of course origins of instruments of death such as the electric chair and the guillotine, but the whole is concerned with death and the ways it happens. Great for reference and great for just reading. Though at first it is a grim subject, Panati deals with it in such a way, that you could almost read it as humorous yet respectful. Points of interest include last wills and testaments of past presidents and the last words along with cause and description of death with famous figures in history such as Buddha, Joan of Arc, Edgar Allan Poe, and Ludwig van Beethoven.

With the help of one of the group's leading speakers (Donna Forsi), Lisa tries to uncover the truth about her boyfriend's death.\\"Resolved: You're Dead\\" isn't the best book I've read by Nicholas Adams, but at least it's short (153 pages). About three-fourths of the way into the book, though, the identity of the killer is revealed, leaving very little suspense after that. Most readers will be able to guess the ending, too.

There's a creepy castle, a curse and a mystery.Sean Killdaren is a recluse, haunted by a curse involving his twin brother. Cassie travels to Dartmouth to try and locate her lost cousin who has gone missing while employed by Killdaren. I really enjoyed this book. The mystery doesn't overshadow the romance but adds an interesting aspect to the story. I'm a sucker for a tormented hero and a smart heroine. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book."},{"Title":"Midnight Secrets (Berkley Sensation)","review":"In 1879 Cassie Andrews sees a vision of her cousin Mary dying at sea off the coast of Dartmouth. Unable to ignore what she \\"witnessed\\", she plans to learn how her relative ended in the cold water and who caused the \\"accident\\". Cassie disguises herself as a chambermaid to gain entrance to the estate of Sean Killaren, the last place Mary stayed where she hears of a curse in which he and his twin will kill one anotherCassie and Sean are immediately attracted to one another, but she fears that the man she is beginning to fall in love might be Mary's killer. Adding to the aura of mystery that surrounds Sean is he is a bibliophile, but the only books he collects are those who dwell on the topic of vampires. Cassie ponders whether the man who stole her soul is soulless.MIDNIGHT SECRETS is a terrific Victorian romantic suspense that grips the reader from the moment that Cassie has her vision and decides to become an amateur sleuth and never slows down until the mystery is resolved. Cassie is a fabulous heroine with a need to know the truth though she fears that once she learns it her heart will break. Sean is an enigmatic hunk who in some ways seems like a gothic antihero. The whodunit is fun to follow and the paranormal elements blend in completely so that readers obtain a great tale, which is no secret as Jennifer St. Giles always provides such to her audience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Midnight Secrets (Berkley Sensation)","review":"This book, for me, was a so-so read. I felt it took a little too long for Sean to be an integral part of the book. He never really was--he always seemed to be on the outside edges looking in. This is always a chance an author takes with a first person narrative. We knew Cassie's thoughts, but I never really connected with Sean's. Ms. St. Giles cites Phantom of the Opera as inspiration, but I never thought, \\"Oh, yes! That is the Phantom\\", as I was reading. I think such an Irish name threw me off. Something Scottish (Gerard Butler's homeland) might have been a better trigger. And of course, maybe the author never intended for any Phantom references to be evident.Another thing that bothered me was the relationship between Cassie and Sean. It was pretty contrived how Cassie managed to bathe every day. I also thought her duties seemed sort of light. She did a lot, but was still able to cavort with Sean all night. I think realistically, she would have been dead on her feet. To be honest, I thought Stuart was a pretty interesting character and I liked his romance with Bridget.I really liked the author's Mistress of Trevelyan, but I didn't care for the next one (can't think of the title) and this one, while better, still isn't up to Mistress standards. I hope Darkest Dreams is a little more on target."},{"Title":"Midnight Secrets (Berkley Sensation)","review":"I had enjoyed Jennifer St. Giles's His Dark Desires and was lukewarm about The Mistress of Trevelyan. However, I love gothic romances and thought I'd give another one of her books a whirl. Midnight Secrets, though good in some parts, failed to deliver a tangible enough romance between the leads. The year is 1879 and Cassie Andrews suffers from visions in which she senses tragic events in her sleep. When she sees her cousin Mary in her dreams, she immediately imagines the worst. As it turns out, Mary dies under mysterious circumstances at the Killdaren estate. Cassie goes to the estate, posing as a maid, to try to get to the bottom of things. Reticent servants and a dysfunctional family make her even more wary. But sparks fly between Cassie and the mysterious Sean Killdaren, a man whom she seldom sees, for he is constantly hiding in his room. He reads lots of books about vampires, and she assumes that he must be one. Who is the mysterious, phantom-like Sean? Did he kill Mary, or was it his lonely father or Sean's equally enigmatic twin brother?I couldn't get into the novel. The suspense is well written and the gothic elements are all there, but the story went nowhere for a large portion of the book. The sexual tension between the protagonists is wonderful. However, they are not together enough for you to enjoy it. Sean appears in small portions for a large part of the novel. I know the author got her inspiration from The Phantom of the Opera, and she obviously had the very scrumptious Gerard Butler in mind when she created the hero (she describes him in full, from his height and body build to his lovely green eyes), but I would have liked to see more of him, would have liked to see more development between the leading characters. The servants are actually quite compelling in this novel and the mystery's resolution is convincing, but these things weren't enough for me. Midnight Secrets, for the most part, lagged its way toward the end. I will, however, give the other Killdaren book a try. I do like St. Giles's writing style. She writes Victorian gothic romances in first person, and her style kind of reminds me of books like Jane Eyre and Rebecca."},{"Title":"Midnight Secrets (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Jennifer St. Giles is a very powerful writer she give you a nice mystery with a ghostly romance.

The paranormal element adds an intersting twist here, and is not over done. Combined with the suspense, these elements create an intersting backdrop for romance. You have to suspend disbelief a little bit, but it's definitely a good, fun read. I agree with another reviewer that the romantic hero is a little under used here, but still a great summer vacation read!"},{"Title":"Midnight Secrets (Berkley Sensation)","review":"I got this book from First Reads and started reading it as soon as I got it. The conflict in this story was set up very well and early on. As the story continued it was more intriguing and I had a hard time putting it down when I had to do other things. If I hadn't got this book for free I would not have hesitated buying it as soon as I started reading."},{"Title":"Midnight Secrets (Berkley Sensation)","review":"This gothic romance definitely should be given a thought because it was just tension-filled enough with the right blend of intrigue, paranormal and breathless romance.Cassie has the gift of dreaming that someone dies, so when she dreams of her cousin Mary, she is sad and horrified to learn her cousin drowned while on an outing with her charge. Mary has been afraid of the water for years and Cassie just doesn't believe it, so she packs up and goes to Cornwall to inflitrate the legendary Kildaren estate whose curse it is that both brothers (twins) will kill each other.There is a lot of back story in this book that keep the mystery fueled, with different subplots, including setting up for the sequel (which I'm reading now). I really liked the way the world that Cassie inflitrates being a maid is shown and depicted, and Cassie's own understanding how her life of privlege differs from that of servants. Cassie is a very strong character, and a very likeable one. So is the hero of the story, Sean Kildaren, who was born the second twin and therefore not able to have the title of Earl. He and his brother, Alex, have a wide story between them that is still being explored in the second book.What was great about this book is the way Ms. St. Giles brings about the mystery, the gothic nature of the story, and the love between Cassie and Sean. What is not great about this book is the way some things are brought to life, like how we discover why Sean can't go in daylight. That was written almost as an afterthought that had me backtracking on when it was revealed. Also, I thought the ending wasn't thought out, but now that I'm reading the second book it is making more sense now why the first ended like it did.This is definitely a stand alone book, but the ending leaves you feeling incomplete and thus forces you to seek out the sequel. That is partly annoying from a readers standpoint but also brillant from a publisher's view to sell more books! I got this book from a thrift store but really recommend it, either buying it used or new. Just beware that you will end up buying the other book in the series."},{"Title":"Midnight Secrets (Berkley Sensation)","review":"\\"Midnight Secrets\\" is the first book in the Killdaren series, gothic romances with a paranormal twist. When Cassie Andrews dreams about her cousin Mary, she knows something bad will happen. Her dreams always herald the death of a loved one, and before the day is out, Cassie and her 2 sisters, Andrie and Gemini, receive word that their cousin is missing and presumed drowned. This doesn't sit well with Cassie, knowing that Mary is afraid of the ocean and unlikely to have been close enough to the water for an accident to occur. The sisters travel to Dartmoor's End, where they meet up with their aunt and attempt to get more details about Mary's death. Cassie is dissatisfied with the information given her by the constable who handled the investigation and decides to take matters into her own hands. Pretending to be in need of a job, she is hired as a chambermaid at Killdaren's Castle, where Mary was employed as governess. Cassie becomes increasingly convinced that her cousin was the victim of foul play, especially considering the rumors circulating about the castle's owner, Sean Killdaren and his nocturnal life. What Cassie discovers lures her to adventure, trying to discover what happened to Mary, why Sean is never seen during the day and what strange activities take place in the round room.Ms. St. Giles has written a fast paced gothic romance, in the classic model (a mysterious disappearance, locked rooms, rumors of \\"dark\\" deeds), with exciting characters and situations. The tension builds throughout the book and comes to a very satisfying conclusion. I loved it; so well in fact that after I finished the 3rd book in the series, I started over again. If you like a good gothic story with a touch of the supernatural, you will enjoy this book. Jennifer, keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"Midnight Secrets (Berkley Sensation)","review":"\\"Midnight Secrets\\" is the first book I've read by Jennifer St. Giles and initially I wasn't too optimistic - the information on the back of the book made it sound like a story of two warring brothers with some overinflated gothic trappings. I was very pleasantly surprised, however, to find myself reading a story with some mystery, some gothic elements, but far more emphasis on the thoughts of a particular woman as she experiences life as a maid rather than her normally socially elevated status. Cassie Andrews is a very likeable and interesting character who is strong, resourceful and works to help those around her, learning from her mistakes despite being felled by 'love at first sight'.Cassie has a strange ability, one that is actually a problem to her - she tends to have dreams that foretell the deaths of those around her. When she has a dream about her much-loved cousin Mary she decides to go to Cornwall, where Mary works as a governess, to see if she can do anything to prevent the tragedy. Unfortunately when she arrives she discovers that Mary has gone missing, presumably drowned, and that the local constable isn't interested in what happened to Mary. Cassie goes 'undercover' as a maid in the Killdaren estate in order to have the opportunity to do some more investigating.Cassie finds life as a maid significantly harder than she had expected. Her workload is huge under the tyrannical Mrs Frye and her fellow servants may have things to hide. She befriends Bridget but soon discovers that her ideas of right and wrong and behaviour don't translate well to the serving class. Cassie's a wonderful character as she is actually able to learn and to grow and to accommodate her new circumstances. She's also fascinated by Sean Killdaren, the owner of the property who no-one ever sees; it's rumoured he is a vampire and when Cassie meets him she certainly finds him striking.Although billed as a gothic romance this book was mercifully free from overwrought prose. Yes, people wander around dark corridors at night, find themselves kidnapped and stashed in underground caves, but it's all written so enjoyably and well and Cassie is such a great narrator that it's easy to be carried along by the story. Her friend Bridget is excellently described, as is the hard life of a maid in the 1880s. The romance with Sean Killdaren is perhaps a little piecemeal at times, and I wasn't entirely sure why he fell in love with Cassie, but the story was always interesting and enjoyable as Cassie searches for the truth behind Mary's disappearance. My only slight quibble is that something that is hinted about Sean throughout the book isn't really completely rounded up and that the end happens rather quickly and that some loose ends weren't tied up but this was a great read for those who like historical romances and there is a subsequent book featuring Cassie's sister and Sean's brother to continue this excellent cast of characters and presumably to shed light on some of the plot threads that were not completed in this book.[...]"},{"Title":"Midnight Secrets (Berkley Sensation)","review":"I have read all 3 of Jennifer St. Giles' gothic romance novels and so far this was my favorite. I loved the characters of Cassie and Sean, and how Cassie, by posing as a maid in the Killdaren Castle, comes to learn to rethink many of her opinions about how people should lead their lives. For fellow fans of Jenni's \\"Muse\\" (Gerard Butler) there are a great many \\"inside winks\\" that made me smile. I could so picture Sean Killdaren's physical essence resembling (to a great extent) that of the incredibly charismatic and impossibly handsome Mr. Butler.I was not upset by the presence of Irish characters in the English landscape because I realize that many families migrated throughout England, Ireland and Scotland, and I believe many families of wealth living in England would have had Irish servants. I would only question that Sean seems a bit too Irish for someone who was apparently born and raised in England though of Irish ancestory.It was slightly less than satisfying that the mysteries presented during the book were not all resolved in this volume. The teaser at the end indicates a continuation of the story with the next book, coming this December. I'm not sure if there will be a 3rd as well (there are 3 sisters I suspect this may be a series with one book focusing on each sister, in the style of Nora Roberts). Whatever the future of the series, I hope to see all the loose ends and unresolved issues brought to fruition in future editions. I will be on line to purchase them as soon as they are available!"},{"Title":"Midnight Secrets (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Gothic novels are difficult. The spooky surroundings cannot overshadow the romance, and that's hard when romance novels are typically character driven. Ms. St.Giles first novel, The Mistress of Trevelyan, is one of the most outstanding romance novels I've read. Her second and follow up novel, His Dark Desires, was a disappointment. Alas, I love her voice, so I bought her latest, Midnight Secrets. While it came very close to her first novel, it didn't quite capture the mix of eerie, ghostly suspense and strong characters. I've noticed she has more books coming out and I will buy them as I have faith she'll recapture the magic of her first novel.She is a talented writer with a beautiful gift to string words together like a fine piece of music.

Most of the men contributed written works including articles, poetry, and even some fantasy (by as strait-laced a scientist as the future Sir Douglas Mawson!), expedition artist George Marston produced illustrations, then Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce typeset and printed the pages, and when everything was finished Bernard Day crafted covers from empty cases and bound the books.

The characters are all unique and have such specific roles that without them the author would be doing the reader a disservice. The memory of the characters will remain with you long after you finish the book. Characters will become household names -- e.g., Aunt Aggie -- the old mountain woman who completes just about every sentence with a rendition of \`so ya say'. The book is geared to a unisex audience and is excellent for book discussion groups made up of both men and women. The author keeps the reader in mind and writes in an uncomplicated fashion to make certain that reading this book is not a chore but a pleasure. The story line is quite original and not predictable at all. Don't even try to predict the next scene - you can't. The story itself is a great topic for discussion groups -- is it based around underground baby brokers?, the lives of mountain men and women?, or civilized people discovering the lives of mountain people and vice versa? The setting itself is key - West Virginia - many references are made to local points of interest and backwoods to give the reader a feeling of nonfiction. The book is short, under 300 pages, and can easily be read in a day or weekend. The book ends with a reference to the sequel -- if it is anything like the first book, you know you will not be disappointed. \`The Cabin' -- be prepared for adventure and be prepared to be surprised.

I AM a proud West Virginian. However, many stories can be told about WV and about the great variety of people who live in this beautiful, wild and wonderful state. I've heard that the characters in the book were based on real people [I live in the same county as the author]. I've even met a few people myself here whose lifestyles are so totally different than my own that they literally shock me and I KNOW they are real and not just sterotypes. And, of course, the great majority of us have little outwardly in common with the \\"backward\\" mountain folk in the Cabin Series. \\"Misery on the Mountain\\" was C.J. Henderson's first book and her style keeps improving. I've read all her books and I understand she is beginning a new and totally different series. All the Cabin books are quite fun reads. Don't dissect them. Just read them and enjoy! (I don't live on the NC coast any more. I've come home!)"},{"Title":"The Cabin : Misery on the Mountain","review":"I have met C.J. Henderson as she was a very popular author doing signings in my Borders Express store in Bridgeport, WV and I always promised to read her books. I finally bought one and at first I thought \\"Oh no, it's about making West Virginia people look bad again.\\" As I continued to read I got so caught up in the story line that I couldn't put it down. I have since purchased three more in the series! Her writing is very smooth and the text and conversations flow page after page. I have recommended this series to many friends. I think this would make a great mini series on TV especially for a channel like AMC who has all the good frontier type shows."},{"Title":"The Cabin : Misery on the Mountain","review":"I was born, raised and educated in West Virginia and know its hills and its people from Wheeling to Welch. Not a shred of anything written in this book rings true. The sad thing is that readers from out-of-state may accept the dialect and the content as an accurate depiction of a state already excessively stereotyped and always negatively. Of course, there are accents and idioms in WV, but the speech of Aunt Aggie, in itself, was so totally, ridiculously fabricated that I appropriately garbaged Cabin very quickly, never to know the outcome of the incestuous relationships and baby-selling mill that Jacob had going. I agree wholeheartedly with the customer who decribed the book as the \\"most horrific piece of trash I've ever read.\\""},{"Title":"The Cabin : Misery on the Mountain","review":"I met C.J. at our local mall.

Many people in these reviews want to condemn her for her \\"less than rosy\\" depiction of West Virginian society. I too live in WV, have for many years, and while I have certainly never heard of anything described in this fictional book transpiring in real life, I can't deny that the author paints a picture which seems plausible. To the other critics of this book who scorn it, I merely think they are upset because it does, indeed, perpetuate the negative stereotype of the incestuous, backward mountain man. Such readers might be advised to understand that this is a work of /fiction/. and should be regarded only as such.The basic plot is that a man from the mountains keeps a cabin full of \\"wives\\" to produce children for him to sell. He makes a decent profit from this and has an apartment in the city, where he lives in relative comfort. Our heroine, Tuesday, is unfortunate enough to meet this man, who later takes a liking to her and decides to kidnap her and take her to the cabin, where he intends to make her one of his wives.I have both good and bad things to say of this book. First, the bad, because that's how I roll. Essentially, the plot makes it way to the predictable conclusion through a series of really dumb blunders on the part of our heroine. Although these happenings are reflected upon later by her as she considers her poor judgment, they are all too frequent to be ignored and wind up being downright irritating. There are only so many times a reader can put up with the old \\"the search missed them by a few seconds\\" routine.Also, the dialouge within the book was a bit stiff sometimes and unreal seeming, not to mention there are frequent occurances of the \\"one person monologue\\" as a character contemplates things right out loud to themselves. Had these things been conveyed by the characters in thought process, it would have been a lot less disconcerting.One other note was the progression of the story seemed very unnatural to me. In parts it seemed to move forward very quickly, and the author jumps to a new perspective in every chapter, leaving only just enough time to re-immerse yourself in one story before being chucked right into another.Other than that, however, I have to say I did enjoy reading this book. The plot had a lot of potential and I believe the author pulled it off, if just barely. One thing I do really want to commend her on was the character development. The different characters really shine through in their distinctness, which for me really made the novel.So in short, through the clunky progression of the story, sometimes unrealistic dialouge and memorable characters, it made for an entertaining if short read. With another free afternoon, I might even consider picking up the next one."},{"Title":"The Cabin : Misery on the Mountain","review":"I've never felt strongly enough about a book to write an online review about it this book however deserves a comment. I'm an English major and for my senior thesis I'm actually writing about this novel. I'm a proud West Virginian and I'd like to say that this book is complete trash. As another reviewer stated there are numerous beautifully written novels about West Virginia that are based on facts that reflect the people that live here. I was shocked and appalled after i read it to see that the writer was actually from West Virginia. She should be truly ashamed not only for producing this piece of trash but for so horribly slandering her homestate. Breece D.J. Pancake, Pickney Benedict, Jayne Anne Phillips those are true West Virginia writers. Lee Smith or \\"The Dollmaker\\" if you like the Appalachian feel."},{"Title":"The Cabin : Misery on the Mountain","review":"I am not an avid reader, however my wife is.

J. Henderson has done a masterful job in depicting life back in the hills. Even though it is fiction there are hints of truth throughout the story.

I met the author and bought her book. I couldn't wait to get home and begin reading.The book made me ill and angry. The author used nearly all of the stereotypical images of Appalachians in writing this novel.Evidently she used this tactic to create a sensationalistic piece of literature, and I use the term loosely, to sell books. Not only is this a disservice to the people of the region, but it is also a disservice to her readers. The story is barely believable.In spite of this, she has probably succeeded, because the American public loves sensationalism, not to mention making fun of hillbillies.There are so many wonderful writers who place their stories in Appalachia. Their characters reflect the true spirit of its people, who are, and always have been, like most Americans, especially those in rural areas and of the working class."},{"Title":"The Cabin : Misery on the Mountain","review":"Suspense, drama, culture... this book has it all.

The circumstances surrounding the occupants of the cabin was a bit less than believable. CJ Henderson was not successful at creating an environment that the reader was able to step into easily. Transitions between scenes was instantaneous and often left me confused as to where I was, or what a character would be doing. This novel has potential, this author has potential. However I feel that CJ should focus more on creating believable circumstances and an atmosphere in which the reader's imagination is not taxed towards participation. I want to be placed in that cabin, feel the heat from the stove, smell the dirty matress, and really feel the fear when the man comes home! Maybe Miss Henderson should get out of the city a little more? I'm looking forward to the sequel........."},{"Title":"The Cabin : Misery on the Mountain","review":"As a resident of the lovely and badly maligned state of West Virginia, I always look forward to reading a new West Virginia author. C.J. Henderson, a native West Virginia, took what could have been an opportunity to dispell the myths of the mountain people, and reaped profit from it.

Ten thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The Cabin : Misery on the Mountain","review":"The subject matter of this book is appalling, but it was so poorly written I kept reading it to see if it would get better. It didn't. It sometimes seemed as if the author sat at her keyboard each day and just started out without checking whether she had written this part already or not. In a way, it is inspiring--if she can make a living writing this stuff, I can too, though I don't want to turn my own stomach.Yuk."},{"Title":"The Cabin : Misery on the Mountain","review":"The basic premise of this novel was good. Henderson especially does a great job with the &quot;mountain&quot; dialect. However, my opinion (and it's only my opinion) is that her &quot;city&quot; characters did not seem real. Their dialogue was quite stilted. Also, although basically a good story, the connection between Jacob and Jeb came as no surprise. I will probably purchase at least one more Cabin novel to see if the &quot;city&quot; characters become anymore realistic."},{"Title":"The Cabin : Misery on the Mountain","review":"I was given a bag full of books by a friend and The Cabin was among them.

The book is fiction, although I know of no baby mills in my state, I do know of abject poverty and third world living conditions in some areas. There are places still very isolated from the world. I read the first book and promptly went to my local library and checked out the next four. I read the entire series in five days and have the sixth one on hold. It seems I am not the only one who wants to see how this ends. Keeping in mind that it is a work of fiction, just set back and enjoy it without being offended by the subject matter."},{"Title":"Organization Modeling: Innovative Architectures for the 21st Century","review":"Information modeling, organization theory and design, knowledge management, strategic planning, and process design are all subjects of dozens of published books. Organization Modeling (OM) introduces an innovative framework to utilize these and other relative techniques. The authors have created a novel approach, architecture, and framework that any organization wishing to compete in the 21st century should not be without. Based in existing organization theory, the authors have extended well beyond the traditional theorists. Instead, OM provides a roadmap for business professionals. They have also clearly drawn the line dividing information technology and business modeling. If you are an information technology person expecting another technique for object oriented programming, this book is not for you. If, though, you are an information technology person who desires to move beyond the IT world, this book will provide the tools and framework to move in that direction. If you are an organizational theorist looking for another school of pure organizational theory, you will find much more than that here. Instead, you will find a synthesis of organization theory and other disciplines in a pragmatic yet holistic framework. A word of caution, this book is not some form of \\"pop-theory\\" that can be read in a day or two. I was familiar with many of the subjects in the book and still found the best method for reading was absorption and reflection. I found myself examining how each section of the book could be applied at my current business situation. The book uses an extended information modeling technique introduced by Kilov. Once again, I found myself creating Kilovish models of my current situation to provide greater insight into the material. The book starts by setting the foundation of OM. This foundation introduces key concepts such as the organization molecule, and emergent organizational patterns. Once the foundation is set, the authors introduce applications to key concepts such as information, data, knowledge, culture, and learning. One soon comes to realize the true power of an architecture/framework at this level of abstraction. This book is a must have for any person interested understanding and moving their organization into the 21st century, or students of management related studies."},{"Title":"Organization Modeling: Innovative Architectures for the 21st Century","review":"In a world where technology has come to permeate our lives, where businesses and the organizations which comprise them have become more virtual and knowledge-based in nature, business and IT professionals have struggled to find common ground in their understanding of how businesses operate and how technology can enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of that operation. Organization Modeling, Innovative Architectures for the 21st Century, has successful brought together, for the business/technology manager, some of the key issues and thinking surrounding how organizations and the technology they have come to rely on should be woven together.Rather than simply providing a new \\"spin\\" on the way today's business and organizations need to operate, the book provides new insights into how to foster communication, use information more effectively, develop collaborative behaviors, as well as tools and techniques to help align business/information strategies.Both business and IT professionals will find this book extremely valuable in helping them understand how to analyze and design new business processes and organizational structures which effectively leverage technology as well as the skills, talents, and capabilities of the organization's members.

Even, Mintzburg has applied some of these authors concepts!"},{"Title":"Organization Modeling: Innovative Architectures for the 21st Century","review":"Our book is about organizational architecture and design. The intended audience includes managers and IT professionals, and graduate students of management and MIS. In addition, this book may serve as a reference for research topics - it has become popular as a resource for Master's and Ph.D. students. One hundred years ago Frederick Winslow Taylor engineered work with engineering disciplines and thus created the 20th century design discipline of Scientific Management. In this book we architect work with modeling concepts and thus create the 21st century design practice of Organization Modeling. The analytical disciplines we choose to employ are those associated with the software engineering field: contracts and object-orientation. Our central innovation is the concept of an organization molecule. An organization molecule is the building block of design. It is a managed collection of well known management concepts or domains, such as business process, information, culture, knowledge, structure, strategy, etc. - one molecule for each type of organizational domain or management concept. We may use a molecule to design a domain and create an architecture-in-the-small. Similarly, we may align several molecules into organizational patterns, creating an architecture-in-the-large. Such patterns are at the heart of an organization's competitive distinctiveness. Organization Modeling may be seen as an MIS as well as an organizational design discipline. The industrial era is giving way to the knowledge era. The industrial era organization is characterized by information processing and therefore emphasizes data creators, routine work and a machine culture. In contrast, the knowledge organization is characterized by learning, and therefore emphasizes knowledge creators, nonroutine work, and innovative cultures. The knowledge organization requires an architecture where the three domains of data, information and knowledge are clearly distinguished - designing knowledge work requires a careful intermingling of all three. Hence, we devote a great deal of attention to the architectural models underlying all three domains and how they are interrelated. This brings forth fresh design constructs such as a knowledge contract, and a whole new approach to the meaning of a business system. Finally, we advance a core organizational architecture for a successful 21st century organization, one that emphasizes culture, business processes, data, information, knowledge, people, and learning.

They teach in the executive information management programs at such firms as AT&T, Lucent Technologies, Solomon Smith Barney, PaineWebber, Prudential, and Pearson Education, among others."},{"Title":"Organization Modeling: Innovative Architectures for the 21st Century","review":"In a world where technology has come to permeate our lives, where businesses and the organizations which comprise them have become more virtual and knowledge-based in nature, business and IT professionals have struggled to find common ground in their understanding of how businesses operate and how technology can enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of that operation.

This book should prove an inspiration to all, not just those in research."},{"Title":"A Venomous Life","review":"As someone who has been interested in venomous critters ever since I was a child, I found A Venomous Life to be a wonderful read. It is NOT a dry, boring, chemistry-up-the-ying-yang textbook on toxicology (seeGoldfrank's Toxicologic Emergenciesif you want a good tox book).Instead, this book details the life of one of Australia's most dedicated researchers of venomous critters, and how he worked to mitigate the risk of injury or death from exposure to their bites/stings. Australia is a beautiful country, if you can ignore the snakes \\"down under\\" that are 100+ times more venomous than our humble rattlesnake here in the United States. Then again, they've also got tunnel-web spiders with fangs strong/long enough to punch through shoes or thumbnails, and a neat little tick that can paralyze you with a bite. Great country, nasty critters! Sutherland's book discusses these beasties, and more.Sutherland was a physician, and was a self-admitted \\"prig\\" upon graduation from med school. He spent some time in the Royal Australian Navy before beginning a decades-long career in research focused on Australia's venomous animals (and antidotes to their venoms).This book goes into some detail regarding the events of his childhood, his time in the military, as well as giving insight to the technical/emotional/personal/managerial challenges he faced during his career. In the preface to the book, he faces his own death (from a neurological disorder called Striatal Nigral Degeneration) with grace and humor.This book helps the reader understand Dr. Sutherland as a human, with human faults along with a brilliant mind. His inventions, including pressure bandaging for a venomous spider or snake bite, along with antivenoms for the Sydney funnel-web spider will hopefully serve as lasting memorials to his intelligence (and sense of humor)."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer's Doctrine of Repentance: Renewing the Power to Love","review":"If the cost weren't so high, this could be called a \\"Tractfor the Times\\"! Because of the price, I have given it only4 stars, despite the 5 star content.Here is what attracted me in this study. In this day ofmuch liturgical revision, nobody seems to ask *what messageour liturgy conveys?*Indeed, modern revisions seem to produce liturgies hardlyworthy of the name. Dumbed Down or theologically neutered,today's modern revisions often leave something to be desired.Worse, those who claim to \\"have to liturgy\\" and \\"followthe bible alone\\" often end up going to a meeting called a\\"worship service\\" in name, only to experience aContemporary Christian Music concert without the Mosh Pit.Then, at best, the Word of God, the Thanksgiving of thePeople through the Lord's Supper, and the Gospel ofChrist become incidental to the \\"performance\\".Such muddy thinking and spirituality was not always the case.Cranmer's Doctrine of Repentance is unfolded in Cranmer's Liturgy of 1552.Yet Cranmer's doctrine and liturgy were not really *his* atall. Instead he simply sought to be faithful to theHoly Scriptures and what he considered to be thefaithful teaching of the Holy Catholic Church before thecorruptions that had so plagued his day.Specifically, Cranmer's Liturgy attacked the heretical viewof Christ's atonement which stated that our Lord's passionwas sufficient to wash away the stain of original sin, butlittle more. Our works, the indulgence peddlers stated totheir profit, are required expiate post baptismal sins.To this Cranmer, having studied the scripturesand the fathers of the Church answered a resounding\\"NO\\"! His liturgy is the unfolding of the biblicaldoctrine repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.Read it and you'll agree that we need to re-establishgodly worship along these lines whether one usesCranmer's ancient liturgy or a modern - but faithful- rendition of it. The point is not to return,necessarily, to the Thee's, Thou's, and Vouchsafe'sof Cranmer's day. Rather, the point is for us toRETURN TO CRANMER'S GOD THROUGH JESUS CHRISTin regular worship that humbles us and exaltsthe salvation that Jesus Christ gives to the world!Read this book, and I believe you'll agree with Cranmer.May God move someone at Oxford Press to putthis out in a reasonably priced paperback!Fr. Chuck Huckaby -"},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer's Doctrine of Repentance: Renewing the Power to Love","review":"While at first blush you may not be particularly interested in the difference between the late medieval and early Protestant understandings of repentance this book is much more than that. It deals with Cranmer's understanding of salvation itself and thoroughly outlines his theological development that took place over a few decades. Cranmer stands squarely within the early Protestant tradition with regards to his doctrine of salvation and was as influenced by the Lutheran Philip Melanchthon as he was by such Reformed theologians as Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr and early editions of Calvin's Institutes. Null demonstrates the commonalities between Cranmer and Melanchthon but concludes that he veered more towards Reformed soteriology. Null demonstrates time and time again how Cranmer returned to patristic sources, Augustine in particular, to justify his Protestant understanding of repentance and justifying faith. Cranmer's personl notes, the \\"Great Common Places\\" are filled with quotations and annotations of Augustine's works. Often Cranmer, like Calvin, will prefer Augustine to Luther, but not always. Other times he will read Augustine in light of Luther and Melanchthon. Null describes Cranmer's theology as Protestant Augustinianism.Another hot issue is what Cranmer thought about the baptismal regeneration of infants. After all, the Prayer Book and Catechism indicate that the child is born again in baptism, but Null's extensive research into Cranmer's heretofore untranslated and barely read \\"Great Common Places\\" demonstrates that Cranmer's theology of the sacraments was guided by predestination. Thus Cranmer assumed that infants predestined to be saved were made regenerate in baptism, but not the non-elect. Cranmer tends to give everyone the benefit of the doubt in his liturgy and in his Homilies, but his private notes indicate that he was quite the predestinarian. Thus sacraments were only efficacious for the elect, but Cranmer never made his private beliefs public. Thus the tremendous confusion that ensued within Anglicanism due to what Cranmer proclaimed from the pulpit such as \\"Repent all of you\\" while not saying \\"I know that only the elect amongst you will repent.\\" Nor should one think Cranmer an Arminian, for he believed that the justified and the elect were synonymous. Contra Augustine there was no possibility of a justification that led to a later fall from grace. In this sense Cranmer followed other Reformed theologians and rejected Augustine and the Lutheran position.Ashley Null has provided an invaluable service by making Cranmer's heretofore obscure personal writings become clear and see the light of day. This book is an excellent complement to Diarmaid MacCulloch's biography of Cranmer.Ashley Null has performed a tremendous service to Anglican studies here. His conclusions are based on years of research and not just hunches."},{"Title":"The government inspector (World theatre series)","review":"In Gogol's time in Russia corruption was found in every arm of the government. Petty bureaucrats often pocketed money that was intended for public works. The play exposes backwater greed and corruption by showing how thoroughly ingrained bribery and lobbying are in to the culture of smalltime government officials.The plot of the play is quite ingenious. Khlestakov, a clerk of some sort, but on the whole an entirely unimportant person in the government, is in town at the tavern. He's on the verge of getting kicked out since he's rung up a huge bill. Just when he's thinks all's lost the Lord provost shows up, pays his bill and start treating him like he's the cat's pajamas. Slowly Khlestakov realizes that the towns people think he's an all important Government Inspector and are desperate to bribe wine and dine him so he gives a good report to Petersburg.This play is a critical social statement about corruption told though the humorous device of a farce. By making light of the faults of our leaders we may be able to raise awareness of the problem of corruption and effect measures that will lead to change."},{"Title":"The works of Victor Hugo","review":"Hey Guys,I'm enjoying using kindle so far. It has been great. Although this is the first book that gives me a headache.The table of contents has problems, you can not jump from one work to another.I already wrote to Amazon, they said that it has been fixed it, but so far the problem remains. I deleted the file, reseted my kindle and the file is still with problems.

It revealed to me many things that I had never known before about this unusual character. First rate."},{"Title":"Taking over","review":"Overall, I liked the book very much. It is refreshing to read a book about 4 accomplished business women. My only complaint is that the authors did not write well from the male perspective. Having said that, the book is definately worth reading!"},{"Title":"My Suburban Shtetl (Library of Modern Jewish Literature)","review":"I was thrilled when I found out about this book.Not only was it about my hometown but it was also about being a Jew. Having been a Jew in Skokie during the 60's, 70, & 80'sI was sheltered from the world around me until the Nazi's decided to march in 1977. This book covers not only the nazi's, but the community of Holocaust survivors as well as a mini history of the suburb.I thought I was the only one who thought Aunt Jemima was the real deal. An excellent read all around."},{"Title":"The Rubicon Dictionary of Positive and Motivational Quotations: Believed to Be the World's Largest Collection of Life-Affirming and Inspiring Thoughts and Sayings","review":"If you speak, train or motivate people.

This was recommended to me by my friend and mentor Les Brown and being able to pull out a powerful quote during a presentation has made a world of difference. \\"When it comes to betting on yourself, your a chicken livered coward if you hesitate.\\" Get this book today."},{"Title":"An illustrated guide to the mountain stream insects of Colorado","review":"Obviously this is not a book for everyone. I do think it would be useful to anyone from the Rocky Mountains and not just Colorado. For the price it is the best book to have with you on a field trip and most of the other people I know (a narrow group to be sure) carry it with them along with their collecting equipment. I volunteer as a monitor for wildland restoration projects and we are interested to see what positive impact we are having on stream health. One of the flags of success is a healthly aquatic insects community. It is a good starter book before one gets really serious and pops for a $100+ book on benthic organisms."},{"Title":"An illustrated guide to the mountain stream insects of Colorado","review":"This is a nice little book. It's not exhaustive and it is limited to mountain stream insects of Colorado (just like the title says!). However, there is an excellent introduction with some guiding principles of ecology and the illustrations throughout the book are excellent. I find it a useful compliment to other, more technical books - especially for teaching newcomers in the lab about insect anatomy. It's worth every cent, but it won't answer all of your questions."},{"Title":"Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women","review":"I took this book with me on a two-week trip to Japan and it was invaluable. Weston's book is the only one I've found which focuses on individuals, rather than on time periods spanning hundreds of years or on confusing family dynasties. Instead, the book is divided into easily digestible topics like &quot;Industry,&quot; &quot;Traditional Culture,&quot; and even &quot;Modern Writers.&quot; As I travelled, I skipped around in the book, reading chapters which helped me better understand my surroundings. After seeing Tokyo's electronics district, I read about the founders of Sony, Mitsubishi and Minolta. On the train to Hiroshima, I read up on Tojo, Emperor Hirohito, and novelist Ibuse Masuji(Weston shares Masuji's vivid descriptions of the bombing). I wandered through several of Kyoto's impressive temples and shrines but had no sense of the history behind the architecture, so I looked to Weston's chapters on Oda Nobunaga, &quot;the warrior who united half of Japan,&quot; and on Tokugawa, the founder of a three hundred year-old dynasty which produced several of Kyoto's most glorious structures. After viewing ancient woodcuts in Kyoto, I developed a real appreciation for them by reading about Hokusai, whose work virtually defines the craft. On the plane back to the US, I read Weston's chapter on the filmmaker Kurosawa and decided which movies to rent back home! Weston's book is packed with interesting details, yet does not overwhelm the initiate. If you're travelling in Japan and plan to get by on the information in the front of your guidebook, forget it! You'll be missing out on the most fascinating aspects of everything you see. Stick Weston's paperback in your suitcase and refer to it whenever you wonder things like, &quot;Wow, where did Haiku poetry come from?&quot; &quot;How did Japan's industrial base become so strong?&quot; &quot;How are women treated in modern Japan?&quot; &quot;What's going on in the tea ceremony?&quot; &quot;What was it like here during the post WWII American occupation?&quot; and of course... &quot;Which Japanese samurai films are must-sees?&quot;"},{"Title":"Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women","review":"Giants of Japan is a very pleasant introduction to Japanese history, organized in a succession of biographies of the most influential figures in Japanese business, politics, arts and sports. In addition to being well-written, the book offers a good mix of key facts and anecdotes, making the reading both interesting and exciting.Beyond information about the country itself, Weston takes good care of extracting history lessons from his biographies. For example, it is edifying to learn how (with what vision, strategems, and tricks) Mistui developed from a sake brewry into one of the worldfs largest corporations, with what political purpose tea ceremony was used, and how a single author, Fukuzawa Yukichi, precipitated Japan's westernization.The book recounts the origins of Shintoism, Haiku, even Aikido (judofs creator, Jigoro Kano, is missing from the book). It depicts the spirit of feudal warriors (both samurais and ronins), and shows how Bushido has survived in 20th century Japan (exemplified by Mishimafs tragic death). It also deals with the dark pages of Japanese history, including Japanese military actions before and during WWII and modern political corruption.I recommend this book to anyone who has a yet unfulfilled interest in Japan; the biographical structure of the book makes it readable even to a busy audience."},{"Title":"Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women","review":"Giants Of Japan: The Lives Of Japan's Greatest Men And Women by journalist and author Mark Weston is an informed and informative biographical survey of great figures drawn from fifteen centuries of Japanese history. Ranging from the internationally famous writer Yukio Mishima and the film director Akira Kurosawa, to historical icons such as Shotoku (the prince who helped bring Buddhism to Japan), and the actress Izumo no Okuni (who created kabuki theater), Giants Of Japan effectively summarizes an eclectic collection of fascinating and remarkable lives revealed in an energetic and raptly interesting presentation. Very highly recommended reading for students of Japanese history and culture."},{"Title":"Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women","review":"As one largely unacquainted with Japanese history and culture who had a need to learn more about the country, I found &quot;Giants of Japan&quot; a helpful, accessible, and even fun-to-read overview. Weston's format of &quot;bite-sized&quot; profiles makes the book easy to put down and pick up repeatedly without losing continuity."},{"Title":"Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women","review":"It's very helpful to have biographies of industrial, cultural and historical figures all in one book. They are well-written and researched, and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women","review":"This is the best book I have read in either Japanese or English that gives a comprehensive, easy to read and balanced overview of the lives of 37 people who contributed into making Japan into what it is today. The book presents people from diverse aspects of Japan: industry, traditional culture, history, modern writers and film directors. The people span from the first ever novelist in the world Murasaki (c.975-c.1025) to Morita Akio, the co-founder of Sony. The biographies are short and concise and are on average 10 pages long. It is not necessary to read the entire book at once, but read one biography and come back to another one at a later time. I have read and reread the book numerous times and have been inspired by the lives of each one of the people profiled."},{"Title":"Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women","review":"Much has been written about the history of Japan from the point of view of society and group dynamics. This is understandable given Japan's interdependent culture. Mark Weston's Giants of Japan is one of the first that covers Japan from the point of view of it's great individuals. The subjects of the book range from well known industrialists (Konosku Matsuhita) and leaders (Tokogawa Ieyasu) to lesser known writers (Fukuzawa Yukichi) and directors (Ozu Yasujiro).The book is good for many different types of people. Those with a deeper knowledge of Japan can pick and choose from the individuals they wish to learn more about. Those newly interested in Japan can read the book cover to cover to gain a broad knowledge of the history and people of Japan.This book does not attempt to provide a comprehensive Japanese history, or in depth view of any aspect of Japanese society. There are other more suitable books in those genres."},{"Title":"Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women","review":"This was the best book I read last year.

Check it out."},{"Title":"Civil War: The Early Battles (Civil War Regiments , Vol 5 No 4)","review":"This book is to be commended for inclusion of Lt. William Barlow's account of the Battle of Carthage and other materials that help portray this important, but under-reported phase of the War Between the States. The articles were carefully chosen and suitable for any serious student of the conflict."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Written at the cusp of the 'consumer revolution', this book is both a quaint historical piece and a prophesy of what was to come. The tangential thesis of the book is that by the mid-fifties, the standard problems in capitalism -- those of production and distribution of goods -- were solved, but that this introduced another problem: all of these goods must be consumed. So, it became necessary to step up the techniques used to market these goods.Advertising was nothing new, but the psychological intricacy and sophistication in it was ratcheted up significantly. Using Freud, Jung, and whatever other foundation proved workable, social scientists and psychoanalysts honed their skills to develop an ever-growing repertoire of tricks that would induce us all to spend and consume at ever-higher levels.Two things make the book relevant today: 1) nothing has changed either in the economic situation or in the techniques, except that both have become even more intense (two thirds of the 2002 U.S. GNP depends on consumer spending); and 2) no other book has yet come forward to do a better job at showing, in great anecdotal detail and for a broad audience, what depth marketing is all about."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"The Hidden Persuaders explores the dark world of advertising and the effects it has upon our minds. Even though it was written originally in 1957, most of its material is still relevant today. At first, one may be lead to the conclusion Vance Packard has gone off the far end with his accusations of subliminal mind control, but he provides so much factual data you finally come to realize this isn't any joking matter. Everyone should read this book, at least to become familiar with its theme, and to increase personal awareness of the underlying messages our minds are exposed to every day. Packard will help you understand virtually hundreds of ways corporations get you to give away your hard earned money readily. He explains not only how companies make you tick, but why they make you tick. After reading the book, you will never watch another commercial or listen to another advertisement the same."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS by Vance Packard stands as one of the more eye-opening accounts of the development of the motivational sciences in the 20th Century. What is being described by Packard is the evolution of a systematic relationship between merchandisers of America's then-booming manufacturing industries who teemed up with Madison Avenue-style advertising firms, who themselves were backed by a network of behavioral scientists. As described by Packard, this network not only developed novel and creative ways of reaching into the psyche of its intended target audiance to tap into hidden motivations; but in the process of turning us all into more compliant consumers, so shifted the values of the entire society that they changed American society for all time. Today many of us have virtually succumbed our natural &quot;reality&quot; to a phony existance based upon presenting an image of ourselves to our peers that is actually based upon media and market-generated values. Once we understand the process that created this vast consumer culture, with all it's attendant neuroses, we can then begin to fashion for ourselves a strategy for recovering our basic humanity. What is being described in THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS, is the origins of a system to manipulate us out of that humanity."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Vance Packard is a man ahead of his times. Although this book was published forty years ago, it is not dated at all. Packard shows us in a witty way how producers hire motivation researchers to determine why consumers buy the products they do. This is the first book I have read on this subject, and it is very interesting to read how people actually have a job in which they determine what motivates a person to buy a product. I knew that a product's appearance had some weight on its probability of selling, but I had no idea as to what extent this occurs in. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It is very easy to understand and straightforward."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Most of us realize that we are being influenced all the time. What most of us don't realize is just how much we are controlled and influenced. The Hidden Persuaders will describe to you the early efforts made to understand, control and influence people in the name of consumerism and control. This book should scare you, especially when you stop and think about how much more refined the methods are today.A key point made by the book is the primary difference between manipulation and persuasion is intent. Even the most cursory look at history will tell you that when the tools exist, someone will use them to dominate and control others. In fact, they are being used right now and everyday to control us. The Matrix is alive and well and real.Read this book."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"It is hard to believe that one of the most perceptive and important books on the shaping of modern society is out of print. This book shows how the workings of our minds have been scientifically evaluated, and this knowledged used to manipulate them. Not in any 'X-Files' manner, just straight out appealing to our basic desires and needs. Read this book, and then as yourself what every ad and salesperson is doing to you when you see them. It's all there, so they aren't hard to work out."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"What's really interesting about this book is how old the information is. The ideas Packard described are being presented to us today as relatively novel, as though our culture is just now waking up to the idea that consumerism is about hidden motivations, hypnosis, rationalization and social striving.Take the example about how people want big cars but feel ashamed of buying them, and how you can help them justify it to themselves by talking about safety. This kind of information is being presented to us in the present as though it were news, but there it was, in 1959.As for it being dated, well, in some ways it is. Still, a lot of the psychological information still represents our best information about human nature. It's interesting to see theories devised for healing psychological pathology employed for monetary gain, especially if you don't have a background in advertising and marketing.If you are already an expert in those areas, it might make a fun history lesson."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"A really insightful and illuminating book about the introduction of psychological conditioning methods into product marketing and politics which I consider to be essential reading for anyone who would be aware at this time. What's all the more remarkable is the fact that this book was written at the advent of this development, and the author well understood what it portended. Time to wake up, Neo."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"I met Vance Packard's (1914-1996) work with his The Pyramid Climbers, a pioneer study on American enterprise management developement. The Hidden Persuaders is about a very different subject, and it was also one of the first true considerations on how propaganda, or media manipulation, changes the way America behaves toward franchises, merchandising and, in the end, how it shapes the way we structure our goals and, to use Focualt's title, the order of things. It, of course, shows its age since it was first published in the 1950's. However it is in no way obsolete and thanks to Packard's excellent pen it is a breeze to read, and an excellent example of the so called Pop Sociology."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"We have been programmed by marketing strategies, tv commercials, billboards and anything else that marketing strategists can possibly conceive of!

But the bottomline is that the book no longer belongs to the present time and generation. It is sad but true that this insightful writing needs a relook in present context."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"This book is extremely relevant even its release has been thrown fifty years ago.If you go back to the real origen of the problem , you will find this clever definition of the advertising : It is the art the money of your pocket comes to mine .You may disagree or not with this statement but you must to understand the world has been composed for the consumer and the producer . That means the timeless principle of the Yin and Yan; the force and the reaction; the muscle and the mind; the innovation vs tradition .I love the advertising just for it overthrows the unhealthy paradigm of the last discover; and in the same way that the archeology does , you must to accept the truth always under a veil of relativity . In the market as in the life there is no anything secure and definitive .And that circumstance allows to keep us in continous movement.Packard analyzes the origins of the underworld of the different devices about how to persuade the consumer to acquire things that not necesarily are useful .That is why a whole universe of new disciplines have been created to induce the population to follow certain patterns of induced behavior.I think if you are a centered human being , you can face your inner dragons and win the challenge ; but if you are not a well positioned person , you will be forced to turn around the suggested roads about how to build and rebuild over and over your way of thinking and living.This last option may be well appropriate for this important segment who lives in the first level of Maslow pyramid . And please do not forget this clever statement of Pascal : The mankind looks like as child who always is reborn . That is the real and timeless effective target .Recommended for marketing designers , market research, motivational human sciences and for all those people really interested in that passionate discipline ."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"This book was a great eye opener for me! it mad eme aware of what was really going on in the advertising world!

It is a marketing book and I like marketing books. I was interviewed today and the interviewer asked me if I was more of a mentor coach leader than a marketer. I did not know those were opposite leadership styles.This is one of the original classic marketing books. It was copyrighted in 1957 so it is fairly amusing to read when you see the examples used, like the \\"cancer scare\\", \\"Today's modern housewife\\", and \\"for people entering the second half of this century\\"Much of what he talks about is still true today, although because the book is so dated, it is difficult to pull out all of the lessons. If you want to read it, read it for fun, not for the marketing lessons.It seems whenever I read an older book, the writer thinks that the times were changing more then than ever before and even with the current books, that seems to be the tone. Even back then Packard talked about information overload and overload of marketing. I think the bottom line is everyone always think the times they are in is uncertain, changing etc.To this I say \\"Change is opportunity\\". Find the opportunity for you in change."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"I really enjoyed this book. You will be left with your jaw dropped. A great read for those interested in the contraversy of Marketing."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"The classic book which first exposed the psychological tricks used by advertisers to sell everything from soap to ideas. This information is even more important today when so much information is gathered about each of us. This book shows how even the must seemingly unimportant detail about a person can be used as a tool to manipulate that person's opinions and buying habits."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"This book is filled with lots of interesting examples detailing life and attitudes in the fifties when the book was written. It is a book about how psychological research, motivational research was being employed at the time to sell Americans all kinds of things they did not necessarily really want, or weren't necessarily very good for them. Sounds very much like Reality as we now know it. This selling also extended to Politicians, and Packard foresaw the way the Image would become in many instances more important than the Message in choice of political candidates.As I said the book is filled with information. I am embarassed to say that I have in all my years on this planet and at various dentists never learned Packard's great insight that it does not make much sense to focus one's truth-brushing activities in the morning after the microbes have had eight hours to work on one 's teeth. Brush after you eat, he advises, as I now recall many dentists have told me through the years.In any case this is an enjoyable read by someone who understands that Advertising is not simply manipulative and exploitative but also adds color and interest to the culture."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"Such a great book and such shocking proofreading. The ebook is full of typos. Considering all the publishers have had to do is turn it into electronic text (once) then sit back and take the money, they should be ashamed of the job they've done.

It created my interest in communication."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"What is perhaps most interesting about the early market researchers is the amount of attention paid to class: they imagine, for instance, that the subtle gradations in difference between Buick and cadillac is a telling sympton of American class differences. That is one reason that the Edsel failed, because it was based on the idea that families would &quot;trade-up&quot; to an Edsel if it was positioned as slightly higher-class than a Ford. You can also learn a good deal about life in the 50s: before flouride, people brushed their teeth in the morning, and not for hygiene but for cosmetics. It is a testament to the power of the advertising (and the research) that we now all brush our teeth at night. Packard is long on examples and short on analysis, and he waffles between being golly-gee-willickers impressed with the &quot;scientists&quot; and their methods or repulsed by the cynicism and naked manipulation of their backers. Their definitely is the sense, which is so unfamiliar today, that these guys in lab coats are really strange birds, but surely they must represent progress. After all, isn't it a good thing that people brush at night? Packard is not your standard culture curmudgeon like Galbraith or, much worse, Adorno. Class, of course, is much less important today than then, but it is still important. Packard relates the fascinating story of why people went to loan sharks instead of the wood-panelled banks (and just think of how wood-panelled station wagons have been replaced with the plastic wheel-rims of SUVs): because the borrowers could feel superior to the loan sharks, even if they had to pay higher rates. I suggest that the publisher reissue Packard."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"If you have an interest in what it was like to be in 1950's America, this book is like a time travel excursion taking you there. It's very dated, but an interesting look into life in that time, very much like being there. If you know a little about the 50's, this rounds out a lot of what you think you know. I'm just old enough to have missed the 50's (born 1962) but still recall much of the effects of those years on society. Growing up in Maine, it took awhile for the 50's to actually leave. Much of what I remember as a child relates to that era. If that's you too - you'll enjoy this quick, easy read."},{"Title":"The Hidden Persuaders","review":"I rarely put a book down, even if I find its not what I expected. I feel a book at least deserves the chance to be heard out -- but not this one.I heard about Hidden Persuaders on NPR when they talked about consumer buying habits. Thinking it would be an intriguing look into the way things are marketed to us, I bought the book. Vance and his publisher want you to believe that this is a shocking expose of the advertising industry but I doubt even he believes his assertion. Perhaps these were revolutionary techniques in the 50s but they certainly aren't relevant now. Does it require a psychologist to tell us that we all want a convertible and leave with a sedan? That you'd rather have a cake mix that requires eggs and milk instead of just water? That you want to indulge in a guilty pleasure but need to be reassured first? That sex sells? It's armchair psychology and nothing in the book is shocking or surprising.Even the publisher doesn't take this release seriously -- it clearly skipped the editor's desk and went straight to press typo's and all. The cover teases you in with promises of scandalous marketing tactics, but it fails to deliver any more than wasted print."},{"Title":"Islam in Ethiopia","review":"Trimingham presents the general religious and cultural background of Ethiopian history, into which he places a learned chronicle of the emergence and development of Islam.After introducing the country, he accounts for the origin of Ethiopian Christianity among the peoples of the highlands, its amalgamation of Jewish practices, and its becoming the state religion. The rise of Islam in Mecca (across the Red Sea) results in the isolation of the mountain kingdom. The author proceeds to describe the belated introduction of Islam on the coastal lowlands, and the formation there of various sultanates, each based on trade.The book often conveys the inner logic and pivotal circumstance behind a sequence of events. Trimingham is a scholar of Islam in Africa and his firm grasp of the subject is reflected here in the thoughtful analysis he gives to historical events.The ensuing era of rivalry and armed conflict between the highland and the coast are portrayed, as the Muslim states weather early and severe reversals. Yet, with their seaborne connections, e.g., to the Ottoman Turks, the Muslims manage to marshall their strength. A charismatic Imam, Ahmad ibn Ibraham (aka &quot;Gragn&quot;), eventually directs an army of pastoralists and immigrants to a climactic invasion of the wealthier, agricultural highlands during the sixteenth century. The timely arrival of the Portuguese provide the assistance by which the Christian kingdom survives. Eventually the negusa negast (king of kings) overcomes, but shortly thereafter the pagan Oromo peoples invade from the south at the expense of both Christian and Muslim.The historical account is carried forward through a period of political disorganization, until the time of the unification of modern Ethiopia under the sway of the Christian Emperor, the negusa negast. (The book was writtn in 1951, well before the problematic communist revolution of 1974, the famine and economic disasters, and the subsequent rebuilding of the current secular state).Following the historical account is a description of the then current state of Islam: its status among the different peoples of the region, and the various sufi orders practiced. Islam continued to find converts among the pagan peoples with whom Muslim merchants traded; it was the sufi orders which provided the most common port of entry for new adherents. As Ethiopia is a country where relations between Muslims and Christians are today relatively benign, its history would seem to merit study for this reason alone.Trimingham, authoritative and scholarly throughout, nonetheless lets his Christianity show from time to time, while losing neither his bearings nor his reliable objectivity. The book's contents have stood up well, and have been little dated where it matters most, i.e., where Trimingham provides his reflections on Ethiopian religious history. This book satisfies on account of its rich historic content and its narrative strengths, as well as its recurrent insight"},{"Title":"Small Game Hunting","review":"There are many things to like in this book. For one, the author very clearly has a love for small game hunting and does not merely see the activity as an amusing prelude to the big-game seasons. Additionally, the author focuses on the joy of the hunt and the satisfaction that is not weighed in pounds of meat. He uses a variety of guns, not for their efficiency, but because they add enjoyment to the hunt.On the negative side, the author seems to have some very rigid opinions about a number of items and advocates for them without explanation--even to such mundane items as the types of boot laces to use (leather and nothing else). Such flourishes that are clearly opinions without deference to any other possibility takes away from what is otherwise, a very good book.The last negative, is that the book focuses almost exclusively on hunting in the Pacific Northwest. If that is your area, then you really should buy this book. If you live elsewhere, but want to read a well-written book with much valuable information, this is a good book, but not a \\"must-read\\"."},{"Title":"Small Game Hunting","review":"Francis Sell is a vigorous hunter, passionately enthusiastic about his beloved sport. Keen and observant and living right in the heart of excellent hunting country, he gives his all in an attempt to understand game and to master the skills necessary for the utmost satisfaction and the ultimate in results. A stickler for detail, he has advanced t a point which few hunters have the opportunity to achieve. To him the actual shot is wonderful, but collectively the many other contributing factors constitute the vital considerations of his exacting pastime.Great significance is attached to the small-game hunting season as a perfect tune-up for the elk and deer seasons which climax the year. So clearly he shows how the stalk, the arms and ammunition, and the type of shots for small game correspond with big-game situations. Each sport in turn prepares the individual to meet the success in the other; each makes the other more enjoyable. Squirrel, woodchuck, rabbits, birds, in fact all manner of small game present problems comparable to those on the elk and deer trails.A study of Francis Sell's conception of small-game hunting will create in the individual a deeper interest and understanding of his sport and it will bring to him more abundant reward."},{"Title":"Urban Renewal and the End of Black Culture in Charlottesville, Virginia: An Oral History of Vinegar Hill","review":"An excellent overview of the local history of \\"urban removal\\" in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Here also the hero,shadow warrior Chris Hatcher,goes on a long, tortuous hunt for a renegade US soldier, Murph Cody, once his bosom buddy. The wild goose chase, in its wake, exposes the dark underbelly of the drug mafias of the Golden Triangle. The mafia heading the secret organizations, known as Triads, can match the best of business brains in their strategies and the worst terrorists in their vice. The terror trail leads us to the source of drugs trade, where tribesmen systematically produce the deadly crop, dodging the prying eyes of the authorities.The depravity and the viciousness of the drug gangs and the blood and gore that Hatcher's entry generates, are somewhat counterbalanced by the light-hearted camaraderie of the Vietnam veterans cooped in a strange corner in Bangkok. They are the destitute of the war--home and their past now seem so far away. They want to live their lives in the make-believe world in a totally unreal environment.The novelist deftly invokes the sights and sounds of the enchanting city that is Bangkok. If you have traveled there, this book will take you one notch closer to its heart.Chinmay HotaAuthor of 'Hits and Misses'"},{"Title":"Thai Horse","review":"With two tours in Viet Nam, 3 years teaching at the Naval Academy and experience \\"fighting\\" kites in Borneo, I feel qualified to say that the author wrote this drivel without even the most rudimentary research.

This story moves like a well written movie, all the splendor of the orient are displayed here. William Diehl one of the best modern writers outdoes himself, he creates a world that captures the imagination and takes the reader beyond excitement. The book is a must read for lovers of action hero types. Christian hatcher can match wits with Sherlok Holmes, has the finesse of James Bond and the destructive indifferent side of the terminator, three traits that are very difficult to mesh together in a single story or character. To william Diehl, thank you for writing such a captivating book, Outstanding writing, keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Thai Horse","review":"With the whispering assassin, Diehl has created a verysatisfying hero. Christian Hatcher is the strong, silent type who is also a gentle, caring lover. He's a fairly simple - even gullible - character, driven for most of his life by other people's ambitions and machinations, but finally starting to realise his own value to himself.Nonetheless, he is set on an adventure by the one person he really wants to see either dead, or in jail: the self-same man who framed nhim and sent him to Lops Boxes.But who is manipulating whom? The plot thickens. There's a man-eating tiger, there are scenes of insane barbarity and passages of tender intimacy.One note: you'll have to put yourself firmly into the '80s, when the action happens.The plot, as I said, is convoluted, although based on a simple premise: Hatcher, a man wronged, is asked by his betrayer to find an old friend, the son of a respected, dying General.Great stuff. Another book I've stopped lending out...First among equals? Yes. I've enjoyed all William Diehl's books - but this is his best, by a short whisker. Buy it. It's a great read."},{"Title":"Thai Horse","review":"William Diehl does know how to tell story. He is comparable to the likes of Forsyth and Follet.Thai Horse is a very well researched novel , rich in detail, and full of twists and surprises.

After I finished the book, I just loved it! That lead me to buy and read all of Diehl's books afterwards. All of his books or most were good. I bought a used Thai Horse book at used bookstore today because I wanted to read it again. I guess I just love Hatcher's character and perservence and that he never gave up hope."},{"Title":"Thai Horse","review":"This is my 1st William Diehl book. I didn't think I would like it at all as it revolved around the Vietnam war in the beginning (I thought it was a war story) but I got so wrapped up with the character Hatch, that I had to know why he was where he was and how on earth he would get out of Los Boxes! Hatch became our hero and if Cody was alive we knew Hatch would find him and do the right thing no matter what Sloan had planned for maybe both? I can see an excellent action/thriller movie out of this story the plot is twisting and turning and you wonder why the author is introducing new characters (or old)and how is all comes together (brilliantly) at the end. We could fell Hatch's pain with Daphne but I won't give the story away. All I can say is read the book.

There is action, suspense, depth, love, and fear. The settings make for engaging reading, as do the dialogues and complex relationships between characters. Unquestionably Diehl's best book."},{"Title":"Thai Horse","review":"Although he makes a few technical errors (he's not Tom Clancy), the author is able to convince readers that Christian Hatcher is a real former secret agent/assassin with a conscience and sense of duty and what's right.

Hatcher agrees and starts the search, coming to the Vietnam memorial in D.C. discovering a beret with the inscription \\"Thank god for Thai Horse,\\" Hatcher is confused of why a vet would thank Thai Heroin and goes looking for answers that take him all the way to Asia where he meets up with a freind whose a crime lord in Hong Kong who shows him the statue of the mythical animal Thai Horse said to come down and gather up fallen warriors off the battle field and carry them to the warriors paradise. He then goes to Bangkok where he meets expatriates and former veterans of the Vietnam War who make a life in Thailand, unable or unwilling to go home. They eventually show Hatcher that Murph Cody is in hiding, and that the woman who he loved in Vietnam they called Thai Horse because she helped alleviate their pain while in a Vietnamese prison camp.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Cities and the Creative Class","review":"Even though Richard Florida wrote this book three years afterThe Rise of the Creative Class: And How It's Transforming Work, Leisure, Community and Everyday Life, he calls it a prequel. He covers the same theme: cities that show openness to people and new ideas thrive as they attract the Creative Class, which in turn creates new markets and cause economic growth.The foundation of his Creative Capital theory is his 3 Ts of economic growth: tolerance, talent, and technology. For any city to be a thriving Creative Class cluster it needs all three. The Creative Class generates new ideas and products that cause creative centers to thrive. Those include San Francisco, Seattle, Washington D.C., Boston, Denver, and Austin. The cities that are less tolerant of people and new ideas do less well. Examples include Memphis, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Indianapolis.The author goes into more statistics then in \\"The Rise of the Creative Class.\\" Unfortunately, they are flawed. He shows many scatter plots with either High Technology or Software workers per million as the dependent variable on the Y axis. He tests those against many independent variables. But, he gets very different results. For instance, when he looks at Environmental Quality vs High Technology (figure 3.4) he gets a random relationship. Meanwhile, Environmental Quality vs Software workers shows a strong relationship. When focusing on Amenities, the reverse is true. Also, his scatter plots are flawed because they select different data. The ones with High Technology have 35 cities. The ones with Software workers have only 27. So, comparisons between the two data sets are invalid. For the one variable (Gay index) that does show strong correlation with both High Technology and Social workers, he may have cherry picked the data as he uses now only 24 cities. Thus, he could have eliminated outliers (11 cities from one data set and 3 from the other) that did not confirm the strong relationship. Later, when he studies the Bohemian Index he uses a different independent variable than the ones he used for the Gay Index rendering the comparison between both indexes moot.When analyzing the impact of amenities in attracting the Creative Class the statistics and narratives contradict each other. Table 4.2 shows Cultural Amenities with a 0.493 correlation with High Tech. Yet, a similar scatter plot on page 70 shows complete randomness. On page 71, the author states there is no relationship between cultural amenities and the Creative Class, as they strongly prefer outdoor recreational amenities. But, on page 99 he states the opposite: \\"The results of the correlation analysis support that talented individuals appear to be attracted more by cultural amenities than by recreational amenities or climate.\\" Finally, on page 167 he reverses course again: \\"The Creative Class prefers active, participatory forms of recreation... these workers enjoy active outdoor sports. \\" So, which is it?The single best statistical evidence supporting his Creative Capital Theory is a correlation matrix (fig. 5.2) on page 119 that confirms that the Bohemian Index, Gay Index, Talent, and High Technology are all very highly correlated. Unfortunately, those high correlations are contradicted by a Path Analysis (fig. 4.5) on page 106 with path coefficients that are very small. This raises further confusion.Semantics are also confusing. The author refers to the Gay Index or the Diversity Index or even the Diversity/Gay Index to refer to the same thing. Why doesn't he stick to just one name?In the last two chapters, he gives us a lead into his next two books. In chapter 8, he focuses on New York city and the whole East Coast corridor going all the way to Boston. This is the first Meta-Region he focuses on. In chapter 9, he muses about international competition with many cutting edge foreign Meta-Regions (London, Sydney, Tokyo, Vancouver). This will lead to his next book I was not that fond off where he sells the U.S. short,The Flight of the Creative Class: The New Global Competition for Talent. But, ultimately this research will lead to his second outstanding book,Who's Your City?: How the Creative Economy Is Making Where to Live the Most Important Decision of Your Lifewhere he will study the 50 or so leading Meta-Regions of the World that generate most of the World's GDP and new ideas. If only he had just written \\"The Creative Class\\" and \\"Who'se Your City?\\" his track record would have been impeccable."},{"Title":"Cities and the Creative Class","review":"This honestly might be the worst book I've ever read. I'm a senior in college and was forced to read it for a Sustainable Urban Engineering elective class, and wow what a waste of time. I've never seen an author repeat himself more than Florida did here. He was saying the same things (really, check it out) on, say, page 140 as he was on page 35...that basically cities need to invest not in tax abatements to attract high-quality and talented businesses and people, but need to focus on increasing diversity and quality of life through developing amenities like good social scenes. The book is filled with a bunch of charts, tables, and graphs, backing up his claims that talent and the creative class flock to diverse regions with lots of stuff to do (which, really in my mind isn't groundbreaking information), but they again are extraordinarily repetitive. The book could have easily been condensed into a short article in and I would have gotten just as much out of it."},{"Title":"Cities and the Creative Class","review":"The basic thesis of this book is that socially tolerant cities tend to have high levels of education and high-technology employment, which in turn leads to regional economic growth. To my unsophisticated eyes, he appears to have shown some correlation between social tolerance and a high-tech economy. But his analysis raised some questions:*Is it possible to establish which way the causal chain runs? That is, does economic growth cause tolerance or vice versa? Florida writes that declining cities like Pittsburgh and Baltimore are not sufficiently \\"tolerant and open.\\" But are these cities less tolerant because of economic stagnation or vice versa?*Florida shows that there is at least some correlation between social tolerance (defined as a high number of gay couples and people in \\"bohemian\\" occupations such as writing and the arts) and an educated workforce, and that an educated workforce is correlated with economic growth. But (and maybe I'm just misreading his data here) I'm not sure that he has established the link between social tolerance and economic growth.*Assuming that socially tolerant places have higher income growth, is the advantage of higher income growth wiped out by higher regional cost of living? In other words, if Hipsterville has 2 percent income growth per year and exploding housing costs while Stodgeland has 1 percent growth and small-town housing costs, is Hipsterville really better off?Finally, there are some assertions Florida makes that aren't supported by data. He suggests, for example, that \\"environmental quality and natural amenities are important factors in a firm's choice of location.\\" But his own table shows that more cities have low environmental quality and high levels of hi-tech employment than have high environmental quality and high hi-tech.Perhaps Florida's most valuable service is peripheral to his main argument: he utterly demolishes the idea that old-fashioned cultural amenities like professional sports, art museums, etc. contribute to high-talent, high-tech employment. The correlations are simply nonexistent."},{"Title":"Cities and the Creative Class","review":"My hunch is this is a cheap sequel. Not a lot of discussion, just a lot of (regression) results reporting. Extremely repetitive. Moreover, given that this often verves into being fairly social science (as opposed to pop), the causal linkages seem pretty poorly established. If you want to read this for professional reasons (social science or urban planning), most of this could be ignored; if you want to read this for personal (i.e., recreational) reasons, it's really boring."},{"Title":"Japanese for College Students II: Tapes","review":"Having worked with Volume 1 I already was familiar with the outline of this book. I am a beginners student of Japanese at Tel Aviv University. We study one chapter a week in the book which is quite a moderate tempo but that is about as much as I feel comfortable to grasp per week. The book is divided into exercises based on the grammar in the chapter and it is explained in comprehensible English. There are reading exercises and each chapter also has a kanji section that covers about 10 new kanjis for writing. I have not bought the audio tapes coming with the books yet but have been highly recommended since they are an excellent complement and ensure proper pronounciation and a comfortable method to review the material covered in the chapter."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Game Master's Pack","review":"This typical RPG accessory contains a pad of character record sheets; a copy of the character generation scheme (with tables); a combat action summary; a magic summary (arcane and divine-no dark- lores) with name, casting time and number of spells; and a grimoire form for 16 spells. There is also an extensive name generating table for all four races, and \\"inspirational Character Portraits\\"-read line drawings of old world folk.None of these are necessary, of course:(one could easily make up one's own tables) but they are convenient and well done.

Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Waiting Dog","review":"With the recent popularity in children's literature of dark subject materials with such books as Lemony Snickett's A series of unfortunate events, the re-issue of Edward Gorey's books and the gross out concepts of series with titles like like \\"Captain Underpants and the Big, Bad Battle of the Bionic Booger Boy\\"this book seems to be an almost natural progression. However, every trend in literature has it's limitsThe Waiting Dog, a poem about a dogs fantasy to eat the mailman, started off as a story told around the dinner table to adults, and one could almost see kids squealing with delight around the campfire, just imagining the scenes evoked by such lines as\\"Picking AwayA chip of your hipa snip of your china nip of your lipa strip of your shinand the eyeball!!SQUIRT!\\"But, the actualization of these images by Andrea Beck is an entirely different matter. Those parents who would think nothing of letting their children watch slasher movies and playing violent videogames can rest assured that their child would lose no sleep over depictions of a dog with his face gleefully buried in the mailman's skull chewing on his eyeballs and brain, while splatters of blood are all over the walls, a closeup of the doomed mans'hands with wood splinters under his fingernails.Most parents however, are probably a little more uptight.That is not to say that this book does not have it's place Indeed, I have had great fun with this book, seeing people's reactions to it, discussing it's merit, and it certainlyfits in well with my collection of bizzare and banned books. Hopefully this book will find its audience and be marketed to adults and not as a children's book.

Especially in these times of so called 'political correctness' and blanding down. Kids are more durable than we give them credit for and, on the whole, will find this wickedly funny gross out tale endlessly fascinating and enjoyable.It is a sad state of affairs that this book was not to be found on the shelves of my local big brand book shop but had to be escorted from the safety of the rear stockroom so I could have a look at it. I understand the need for some censorship but is that really necessary because, lets face it, children are exposed to far worse on TV, in video games and on the internet."},{"Title":"The Waiting Dog","review":"Thank you Thank you Thank you, Kids Can Press and The Beck Sisters.

I think she was an incredible woman way ahead of her time. She was well-established actress on television, film, and stage. She even earned two Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for both television and film. In this book dedicated to her final husband, Dr. Norton Brown, she writes about how they came together quite vaguely. She does write about her previous marriage to William B. Murray, an agent for William Morris agency and the father of author William Murray too. The book is missing pictures but it's a first edition and pictures and photos were not common during the time. Ilka Chase writes beautifully about her life but she comments and name-drops people like Bette Davis and George Cukor but she writes about her divorce and her marriage. She was quite a writer as well as an actress who was ahead of her time. I would have liked to know about why she never had children or desired too. I think she was quite kind to Bette Davis and other celebrities in the book. Ilka's name is quite unusual but useful in remembering her. She was well apart from others. She writes about her succes in acting as well as her failures too. She was quite an author and world traveler in her later books. She writes about her mother, Edna Woolman Chase, and her literary career in New York City as well as life in Hollywood as a movie star without the airs."},{"Title":"Deadly Sweet","review":"If you enjoy good Florida crime novels, in the tradition of Carl Hiassen, Charles Willeford or James Hall, you will really enjoy this book.

It has two delicious heroines, dark-swampy bad guys and a reluctant hero, former football star Eddie Priest.I'd put this one up in top 10% of crime novels."},{"Title":"Deadly Sweet","review":"This one started off a bit slowly. The pace picked up, but it is a deliberate pace throughout.The jacket had comparisons to Carl Hiaasen, but I did not really see that. Hiaasen's recent works have been peopled by characters that have become cartoonish and parodies. The characters in &quot;Deadly Sweet&quot; are far more plausable.The main players are believeable and the plot makes sense. The comic element that Hiaasen brings is not present here, and to me that was a major plus.It never becomes a fast read or a &quot;page turner&quot; in the strict sense. It progresses at a logical pace and the loose ends are tied up. The protagonists are easy to cheer for and it's easy to feel their losses along the way.I enjoyed it. However, I felt the Hiaasen comparisons were off base, but that was a positive. Maybe reviewers think any novel set in Florida is Hiaasenesque."},{"Title":"Dolphin Adventure:: A True Story","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

One day he was diving when he saw three dolphins swimming toward him. He didn't know what they wanted at first, but a couple minutes after, he realized that they wanted help. He knew that he was short of supplies, but he did what he could do to help them. There was a fishhook in the baby's tail so the diver got out a knife and tried to cut the string. Then, the next thing he did was to get the fishhook out of the baby's tail. The baby was saved, but then three ugly sharks came swimming toward them! The father shark tried to avoid them while the others swam up to the surface for safety. They escaped the sharks and said goodbye to the man.

This is not about sea monsters, but rather the monster that is alcoholism. Scott Preston doesn't have a problem. Its everyone else that does. It must be a metabolic thing why he is the only one sweating on the bus...It must be the waitresses problem that she is watching to see if he is going to spill his drink... and after the intervention he will agree to get treatment just to shut his family up...and then he will go have a few more... As sad as people can be when they have a drinking problem, Benchley does a great job of making Preston very likeable and unbelievably witty and clever. The reader almost wants him to be able to go have a drink. This book is very lighthearted despite its dark subject matter. Once in rehab, Preston meets a cast of characters that rivals the core group from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest... And that's when the murder takes place. From there the book increases in suspense and pace. It's amazing how much entertainment Benchley can squeeze into 250 pages - moreover, its amazing that this man is known for monster books and not his precision wit and biting social commentary.Buy this book - its 12 steps worth taking.Relic113"},{"Title":"Rummies","review":"A High Flying editor in a New York publishing firm is forced into rehab by his family and his boss. Of course Scott isn't really an alcoholic. He just needs two double vodkas to start the day. From the hilarious opening sequence all the way to the delightfully wicked ending, Rummies is a simple story, brilliantly told. While it is impossible to ignore the humor in the story Rummies the plot evolves in such a way that it is also a deeply touching and uplifting story. In Scott Preston, Peter Benchley has created an engaging hero for the masses out of an upper middle class WASP. No easy feat. Intelligent and cynical but vulnerable enough to be easily identified with. Throw in a twisted collection of celebrity junkies, booze sodden actresses and hilarious dropouts not to mention an institutional patriach who may not be all that he seems and you have Rummies. Not often can a book make you laugh out loud, but believe it, this one will."},{"Title":"Rummies","review":"A realistic description of how an alcoholic, going into a rehab centre as a result of an intervention, views himself and those around him is how this story starts. Instead of a maudling, self pitying story, there is an outside horror going on that gives the &quot;rummy&quot; a chance to do something good for someone else while recovering. A real inspiration. I love this book and would really like to see it made into a movie. It's very funny and touching. I've never laughed out loud so many times when reading a book. It's about time it was re-issued. I've loaned my copy out and lost it many times. I keep getting &quot;new&quot; ones at garage sales. I'd buy a new copy if I could. One of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Rummies","review":"Rummies is second only to The Girl of the Sea of Cortez as Peter Benhcley's best story. A New York executive has an intervention pulled on him and is whisked away to a rehab facility in Arizona. What goes on there is both funny and infuriating. Benchley seems to understand the alcoholic's twisted logic well and his main character's awakening to his own personal problems and failings ring true. There is a suspense subplot revolving around less than ethical shenanigans at the facility, just to keep the story spicy. An excellent book."},{"Title":"Rummies","review":"Early in his career, those who thought Benchley would follow the comical career of his grandfather and father were wrong. He wrote horror and chilled our blood for ages (JAWS, THE DEEP, THE ISLAND), then made us re-love the see w/ a lighter, more sentimental novel (THE GIRL OF THE SEA OF CORTEZ). After that? He broke into comedy with Q-CLEARANCE (buy it or you'll regret it) and finally, RUMMIES. RUMMIES is what American comedy is---funny, twisted, and utterly fun. From the first page, when backed into a corner &quot;like a Playboy bunny&quot; by his wife, friends, and colleauges to the end, when our hero &quot;Will take care of 'em, Mr. President, don't worry,&quot; the reader is confronted with non-stop laughs. Read it"},{"Title":"Rummies","review":"When Scott Preston has four double vodkas on his way to work one time too many, he finds himself the subject of an intervention. He's packed off to the Banner Clinic, run by Stone Banner, a celebrity who is idolized by the public. He gets to the clinic, where he certainly doesn't feel like he belongs, the same day as another guy dressed in a rabbit suit, and proceeds to meet a unique array of patients. There's tattooed Hector, who seems to be spending his life bouncing from one treatment center to another, Puffguts, who was sent to treatment in lieu of a mob drowning, Cheryl, who's incredibly thin and timid, and the lovely Priscilla, who intrigues Scott against his better judgment. They spend their days going to therapy and chain smoking cigarettes, and Scott begins to turn around under the tutelage of their counselor Marcia. Just when Scott seems to be settling into life in treatment, however, everything goes awry. A famous actress who graduated from the clinic shortly after Scott's arrival is found dead in the desert, either the victim of a long fall or a hit and run. Then their counselors, and then Priscilla, disappear. Something is wrong at the Banner Clinic, and Scott seems to be the only patient levelheaded enough to come up with a plan to save them all.The name Peter Benchley is practically synonymous with the sea, but in this book he proves he doesn't need a watery background to craft a good story. This is a book largely about addiction treatment with a bit of intrigue thrown in, but even without the intrigue I would have liked it. Benchley writes with an engaging sense of humor and his protagonist's journey from denial to acceptance was actually a lot of fun. Though we don't see him on the current best seller lists, Benchley's work is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Gene Structure and Expression","review":"Well, if you do not have time to sit down and read a whole textbook or set of textbooks on the subject, Hawkins Gene Structure and Expression is for you. He not only gives you an overview of the basic topics inluding DNA/RNA structure, replication and transcription but also gives you enough statistics and experimental details to fill a void on the practical side of molecular biology. Lots of overview on gene strcture and function. Although you will not find extensive biochemistry, you do get enough to set you out researching for more. The details you do get, however, will surprise you - both prokaryotic and eukaryotic aspects. There is enough here to bring you up to speed with the theories and methods of molecular biology, and then some.

Here he has written an overview of the entire 17th century as part of this series of books on the history of England to modern times. Needless to say some of his work around the English Revolution seeps into this work as well, which makes that period the strongest section of the book.Professor Hill traces the major social, political, economic and religious trends that culminated in the revolution back to the reign of James I (and some economic trends back to Elizabethan times). He covers such keys areas of conflict as the changes in land use and ownership, agricultural innovations including the highly controversial enclosure policy, governmental foreign policy which tended to have a distinctly Catholic, particularly pro-Spanish, orientation, the embryonic beginnings of the split between court and \`country' as a result of Stuart arbitrary rule, the split between landed proprietors and city merchants; the city and the country, the established church and the numerous pro-Puritan (read Calvinist) sects that started to sprout up like wildfire and the rise of a secular democratic movement based in the cities that both the Army and the Levellers would draw upon in the Civil War period.Special note should be taken of the decades between the beginning of the defensive parliamentary struggles against Charles I in 1640 and 1660 with the restoration of his son Charles II to the throne. At this point the tensions that were merely outlined by the prior policies of the Stuart governments came to the breaking point. Hill does more than merely narrate that story. He shows, based on his well-stocked body of knowledge about the period, the various stages that the revolution went through from vascillations of the first defensive struggles of the Parliamentarians to the definitive break with Charles and the establishment of the New Model Army which would usher in a period of military dominance of government and society and with it the rise and fall of the various secular and religious democratic movements. Hill also does a masterful job of showing how the various plebian democratic forces in society reacted to governmental policy (and how the government dealt with those forces) and how, as a result, these various fights sapped the revolutionary energy of the masses.As more than one historian and sociologist has noted, as a general proposition the study of post-revolutionary periods tends to be rather anti-climatic. That is also the case here with the restoration of Charles II. England, however, exhibited that trend in revolutionary history that demonstrates that even when the revolution runs out of steam there is generally no regression back to the old ways of ruling. Despite the regression in governmental form with the reintroduction of the monarchy, parliamentary supremacy was essentially assured although not without various intrigues by Charles and his brother James against it and against England. As importantly, the capitalist industrial developmental trends that had been gathering force throughout the century kept expanding after the revolution. That trend would make England the number one power in the world in the next century. For an excellent overview of an important period in English history, which moreover is filled with helpful footnotes on sources for further research, this is your stop."},{"Title":"The Century of Revolution. 1603-1714.","review":"Although there have been a seemingly infinite amount of books written on 17th century England, this one stands out from the rest. Although it is not exactly a thoroughly in depth study, it provides ample knowledge about all of the important people and events of the era. It is also helpful that each division of the era is looked at in several different fields of study, including the often overlooked area of economics."},{"Title":"The Century of Revolution. 1603-1714.","review":"This is a great book for learning the basics of a very tumultuous century.Like most Americans (at least those that know some history) all I really knew about the 17th century was James and Charles (2 each), Puritans, Pilgrims and Cromwell. I kind of knew about William and Mary and Anne, but wasn't too clear. However between Elizabeth and the start of the (American) Revolution England became a major power in Europe, political power had moved decisively from the King/Queen to Parliament and the Industrial Revolution was starting. This book covers a great deal of that change.It reads like a cram book for taking a test, that is it gives a lot of information and names and dates and assumes you already recognize them. This isn't too hard to overcome because it does tell you what they did. It is broken down into 3 forty year and one 26 year sections covering before the Civil War, the Civil War and Cromwell, afterward until the Glorious Revolution (1688,) and then until the first George.Each book has a section on politics, economy, religion and ideas (every idea had religious implications) and then a concluding overview. The one (minor) quibble I have is that a lot of the political and economic changes are said to have been 'necessary'. That is only true if you accept that the Industrial Revolution was necessary or preordained.Once you have read this you will have a basic grasp of what happened and why."},{"Title":"The Century of Revolution. 1603-1714.","review":"Authoritative, but pretty difficult to read. Instead of a linear narrative, the author breaks down each 20 year period by the political, economic and religious factors contributing to the overall situation. While this provides granular clarity to the subject, as a narrative it makes for mind-numbingly intricate reading & memory. As a research tool, this is top-notch. As a vehicle for the average person understanding the period (which was my intent) I can't recommend it"},{"Title":"The Century of Revolution. 1603-1714.","review":"Although Britain in the seventeenth century had long been my favourite period of history, I had several times put off reading Hill until now. I took against his abrupt and detached style. Additionally, in this book at least, Hill eschews a narrative approach, which I had tended to favour, and chopping the period into four chunks, subdivides each into sections marked narrative, politics, economics and religion.But as Amazon comments, this may not tell the story of a period, but it helps you understand what was going on.However I would suggest this is not the place to start a study of the period, which is enormously complex, with radical and continual changes going off throughout the century in all of Hill's demarked areas. Begin with a conventional narrative history like those offered by Trevelyan or Kishlansky, maybe throw in some biographies of key figures. Then you will get the most out of Hill.But as stated, Hill does help you understand what was going on. What I got from his book chiefly was that the development of opposition to the monarchy was not only the fact that James I for all his intelligence did either not understand or respect the importance of parliament, because his approach to the monarchy of England was Scottish in style however much he revelled in it, but that the opposition parliament brought to the situation was not only steeped in a tradition going back four hundred years to when parliament effectively first became a part of government, but was also being transformed by a revolution in thought, made possible of course by the clarifying momentum of the Renaissance and Reformation, which created the possibility of a scientific method which could be applied not only to learning but industry, and which also allowed fresh perceptions about the spiritual and moral responsibilities of the citizen, which could now be seen in the light of reason as well as faith.The way Hill tells it, the republicans in the mid-century were tearing up the rule book, not only about what they could do, but why, and what could be deemed right and good, in a way that has never happened in British known history before or since. Many reforms were thrown out after the Restoration, but of these some were resumed after 1688, to become a permanent part of the landscape.After 1688, according to Hill, what was evident above all, apart from the now dominant role of parliament in government, was the pre-eminence of the business community as now more powerful than the landed aristocracy, better organised, and bound indissolubly to the process of government.Deprived of the earnestness of Cromwell and his close followers, these commercial interests had become embedded in a kind of legalised corruption which lasted the whole of the next century, and which still taint the processes of government today. But gone were the dominance of arbitrary monarchical power and the possibility of subservience to the universal Catholic church."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"According to an online source, Huxley aimed in his writing to produce a perfect fusion of novel and essay. He intended his books to be filled with interesting opinions and striking ideas. In 'Ape and Essence' these goals can be clearly discerned, but their development is somewhat on the sketchy side. To begin, the book is actually a novella, which took around 6 or 7 hours to read, and I don't think I'm a terribly fast reader.That is not to say that ideas of considerable import can't be conveyed in a story of that length, but if they are going to have much depth of development, they must be pretty focused. Focus is the ingredient which was sacrificed in this book, to try and achieve the goal of a fusion between essay and fiction.There are two very disparate sections of the book. First, there is the introductory chapter, 'Tallis', where two Hollywood screenwriters stumble onto a mysterious script by an unknown writer. Their interest is whetted and they try to track him down, only to find he had died weeks before. This short portion ostensibly revolves around the relationship between the two screenwriters. The unnamed narrator plays passive analyst as his partner, Bob, rambles on about his financial and marital difficulties. The narrator gives us, the readers, an ongoing sly, ironic and entertaining commentary which he doesn't share with Bob.The narrator, who is obviously Huxley's spokesman, is a supremely sophisticated and intellectual screenwriter. He weaves into his observations on Bob's predicaments many philosophical and literary references. In these few pages, in the midst of the narrator's commonplace conversations, he is mentally racking up thoughts and reflections on: Gandhi, Christ, Keats, Byron, Shelley, Beddoes, Martin Luther, Rembrandt, Breughel, Piero, Plato, the Parthenon, the 'Timaeus', the \\"Republic', Marxists, Fascists, Churriguera, Catherine of Siena, Goya, Lady Hamilton, Ninon de Lenclos, and la petite Morphil. If you weren't familiar with all those people, don't feel bad. I made ample use of internet sources to fill in the gaps in my knowledge.After finishing the book, if you return to this introductory section you will realize that the ruminations of the narrator laid the groundwork for the larger story which is contained in the abandoned script. Bob epitomizes the vapid, self-absorbed, materialistic modern world as contrasted with selfless martyrs and saints such as Gandhi, Christ, and Catherine of Siena. The world usually finds it necessary to kill such people, because they interfere with the \\"order\\" of the state. The restless striving of the Romantics is a willful ignoring of the simple and nourishing spiritual solutions of the saints. The ivory-tower speculations of philosophers in quest of their proprietary versions of the 'truth' have led to the inglorious tyrannies based on Marxism and Fascism. In particular, this desire of each group to be right has led to the irrationality of wars based on nationalism and ideology. Besides the philosophical themes, Bob's troubles with women foreshadows the sexual adjustments visited on humanity in the script-story.The second section 'The Script' shows us the results of mankind's willful stupidity. But before we get into the story proper, there is a short sequence of a few pages where we are given an allegorical picture of the events which led up to the main drama. Baboons, with scientists such as Einstein and Faraday as slaves, are busily developing and perfecting ever more potent weapons of mass-destruction. It doesn't take a genius to figure out who the baboons are, and what the likely result of their tinkering will be. But sandwiched in between the first, realistic part of the novella, and the projected world of the future where humans are again humans, although in some cases mutated, it seems disruptive to have this isolated fragment of animals as people.The remainder of the book, which is by far the largest portion, delves into the way humans have adapted to the destruction of civilization, and endeavors to continue that fusion of fiction and essay. Philosophical and theological ideas are the animating forces behind the events which transpire. To give the story human interest, there is the struggle of a post-apocalyptic man and woman to make a humanly acceptable life for themselves despite the recurring irrational tyranny of those in control.It is a bizarre world of the future which Huxley imagined, with a new religion devoted to Belial, or Satan. The normal relation of the sexes has been disrupted both by mutation and imposition of the authorities. The weirdness of this future society might have attracted a cult following for the book if the highly cultured essayistic element weren't so blatant.After reading the book, I can say that it stirred up thoughts that the human race may be on the wrong path, but as the story itself suggests, there seems to be little to be done except try to pursue your individual happiness to the best of your ability. The ideas of the book were too general and spread much too thinly to broaden our understanding in significant ways."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"I remember the first time I tried to read this book and couldn't shake the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; image that danced around my head. So I set the book aside, let the images fade. After almost a year I pick up the book never to set it down until the end, and still scenes haunt me. Huxley creates a distopia that equally disturbes and intrigues, frightens and consoles, a world where god is feared and suffering is happiness. &quot;Ape and Essence&quot; is the shadow of &quot;Brave new World,&quot; where one's brightest spot is the other's darkest. Truly a novel of ideas."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"When I was given this book by a avid Huxley fan I did not know the mortifing power that the pages held. Huxley's vision of the future is not only amazing but enlighting of the terriable power of Nuclear War and the aftermath. If you have read 1984 by G. Orwell or Brave New World by Huxley you should pick this book up. At first if you are lost, keep reading and before you know it you will have finished the book. It is a page turner in every sence of the word."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"Why this book isn't in more libraries is a mystery to me.

Somewhere between these two stages of hislife and artistic career, Huxley wrote Ape and Essence. Itshumor is almost indistinguishable from its horro, a trulysuccessful work from that point of view only. Add to thatone of the most unique narrative formats ever used (a 30some-odd page short story acting as a preface to this sci-fiscreenplay), an absolute irreverence for contemporary Holly-wood and the future of organized religion, a contrasting ofguilt with passive irresponsibility, and an uncharacteristic(for Huxley) optimistic ending. This is one of those booksyou'll never see in a book store and you might even be hardpressed to find it in most libraries. Still, it's nothingshort of a treasure. It's sharp and warped and it makes youthink a whole hell of a lot."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"It is too bad that one cannot give eight stars out of five for this book. Ape and essence is a very funny novel about a movie writer, William Tallis who wrote a screenplay. Unfortuanately the screenplay got rejected after it got discovered by a couple of studio writers who found the screenplay after it fell off of a truck. The screenplay was one of thousands being sent to the incinerator. In fact, on the screenplay cover, was written in pencil, &quot;Rejection slip sent, 11-6-47, for the incinerator.&quot; Twice underlined.The two studio writers decided to visit William Tallis at his ranch in California only to discover that he died 6 months before.However, we readers are treated with the script in its bawdy entirety. The book is funny because it is a parody of the Hollywood mentality and that any writer would take the time and have the audacity to write such a script and hand it in to a studio for consideration. And that this script would be rejected as a matter of course, for Ape and Essence was written in 1947, and can you imagine a moviegoing audience of that era walking away after seeing such a film?! The film Ape and Essence includes such surrealistic imagery such as a female baboon frying sausages, Michael Faraday and Albert Einstein on a leash, held captive by baboons, a Chief wearing a jacket freshly plucked from an exumed corpse, the scream of the slaughter by bulls' pizzles and priests expectorating and spitting when confronted by the spectacle of the manin character, Alfred Poole, having sex with various women. &quot;Don't mind us,&quot; a priest explains,&quot;after all, Belial day comes only once a year.&quot;The movie ends with a scene of eggshells falling onto a grave.That is a very Eraserhead, and Pink Flamingos type of ending for a movie. Tim Burton might produce a movie version of this, but it would be far better if David Lynch were to do so.A leech's kiss, a squid's embraceThe prurient ape's defiling touchDo I like humanity?No, not muchTHIS MEANS YOU KEEP OUT!- a sign on the gate of William Tallis' ranch.I do not know if I will discover a book as funny again in the foreseeable future. Those in the audience who don't walk out of the movie version of this book would have their minds blown! And that includes not only the audience of 1947, but today's too!"},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"It really is too bad that I cannot give this book eight stars out of five. Firstly, Ape and Essence is a topical satire of Hollywood that remains true today. The story starts with one Hollywood writer who has been turned down for a raise, walking with his friend in a Hollywood lot when out of a truck falls a script, one of thousands of such scripts; written on it, is &quot; Rejection Slip sent, 11-6-47, for the Incinerator. 'Twice Underlined&quot;.It is a hilarious story, ribaldly funny in its imagery and implications with a hilarity that is unmatched. The audacity for a writer to send in such a script, some of the images the reader is treated with, are a stout housewifely baboon, frying eggs, Michal Faraday on a leash held captive by a female ape, two Albert Einsteins, each on a leash held by apes. The Einsteins are placated with sugar cubes while the apes gorge on rum and bologna. A Chief wearing clothes freshly plucked from a corpse. A religious high patriarch expectorating as Poole, just finishes making love to two women.&quot;After all, Belilal day come once a year&quot;, the scenes are hilarious and end with eggshells from a boiled egg falling on to a grave. A very Pink Flamingos and Eraserhead type ending.Now can you imagine an audience in the late 1940s watching such a movie. Half of the audience would walk out and those that did not would have their minds totally blown!!!I wonder if I will ever read a novel as thoroughly funny and entertaining as Ape and Essence?"},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"Huxley starts this novel with two Hollywood types discovering a screenplay by William Tallis. They track him down only to find out that he has passed on, and the rest of the novel is his screenplay. Taking place in the year 2108 we come to find that there has been a Third World War and North America and other parts of the world have been nuked. The danger of the radiation has subsided and people are beginning to explore these parts of the world. The main character Dr. Alfred Poole happens to be with an exploration crew from New Zealand and they are studying California.We come to find that the people are mutated from the radiation, are experiencing the bottleneck effect and know that their race will eventually reach extinction. They've also created a Satanic theocracy to govern their lives complete with rituals and societal values that are realistically exaggerated versions of what actually exist in the world today in regards to sexism and religion.While vastly different than Brave New World, both novels carry Huxley's ability to evaluate his current society--the scientific and technological advances, as well as political corruptions--and imagine them forward into scarily accurate and possibly prophetic depictions of the future of the human race.Interesting note: Pay attention to how William Tallis wanted to buried and how he is actually buried."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"To me, Huxley was someone who had cultivated his mind with great passion and independence, and was also a great writer. The former attribute makes the novel, which is very well written, also a very probing and insightful look at humanity.It is interesting that the grandson of Thomas Huxley, a scientist that expanded on Darwin's theory of evolution, should be so keenly aware of humankind's tendency to devolve, rather than evolve. In a post-apocalyptic setting, a group of ape-people essentially worship Satan, although they know that he has been their downfall since the beginning of time. They see him as the cause of their suffering, but nevertheless try to live a life that they believe would be in accordance with his will.I took this symbolism as sign of a race that has been so totally destroyed that they have resigned themselves to the worst that humankind has ever been. When Huxley wrote Brave New World, the nuclear bomb had not been invented, and this enormous threat obviously shook the world, although we take it almost for granted these days. I think Huxley dealt with that threat pretty well here.I think overall that this book is a very interesting take on post-apocalyptic society, one of the best. I don't think it is the most masterfully crafted thing that Huxley ever wrote. Also, I didn't find it a fun book to read. I found Brave New World to have much more humor. I think that lack of humor may be one of the downfalls of this book, but at the same time, why should one find humor in this utterly horrifying situation? And having said all of that, if you find Huxley to be a great thinker or you like his imagination, I wouldn't pass up this book.Huxley wrote with optimism, cynicism, foresight, and in this case, horror. It seems to me that all of the possible outcomes he talked about are coming true.I also recommend The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell which come in the same book."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"This novel is a must read for anyone who has the slightest interest in Aldous Huxley...

So I set the book aside, let the images fade. After almost a year I pick up the book never to set it down until the end, and still scenes haunt me. Huxley creates a distopia that equally disturbes and intrigues, frightens and consoles, a world where god is feared and suffering is happiness. &quot;Ape and Essence&quot; is the shadow of &quot;Brave new World,&quot; where one's brightest spot is the other's darkest. Truly a novel of ideas."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"Wickedly brutal, innovative in style and content,this is a lost classic that is due to be rediscovered."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"This short novel really shook me and I discovered an extremely opressed society that was very superstitious. The doctor and his girl break from that society by facing the unevadeable, their escaping is risky. Huxley's stirring writings entertain me always and this was no dissapointment."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"I was glued to this book. Huxley has amazing foresight, and although some of the ideas in the book are a bit out there, it doesn't detract from the important ideas that the book presents. He makes many good points on where the world could all to easily lead with just the push of a button."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"A while ago I read an article in (I think) The New Yorker stating nobody reads Huxley anymore. Well, I decided to reread Ape and Essence (one of my all time favorite titles for a book, incidentally). The bizarre parts of the book are still great fun (Give me detumescence / that means you), but the story is a little weak as it is more concerned with being shocking, I think, than being a good story. I would recommend Island (a utopian novel) instead. In Ape and Essence the fact that the humor is so dated is interesting."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"this book was pretty good, although since it was published in 1948 in reaction to WWII huxley's points are rather less revelatory now than they probably were then. occasionally huxley gets a little bogged down in essay-like pontificating, but in general he keeps things moving along. there are three main sections. the first serves as a set up and isn't that memorable. the second is poetic, metaphorical, and satirical and has some striking images, such as two albert einsteins on leashes with apes as masters. the third section makes up the bulk of the book and is an apocalyptic account of the world after world war iii, ravaged by nuclear bombing. there are some interesting ideas (his argument that the world becomes satan-worshipping is surprisingly convincing) and the occasional thought-provoking statement, but more well-known books like fast food nation, etc. have covered similar territory in greater depth. also, the plot involving the main character, dr. poole, is a bit predictable and overly familiar. still, the book as a whole serves as a good reminder and warning of the dangers of our &quot;modern&quot; society, although it's extremely disheartening that even now, 50 years later, so many governments and societies continue to turn the same blind eye to its own self-destructive behaviours. if only our world leaders would read books like this and learn from them."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"This is the 3rd book from Huxley I have read. It's a little harder to understand at times than his others, but it's still good. However, it has a dark tone and for some reason I hard trouble becoming very immersed in it. If you are a Huxley fan, I would recommend first reading Jacob's Hands, which is simply an amazing book."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"I am a tremendous fan of Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World.&quot; Seeing that this book had high marks by other reviewers, I thought I might enjoy it. I have trouble believing that the same author wrote both books.&quot;Ape and Essence&quot; begins in the movie industry where an old discarded script is discovered. The movie industry employees seek out the writer only to find he has been dead for a few weeks. After this revelation, the book jumps into the actual script. The script reads like a cheap romance novel. In a strange savage land, a man from civilization falls in love with a primative woman. They face conflict, but there forbidden love endures. They run away together and live happily. And we never find out what happens to the ever so fortunate movie mogels who rescued the script from incineration.Was Aldous Huxley suffering from writer's block when he wrote this? It is certainly not his best work. There is a reason few people have read this book. It is not very good."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"Ape and Essence is a brief, bizarre, and ludicrously overwritten work of dystopian fiction. The book follows the discovery and full recital of a mysterious play; a play which was almost certainly written by Huxley while under the influence of a particularly foul hallucinogenic substance. Serious fans of Huxley and the dystopian sub-genre of science fiction may find the book worth pursuing, but I cannot honestly say that I would recommend it to any man, woman or child..."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"The only other Aldous Huxley book I ever read was \\"Brave New World,\\" and that was at least ten years ago. For most people, I think that is the only Huxley book they know about. It's a shame, because this book, \\"Ape and Essence,\\" is a true Huxley gem. The back of the book says Huxley wrote this in 1948 as a response to the use of atomic weapons in WWII and the emerging Cold War. \\"Brave New World\\" showed us a future of soma-laden people cared for by the state from cradle to grave. \\"Ape and Essence\\" doesn't have anything nearly as pleasant as soma. In this new world, people are ruled by a satanic theocracy after a nuclear war.The book is pretty easy to describe. Two Hollywood types find a manuscript that dropped off a truck bound for the incinerator. The script is entitled, \\"Ape and Essence,\\" by a William Tallis. Somebody didn't care much for his script; they marked it incinerate and underlined that word twice. The two read the script and try to find Mr. Tallis, only to discover that he died a few months earlier. What follows this brief introduction is the script, in its entirety.\\"Ape and Essence\\" is about a post-nuclear holocaust world. New Zealand escaped the holocaust, and now they are sending explorers to America to see how the world is coming along. The main character here is Dr. Poole, a botanist. The survivors who roam the ruins of Los Angeles capture Poole and agree to let him live if he can improve crop production. Poole witnesses some unusual behavior amongst the natives, behavior that is explained to him by the archpriest of Belial.Huxley uses this odd world as a backdrop for his own views on humanity in the 20th century. Huxley feels that mankind never got past the beast (or ape) inside. The beginning of the script shows apes dressed as humans, engaging in such delightful activities as chemical warfare and mass killing. These apes even keep Albert Einstein on a leash, signifying man's inability to use our genius to overcome our basest instincts. While strange at times (almost David Lynch-like), I don't think this is too strange for an intellectual like Huxley. He relies on extreme images to capture his despair over the state of mankind. The time frame in which Huxley writes is telling. It's 1948, only a few years after Hiroshima and just about the time the Cold War is really cranking into gear. Huxley must have been appalled that just a few years after the most destructive war in human history, even more horrors are starting to lurk on the horizon.Huxley makes special mention of a few of man's ideas that lead to this type of nightmare. Both progress and nationalism are killers of mankind, according to Huxley. Nationalism, or the idea that one state is divinely sanctioned over all others, leads to useless killing. As Africa and the Balkans clearly show today, Huxley is not only insightful for his own time, but also prescient for today, as well.The idea of progress is just as important. Why, with man's ability to create, does he so often use his talents for destructive purposes? It is progress that led to industrialization, which led to cities full of people with created needs. These needs found expression through war, when one set of people decided to take things from others to fulfill their own needs.Huxley is insightful and his views on what makes humanity tick are dead on. I thought his use of a movie script to convey his ideas was clever, even though it is uneven at times. Huxley does seem to recognize the growing importance of media in disseminating ideas, and perhaps that is why he chose the format he did. I had to chuckle over the idea of this becoming a film in Huxley's day. The Catholics, who were keeping a close eye on Hollywood at this time, would have had a field day with this script-Satanism and unusual mating rituals would send them into histrionics. You can't go wrong with Mr. Aldous Huxley by your side."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"Not as well-crafted as Huxley's better-known _Brave_New_World_, and I think I can guess why. Huxley, despondent over contemporary events and trends, must have felt crushed with utter despair and yet spurred by the conviction that he could not remain silent. Under such stress it's hard to attend to belleletristic niceties. Huxley also was experimenting with form. The story is presented as a stylized movie script, in the same sense that Goethe's _Faust_ is a stylized drama.Nevertheless, this is a powerful, passionate, and haunting book. I cannot think of any other book which makes such a frighteningly real case for Evil as an operative principle in the world. Even more amazing, this case is presented under the guise of what looks and sounds like a B-grade horror flick. Imagine if, say, Dostoevsky had written his great novels as comic books -- and they still had the same terrifying, probing depth as the novels. That's essentially the effet that Huxley achieves, and it is uncanny.Huxley is speaking of the condition of modern civilization *as it is*, under a set of grotesque, phantasmagoric masks. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"Aldous Huxley's Apes and Essence is science fiction combined with the allegorical drive of a Swift's Gulliver's Travels. It ought to assume a proud place beside other works on retro-futures -- novels like, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and films of the Mad Max genre. Huxley is convinced that we opted for the worst of both worlds -- East and West -- by failing to curb the capability of science with the wisdom and moderation of Eastern mysticism. Here too is the brave new eugenicsl, and insofar as Huxley is trying to point to this as a future dilemma, he is decisively on track."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"This book is an unbelievable prophecy. I find it more erie than Orwell's 1984. The story lacks the smoothness of Brave New World, yet it's importance is equal. To look to the future of society is to read Brave New World and Ape and Essence, and figure out where we are headed. I can already see some of the philosophies described in the book in our society as we speak, and we have not yet had a nuclear holocaust. All I can say is that this book is a must read and every bit as important as Brave New World."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"I read this book quite rapidly (two days) and really liked it.It's 1948, Ghandi has just been assassinated, and two guys connected to the movie business come across a script that's just fallen from a trash truck. They set out to find the author, whose script makes up the bulk of the novel.There are a lot of wonderful \\"postmodern\\" touches here -- for example, one of the main characters in the script picks up a copy of Shelley that's about to be burned, and ends up reading it at the grave of the fictional author of the script saved from the trash heap.In addition, this book's scenes of apes lording themselves over human beings unquestionably inspired Planet of the Apes.And finally, the novel's descriptions of classical music in its portrayal of a dystopia probably influenced A Clockwork Orange. In fact, Anthony Burgess named Ape and Essence one of the best novels in English since 1939:\\"Novels like Ape and Essence seem now to be very much products of their time [immediately post-Hiroshima] and rather dated. But this is Huxley -- clever, brutal, thoughtful, original -- and his fictional tract clings to the mind....It is a nauseating vision of a still possible future....\\"Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"I first read Ape and Essence in a single sitting about 1950. I was then 29 or 30 and so deeply impressed by the novel's power and its comment on the state of our world that I felt it was the end-all of literature and there was no need to read any more fiction. Indeed, my appetite for novels remained sated for more than a year. I read the novel again with its second edition a few years ago and was scarcely less impressed. This novel fully ranks with Brave New World and Point Counter Point, and deserves to be recognized as one of the best 100 novels of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"Compared to Ape and Essence, Huxley's more celebrated dystopian comic fantasy, Brave New World, bursts with sunny optimism about the future. World War II, which intervened between the two books, unquestionably accelerated Huxley's depair. In Brave New World, the people of the far future had lost their edge, their creativity, their sense of the tragic; that seemed like a sorry enough fate to readers in the pre-Nazi, pre-Hiroshima 1930s. But Ape and Essence posits a crueller and more desperate post-apocalyptic future.Huxley delivers the bad news in his trademark style, a savage yet mannered irony that must have inspired Terry Southern a generation later. Most of the story is told in the form of a manifestly unsellable film script by an imaginary unknown. The script's narrator sets the scene by briefly describing World War III in chilling detail: if you're not afraid of thermonuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, just read the few pages that Huxley devotes to them. Your current mundane nightmares will take a serious turn for the worse.The script does end on an upbeat note. But it's in a '40s movie. Huxley himself gives absolutely no cause for optimism. Nearly sixty years ago he specified fanatic nationalism and contempt for the natural world as the most dangerous attitudes on earth.Now look around you.Still scary after all these years, Ape and Essence is for those who like their dystopias blackly humorous and seriously thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"I can't read this book (as I have a number of times) without thinking of it as the flip side to Brave New World. I still find myself wandering into the library, grabbing the book and thumbing through the pages for passages that inspire and depress me!"},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"When you are a conservative, here's what passes for optimism : things aren't very good (they're definitely worse than they used to be) and they are likely to get worse still; but there will always be a small, but hardy, band of resistors, summoning the species back to first principles, and, in the long run, we may even prevail--God willing. That's not particularly optimistic, is it ? Moreover, to many, what's particularly objectionable about this dark view is that it flows from a fairly low estimation of our fellow men, which is perhaps best expressed in Edmund Burke's aphorism : &quot;There is no safety for honest men but by believing all possible evil of evil men.&quot; Unpleasant they may be, but these attitudes are on full and glorious display in Aldous Huxley's novel, Ape and Essence.The story is told in screenplay form--a narrative device which I found awkward--a script having blown off of a truck which is hauling studio detritus to the dump. The deceased screenwriter, William Tallis, posits a future in which most of the world has been devastated by nuclear war. Their island nation having been spared major damage, the New Zealand Rediscovery Expedition to North America lands on the California coast in 2108, looking for survivors. Dr. Alfred Poole gets separated from the rest of the party and taken in by the Belial worshipping natives.In the wake of the catastrophe--which they refer to as the Thing--the remaining Southern Californians are held in thrall by the sterilized priests of Belial, who seek to limit knowledge and quash human desires, relegating the populace to a single two week period of sex a year (following Belial Day), which produces an annual litter of mutant babies, some of whom are actually healthy enough to replace the dead and dying adults. This suffices to fulfill the rather limited purposes of their decimated society : to serve Belial by accepting the punishment that has been visited upon them and to avoid extinction. Dr. Poole falls in love with Loola, a native girl, and they run away, the book ending with them on their way to Bakersfield, stumbling upon the grave of William Tallis, where they quote from the poem Adonais by Percy Bysse Shelley :That Light whose smile kindles the Universe, That Beauty in which all things work and move, That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love Which through the web of being blindly wove By man and beast and earth and air and sea, Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me, Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.and share a hard-boiled egg.Such are the bare bones of the rather meager plot, but the real meat of the book is Huxley's scorching attacks on Man's faith in himself :Cruelty and compassion come with chromosomes; All men are merciful and all are murderers. Doting on dogs, they build their Dachaus; Fire whole cities and fondle the orphans; Are loud against lynching, but all for Oakridge; Full of future philanthropy, but today the NKVD. Whom shall we persecute, for whom feel pity ? It is all a matter of the moment's mores, Of words on wood pulp, of radios roaring, Of Communist kindergartens or first communions. Only in the knowledge of his own Essence Has any man ceased to be many monkeys.and on the idea of Progress :Progress --the theory that you can get something for nothing; the theory that you can gain in one field without paying for your gain in another; the theory that you alone can understand the meaning of history; the theory that you know what's going to happen fifty years from now; the theory that, in the teeth of all experience, you can foresee all the consequences of your present actions; the theory that Utopia lies just ahead and that, since ideal ends justify the abominable means, it is your privilege and duty to rob, swindle, torture, enslave and murder all those who, in your opinion (which is, by definition, infallible), obstruct the onward march to the earthly paradise.I have to admit that I've always been so intent on using Brave New World as a scourge against totalitarian Utopias, I blinded myself to the deeply anti-technology aspects of Huxley's vision. But you can't make the same mistake here, as Huxley clobbers the reader over the head with his contempt for &quot;science&quot; :...what we call knowledge is merely another form of Ignorance--highly organized, of course, and eminently scientific, but for that very reason all the more complete, all the more productive of angry apes. When Ignorance was merely ignorance, we were the equivalents of lemurs, marmosets and howler monkeys. Today, thanks to that Higher Ignorance which is our knowledge, man's stature has increased to such an extent that the least among us is now a baboon, the greatest an orangutan or even, if he takes rank as a Saviour of Society, a true Gorilla.As court jesters once served to deflate the pomposity of kings and as servants followed Roman Emperors, whispering in their ears, &quot;Thou art human,&quot; perhaps it is the role of conservative literature, not so much to educate or convert, but to remind men of the signal human sin of hubris. If such truly is the case, it can rightly be said that no writer has done so better than Aldous Huxley.GRADE : B"},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"Two motion picture executives stumble across a screenplay in the lot. The majority of the book is the text of that document. It is about a future era, post World War III, when the residents of Southern California worship the devil and sex is outlawed except for two weeks once per year. The resulting infants are increasingly more deformed due to radiation fallout. The action of the 'film' seems to be mostly an excuse to espouse the philosophy that human kind, following the Second World War were increasingly destructive and not in cohesion with the Order of Things (i.e. Nature, God, etc.) and that led to their downfall. A lot of the points Huxley makes seem particularly true and relevant even now in the late 2000's. Although the first few chapters were almost incomprehensible to me, due to choppiness, jargon, and references to popular events and figures in the late 1940's, once the narrative turned to the screenplay, it was a fascinating tale. The pop culture references that I didn't really comprehend continued throughout the book, and it's quite possible that I've missed out on a lot of the points that were being made due to my having been born several decades later and not being familiar with those references."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"we know huxley is a master in the literary world, and we know that he can write anti-utopian fiction, just read Brave New World. this is along the same lines, though without the niceties of BNW. and without the excellence of BNW. maybe it was the experimentation Huxley did with the form of the novel. but huxley still says a lot, perhaps more in this than he did in BNW. i'd recommend reading it just for the philosophy of huxley, but if you are expecting BNW, you are going to be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence","review":"well, this was a very interesting book.

However, that said, there are very few courses and programmes which are of any true value to the Spanish language learner. The majority are either too basic in their content or just downright awful.That's where FSI programmatic Spanish comes in. Despite its age, I can honestly say that this is the best programme for learning the Spanish language I have seen. The approach and methods of teaching in this programme are very effective, and you will find yourself dealing with complex structures like the subjunctive without even realising it. That's right! FSI's approach to the subjunctive is so simple, it's surprising that other programmes treat this subject in such a confusing and difficult manner, often leaving the learner baffled and perplexed. For these reasons alone, in my opinion, if you are serious about learning Spanish, get your hands on this baby - you won't regret it.Having said that, I suppose I should mention that there are some down sides to the course. For one thing, it is rather old. As a consequence the sound quality isn't superb nor as good as modern programmes (although the quality overall is much better in level 2). In any case, the quality is always such that you can get through the lessons without any problems or misunderstanding. In addition to this, the drills can sometimes get a little boring and repetitive, but I implore you to bear through them - if you do, you will be greatly rewarded, your level of Spanish will improve in leaps and bounds. Hmm, other disadvantages?? None that I can think of right now. Even though there are these small problems, I still consider the course worthy of a 5 star rating.

Rosetta stone teaches primarily the present progressive tense that is hardly ever used in Spanish, and is really for someone looking for superficial learning for an upcoming trip. Pimsleur is really good for basic info, but is too short. Barrons is the second best because the speakers talk at a realistic pace, but it is very drill oriented, has minimal instructional text, and can have very rapid speakers at some times. Learning Like Crazy is for a serious learner. It uses various accents in at a normal conversational speed. It has an amazing text for learning in addition to its excellent dialog and oral excercises, which are of real life situations. It works in a piecewise method to build sentences, conversations, etc with substitutions of common verbs and words. Best of all LSLC II uses the preterite, subjunctive, imperfect, and present tenses in nearly all its earlier exercises, dialogs, etc., and then slowly adds the future, condicional, imperfect subjunctive.

NO program is truly going to teach anyone how to speak Spanish. This came as a \\"free\\" download when I purchased another LSLC program.

The book is 500 pages, so I had had to buy about 12 blank CDs, a printer ribbon, and paper which adds up) See if you can get it with another LSLC product, or consider buying the whole package, level 1 and 2 and this. I enjoy the level 1 and 2 LSLC program, and I can easily listen to it in my car and I have learned a ton from that.This, on the other hand is not fun. Pages are in plain type. I have to sit at my desk, work through the exercises and listen to the CD. I have found from all my Spanish studies that if I really want to learn Spanish, I do best by repetition until I am thoroughly tired of the material, so I personally repeat the exercises several times, noting to myself and redoing the exercises later. The voices are boring and at times the sound quality isn't good... kind of like old AM radio. The voices are still understandable and the program does a nice job of emphasizing pronunciation. There are lots of drills, lots of exercises, lots of dialogs, and lots of explanations. Again, the best way to learn is to repeat exercises, but there is built in review and the exercises build on each other.

There are also links to download the Level 3 and Level 4 courses free, making it excellent value for money.The lessons cover many grammatical concepts, helping you to get to grips with difficult elements such as the subjunctive tense in a manner that is easy to understand.This course is not designed for beginners, and assumes that you already have a basic knowledge of Spanish from a Level 1 course. It is also not for the student who only wants to be able to memorize a few key phrases for their holiday in a Spanish speaking country. It is a comprehensive in depth course for any student who really wants to be able to communicate in Spanish, and if you are serious about learning then this is a great course to invest in.Another thing that I noticed is that although the publisher states that he has re-mastered the original FSI cassettes to give the CD course digital sound quality, I still found that the sound quality was only slightly better than the original cassettes (which I was able to borrow from the library quite a while ago). Although this is a pretty good method to learn Spanish, I am only going to give it 3 stars because there are several modern language courses that are more effective for learning how to speak Spanish than the FSI method. ivIn closing my review of this product, I'd like to share with you the three Amazon products that I have found most helpful in my pursuit to learn Spanish. If you are truly serious about achieving fluency, I'd recommend getting all 3 of them if you can afford it.1.Lights, Camera, Spanish (Book + DVD): Learn Conversational Spanish by Watching a Romantic AdventureThis is actually a 90 minute movie for Spanish-language learners. It gives the option to watch the movie with subtitles but I'd recommend not using them to improve your Spanish. This \\"movie\\" also includes a workbook so that you can reinforce the Spanish vocabulary words and phrases from the film. The workbook also has lots of exercises to keep you engaged in the film. But be prepared to hear Chilean accents. Although pleasent to the ear, the accents from Chile are very different from most Latin American accents.2.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This software replaces the traditional verb conjugation books and makes learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an interactive and fun activity. This should be a required resource for anyone who wants to improve their ability to conjugate Spanish verbs. Especially anyone who is challenged by the drudgery of learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs and who is looking for a new way to make learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an easy and fun activity3.Diccionario esencial de la lengua espanola de la Real Academia Espanola (Spanish Edition)If you are really serious about speaking the language fluently, then at some point you will need to replace your Spanish-English dictionary and get a pure Spanish dictionary with both the vocabulary words and the definitions entirely in Spanish. I use this one only because it was highly-recommended by a friend from Spain who teaches Spanish."},{"Title":"FSI Programmatic Spanish, Level 1 (Re-Mastered)","review":"You can get this exact same material FOR FREE.

YES you still have to work after the courses, but it's worth it!!!!

I was given reason to expect great things just as soon as I started reading the information on the inside edge of the book's dust cover and was not disappointed with the content. Ordinarily, this provides the reader with a pr&eacute;cis of what is found inside but, on this occasion, I found myself learning some very important details that were hitherto unknown to me - and I have had an interest in the U Boat for over 40 years!The Type VII U Boat was probably the most successful submarine of all time. It was Gunther Prien in U47 which sank HMS Royal Oak right at the beginning of WW2 and Otto Kretschmer with his U99 who established the record for tonnage sunk during that same war - and the sinking of ships was the primary role of this type of craft). Today, some 65 years after the Type VII fired it's last torpedo in war, there are websites clubs in many different languages dedicated to the finest detail of this specific weapon of war and every aspect of the battles they fought. For all those ardent enthusiasts plus those with a more general interest in WW2, ships or shipwrecks, this is an excellent addition to the bookshelf.Commencing with the boat's evolution and design (all submarines are \`boats' and not ships!), the author then takes the reader through the vital characteristics which made this craft exactly what is was and why. This includes fascinating detail from history and the lessons learned from WW1. Part Two covers; The hull, propulsion, crew, provisions and even sanitation. The third part provides a complete explanation of the various weapons. Commencing with the obvious; Torpedoes, mines, deck and flak guns, we are then treated to an interesting insight into some experimental weapons. Often overlooked, Part Four includes the real cutting-edge technology of the day; Radio, radar, radar detectors, hydrophones and infra-red sensors. The final part of this complete assessment moves from the offensive to the defensive with; Anti-radar coatings, anti-radar decoys, anti-sonar coatings and anti-sonar decoys - something which reveals the exhaustive nature of the research undertaken by this author. The book concludes with equally informative appendices on; General appearance, Admiral D&ouml;nitz and a table of Hull numbers which shows when and where each boat was made and includes those projects which were never completed.The work is well supported throughout with an excellent and plentiful selection of black and white photographs showing all aspects of boats, people, construction, war, weapons, life on board and so forth in addition to an equally outstanding compilation of plans and profiles.If I may be permitted one very minor criticism; Most readers will know that the German word for submarine is Unterseeboot (undersea boat) or U Boat for short. In the German language, there never was a hyphen between the letter \\"U\\" and the word \\"Boat\\" and no hyphen appears in any of Germany's official records on the U Boat at any time. The hyphen was added by those who translated various German documents into English. Consequently (e.g.); U Boat and U68 are correct whereas U-Boat and U-68 are incorrect. As I say, a very small point and not one which will mar your enjoyment of a truly accomplished study.NM"},{"Title":"Type VII U-Boats","review":"A very good book with thorough technical details of the Type VII.

The analysis is complicated, detailed and difficult, but extremely rigorous and very illuminating, both about the nature of meaning and about Husserl.Through his careful focus on the specifics of the text, Lampert is ultimately able to conclude that Husserl's project of phenomenology is of a piece with the projects of dialectics and deconstruction, inasmuch as Husserl's is a philosophy of self-organizing meanings that are not governed by an independent telos. Experiences tend towards synthesis, and in so doing project beside, ahead of, and behind themselves a coherent context for themselves. In particular, Lampert focuses on &quot;backward reference&quot; as a crucial form of synthesis, according to which meanings present themselves as having been awaited by the past, that is, they project behind themselves a past that was anticipating them.Lampert's book should be required reading for all serious students of Husserl. It is an education in itself, as well as being an essential guide to the rigorous demands of Husserlian phenomenology."},{"Title":"Shakespeare Without Tears","review":"This book is designed to give an insight to the reader.

Stories about two-headed chickens, a drive-in movie theatre that just won't die, a freaky video store, the end of the world, a freelance writer who...whoops, well I don't wanna spoil that one, succubi, and more!His style is perfect, he has the gift of being a natural storyteller coupled with the insights and knowledge of the genre, which puts him in the tier of the elite. Always a pleasure to read his work!Joe Nassise came up with a few hum-dingers as well, like the awsome \\"CARRION MAN,\\" but I found the dialouge in some of his pieces to be a bit corny, and some of the stories a bit contrived. Still, worth reading.Overall, I highly reccomend that all horror fans check out Drew Williams' work. I have not met one person familiar with his work who has not spoken as highly of it as I am now.Semi-complaint: There were more than several typos throughout (mostly in Nassise's stories)which doesn't usually bother me, but when it is a rather short book, I expect better editing than this. But that is nit-picking. This is a keeper."},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright in Pop-up","review":"This book of Pop-ups, side by side with the building photographs and original plans and drawings, show all the beauty and majesty of Frank Lloyd Wright's most famous buildings. It's done with grace, and beauty, and style befitting the nature and purpose of the book. The pop-ups are elegant, simple, and yet breathtaking.Like most pop-up books, it is fragile, paper engineering being what it is. I have yet to see a pop-up book that isn't as fragile as a flower. You should keep this book out of the reach of children. But, it should make a beautiful coffee table item for thoughtful adults, but again, it's destined to be a wonderful collectors item, so only take it out for special occasions.I read Dominic's review and completely disagree. As a pop-up book collector, I expect pop-ups to be only as complex or realistically depicted as makes sense to its art and that of the story. The pop-ups cleverly give you the illusion of standing back and viewing the structures from a great distance as opposed to viewing a 3 dimentional, detailed miniature.It works beautifully."},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright in Pop-up","review":"I have collected pop-up books for 35 years and must disagree with Dominic. Yes, the book is fragile, nearly all large pop-up books are (most books this size will develop splits in the gutters if you are not extremely careful). I feel the pop-ups are in keeping with Wright's work. I especially enjoyed the accompanying text and plans. I'm very happy to include this in my collection."},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright in Pop-up","review":"When I first saw the book listing and read about the \\"latest in pop-up engineering\\" I had high hopes for this book. However, that hope quickly turns into disgust the minute I opened it. The book is poorly designed. The pop-up buildings are designed with some cheap software that fills trees with cheesy moire patterns, buildings with tastelss line arts and washed out colors. The binding of the book is so poor that it began to fall apart before I opened it. The paper engineering part is also mediocre. Most buildings don't actually pop-up. Instead it's just got some poorly die-cut panels that \\"float\\" in front of flatly printed images. With the recent dramatic improvement to pop-up books such as Harry Potter's Howart Carassel and the pop-up book of phobia, this book is mundane and boring. Publishing such a ill-conceived and executed book on Frank Lloyd Wright is an insult to our country's architectural history."},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright in Pop-up","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

This book is not the best example of pop-ups or the best review of FLW's work but it is an excellent example of joy, humor and delight in it's subject, FLW and American Architecture."},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright in Pop-up","review":"Despite the earlier, very negative review by Dominic, I agree with George&M;'s positive review, and found this book quite enjoyable, interesting, and readable.First of all, Dominic is wrong when he says the pop ups don't actually \\"pop up.\\" The model of the Johnson Wax building actually rises up a good six inches, maybe more off the paper, hardly anything close to what he describes. Most don't go that far, but are still very enjoyable to watch how they work as you open up the book, and to look at.And as for the fragile binding and poor book quality he cites, well, welcome to the real world of commercial publishing of art and architecture books, which has been going downhill for probably the last 20 years, as publishers struggle to maintain profitability in the face of an American public that cares little for art and architectural education. Dominic also doesn't discuss the written text, which, for a book that looks like it's designed more to entertain rather than to educate, is well done, with detailed histories of the six buildings in the book, and comments by Wright himself about how he designed the project.Even if you don't buy it, if you're a fan of Wright's, you should at least seek it out for the sheer fun of watching the paper pop-ups of Wright's buildings. The book discusses six of Wright's most notable buildings, such as the Johnson Wax building, Fallingwater, and the Mayan style house in L.A. (unfortunately I don't recall the name of the owners). The choices of buildings are a good selection to represent the full diversity of Wright's work, which ranged from personal residences to major corporate complexes. Overall, this is an interesting and fun and informative book on Wright that should be of interest to any Wright afficionados or fans of pop-up books (the most fun books after all--check out the Kama Sutra one I saw once some time. :-))."},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright in Pop-up","review":"I have enjoyed this book since receiving it.

It's okay if you've never seen other pop up books before, and it's probably interesting to children, but I felt like it could have been so much better.

It is a very well written and enlightening mid-twentieth century text book. There are errors that were missed by the editor, but not enough to reduce the value of the book; just be on guard, so you'll catch'em and not let'em make you confused.One definition is flawed. It's 4.10a, \\"Binary Operation of Addition,\\" on page 83. It's flawed because it requires that sets A and B must not have any common element. Too bad, because that excludes counting sets, which are used for defining whole numbers. I've seen a modern definition by an other author that works around this, but also avoids counting sets.The intended audience is mathematics educators, but students will also find it as an excellent source for learning the fundemental theories of arithmetic. The writing is clear, fluid, well organized, thorough, and peer reviewed. In my view, it's worth at least $20.Table of Contents (for Second Edition)1.

Any American convicted of engaging in the slave trade was subject to the death penalty. Surely Captain Nathanial Gordon from Portland, Maine had no reason to believe that this could ever happen to him as he sailed toward Africa on just such a mission in the Spring of 1860. For up until this time not a single American citizen had ever been sentenced to die for this most heinous of crimes. Yes, the slave trade was alive and well in the year before the American Civil War would commence and a great many Americans were still involved up to their ears. \\"Hanging Captain Gordon\\" is author Ron Soodalter's remarkable account of the life and death of one Captain Nathanial Gordon who would pay the ultimate price for essentially being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is a captivating book that recalls a series of events that history had largely forgotten. It is compelling reading.Most Americans will be shocked and disgusted when they learn just how widespread slave trading was in the first six decades of the nineteenth century. And what is most disturbing is how complicit many Americans were in this practice. There was lots of money to be made in the slave trade. Here in the U.S. many \\"respected\\" businessmen participated as investors in such enterprises. They would outfit the vessels and make all of the other necessary arrangements to carry out the sordid mission. Many of the the most prominent businessmen in New York and other major northern cities were involved. Many other Americans were all too happy to work as officers and crew members on these ships. And just in case someone was caught in the act there were legions of corrupt politicians and judges to provide cover. And so in 1860 as a divided America prepared to face off on the question of slavery here at home a lively slave trade continued to flourish in ports such as Havana and Rio de Janiero. It was Captain Gordon's great misfortune to be nabbed by the American steamer USS Mohican as he sailed westward with some 897 slaves on board. They were packed below like so many sardines. Nathanial Gordon and his crew had been caught red-handed at a time when the political winds at home were shifting dramatically. For it would come to pass that Nathanial Gordon of Maine would be made an example of. History would demand that he pay the ultimate price.I found \\"Hanging Captain Gordon\\" to be very thoroughly researched and particularly well written. This one held my interest from cover to cover. Ron Soodalter gives the reader a very thorough picture of all of the forces at work and players involved in the highly charged atmosphere surrounding the trial and conviction of Captain Gordon. In addition, Soodalter presents more compelling evidence at just how great a President Abraham Lincoln really was. As many in American bombarded the President with requests for a pardon for Captain Gordon Lincoln resisted. He saw the hanging of Captain Gordon as an opportunity to send a clear message to all that slave trading would no longer be tolerated. In the end Lincoln was correct. Slave trading would largely disappear for nearly a century.Ron Soodhalter concludes \\"Hanging Captain Gordon\\" with a \\"Afterword\\" on how new forms of slave trading have begun to re-appear in recent years. His examples are surely food for thought. \\"Hanging Captain Gordon\\" is packed with material I had never seen anywhere else. This one is an absolute must for history buffs. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Hanging Captain Gordon: The Life and Trial of an American Slave Trader","review":"Mr. Soodalter does an amazing job by taking a little known event and giving it life. His characters and events are so real and the lack of support to end slavery is shameful. Although there was legislation, the politicians did little to prevent slavery from continuing (they all had them) and Soodalter shows how little things have changed in the world in his final chapter. This is an adventure, a great story, told by an excellent historian and story-teller. This is a must read!!"},{"Title":"Hanging Captain Gordon: The Life and Trial of an American Slave Trader","review":"Hanging Captain Gordon is a good review of the slave trade and the majority attitudes that prevailed just before the start of the Civil War. The book arouses sympathy for Captain Gordon's widow and children, revulsion over the treatment of African captives, and horror at the crudeness of our entire justice system in the 18th and 19th centuries. It does not make me proud of my European ancestors. Anyone willing to critically evaluate American culture will benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Hanging Captain Gordon: The Life and Trial of an American Slave Trader","review":"Hanging Cpt. Gordon by Ron Soodalter was for me, an exceptional read. It's a non-fiction that reads like a novel, it's well written, and very fluid. The bulk of the books goes into the social and political sentiments of the mid 1800's especially as they related to slavery and the trafficking of slaves from the African continent to the Americas.The author, I believe, pain stakingly and with great detail (20 pages of footnotes) painted a psychological picture of the major players, Cpt. Gordon, the prosecutor, the defense team (dream team of 1864) and of president Lincoln, and what motivated these men. We come to see Cpt. Morgan as an unfortunate but wretched soul, whose life and death had to be used as an example, that trafficking in slaves, along with slavery in the territories and new states would not be allowed.From an historical stand point, it was interesting to see how New York and the other eastern seaboard states were heavily invested in the slave trafficking that was vital to the supply of slaves to the south. Slave trafficking florished during the 40 year period that anti trafficking laws were on the books as a capital offense. Trafficking florished and no one was hanged because of the involvement of New York financiers, insurers, ship builders, legal community and politicians.This is not a feel good history book, but for those that want an accurate account of what took place in this country during the 1800's as it ralates to slavery, slave trafficking and slave laws, this is the book."},{"Title":"Hanging Captain Gordon: The Life and Trial of an American Slave Trader","review":"A great read about greed, politics, corruption, ineffective government, and of course, the heinous act of slavery.

It was the age that brought us groundbreaking films and made household names of people like Karloff and Lugosi. Author Bryan Senn gives fans of classic horror films the ultimate resource to these films. Over 500 pages which cover 46 classic films including \\"Frankenstein\\", \\"Dracula\\", \\"The Mummy\\", \\"White Zombie\\", \\"King Kong\\", \\"Mark of the Vampire\\", \\"The Black Cat\\", and lesser known films like \\"Murders in the Zoo\\", \\"Devil Doll\\", and \\"The Return of Doctor X\\". Senn doesn't just give a passing glance to these films. Each receives some 8 - 12 pages in the book. He starts with the full film credits, then provides a lengthy plot synopsis before launching into the real meat of each film as Senn provides a critical and knowledgeable analysis of each film's assets and liabilities and productions notes.Senn rightfully points out milquetoast actor David Manners being a liability on three classic horror films: \\"Dracula\\", \\"The Mummy\\", and \\"The Black Cat\\", essentially playing the same dull, uninspiring romantic lead in each film. As if Manners' performance and his own utter disdain for the roles were not bad enough, there is the revelation that he earned four times as much for his role in \\"Dracula\\" as Bela Lugosi did. The production notes in Golden Horrors are perhaps the most interesting part of each film's coverage. Even a classic horror film like myself discovered lots of new bits of information about these films that I didn't know previously. For example, the Satanist character played by Karloff in the Black Cat was based on real-life Satanist and occultist Aleister Crowley. Senn is right on the money when he says that there has never been a film like \\"The Black Cat\\" in terms of it's mood and its grisly scenes of corpses floating in glass tubes. One can forget in this era of the shock film that \\"The Black Cat\\" was released back in 1934.In \\"Mark of the Vampire\\" Bela Lugosi's Count Morla goes about with a bloody wound to the side of his temple. The original script of this Tod Browning film revealed that Morla had an incestuous relationship with his daughter Luna and then murdered her and committed suicide. This was dropped from the film as it would have never made it past the 30's censors, but it goes to show just how dark and ahead of its time the film was, despite the cop-out ending. In discussing \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" we learn that 17 minutes were cut from the preview screenings to the theatrical release. Included in the cuts are Karl (Dwight Frye) murdering his wealthy parents and blaming the monster. Another interesting film that Senn looks at is the underrated \\"Dracula's Daughter\\". This was the last horror film made prior to the two year horror film hiatus/ban in 1936. The film was to have starred Lugosi reprising his role as Dracula but that was dropped. When we see Dracula in his casket, we are seeing a wax dummy of Lugosi. Interestingly, Universal still had paid Lugosi $4000 for the role he never played...far more than he earned when starring in \\"Dracula\\" in 1931.Senn covers many more great films of the 1930's inclucing \\"The Ghoul\\", \\"The Old Dark House\\", \\"Mad Love\\", and \\"Werewolf of London\\", all aided by over 100 photographs. Nearly as interesting is the appendix of another 71 films that were borderline exclusions into the horror genre. Some of these films were new to me and although many are not available on DVD or VHS, I certainly intend to hunt down those that are. This may be the ultimate resource for fans of Golden Age horrors. You'll spend hours pouring over Senn's meticulous research and certainly learn a great deal about the films you've loved for so many years. Another fantastic offering from McFarland Books!Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939","review":"A fan of Lugosi or Karloff? Find it in your budget to pick up this masterpiece. Bryan Senn is a young, inspired, well-read cinephile. His specialty is the 1930's. He's very good. He acknowledges his sources and blends them perfectly into this valuable tome. Interesting pictures and wonderful trivia abound. For example, did you know that, in 1932, Fay Wray was filming &quot;King Kong&quot; during the day, &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; at night, and still going back to Warner Bros. studio for pick-ups on &quot;Dr. X&quot; all at the same time? This remarkable lady is still alive(around age 96). (I met her at a California film festival.) If old horror movies are your bag, are you in luck!"},{"Title":"Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939","review":"If your interested in 30's horror this is the one book that you must have. Senn provides full coverage of the genre in the 30's--in depth reviews of all the decade's major films and short reviews of films that are more marginal in importance (mostly mysteries with horror overtones).Golden horrors has the best format of any film book I have ever read. for each major film covered, Senn provides seperate sections on plot summaries, the strengths of the film, its weaknesses, and its prodiuction history. This means you can skip over reading the plots of films you have already seen and get the historical and analytical meat.Senn's taste is informed and almost always on target. He not only tells you what's good or bad about the film but why. There's no vague generalties about ambience or directorial skill--he explains with specifics how the director (or writer or cinematographer) achieved his effects.The production histories are complete and usually very interesting.The book also includes 10 best lists for 30's horror films by Senn and other writers. Finding out Ray Bradbury's top 10 picks will, I think, be of interest to most fans.I can't recommend this book to highly. It's simply the best on the subject and nothing else is even a close second."},{"Title":"Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939","review":"Senn's book is simply the best ever done on the classic (and otherwise) horror films of the thirties. It surpasses the coverage of the thirties in such recognized masterpieces as UNIVERSAL HORRORS, and it is hard to see how a book could offer better understanding of the films addressed. If Senn would do a similar job on the forties, he will go down as one of the great authors in the genre. He might anyway."},{"Title":"Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939","review":"This book is similar to other volumes recounting the back stories of the classic Universal Horror movies however it only deals with the first decade--ending with 1939. Therefore, \\"The Wolf Man\\" a few other classic movies are omitted, but the discussion is relevant and insiteful. Many of the sacred cows that are often lauded in similar tomes (The Bride of Frankenstein) are not afforded the same veneration, but the author does provide thought-provoking analysis for his claims.Overall, a good resource read."},{"Title":"Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939","review":"The book appears to be an encyclopedia of horror films, however, the reviews include only films released from 1931-1939. It makes no sense why the 1940-1946 horror films are not included, which he calls the \\"Silver\\" age of horror. Senn's writing style is like that of a graduate student in film rather than a style that communicates chills and suspense. Senn biases his reviews of the film and actors based upon \\"academy award\\" potential rather than the atmosphere and mood. If you are a Bela Lugosi fan, you will be disappointed in the reviews like I was. He tries very hard to be \\"diplomatic\\" about Mr. Lugosi, however, none of Mr. Senn's top 10 list of best horror films include Bela Lugosi. Mr. Senn dismisses Lugosi films like \\"The Corpse Vanishes\\" because of the absence of 'film school etiquette'. I am a serious fan of the golden age of horror films and consider \\"The Corpse Vanishes\\" to be extremely atmospheric and haunting and one of my favorites. Senn has a strong bias towards Boris Karloff because of his \\"acting\\" abilities, e.g., the ability to play two parts in one film. I like Boris Karloff very much but have not found any of Karloff's films, with the exception of Frankenstein, that would rival a Lugosi film in terms of mood and atmosphere. Don't base your opinion on whether or not to buy a DVD format of the film based upon Senn's reviews."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"This is simply an amazing book. Compulsively readable even while it dazzles with long bravura political/intellectual conversations. You finish the book with a real feel for a particular moment in time, politically, artistically, personally and intellectually. What astonished me more is that Huxley creates a fictional character who eerily foreshadows the real life figure of Oswald Mosley, the British fascist leader of the 1930s. When I first read the book, I thought it was an actual, lightly fictionalized portrait of Mosley and his movement, only to learn that in fact Mosley did not come to prominence concurrent with the book. Do not miss this."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Point Counter Point was a scandal in its day, and is still an startlingly funny account of the literary and cultural elite of the 1920's. There are recognizable depictions of the famous personalities of the day. Various plots intertwine to culminate in an dramatic ending. The book describes a bygone era, England after the first war, with Victorian morals falling. Huxley has a gift for caricaturing individuals, lampooning mores, and playing with the varied intellectual and artistic fashions and fads of the 'twenties. Even read today, the book provides a liberating sense of iconoclasm and free thought, and is humorous to boot. Best to read and reread."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Huxley had to be one of the most astute minds of his age. Although Point Counter Point and a Brave New World are very different, Huxley's far sighted genius is evident on every page.The coversations of Spandrell, Pampion, Burlap and Phillip Quarles are deep and challenging touching subjects such as art, literature, religion, science, and sociology.Huxley also mixes infedelity and mudrer into his rather thin plot. The true value of Point Counter Point is its deep thought provoking conversations, not its plot."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Huxley's character portrayals are, as has been mentioned, sophisticated, fascinating and diverse, if not a little exaggerated. His ideas are, as always, well developed and insightful. The plot structure, as is typical in a character-driven novel, is virtually nonexistant - but we can forgive this. In fact, the only real problem I have with this book is a disagreement with Huxley's callow &quot;whole person&quot; thesis, which smacks of a kind of vague transcendentalism. Of course, this is a personal gripe, and I would encourage this book to anyone interested in a rather meandering examination of extreme personality types in early 1900's England."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Point Counter Point, considered one of Aldous Huxley's best novels, is an omniscient intertwining of myriad characters in all their glory, sin, sophistication and harsh cynicism. While little actually happens in the plot of the story, there is so much detail given to each character that we can essentially see their life through their eyes for the duration of the text.If it weren't for Aldous' ability to awaken his characters within the reader and donate a most wise introspective commentary to compliment each one, this book would have been a total loss for all involved. It is his insight and sheer breadth of intelligence that make all of Huxley's works a must-read for anyone in any generation.That said, I will add that I personally found this book to be almost a complete bore, and even fought myself to not put it down almost every time I picked it up. I realize that this is contradictory to everything I've just said, so allow me to explain.Keep in mind that this is pure opinion.Of Aldous' works that I have read, I find a sharp distinction between his early and latter writing. Antic Hay, Chrome Yellow, The Genius and The Goddess and Eyeless in Gaza and Point Counter Point are novels that address problems of an era that was, frankly, deceased long before I was born, and I found little interest in them because of this. I'm not saying that they weren't brilliant or provocative in their own right; merely that they spoke of things that were beyond me. Contrastingly, Brave New World, Brave New World Revisited, The Encyclopaedia of Pacifism, The Doors of Perception, Heaven and Hell, Ape and Essence, After Many a Summer and Island have each blown me away almost completely, and each in their own way. I couldn't say enough about any one of these novels, and in fact skipped writing a review of Island because I simply couldn't say anything intelligent enough about it that would come close to the level of brilliance within the text. I believe these novels to touch upon a much more personal philosophy that the others did not; each explores a personal avenue, often relating social implications to the fray, whereas the former group deals most explicitly with social implications and how they affect his characters. Broad statement I know, but this is a general summary of my thought patterns.Back to Point Counter Point, as this is supposed to be a review of the text, I won't be saying anything else about it. I feel that I can't do it justice since I didn't enjoy it, and insulting it for being outside the scope of my personal preference would be idiotic and more worthy of a Newspaper than this site. This was originally posted at www dot yourwords dot ca"},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Wonderful reading, terrific character development, and Huxley does a great job of personifying the main characters, all of whom weave in and out of readers' focus and each others' lives while all the time expanding on such subjects as: materialism, intellect, social staidness &amp; frivolity. There is also,of course, my favorite character: Lucy Tantamount - who boogies to her own tune &amp; lives her own life at a time when women didn't really &quot;enjoy themselves as a man does.&quot; A lot of different perspectives on life, love &amp; learning which are sure to expand the mind."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"The novel takes it title and structure from music, particularly the music of Bach, as it weaves themes and moods in and out, contrasting one instrument with another. Huxley does the same here, presenting a large cast of characters and allowing them to present their ideas separately, contrasting one viewpoint with another. He says, \\"In the human fugue there are eighteen hundred million parts....It is only by considering one or two parts at a time that the artist can understand anything.\\"This is a novel about life-philosophies and where they lead the separate characters. Huxley portrays one of his characters (a novelist, modeled upon himself) as writing, \\"The character of each personage must be implied, as far as possible, in the ideas of which he is the mouthpiece.\\" And that is exactly what Huxley does here. He also allows various characters to give long speeches wherein they explain their ideas.What Huxley is primarily concerned with is the balance that he feels must be achieved of the three aspects of man--the intellectual, the physical, and the spiritual or emotional.All of this sounds very boring, as I relate it, but it is not. It is often very funny. (A murdered corpse just going into rigor kicks his murderer. That was priceless.) The plot is actually quite interesting, including bits of high drama. The types of people portrayed are realistic, if a little exaggerated. The ideas are interesting; the writing is impeccable.It is slow-going reading, and the people seem more like stereotypes than real, so emotional investment in the novel is minimal.This is certainly an interesting read and very well done, but it is written with an almost entirely intellectual focus, revealing perhaps that Huxley had not achieved a balance in his own life."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"I had no problems with this order. The package shipped quickly and was received on time. The book was labed new and seemed very new to me. It looked like its never been used. I am very satisfied with this order."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"It's the second time that I am reading this book. I bought it after reading Ken Follet 2 books from his trilogy. They made me remember of this book. It's a wonderful book, better written than those of Follet. The way people think and act in the society is very accurate, you see human being from the inside, how we feel, think. I am sure we know a lot of the characters of this novel in the poeple we mingle with."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"This was the second Huxley read for me. First of course being BNW. While this and BNW are to differing books, it was PCP (I like the initials!) that really compelled me to read all of Huxley's other novels and explore others like Henry Miller, Gabriel Garcia Marqez, and William Faulkner. The influence this book has played on my desire to explore serious literary fiction has is probably why I am unafraid to state that this is my favorite book I have ever read. Considering how many novels I have perused through, that is not a small understatement.The reason for this is not because I find the characters easily likable. Spandrell and Phillip are the only two characters are particuarly find to likable people. As in that I would like to explore their minds over a cup of coffee with them. The beauty of this piece is Huxley's ability to delve into the sick desires and insecurities of his characters so it is astounding how easy it is to identify with your own thoughts and feelings about a particular situation. If you have had your heart broken by a woman, just look at the gut wrenching sickness of Bidlake and L. Tantamount's relationship for a feeling close to a cynics mind. For me Phillip's quiet \\"I prefer to be left alone with my own thoughts and desires attitude\\" is a beautiful commentary on someone who seems to have rejected what society has to offer us. Whether you hate or love a particular character almost all of them exhibit a characteristic that I have felt or identify with about modern society (it doesn't even matter this was published in 1928).Despite the converging, merging, and diversifying path of all the important characters, it locks into a nicely concluded puzzle with a ironic and bitter tragedy. Which is why it stands a notch above Those Barren Leaves. The story comes together. It is a beautiful piece of literature which my words cannot do justice."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"This book is fascinating, and Huxley's genius is evident on every page. However, his effort to create a giant contrapuntal mosaic of different voices fails in that it has almost no driving motion to propel it forward. In music, that motion is created by the beat. In writing, it is created by the story.While this book can be appreciated for its deep insight into human nature and exquisitely drawn characters, it remains more of a static work such as that of a photo or painting, and requires the reader to move through it, rather than moving the reader along. In a shorter book, this might work. In a work of this size, it leaves the vast majority of readers unsatisfied or abandoning the book. There is a reason why this book has so few reviews. It is not the fault of some readers that that Point Counter Point is not as popular or accessible as some of his other novels. It's because he has only appealed to the intellect capable of looking within a painting for an hour, and not the intellect who can listen attentively to an entire Mahler Symphony. To the musical intellect, this book teases with its occasional brief advances in action, then jerkingly stops the microscope repeatedly to focus on the characters. Huxley is unable in this book, like a true master, to keep the microscope moving."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"I'll explain the title quote later; first let me say that I found the novel very well written. Every time I read a book I look for memorable quotes to pick out, and Point Counter Point scored well above average. But at the high level the book still failed for me. Huxley was trying to write a 'novel of ideas,' but I found this was executed at the expense of a plot. Most of the characters are mere caricatures--people like Willy Weaver and Charles Quarles--who are themselves entertaining parodies, but who don't give the novel any meat. And then the official characters don't much pick up the slack. Take Walter Bidlake, who opens the book stuck in his declining affair with Marjorie Carling. He was interesting at the start, and I found his courtship of Lucy Tantamount engaging, but after that their affair simply leaves off and they do nothing but exchange a few letters in the last 200 pages. Walter's story has no ending, but his is actually the most developed of them all. Other than that, the only really engaging piece of storytelling was that of Mark Rampion's courtship of his wife, but that was a standalone episode.So, without much plot, what do the characters spend their time doing? Mostly ranting. About how industrialized society is destroying our souls; how wealth and leisure make us frivolous and lazy; how the supercilious intellectual life is merely a crutch for people who can't deal with their fellow man, etc. While Huxley makes some good points, he doesn't counterbalance his criticisms with recommendations; and his characters are mostly examples of what not to do, so his theories end up pointing to nothing.And a lot of the book's arguments seemed manufactured and phony to me. This phoniness reached surreal heights in the last scene where Rampion listens to Beethoven's A Convalescent's Holy Song of Thanksgiving. I've heard it many times, and it's a great piece of music; but Rampion uses it as a launching point to say, \\"Why did [Beethoven] make castration and bodilessness his ideal? What's his music? Just a hymn in praise of eunuchism. Very beautiful, I admit. But couldn't he have chosen something more human than castration to sing about.\\" (p. 429) Rampion says to Beethoven, \\"What is your music?\\" and I say to Rampion, \\"What is your *deal*?\\" He isn't just over-analyzing the music: he's inventing completely artificial things to put on top of that music to over-analyze. Even the things he appears to enjoy he can only use as fodder for some blanket condemnation.The novel wore even thinner for me when I discovered that it was a roman &agrave; clef filled with people Huxley knew personally. I thought Lucy Tantamount was a great character, but the dignity of her as a literary construction lost some of its gilt when I realized that Huxley was merely demonizing a woman he had had his own bad affair with. Though I was surprised to find that Mark Rampion was supposed to be a depiction of D.H. Lawrence.Speaking of whom, in the end Point Counter Point reminded me of a quote from Lawrence's own Lady Chatterley's Lover. In it, Constance Chatterley is talking about her husband, Clifford, who is a young 'intellectual' writer, but:\\"Where the intellect came in, Connie did not quite see. Clifford was really clever at that slightly humorous analysis of people and motives which leaves everything in bits at the end. But it was rather like puppies tearing the sofa cushions to bits; except that it was not young and playful, but curiously old, and rather obstinately conceited. It was weird and it was nothing ... a wonderful display of nothingness. At the same time a display. A display! a display! a display!\\"(p. 53)That is exactly how I feel about Point Counter Point: slightly humorous, but leaves everything in bits at the end, and comes off as a conceited display of nothingness.Though, on reflection, I realized that Lady Chatterley's Lover was making a lot of the same core points as this book. In Chatterley, Constance begins having affairs because her husband was made crippled and impotent in the war; and Clifford tries to make up for his physical incapacity by devoting himself entirely to the intellectual life of a writer. But, as Clifford becomes more abstract and artificial, Constance and Oliver Mellors (the eponymous lover) move closer to nature and sensuality. And, while the lovers achieve happiness, the writer--for all of his success--only becomes frustrated and infantile. This seems like the same condemnation that Huxley was going for.Perhaps Lawrence was criticizing those who symbolically cripple themselves to work purely in the intellectual domain, because they only produce inferior works because of it. That was why he approached Lady Chatterley with the objective of simply telling a good story with well developed characters--the plain, non-intellectual book--, and yet he was still able to convey the points he wanted. But with Point Counter Point Huxley was trying the opposite: to throw out the plot and story entirely so that he could just focus on writing his 'novel of ideas.' But by discarding the mobility and moment of a story, it seems that Huxley--like Clifford Chatterley--was crippling himself. And, as such, between the two books I enjoyed Lady Chatterley's Lover much more."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"I'm roughly two hundred pages into this work and can't put it down. While other books have fallen by the wayside temporarily this book is so easily consumed. The book's character development is a joy thus far. Be warned, Brave New World is nothing like this work, so if you are looking for something similar, click on the G. Orwell link at the bottom of this page."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Though the book takes it's sweet time in making it's points, in the end the payoff is well worth it. You realize that everyone in the book indeed is in one way or another a total jerk, and then the scary thing is when you realize you, and everyone you know, is somehow like any number of the characters. Great debate within over the struggle between passion and reason, hedonism and cold pursuit of &quot;progress&quot; or &quot;The better good&quot;. The book may seem slow, but there is no other way the story, or points could have been effectively made."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"The book has its quirks that make it more difficult to read now than it might have been in 1928. The proportion of dialogue to plot movement makes the book's structure look like an extended parlor discussion with only a few events that \\"happen to them\\" in between. The book is also stuffed to the limit with exposition on the nearly dozen main characters, each of whose primary flaw is both explained in narrative and demonstrated not in action, but in dialogue. Third, the details of 1920s British politics and the scholarly dialogue make some parts difficult to follow, to the point of obscurity.However, these flaws do not outweigh the sparkling portions of the book. If Huxley's dissection of the modern soul weren't so witheringly accurate and complete, this book might not have made mention outside its immediate time and place. Although this is from late in the book (Chapter 36), this passage (a journal entry in Philip Quarles' notebook) gives the summary statement of the problem:\\"It's incomparably easier to know a lot, say, about the history of art and to have profound ideas about metaphysics and sociology than to know personally and intuitively a lot about one's fellows, one's wife and children. Living's much more difficult than Sanskrit or chemistry or economics. The intellectual life is child's play; which is why intellectuals tend to become children -- and then imbeciles and finally, as the political and industrial history of the last few centuries clearly demonstrates, homicidal lunatics and wild beasts. The repressed functions don't die; they deteriorate, they fester, they revert to primitiveness. But meanwhile it's much easier to be an intellectual child or lunatic or beast than a harmonious adult man.\\"Huxley demonstrates this general principle in his characters, all of whom are intellectuals of the moment and are engaged in fields of painting, writing, biology, politics, religion, and seduction, and all of whom share neither the solution to the unhappiness of their predicament, or the moral strength to overcome their weaknesses. This is a morality play, but not of the traditional kind. Here, the tempter is not a horned figure with a pitchfork. Rather, it is a consequence of the modern world: the balkanization of the fields of knowledge and the allure of \\"whoring after abstractions\\" at the expense of arresting the development of real human qualities. To this extent, I don't believe this problem has been solved even with the transition forward from the modern world into a post-modern one, and the character studies still largely ring true today.That's not to say that today's moralists would agree to Huxley's solution to this problem. Rampion, the least flawed character in the book, says this as a rebuke to the religious ascetics and to the sexual and intellectual fetishists alike: \\"[I]t's a damned sight better to behave like a beast -- a real, genuine, undomesticated animal, I mean -- than to invent a devil and then behave like one's invention.\\" Judging by how Huxley spent his life thereafter, it appears that this was his own view as well."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"I didn't like this book. Aldous Huxley has succeeded in creating a book in which every character is distasteful. There is simply not one character in the book who is likable or who has any redeeming qualities.Many other reviewers seem to suggest that the whole point of the book is to demonstrate the moral decay of English society around the time of the First World War. However, how can one seek to demonstrate moral decay without some point of moral reference? In order to do this, Huxley would need to create at least one character who establishes a moral point of reference by which the other characters in the book can be judged. There is simply no character in the book which fulfills this reference role. As a result, the book is no more than a fairly pointless and gratuitous description of decaying individuals.I had also expected Huxley to provide some well argued and intellectual insights into his own atheism and his general skepticism about organised religion. Unfortunately, in this regard, Huxley only succeeded in demonstrating his arrogance, stupidity and condescension - for example:\\"You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. . . . Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies. Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat's meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, quite intelligent enough.\\"A further reason for the title of my review, is that virtually nothing of substance happens in the entire book and the only significant events which do occur in the book, appear to occur for no apparent reason and are not explained. I found myself going back a few pages after one of these pointless events to check whether I had missed the explanation of why the event happened - unfortunately, there was no explanation.Give this book a miss!"},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"I read this book several years ago and I am now adding it to my personal library. As one of your editorial reviewers notes, Aldous Huxley's explanation of the motives for actions filled gaps in my understanding of peoples' thinking. It is as valuable as a psychological textbook, and it is a lot more interesting. Seconding the reviewers' comments, this book is as appropo today as in the recent past. Modern man can reflect on the personalities of the characters and see how they betray themselves and others with subtle repressions of their real feelings. For the lovelorn on Valentine's day, Huxley's portrayal of a venal vixen provides soothing understanding for those who have endured similar rejections. Also, commentating on what one of the critics said, that Huxley showed his disapproval of science; this is another reason why it is a great novel. Science ignores the human spirit."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"After 100 pages I hated Point Counter Point. It was pretty nicely written, witty and urbane and filled with mildly amusing ponderings of people who like to show off how smart they imagine themselves to be. After the first 100 pages my vague recollection of reading Brave New World sometime years and years ago made my already underwhelming opinion nosedive. I hated the characters: hated their smug, self-righteous, utterly condescending self-importance and I was annoyed with Huxley for creating them.But I kept going, for an as yet uncertain reason compelled to at least finish it. And nothing changes . . .The turnaround comes in the slow, very subtle humanizing of these pompous jerks followed by a rapid and all-consuming anatomization of the nuance and flow of their personalities. Regardless of their lofty identities and superior postures, these people are flaked away, pulled apart, itemized and discarded with an ambitious and often roaring insight.I suspect many of Huxley's other novels resemble this slow-to-appreciate mumble of ramblings, often in dispute, of various social issues as seen by people who hardly care. Having ventured this one I might wish to avoid many of the others. Regardless of this eventual respect I still find myself irritated. Call it three-and-a-half, rounded up because it ends rather cruelly."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Every time I write a review of a book which is considered \\"literature\\" I am afraid that some Pulitzer Prize winner dude with 2 PhDs is going to track me down and hit me over the head with his cane, but, since I move once a year, I will take my chances. I wish the rest of the book tasted like the first 20 pages. It starts with a series of insights of the minds of the characters which is just exquisite, but then it dilutes onto other things, which are much, much more mundane and I just do not see the same quality of thought put into the writing until some chapters ahead.My 2 cents."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"I love science fiction especially books like 1984, a brave new world, and Fahrenheit 451.

I know it is unfair to judge a book that I haven't finished. However, I feel like it's important for those people who are considering this book due to a brave new world to know that this is not as entertaining or as fast paced as that book was."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Hearken back those of you who remember introductory literature classes and lectures on the difference between \\"story\\" and \\"plot.\\" \\"Point Counter Point is rather short on story, but it's absolutely dripping in plot. Not much happens that could be easily summarized on a book cover, but so much happens in the way of character development and psychological insight that the results are nearly mind-boggling. How Huxley could develop such a large cast of characters so thoroughly is one of the greatest testaments I can make to his ability as an artist, and for those who love to sink their teeth into complex characterizations and psychological motivations, this book will have you frothing at the mouth.One should read \\"Point Counter Point\\" not for the destination, but for the journey. The ending is eerily and disquietingly ambiguous; Huxley is not as interested in passing judgements on his characters as he is in illustrating how complicated the act of living is and how there is likely no one approach to life that will adequately prepare one for its tragedies and twists of fate. A somewhat cynical point of view perhaps, and certainly not comforting to those in search of the big answers to life's big questions, but very realistic. There's hardly a page of this novel that didn't strike a chord with me and put perfectly into words either an idea I have myself or a character trait that I can instantly recognize in someone else.Though published nearly 80 years ago, this novel feels like it could have been written yesterday (some period differences aside, of course) so relevant do these characters' conflicts, escapades, fears and desires seem. Huxley's book is a reminder that 80 years isn't all that long in the course of human events, nor really is 200, 300 or 400 years. Despite superficial advancements in technology and science, the fundamental questions of being have been mankind's greatest preoccupation for centuries and will likely go on being so.This is a marvelous novel and perfect for a book club or literature class, as the food for debate it offers are virtually endless."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Aldous Huxley's reputation as a writer of fiction rests on three works: _Antic Hay_, _Brave New World_, and _Point Counter Point_. In this book, the most ambitious and successful of the three, he examines in detail the ideas and personalities of the British intelligentsia of the late twenties. Their politics, their sexuality, their world view, their love of life, and their fear of death are ruthlessly dissected for our delectation.Huxley accomplishes this by developing various themes with one group of characters and then reintroducing them with another group, whose members view similar developments from a different perspective. Situations, ideas, and figures of speech recur in altered form throughout the novel. Oftentimes, he accomplishes this effect with a great deal of gentleness and subtlety.Two brothers-in-law, Walter Bidlake and Philip Quarles, are clearly projections of Huxley at different ages. They interact with each other and the other members of the large cast of characters. A third, diabolical character, Maurice Spandrell, is more or less Huxley's Jungian shadow. D.H. Lawrence is projected into the story as Mark Rampion, and John Middleton Murry appears as Denis Burlap. We are allowed inside the minds of these five men, letting us see the events of the story from many points of view. For that matter, we are allowed inside the minds of all the characters. In particular, we are allowed inside the mind of the frighteningly seductive femme fatale, Lucy Tantamount, who is a projection of Nancy Cunard.Communists and Fascists, apolitical seekers of wholeness, God-seekers, and bored aesthetes offer their views on the events and ideas of the time and on each other. Sometimes these oppositions escalate into violence. The crippling effects of poverty on the poor are contrasted with the pathetic efforts of their economic betters to come to terms with their personal demons.The young rich characters have for the most part dispensed with God and busy themselves searching for a good time. But the doddering rich, the elderly quietists, the weepy inepts, the smarmy bullies, the shameless exploiters, and the sinister diabolists continue the quest. The elderly quietists come off best.The lusts of the flesh fail as miserably as religion. Philip Quarles and his wife cannot communicate. Spandrell humiliates his conquests, but is ultimately bored with them. Lucy Tantamount is also chronically unfulfilled. Rampion's vision of wholeness and marital fulfillment serves more to highlight the deficiencies of the other characters than to inspire emulation. The elderly members of the cast no longer possess the life force necessary to seduce, and such efforts as they make end in disaster. Burlap, the truly successful seducer of the novel, is so disgusting that he will make your skin crawl.The novel is like a machine with a thousand moving parts. It delights, it captivates, it amuses and horrifies. It sparkles with Huxley's intelligence and wit. It is sufficiently vicious in spots to gratify one's intellectual bloodlust. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"I thought Point Counter Point was probably one of the best books that I have ever read. What drew me in the most was the ability Huxley has to portray many characters, all of whom are very different. The subtle way in which Huxley questions the idle spirit of modern man are at once both funny and disturbing. It is amazing how little has changed since the publication of the book...All in all, I was left feeling awed that someone could write a book that was so good.... and I was sad to have to finish it... it was the type of book you wish could last indefinately."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Aldous Huxley's 1928 novel opens with a grand London party given by Lady Edward Tantamount. Music plays. Dozens of characters cross the stage, meet briefly, argue, and part. Some go on to a restaurant that stays open past midnight; there, they meet still more characters and argue some more; several of them continue to yet another party in the early hours of the morning. We are now 100 pages into the book, a quarter of the way through. The numerous characters will continue to bump into each other over the next days and months, but the essential texture of the opening will not change.If you Google the title, the question comes back \\"Did you mean Point Counterpoint?\\" Well, no. Counterpoint is a musical term implying line and movement: two or more voices, intertwining with one another, echoing, developing, but never standing still. Huxley certainly understands that music implies movement -- his descriptions of actual music are superb -- but his method as a novelist is essentially static: to set characters off against one another, each of whom represents a different point of view. The book is thus a series of debates, some funny, some serious, all clever. But the characters ricochet off one another like balls on a pool table; this is truly a matter of point clashing with point; there is no line, little movement, and almost no plot.Oddly enough, Huxley has one of his characters, a writer, criticize his own method: \\"Novel of ideas. The character of each personage must be implied, as far as possible, in the ideas of which he is the mouthpiece. In so far as theories are rationalizations of sentiments, instincts, dispositions of soul, this is feasible. The chief defect of the novel of ideas is that you must write about people who have ideas to express -- which excludes all but about .01 per cent of the human race.\\" And again: \\"The great defect of the novel of ideas is that it's a made-up affair. Necessarily; for people who can reel off neatly formulated notions aren't quite real; they're slightly monstrous. Living with monsters becomes rather tiresome in the long run.\\" He has it right; this book IS a made-up affair, it IS tiresome, and its .01 percent of the human race consists of a handful of English aristocrats and intellectuals -- Huxley as a kind of egghead Evelyn Waugh.Several times, I almost tossed the book away, yet kept on reading -- why? The first time was when Huxley introduces Mark Rampion, a painter and would-be novelist closely based on his friend D. H. Lawrence. Here is a character who does not come from the upper classes, whose thoughts are three-dimensional and fully worked out, and whose unconventional yet bracing morality serves as a touchstone for the other characters in the book. The chapter describing his courtship is one of the few passages where the novel of ideas becomes one of feeling, and it was riveting. Although nothing quite like that chapter comes again, I kept on because I was often amused, sometimes challenged (Huxley is an erudite author who almost demands footnotes), and increasingly aware that I was reading something that was as close to source material on the period as I was likely to find. For Huxley does not confine himself to the social and amorous goings-on typical of an early Waugh book such asA HANDFUL OF DUST. He also addresses politics (both fascism and communism are represented), religion and its substitutes, philosophy, the arts, and science. Even sex gets analyzed with an almost scientific detachment: there is a long disquisition by one of the more despicable characters on the techniques of seduction, perversion, and spiritual degradation; another embarks on what must be the first examination in literature of the phrase \\"sleeping around\\". As a reference work, this is fascinating; I just wish it were a better novel. Interesting though the numerous points are, I could have done with some genuine counterpoint."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"I, like many, with Brave New World as my only prior exposure to Huxley, was not quite sure what to expect with Point Counter Point. Rated the #44 fiction novel of the 20th Century by The Modern Library, I felt obliged to give it a read. Firstly, it is entirely unfair, and furthermore foolishly inane, to even begin to compare it to the dystopian genre of Brave New World. It's apples and oranges.The true mark of a genius is the irrefutable fact that his work cannot, and should not, be fastidiously placed in a box, or in essence shortsightedly confined to a category. That is readily apparent with Huxley, and more importantly Point Counter Point. A prodigious and incendiary denunciation of 1920s English aristocracy and their partners in crime, the supercilious intelligentsia. Huxley exposes them for nothing short of morally bankrupt, intellectually vacuous, and hopelessly incorrigible.Point Counter Point strikes me as a book for the more intelligent among us, i.e., those who strive to read challenging and illuminating literature that is not only profound, but highly enjoyable as well. You will treat yourself to intensely stimulating debates between Huxley's eclectic cast of characters as they argue the merits of science, religion, communism, fascism, capitalism, fidelity, etc, etc, etc. Although Brave New World receives all of the ink (and rightly so), Point Counter Point makes an incontrovertible case that it is a definitive classic in its own right."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Point Counter Point provokes all kinds of philosophical thoughts in my young, impressionable mind. But isn't that what I need? I love the way Aldous Huxley makes his readers think about their godless, fornicating lives and the impact it has on them and their world. Few authors cause me to feel the love for reading I have like Aldous Huxley does. Regardless of my age, I am a senior in high school, Huxley stampeded his way into my heart with Brave New World in ninth grade; then with Doors of Perception in eleventh; now he does it with Point Counter Point. I can live without a major plot as long as he continues to build his characters. No flat characters exist in any of Huxley's novels. Read them. Fall in love with him like I have."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"In Huxley's books, its not just the plot that captivates. Huxley's insights on society and people are so on target and so truthful, it's amazing. His ability to translate truth into words is incredible. Point Counterpoint is no exception:\\"Work's no more respectable than alcohol, and it serves exactly the same purpose: it just distracts the mind, makes a man forget himself. Work's simply a drug, that's all. It's humiliating that men shouldn't be able to live without drugs, soberly; it's humiliating that they shouldn't have the courage to see the world and themselves as they really are.\\"\\"But there is in debauchery something so intrinsically dull, something so absolutely and hopelessly dismal, that it is only the rarest beings, gifted with much less than the usual amount of intelligence and much more than the usual intensity of appetite, who can go on actively enjoying a regular course of vice or continue actively to believe in its wickedness.\\"\\"But the very possession of a body is a cynical comment on the soul and all its ways. It is a piece of cynicism, however, which the soul must accept, whether it likes it or no.\\"If these statements strike you as surprisingly truthful, then Huxley is for you.The theme of Point Counterpoint concerns the mind/body dichotomy, which I think is really interesting. It makes you think about yourself a little differently than you may be used to."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Lots of people have overanalyzed and overhyped the books on this site, but let me tell you this: Point Counter Point is Huxley's finest work. Sure &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot; are popular titles, (popularized by quasi-intelligent hippies who THINK they understand things) but Point Counter Point really shows just how perceptive and thorough Huxley's literary style is. If you can disassociate Huxley's &quot;cult&quot; fans from his actual work, this is the one title I would reccomend. Stunning...."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Many years ago I saw the Masterpiece dramatization of Aldous Huxley's \\"Point Counter Point.\\" I have finally found time to sit down and read the original text. This is a wonderful novel. Huxley's command of English is striking. He is an artist- except that he uses words and not paint brushes to fill in the canvas. Some have compared \\"Point Counter Point\\" to Thackery's earlier work \\"Vanity Fair.\\" They were not wrong. It is interesting to note that Huxley writes of the deep cynicism and hypocrisy that infected post-WWI Europe. He captures a jaded society that has lost all moral bearings. He characters are cruel and brutal with their emotions and intellectual swords. Thackery also wrote after a long conflict- the Napoleonic Wars- and similarly captures a society bent on seeking pleasure and material satisfaction. Perhaps a major difference is that Thackery's characters are funny and amuse. Many of Thackery's creations would actually be fun to meet in person. Who would not want to spend an exhausting evening with Becky Sharp or the foppish Josh? The characters in Huxley's novel are far from agreeable. In fact, I could not wish to meet any of them in real life. However, Huxley captures an age. In fact, reading \\"Point Counter Point\\" I now understand better the collapse of the West in the face of Nazi aggression. Appeasement and the rapid collapse of France's Third Republic have always been a mystery to me. Huxley provides a clue- Western Europe after WWI had lost its moral compass and inner strength. The characters of Lucy Tantamoun and Burlap were bereft of true emotional empathy with their fellow human beings. Where Thackery paints a picture driven by material gain; Huxley tells of a society that suffers extreme ennui and moral abandonment, driven only by the pleasures of petty cruelty and puerile interests. This is a must read for anyone wanting to better understand the late 1920s and the onset of the 1930s. Otherwise, read it for the sheer pleasure of experiencing Huxley !"},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"This striking portrait of early 20th century high society is the first book I read by Aldous Huxley. While exposing the lavish lifestyle of the literary and social elite as one of hypocracy and shared animosity, it also carries a strong philisophical undercurrent. He uses the satirical charaterizations to expound on his personal docterine, and does so in a way that is both accessable and entertaining.At times the book tended to be a tad meandering, without any real plot-driving focus of conflict, but somehow the lack of a linear plot deveopment is not that big of an issue once you get caught up in the flow of his writing style. I do caution readers to avoid the foreward, as it reveals one of the few major plot developments.This is one of my all time favorite novels, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys biting satire, brilliant dialogue, and discourses on a variety of subjects that are still applicable nearly a century later. And how can one resist a book that fits in the phrase &quot;the stertorous borborygmy of dispepsia&quot;?"},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"pienso que es un libro muy bueno, que realmente vale la pena leer. Destaco la gran capacidad del autor, para ver distintos puntos de vista y argumentarlos de la manera en que lo hace. Es el escritor mas inteligente que haya habido, y pienso que en este libro pone de manifiesto su capacidad intelectual."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"This book was written by a very observant man; everyone should be able to relate to at least one scene in it. But the characters, who were simply viewed as intellectuals in their day, behave like people with Asperger's syndrome by today's educationally deficient standards. Even Rampion, the most mentally healthy character in the book, can quote French, alienates his family, and makes references to philosophers. Neurotypically normal people will nonetheless understand most of the characters' antics, but \\"Aspies\\" will identify more with the Quarles family and Marjorie than the other characters.Brave New World is the dystopia that Huxley is famous for, but this book depicts a dystopia as well-one that happened to exist in Huxley's time. His world was ruled by not a bread-and-circus government, but people who were so intelligent they didn't understand the meanings of love and friendship. Huxley himself is one of these people- he seems unable to conceive of any other kind of world than the one he lived in. Anatole France's THAIS, a book I'd never heard of until I read this, is referred to as a children's book. The proletariat are, with few exceptions, only mentioned as examples of the \\"unwashed masses\\"-apparently he didn't feel comfortable around them (one person with a colloquial English accent frightens Walter just by grumbling at him). No one seems to understand or utilize love except for the obviously abnormal (Rampion, Burlap). In these times, the characters' antisocial tendencies and formidable intellects seem especially striking; the world of PCP appears to be ruled by autism.I am recommending this to my psychatrist mother as a book that her autistic patients should read. I have a feeling it will find favor among them."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"The novel looks at more priveleged members of English society. Often, Huxley deals with their relationships and ponderings of the impact of scientific developments on society. Much of this is done well. However, the book is not one that engrosses the reader. The book was a chore to finish.Despite having some interesting personality traits and views, I found the characters mostly boring. The characters seemed to lack vitality. Is that a characteristic of the portion of society of which Huxley wrote?"},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"Good but not great, this book starts off roaring with Walter leaving his expectant girl friend (who has left her husband!) for some man-eater. The book failed for me later with some of the other characters getting too politically involved and too pompous. The down to Earth parts of this book involving Lucy, Walter and others were wonderful. The tragedies at the end left me scratching my head."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"This was probably the most disappointing book on the Modern Library list. I loved Brave New World, but it seems that I misunderstood one of it's main points. Huxley apparently opposed science and meant the book to be as much a warning about a science dominated future, as a warning about authoritarian government in general. From this perspective, Brave New World is nearly a crypto-Luddite tract.Huxley was generally something of a sensualist and an anti-rationalist. Like most men before him, he was troubled by the body/mind dichotomy that uniquely confronts humankind. But unlike the great thinkers who have been responsible for nearly all human progress, he (along with his friend DH Lawrence) came down on the side of the body and sensory experience, rejecting reason, science, religion, etc.. It seems to me that to choose the body over the mind is to reject the divine spark in man in favor of the animal instinct.Point Counter Point, a voluminous, wildly overpopulated, completely outdated roman a clef is meant to vindicate his viewpoint, but is so sarcastic as to undermine even his own arguments. Despite some funny set pieces and some interesting ideas, I'd not recommend this book and may have to revisit Brave New World.GRADE: D"},{"Title":"Point Counter Point","review":"A very good piece of literature, but not a very good book."},{"Title":"Boon Island","review":"This is a little book that you will remember with excitement.

Of course, much has changed since publication, but that doesn't diminish the readability of this book in the least.

I have only brewed two batches thus far, both extract, but I am interested in getting into all grain and brewing the range of belgian beers. Given that, I very much enjoyed this book and learned a great deal from it. This is a book that can be enjoyed on multiple levels. It gives enough of the history and background on belgian trappist and abbey style beers to be interesting from that standpoint alone. It goes into great depth on how we have arrived at the various styles and gives a wide range of opinions on how useful these classifications are. Regarding brewing these beers, it does not give step by step recipes per se, though perhaps a few in the later chapters. More appropriate is to say that it teaches concepts on brewing these beers along with the historical perspective as to how these concepts came about.I would recommend anyone who is buying this book to improve their brewing to at least have read a book or two on the concepts of brewing. Palmer's book \\"How to Brew\\" would probably be adequate to give the necessary background to understand the concepts.

While there are base recipes for many of the bigger name Abbey/Trappist style beers, they are by malt % and require a bit of homework on the part of the brewer to really flesh out the recipe. The basics of the recipe are there, however the intent of the book is not just clone recipes, and Stan (or the belgian brewers he interviewed for this book) certainly don't give all their secrets away. The reviews slamming this book for a lack of clone recipes are apparently missing the intention of this book, or glossing over the many base recipes given.Who this book is for: belgian beer lovers, belgian beer homebrewers, and anyone looking to broaden their understanding of brewing in general. I have re-read this book multiple times, and go back to it as a reference now more than Papazian's books.

Ingredients and specifications (gravity, IBU) are given for commercially available beers whenever possible (and the author has done a *lot* of homework to get his hands on this information). Additionally, full recipes are provided for various Belgian style and Belgian-inspired beers. Even better, the authors of these recipes explain *why* they formulated their recipes as they did, and the author supplements this advice with his own, with advice from professional brewers, and from BJCP judges. This enables the brewer to not just mimic the recipes he finds in the book (though believe me, they are definitely worth mimicing!), but to thoughtfully exercise his own creativity within the rich history and style of the Belgian tradition.Beginning brewers will find a lot of technical information regarding krausening, PH adjustment, etc. that goes over their heads. But this shouldn't scare anyone off. The technical information is easy to skip over and there's enough in this book for readers of all levels.This book represents the state of the art in knowledge regarding Belgian brewers and brewing.

A reader interested in brewing can get a sense of visiting each brewery and asking questions about the beers made.Accompanying the discussions of the beers are lists of ingredients, hop levels, alcohol levels, and other brewing specifications, surmised or known. The lists are somewhat general but enough to enable an experienced brewer to experiment with replication. Specifics about recipes and brewing methods are, understandably, guarded by the breweries.The later chapters discuss malts, sugars, hops, yeasts, and bottling processes for these Belgium beers, before a final chapter on recipes.

It is NOT a recipe book, so if that is what you want, then you will be disappointed. The author is very clear that he was not writing a recipe book. But if you are looking for the insight of Belgian Beer and what makes a Belgian Beer tick, then this is definitely for you. There have been some who thought there was too much history, but its my humble opinion that the history is exceedingly important to help one truly understand the Belgian way!"},{"Title":"Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","review":"I bought this for my husband's birthday and it took him no time to read through it.

Did you know there is actually more than one Orval beer brewed at the monastery (despite constant articles to the contrary)? There is actually enough information in this book - assuming you know what you are doing in the all-grain world - to pull it off. But you're going to have to introduce Brettanomyces into your brewery to do it ... and there's the awful temptation! As it is with virtually all Belgian beers, never mind the host of wild yeasts and bacteria that go along with them!Add the wonderful, detailed brewing information to the history and stories and you get quite an unusual brewing book. It may be read for brewing purposes, as a casual read, for historical purposes, for cultural perspective, even for its religious content. Orval, of course, is just one of the Trappist breweries presented in the book.Highly recommended.

The book is more about techniques used at these breweries, a sprinkling of their history, and a description of what each tastes like. There was some recipes in the book, but not really clones of the major Trappest's ales, but a few of the more well know Abby Ales. Original gravity and attenuation was given for each, however. You would really have to know how to design a beer and use this book as a starting point, a concession the book makes in the first chapter. It is really designed, to use a cooking analogy that they did in the book, to give you an idea for a dish and it's up to you to come up with a recipe. To be honest, if all your wanting to do is clone your favorite Abby, be it Trappest or not, doing a Google search or checking out some of the better forums will do you far better. This is more for the advanced brewer, and a novelty at that; however, it was a decent read."},{"Title":"Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","review":"I had heard several good reports of this little book, but after reading it, I'm afraid it is of little substance.

Overall, It deserves a D+."},{"Title":"Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","review":"So if you've just done your first batch of beer this is not the book for you. As a matter of fact, if you have just done your first all grain batch this might not be the book for you. However, if you are a seasoned veteran of the mash tun and want to really delve head first into some of the most beautiful beers on earth this could be your ticket. I know Stan and can affirm that he knows as much about Belgian brewing as anyone in the US. Interviews with Belgian beer masters as well as those stateside gives the advanced homebrewer or professional a great idea of what it will take to brew great belgian inspired beers. Clearly the most important parts of this book to the brewer are the sections on ingredients and fermentation. If you are a diehard English inspired brewer this book will be an eye opener as to what exactly is so different about brewing belgian ales.While being the most accessible of the series, Brew Like a Monk does have periods of extreme tehnical pursuit and it is not just there to baffle, but to educate. Topics such as pitching rates, krausening, bottle conditioning, mash PH, hop extracts, fermentation temperatures, attenuation, and adjunct types are covered in full. For those that are so inclined, Malt analysis and enzyme content are also covered as well as fermenter design of the trappist and secular breweries.As I said, this, as well as the other two in this series, are not for the novice brewer, but if you really want a definitive and complete working knowledge of belgian brewing in the trappist tradition, look no further."},{"Title":"Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, it's a good idea for the reader to have several years of all-grain brewing experience. That, and an existing appreciation of abbey-style beers; words alone cannot adequately portray the unique flavors of Belgian fermentations.Homebrewers often set out to create trappist-inspired beers with the goal of high alcohol content. From reading the book, one will learn that this is a flawed approach; these beers are about allowing the yeast to contribute flavor and attenuation, about embracing the quirky qualities of the yeast, and about retaining balance and \\"drinkability\\" in the beer. Higher alcohol content is serendipitous, but almost incidental.Insightful interviews with trappist brewers, and secular brewers of superb abbey-style ales, introduce the reader to this brewing \\"philosophy.\\" These discussions, and the technical data of the beers they brew, are of enormous value. (As are the lessons they learned from brewing less-than-spectacular beers.) In fact, the differences in malt bills between the two schools is radical at times. I found it amusing that many of the most revered examples of the styles do not fit neatly into the \\"guidelines\\" that are supposed to define them.All aspects of abbey-style brewing are explored in depth... from water, ingredients, and mash temperatures to pitching rates, influences on yeast behavior, and bottle conditioning. Questions about two of the most controversial topics among homebrewers... yeast origins and sugars... are definitively answered.Finally, the text is a joy to read! At once both thoughtful and passionate, the book conveys the reader on a journey of exploration and teaching. (As of this writing, my copy is only a few months old, and already frayed and littered with page markers.) It is amazing that such a wealth of useful information can be packed into under 300 pages and still remain so interesting and approachable.In my fifteen years of homebrewing, I can think of no other publication that is as captivating and enlightening as Brew Like A Monk."},{"Title":"Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","review":"The author presumes you are a proficient brewer and concentrates on the philosophy of belgium abbey brewing rather than the mechanics of brewing. It is a good read and provides the home brewer with useful data to incorporate into their brewing. Excellent section of the use of sugars for increased attentuation and reduced cloying qualities associated with malt only brewing. Overall I would recommend this book without reservation to any home brewer seeking to gain more professional results in their brewing and greater complexity."},{"Title":"Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","review":"Any interested in beer brewing probably has had a hand in home brew and familiarity with some favorite styles such as pilsner or stouts, but BREW LIKE A MONK: TRAPPIST, ABBEY AND STRONG BELGIAN ALES AND HOW TO BREW THEM offers something different, exploring the unique flavors and brews of monastic brewing through visits to modern producers in both America and Belgium. BREW LIKE A MONK isn't just a recipe collection, though of course some brew recipes are included: it's a survey of the history, traditions and flavors of Trappist monk brewing in the Belgian tradition and contrasts the products of independent breweries with American and European brewing traditions.Diane C.

I love the complexity and depth of belgian strong beers. Occasionally, by dumb luck, I've brewed one.

I started out with the clone recipe books (of which there are many out there) and initially bought this book to quickly increase my ability to clone a Belgian style beer that had enjoyed on a whim. Once I started reading however, my eyes were opened. The book does cover quite a bit of history but in doing so debunks a lot of myths about abbey beers and some of the notions about 1000 year old recipes. This is really more a book about brewing philosophy written with the small batch home-brewer in mind. There are very helpful and encouraging tips scattered throughout the book and any brewer with this new knowledge (and perhaps Brewsmith software-my personal favorite) you can continue the \\"tradition\\" of abbey beers even though you may not be affiliated with a monastery or even Belgium for that matter. Home-brewing is all about finding your style and using the experience of those that have come before to create something that you really want to drink."},{"Title":"Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","review":"What a great book. This goes into a great amount of depth in the Belgian style of brewing. I made a dubbel after reading this (with things I learned from it) that is fantastic. A few things to remember about this book if you're considering purchasing it;1. Not for beginners; If this is your first foray into homebrewing, this book will probably not be what you're looking for. It's not really a step by step into how to brew Belgian beers.2. Not a recipe book; Although it does have a few recipes, this book is not a recipe book. It revolves more around theory and techniques that can be applied to your brewing practices rather than telling you what to do.Beyond that, it is well written and easy to read.If you've made a few batches of beer and know the terminology (or some of it at least) but want to gain a little more insight and a new perspective. This is the book for you."},{"Title":"Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","review":"If you enjoy the Belgian styles and are interested in learning more about the beers and their history, this book has plenty to offer. If you go into the purchase knowing it's largely an educational book and not strictly a Belgian recipe book, you should enjoy it. If you're more or less looking for a quick and dirty book that gives you a starting point for brewing beers of this style, you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","review":"Of all the books in my library, this book is by far the best and is hands-down the most detailed text on Trappist ales. Even if you are not a homebrewer, anyone who is even slightly interested in Trappist ales and the monastic way of life will not be disappointed. I have read this book cover to cover many times and I am always finding helpful and interesting info that propels my love for Trappist ales even further. Stan Hieronymous takes the reader inside the walls of the abbeys where these beers are made and not only presents the history and beers of each abbey but even manages to list a few ingredients for each beer. Because the monks and lay workers who work in the breweries are quite secretive regarding their recipes and ingredients, one can only imagine the effort that was put in by the author when writing this book.Above anything else, the author reminds the reader that each of these places is an abbey with a brewery and not the other way around. Despite the fact that the beers are truly amazing, Stan Hieronymous does not let the reader forget the reason for the existence of these beers (to add extra income to the abbey and serve as a form of manual labor according to the Rule of Saint Benedict). The author does a wonderful job of outlining the monastic way of life and mentality, and how this life of silence and harmony manages to produce some of the finest beers in the world time and time again.In addition to the famous Trappist Ales, Stan Hieronymous also provides extensive information on other commercial examples that are produced both in Belgium and the United States. While the main focus of this book is about the Trappist ales produced in the six specific Cistercian monestaries, the reader can also find detailed information about Abbey ales as well as beers brewed in the United States that follow the Belgian tradition and style.Homebrewers will not be disappointed. With plenty of mash schedules and temperatures as well as listed ingredients, fermentation times and temperatures and yeast strains, this book is a highly valuable asset for any homebrewer who wants to try (underline the TRY about five times considering the amazing quality of these beers) to make a beer similar to these Belgian styles at home.If Amazon.com had a rating for 6 or even 10 stars I would choose the highest possible rating for this truly excellent book, as well as a personal commendation for Stan Hieronymous who so artfully presents the Trappists' breweries and way of life."},{"Title":"Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","review":"a very good read, describing the origins of this \\"style\\". very in depth about all the ingredients and processes and history. i also very much liked their tables of the characters to the beer imparted by yeasts at different fermentation temperatures, for both wyeast and white labs strains. perhaps having some discussion on culturing from the original belgian bottles would be good (other than just saying that the yeast have been through battle and are not good for doing this, despite the fact that many of us have done just that). the criticisms i would offer are that several of the recipes are very vague and are likely not what people are looking to brew when they pick up this book. the author also perseverates on this not being a recipe book (or clone book) then includes the recipe for three philosophers!? i do like the tables for ingredients (and how many of the home brews, on average, include which ingredients) and the style guidelines, as well as the does and don'ts. overall a very enjoyable read"},{"Title":"The Bible And Its Story Taught by One Thousand Picture Lessons (4)","review":"Whatever one's beliefs this is a consumate addition to any library.

I must say that Hartog and Meirovitch complement each other beautifully whereas Kelly's book feels a little superfluous.It is clear from the book that Hartog himself had extensive experience with real world vibration analysis. The theory is developed while analyzing a range of mechanical mechanisms and electrical circuits that frequently are important in real vibrating systems. Hartogs book is therefore useful as a reference, for instance for how the piston excite vibrations in the engine frame. Although quite old, the book does not feel dated. The type setting is old school with numerous small but clear figures.Meirovitch's book is more modern in its presentation. Meirovitch prepares the reader for modern methods of vibration analysis such as frequency response analysis of continuous systems with the aid of the finite element method. Meirovitch also make extensive use of matrix algebra and analytical mechanics. However, Meirovitch lacks in practical examples.Overall I recomend the book, especially in combination with Meirovitch."},{"Title":"Mechanical vibrations,","review":"Hey this guy taught at MIT for years - it is the best analytical treatise on the subject in 1934 (and BTW, Physics has not changed since then).I LOVED the book - it covered FUNDAMENTAL points that are timeless.KUDOS to Dr. Den Hartog, and Rest in Peace - your contrbutions in this arena will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Mechanical vibrations,","review":"Don't let the age of this book fool you.

This book helped me (entry level engineer) take a different perspective of real world engineering. It is also very similar to S. Timoshenko's Vibration Problems in Engineering.

In the process friendship crosses class and cultural barriers, Bata&#65533;s faith in the traditional gods of Egypt is challenged by his Greek friend&#65533;s commitment to reason, and all of them find that their lives will not be what they expected.This lively adventure puts plaster and paint on those Egyptian ruins you have read about and brings to life the people who once lived there with their customs, beliefs, conflicts and concerns. Some elements of the story may be taken as fantasy or as an endorsement of ancient religion. They will certainly provoke discussion, which Ms Marston encourages with questions on her website.

In both circumstances, black slaves comprised the vast majority of the population -- 75% in Charleston, 90% in Saint Domingue. In both, the hopeful liberators were former slaves who had become literate, fairly well-to-do, free blacks. Both Toussaint and Vesey distrusted mulattoes, who were regarded in both societies as a distinct class, with ambivalent loyalties. Both leaders took advantage of the disparate religious beliefs of their followers to enhance group cohesiveness.In any such mass event, planned well in advance, the risk of discovery or betrayal is always great. Remarkably, in both of these planned insurrections, rumors and confessions alerted authorities weeks in advance of the scheduled dates. And in both, the white slaveholders were incredulous that ignorant, simple blacks could possibly coordinate an uprising of the size suggested by their informants. In both instances, the threat was dismissed as fantasy. As we know, the French authorities of Saint Domingue were too late in recognizing the magnitude and reality of the uprising. Few of us, however, have grasped the slim margin of time by which white Charlestonians were able to prevent a similar success in Charleston. Considering that Charleston was the prime destination of French planters fleeing the conflagration in Saint Domingue, Charlestonians should have been more attuned to the threat brought on by their slaveholding, minority autocracy. But, as Robertson points out, there was a degree of theater involved in living as a dominant white minority among a vast population of black slaves, and part of that theater was the belief by slaveholders that their slaves were grateful for being well treated--that slaves could recognize that it is better to be fed and clothed and sheltered as a slave than to be free as a savage. This delusion led to the Charlestonians' nearly fatal delay in responding to the signs of impending insurrection.STRENGTHS: The story of Denmark Vesey is as fine an example of &quot;Silencing the Past&quot;, in Michel-Rolph Trouillot's words, as the story of Saint Domingue. Despite the conscious efforts of Charlestonians to obliterate the history of the event (efforts well chronicled by Robertson) the author has assembled a creditable body of confirmed and &quot;probable&quot; details about Vesey and the planned insurrection. His unflinching thoroughness is revealed in such details as the fact that Peter Prioleau, the slave who initially betrayed the plot, was freed in 1822 by a special act of the legislature, and given a lifetime pension. We learn that by 1840, Prioleau is himself the owner of 7 slaves. The brief text (153 pages) is readable compelling, and well documented.In an appendix, Robertson includes 1 paragraph biographies of the other men who were executed along with Denmark Vesey. These poignant scraps are practically all that is know of many of these would be liberators.Interestingly, we learn that Vesey's attempted insurrection apparently led to the US's refusal to grant diplomatic recognition to the Republic of Haiti until the US Civil War. This veritable boycott of the Western Hemisphere's second oldest republic by its older brother may be seen as a significant cause of Haiti's financial and political instability during the first half of the 19th century.WEAKNESSES: I'm stumped here. Perhaps the only shortcoming I can point out is that the text would be enhanced by a period map of Charleston, to enable the reader to follow some of the geographical commentary.CONCLUSION: This short, fluidly written history of an event which could have resulted in a stunning alteration of American history, is also great reading."},{"Title":"Denmark Vesey: The Buried Story of America's Largest Slave Rebellion and the Man Who Led It","review":"David Robertson's book on the life of Denmark Vesey and the planned insurrection of slaves and freed blacks is a powerful, griping story unknown by most American blacks and whites.American school children are always instructed on the bravery of George Washington, Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, etc. and other courageous Founding Fathers who rebelled against the mighty British Empire. As we know, the colonials fought for freedom, liberty and justice. While Americans are proud of the Founding Fathers, the English government believed our heroes were traitors and worthy of death. The labeling of one as a \\"hero/patriot\\" or \\"rebel/terrorist\\" is related to ones perspective of the \\"cause\\".In a brief 153 pages, Roberston leaves the reader grasping for more information about this free, skilled(carpenter), relatively well-off black male, who at the age of 60 risked his life to free slaves in a plan surely doomed for failure. How could a former slave believe an insurrection of this type would not only go undetected, but also ultimately succeed? Robertson provides the reader with enough historical information about Vesey that one believes the plan would have succeeded if not for a few informers. The fact that Vesey and his trusted compatriots enlisted 9000 slaves prepared to rebel clearly demonstrates his planning and leadership skills.After his betrayal, the manner in which Vesey conducted himself under tortuous conditions is inspiring. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the American judicial system.Upon reflection, what is evident in this story of Denmark Vesey is not that a slave rebellion ultimately failed and many of its organizers and participants executed. What is clear is that basic human rights, respect and dignity (as so eloquently delineated in the U.S. Constitution) are not only universally desired, but will ultimately be seized by those so denied. History is full of such brave men and women who pursue justice regardless of personal circumstances and comfort. Denmark Vesey was such a man; an American indoctrinated with the concept of freedom and willing to give his life so his fellow man could have it."},{"Title":"Denmark Vesey: The Buried Story of America's Largest Slave Rebellion and the Man Who Led It","review":"I was surprised to see that this wonderful biography has not been popular among Amazon.com customers. In telling a moving story of courage and rebellion, Robertson succeeds in bringing the reader to Vesey's time and place. This book should be taught in schools, particularly as it brings to life an important and largley overlooked figure in American history. I cannot recommend it highly enough to readers interested in American history, slavery, the South, and social justice."},{"Title":"Denmark Vesey: The Buried Story of America's Largest Slave Rebellion and the Man Who Led It","review":"I found the story hard to follow. It started out to be a very interesting about a slave named,Denmark Vesey. It could have been a great read, but it wasn't."},{"Title":"Denmark Vesey: The Buried Story of America's Largest Slave Rebellion and the Man Who Led It","review":"This is an empowering and inspiring story by a gifted storyteller who surprisingly managed to stay neutral and objective throughout his research into the man and the myth of Denmark Vesey. There are so many lessons for all Americans courageous enough to examine the actions and motives of their immediate ancestors as well as their own often conflicting feelings toward each other."},{"Title":"Denmark Vesey: The Buried Story of America's Largest Slave Rebellion and the Man Who Led It","review":"I find his work to be primarily \\"his story\\", rather than an objective historical account. He was unable to set aside his on prejudices and write a well-balanced account of Denmark Vesey. Is it possible that only a person of African American descent can tell our story truthfully. I generally say yes. But I have read a few non-Africans who have done an excellent job and dare write the truth.. But I believe if you want your story told right, you can't count on outsiders to tell it. However, I did learn some things and I have been directed to some real historians, which some of them are of African descent. So I am in hopes of getting a fuller view of the great Denmark Vesey, who would have led a successful rebellion of Charleston had it not been for a house slave running to massa to tattle.In addition, why is it seen as a crime to the people holding my neck under water, desperately trying to drown me that I wish to cut their throats if given a chance. It is not every human's right to destroy those who wish to destroy them? It is your God given right and command. I guess as long as they are the ones doing the killing, stealing and raping it is all good?!Some irritating comments by the author:Vesey motives were no peaceful.\\"\\"Among the quasi-Christian slaves of the Sea Islands, he was a savage Chieftain who, as a token of his powers, had chosen Gullah Jack as his war advisor and his familiar.\\"This duality is central to Vesy's leadership - a free black who felt himself enslaved, a secular enlightenment autocrat who was also a passionate religionist, a liberator of the oppressed and a potential murder of the innocence.\\"What a bunch of horse manure. Dah! I wonder why some folks think it is criminal for the oppressed to want to slaughter those who terrorize them, rob them of their labor, work them to death, rape their wives and daughters, sell their children off like cattle, etc. It is their duty. It is generally garbage, but even in garbage you can find a few gems. And those gems for me were his shoutin out some real historians I am familiar and who I know don't write any rubbish.\\"At the conclusion of this meeting, he insisted that everyone present contribute twelve and a half cent in order \\"to pay that black man's wages to his mistress.\\" AuthorIs this a direct quote and what is the source? Or is the author using quotation marks for emphasis. I can't imagine a black man using the wording. Isn't it obvious that the man is black. Why the need to say \\"black man.\\" This is why I doubt this is a direct quote made by black man in reference to another black man.\\"In both the old world and the New, the records of slave revolts are a testimony to the courage of human beings, but they also are evidence of the human unwillingness to accept the laws of probability?\\" AuthorThis is rubbish. Let me remind the author the only way the white slave owning class knew about the slave revolt is because a house slave ran to his master to report it. Therefore, the probability that the revolt would have happened had it not been for this man is 100%. The author contradicts his own story. Also, may I remind the author of little island called Haiti. Every slave rebellion except that of Nat Turner was spoiled by a slave telling his owner about what was happening. I figure what gets them is that these Africans generally out smarted them and they only had information through another black, not their own intelligence, which the author said several times clearly in his own words. When it was first reported, the tattler's owner did not even believe him. So this is wishful thinking on the part of the author.I do not recommend this book. If you must read it, check it out at the library. Don't waste your money on it."},{"Title":"The House On Hackman's Hill","review":"The House on Hackmans Hill by Joan Lowery Nixon is about these two kids who want to find this mummy so they can get the $10,000 reward but they face one problem they are stuck in the house.

My teacher read it to my class in school. It made me shiver and gasp. At the house on Hackman's Hill, you never know what surprises come next.It all started as an innocent hunt for a contest. The prize:10 grand. The two innocent kids: Debbie and Jack. They were trying to find mummy that was worth quite a bundle. How were they to know that their own neighbor, Mr.Carlson, had actually lived there. Mr. Carlson told them the horrific story of what happened when he was just a boy living their. He told about the mummy's curse and the many secrets that house held.After hearing that invigorating story, the two kids went over to the house to search for the mummy. They put aside the fact that even adults avoided the house. They packed sandwiches, a camera, and flashlights. After about 5 hours there, a storm came. They were trapped inside the terrible house...This book kept me on the edge of my seat while my teacher was reading it to me. I loved every page of the book. There were no bad parts in the book at all. The author was brilliant to think of such an idea.I would recommend this book for children 10-18. It is so scary it might frighten kids under the age of 10. Actually I recommend this book for ages 10 and up. Everyone would enjoy it.

You follow the story of a 2 kids who get stuck in the ruins of a haunted - cursed - mansion during a fierce storm. You intertwine that with the story of a now-elderly man telling the story of the mansion that he had to reside in when his mother worked at the mansion - and the story of his being hauntedby creatures wanting the return of property stolen from them by the evil professor who owned the mansion, and employed the mother.A great read, very descriptive of the mansion and environment, though a bit biased towards American culture. I found myself thinking at the end that didn't the creatures have a right to keep their jewels and such?"},{"Title":"The House On Hackman's Hill","review":"I first read this book when I was 10 years old and fell in love with it instantly. I probably read it 20 times over a few year span, constantly checking it out of the public library every time I went. The story gets under your skin and stays there. For years I jumped at shadows and nervously walked alone in the dark as images of Anubis stalking through the empty foyer searching for his \\"eyes\\" crept through my mind. Despite the level of fear the story bestowed on me, I kept coming back for more, reading and re-reading the story. The House on Hackman's Hill instilled a deep and abiding love of terror, fear, and the adrenaline rush of a good scare in me that abides to this day. I highly recommend this book to young adults looking for something beyond the superficial horror books that are popular today. This books is a wonderful intermediary between light horror, and the more substantial works of H.P. Lovecraft or the pulp classics.

Once they get there it starts snowing and are stuck there for the night because of a huge blizzard that just came through. Also the spirit of the god of the dead, Anubis, is watching them.The book in its entirety was outstanding, very balanced in the themes. It kept me going, I really never wanted to put the book down. The story was very good from the beginning; I was immediately engaged in it. My favorite part is when Jeff and Debbie are in Mr. Karsten's old room and Anubis is looking for them and the gold eye. The only part I didn't like was when they were stuck in the study during the storm. It was the dull boring part of the book because nothing that significant happened. Besides the small things like that scene were all really very good.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and horror at the same time. It always seems to keep you guessing what going to happen next. Would they get out of the house, could they find the mummy? It also has a comical twist in it, just because Jeff is such a goof ball and does stupid stuff. You always think about what is going to happen next. If you are into old civilizations like egypt I would definetly recommend this book to you because it is one of its main themes. The author Joan Lowery Nixon puts you into the characters because they're very similar to a lot of people their age."},{"Title":"The House On Hackman's Hill","review":"House on Hackman's hill is about two cousins, Jeff and Debbie.

I give this book five stars; it's really good.This book is about two kids named Jeff and Debbie who go visit their grandparents. When they arrived they discovered this freaky, but interesting house. They wanted to know more about the creepy big house, so they asked the oldest guy in town, Mr. Karsten, who just so happened to live across the street. So he tells them about the house and how there's a mummy hidden somewhere beneath it. They then, became very enthusiastic about going to the house and searching for the mummy. When they get there though, they regret every step they took in that house. Something was in there, watching them, and following them everywhere at all times. Who could it be though? Of course, the weird figure. That strange figure had a body of a human and a head of a jackal. It was Anibus. Can the kids escape his evil wrath? Read and find out.

Then you should read The House on Hackman's Hill by Joan Lowery Nixon.This fiction book is about two cousins, Jeff and Debbie, who are looking for a little adventure and are bound to find the mummy that many people have been trying to find for many years. They can't escape the terrible curse, they are stuck in the mansion because of the horrible snowstorm, and there is no turning back until they solve the mystery on Hackman's Hill.What I like about this book is taht you never want to put it down. Like most books you may be able to predict what is going to happen, but not in this book. And it only has 126 pages. Scholastic published a good book.The autor may be familiar to some more than others. But Joan Lowery Nixon is an author that writes mainly mysterious books. She has many series out, which include: Orphan Train Adventures, Hollywood Daughter, Disney Adventures Case Buters and many more series. Nixon also has many, many novels out. Many of them are mysteries. She has won some awards for her writing, including being the only four-tijme winner of the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe Award and a two-time winner of the California Young Reader Medal.I would give theis book 3 stars out of five for the great adventure and mystery.

I KNOW the PUBLISHERS should RE-PRINT this book because they are depriving the young children today of the one book they will always remember along with great memories with the person who reads it to them. The story line is not only scary but it's so easy for young children to follow and still just as great and scary for older children too. This book would definately bring back story time and your child will certainly enjoy it more than their favorite nighttime t.v. show. The books price while in print was about $4.00.

No other publisher can comparewith the quality of their Bibles, not even Oxford. This editionof the NRSV is elegant. It feels good and has a fairly goodprint size. The NRSV has become the standard translation formany churches and scholars around the world. It is an excellenttranslation, but like all translations has some weaknesses. Donot let the criticism of others deter you fromchoosing this Bible. Again, all translations have weaknesses,but the NRSV gets an A- from me, while the RSV gets an A+. Ifthe NRSV is your translation of choice (and it frequently is forme) then buy this Bible."},{"Title":"NRSV Reference Edition with Apocrypha Black calfskin leather NRA27","review":"What good is there in having a Bible unless it is one you will read? In an attempt to find a Bible that had large enough print, easy to understand verbage, a translation that did not continue the errors of the King James Version, and contained the Apocrypha (why it has been removed from mainline versions is beyond my understanding), in a geniune leather binding was like searching for the Holy Grail. Until I saw this Bible. It is the most beautifully presented volume of the Holy Writ I have seen in a long time. Even the cover has become as an old friend beckoning me to pick it up and to read it. It is bound so well that it will provide decades of service. The leather has a rich feel to it and is leather of the highest quality. The paper is not India but has the same feel and quality to it. There is not any \\"bleed through\\" from my Bible highlighters. The chapter headings are accurate and the traditional verse numbering does not distract from the contextual flow. The only drawback is the attempt of the editors to make it non-gender specific. Some of the verses one has memorized from the KJV seem almost sacriledge now that the gender has been sterilzed. All-in-all I shall treasure this Bible as my favorite study/reference Bible for many years to come."},{"Title":"NRSV Reference Edition with Apocrypha Black calfskin leather NRA27","review":"This is a beautiful Bible. It's just a few things short of being perfect; the pages seem to be slightly offset (the page edges on the right side don't look as straight as they could be), one of the ribbons is fraying slightly (easily fixable). Another thing I was disappointed in was the box that it came in; it didn't come in Cambridge's &quot;A Cambridge Bible&quot; double slipcase like pictured, but a gray case with a red ribbon-like pattern on it.

They do a sensational job with the basics of production.However, with that said, I just wish they would choose a more conservative translation of the bible. The NRSV leaves much to be desired as a bible translation. The press for &quot;gender equity in translation&quot; [a dubious goal at best] caused these revisors to botch several essential messianic prophecies. With that said, I could still preach the gospel from an NRSV, I would simply have to avoid certain texts.Yet there is no reason to compromise in this English speaking world. We have many other better translations, such as the NASB, the NKJV, and the NIV. There are many lovely bibles made in these translations.

It is well documented and does not show the bias of many previous church historians. The book is not only a history but explains how the Anabaptist view of the church differed from the other Protestant reformers and its influence on modern church life. A good concise view of historical Anabaptist beliefs."},{"Title":"The Anabaptist View of the Church (Dissent and Nonconformity)","review":"This book and the first edition of George Williams,'The Radical Reformation (3rd ed)had a greater impact on me than any book except the Bible. I came across these two books in the library stacks during my student years and they changed my life.In its original form, this was the PhD thesis that Littell wrote at Yale under Bainton. He later became known as an authority on the holocaust but this early work had an important influence on Anabaptist studies, especially by scholars outside the subculture.One of Littell's most valuable insights was to document the significant and at that time, largely unappreciated, contribution of the Anabaptist movement to the American evangelical church."},{"Title":"The Anabaptist View of the Church (Dissent and Nonconformity)","review":"While the title sounds like it is devoted to Anabaptist ecclesiology, it is more of a generalized overview and defense of Anabaptism in light of four centuries of poor scholarship and missing primary sources. As with other favorable writings about the Anabaptists, the author Frank Littell walks us through the three main groups of Anabaptists and does a convincing job of showing that the \\"mainstream\\" Anabaptists like the Mennonites, Brethren, Amish and Hutterites are the real representatives of Anabaptism, not the anti-trinitarians or the radical revolutionaries. Those movements by and large died out but the majority of Anabaptists (and those more properly called by that name) still survive and thrive today and played an important, if misunderstood and misrepresented, role in the Reformation period and the formation of evangelicalism.Littell lays out the scope of Anabaptist thought regarding the church and it is unlike what you normally think of having grown up in America and our symbiotic church-society culture. In a day and age when perceived persecution against Christians (which is rarely more than a minor inconvenience) and the thinnest excuse for community suffices, the Anabaptist idea of Gemeinschaft (c0mmunity) and the theology of suffering is jarring. Where we often hear patriotism and Christianity blurred together, the Anabaptists insisted on a complete separation from the state and from worldliness in general. Where we tout our theories of \\"just war\\", the Anabaptists preached and practiced non-resistance. This stance of non-resistance and refusal to take up the sword made them easy prey for Protestant, pagan and Roman Catholics alike but that was accepted as part of what it means to follow Christ.First and foremost, the Anabaptist view of the church was one that rejected the compulsory nature of 16th century Christianity and demanded a free and voluntary church coupled with a strenuous and serious church discipline. In the magisterial Reformation, one form of church-state was replaced with a different form. By rejecting this, the Anabaptists made themselves enemies of both the state and the religious establishment and paid a terrible price for it. Refusal to baptize infants led to criminal charges, baptizing adults who had been \\"baptized\\" as infants led to martyring by drowning. The early Anabaptists exhibited an earnestness and devotion that is commendable and sorely lacking today.All in all an excellent book for students of the Anabaptists and the Reformation alike. The Anabaptist view of the church is highly challenging to Western Christians and it should be. There are some flaws. Littell often intersperses German quotes as if the reader can translate them with ease. He also throws quotes in with little to distinguish them, so sometimes I was unsure whether what I was reading was a quotation or his writing. He also was somewhat repetitive in places and was perhaps less critical in others where he should have been. Given the unbalanced nature of most Christian scholarship on the Anabaptists in the last four hundred years, I think I can forgive him for his zeal to set the record straight or at least give it some balance. I would commend The Anabaptist View of the Church to anyone interested in Anabaptists, the Reformation, the church and our faith in Christ."},{"Title":"The Forsaken Flower","review":"I am a avid reader and love all types of novels.

The matches to the date type are as accurate as they are hysterical. Having made several of the dishes in here, I can tell you that the recipes are not super complicated or missing steps/ingrediesnts (a la Marth Stewart). I hope to hell they do a series of these of these cookbooks."},{"Title":"Cooking to Hook Up: The Bachelor's Date-Night Cookbook (Cookbooks)","review":"The publicity for this book quickly intones the phrase \\"It's A Fact: Cooking is dead sexy.\\" And the whole idea of this cooking guide is how to use food to land that dream lady.Authors Michaels and Campbell, formerly husband and wife, decided after being married for a few years that they worked better as a couple of friends rather than being married. So they divorced and wrote what is essentially a workbook for the dating scene.The book is divided into three distinct sections: Preparing to cook for a date, what to cook for a variety of \\"girls\\" (the girl next door, the party girl, the gourmet girl, etc), and finally, what to cook for breakfast should the male this book is aimed at \\"get lucky\\" (their words, not mine).Each of the Girl sections gives an overview of the type of girl being talked about, followed by several recipes for the perfect date, and a chronology of what needs to be done when, from shopping to preparation to cooking. It also offers up suggestions on what to have lying around on the coffee table, what kind of drinks to serve, and so forth.Most of all, it is the wit and whimsy that is woven throughout the book that makes it special. Although it IS a serious guide for the hapless male in the dating pool, the humor in each chapter is evident, and the tone throughout the book is somewhat tongue in cheek.Still, the recipes are worth having for the most part, and the other tips help you along in your quest to land the perfect \\"girl\\". Clearly, author Campbell probably didn't follow his own advice; if he did, he and Michaels would probably still be married. But it's a fun romp and a decidedly different way to approach having fun and success while cooking, and would make an amusing and fun addition to any cookbook library."},{"Title":"Cooking to Hook Up: The Bachelor's Date-Night Cookbook (Cookbooks)","review":"Here's a not-so-secret secret: men are linear.

I didn't realize that two hours had passed and that I had read through half the book standing up until my back started killing me. I lost all sense of what was going on around me. This is an amazing book, not just for the descriptive details of characters while writing a novel, which I am doing. And that is the REAL reason I would purchase this book for all of my family and friends. This book is great not just for characterization of the different kinds of women, but for the recipes as well.I don't need to have many books. I read them while I'm there. I want this book. I must have this book. I read the whole book already, and I must have this book for reference. I have yet to read a book as hilarious, as accurately descriptive of the potential pitfalls, and as applicable to the mind-numbing dilemma of preparing a meal for a potential love interest that you don't know that well, yet.I couldn't stop laughing when I got to the \\"Gourmet Girl\\" description. The authors DEFINITELY know what they are talking about. The only guys who have ever impressed me with their culinary skills were the chefs at Le Cordon Bleu and the guys I competed next to at the culinary competition.P.S. Guys, after reading this book, if you happen to be in love with a Gourmet Girl, you may now be justifiably terrified at how slim your chances are to impress her with dinner. Do exactly as the authors instruct you to do, and make reservations for an expensive (and preferably Michelin starred) restaurant. It would be even better for you if you could take her to Lucas Carton or La Tour D'Argent. Yes, they are located in Paris. Yes, she is expensive to impress. Take her to a vineyard, study up on wines, talk to her about them. Make these things happen, and she'll be yours forever. I promise. AFTER you have done that, buy yourself a copy of Larousse Gastronomique, and the Oxford Companion to Food. Being able to quote things from the Oxford Companion to Wine will also amaze her. The fact that you went to so much trouble to impress her will ALSO impress her.If you're short on cash, and still want to impress your Gourmet Girl, grab Dornenburg and Page's Culinary Artistry, which will help you to score major points.(Incidentally, the description of the Gourmet Guy at the end of the chapter had me hoping that he'd be listed in the section under resources. I want to meet that man with the edible landscaping!)I just hope they write a sequel (Cooking to Hook Up for Ladies) because I thoroughly enjoyed this!"},{"Title":"Cooking to Hook Up: The Bachelor's Date-Night Cookbook (Cookbooks)","review":"I just recently purchased this book as a gift for my younger brother who is with a very bad-for-him type girl.

As I told my brother, this book is yours, but I reserve the right to steal it back from time time.Each little chapter covers an entire date from beginning to end, including an easy meal to impress her, and sure to inform you on what is important, and helping you get those all so important little details just right. Very easy to read, doesn't drag on, and provides just enough info to have a great night without so much to think your learning something.

I found this to be very different from all the other viking stories I have read because Dag cared for Fiona right from the start and was a very sweet and sensual man. I found this to be a refreshing change of pace compared to the lusty, domineering barbarians I usually read about. This book is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Storm Maiden","review":"Mary Gillgannon has written a very stirring tale of passion and love in &quot;The Storm Maiden&quot;. She has narrated the feelings from both the protagonists' points of view and have thus effectively conveyed the feelings one harboured for another. Their love has progressed vividly from bedmates to soulmates which makes a very gratifying reading experience.There is enough intrigue, mistrust, false fear of magic which sustains the story. The tempo is quick enough to maintain the interest of the readers. I like this book very much."},{"Title":"Storm Maiden","review":"Gillgannon knows how to develop a story and maintain it without the reader ever losing interest. Fiona &amp; Dag are characters you will remember long after you've read the last page and placed this book on your &quot;keepers&quot; shelf. They have a wonderful chemistry and a genuine love story."},{"Title":"Storm Maiden","review":"Before I read this book, I thought it would be the typical Viking kidnapping tale. Boy, was I wrong. Unlike the previous reviewer, I didn't think the story was predictable. All that trouble was what kept the reader on their toes. Also, I liked the fact that Dag and Fiona couldn't speak to each other. They had to talk to each other in new ways, which frankly made the story one of the most sensual I have ever read! On a personal note, I am glad that when the lovers finally came together, the &quot;maiden&quot; wasn't shy and timid. She wanted it as much as he did and was an aggressor just as much as he was. To me, that is more realistic and fun. If you like this novel, you should also try Catherine Coulter's &quot;Lord of Hawkfell Island.&quot;"},{"Title":"Storm Maiden","review":"I love anything to do with Viking, Irish or highland history.

Very well written and flowed well. It gave people a vision of what Viking life must have been like for the Vikings and their thrawls. It was especially interesting because it dealt with the Irish princess Fiona, becoming a thrawl (slave) to Dag the Viking.This was a sensual book, but also dealt with a deep love that developed between the two characters.My only objection to this book was the formatting. There should have been skipped places, notifying us of a change of scene.

It was wonderful."},{"Title":"Storm Maiden","review":"Started out great and went along fast paced until the arrival in Viking Territory. Then it went downhill. The plot seemed contrived and I knew what was going to happen before it happened. After awhile I got tired of it and felt like tossing the book.How many times can one person be saved from certain death? I mean, come on already. Some of the plot and scenes were too far fetched even for me. More than halfway through the book, neither one can speak the other's language, so there is no worthwhile dialog between the main characters, just an interpeter. They fall in love too quickly and the heroine, Fiona, is too quick to make major life changing decisions.The villain is very typical. All in all, I hate to say, I was unimpressed with this at-first promising book.The daughter of an Irish chieftian has found a way of keeping out of a marriage she does not want. Her decision(this is what I mean about life changing and too quick) is to let the Viking prisoner in her father's dungeon ravish her. Ruined, she will be unacceptable for marriage. But when the Viking refuses her, she is desperate.Delirious with fever and festering wound, Dag Thorsson thinks the woman coming to seduce him is a dreaded fairy. He must resist her charms. But after he resists he realizes she is human. Escaping his imprisonment unexpectedly, Dag captures the beautiful princess and takes her with him home.Suddenly trapped in a rugged land with nowhere to go, Fiona becomes desperate to escape.

Because Mr. Rogers Neighborhood aired on my local PBS station, I had the privilege of growing up with Mr. Rogers and his puppet incarnations (King Friday, X the Owl, Henrietta Pussycat, Lady Elaine, etc.) that lived in the Neighborhood of Make Believe. Visiting with other neighbors like Mr. McFeely (named after Mr. Rogers Grandfather), Chef Brockett, Lady Aberlin, Bob Dog, and Purple Panda was also a treat. Interestingly, my first husband (deceased) used to take trumpet lessons at Negri's Music Store (Handy Man Negri)!Decades later, I still enjoy Mr. Rogers Neighborhood--now in re-runs on PBS Kids. (My 6 year old son loves it, too.) Despite his passing over 2 years ago, Fred Rogers' generous spirit and legacy live on.Mr. Rogers' unconditional acceptance has comforted and affirmed children on the deepest levels. He never talked down to his audience, and wasn't afraid to tackle difficult topics that aren't even *touched* by children's programs nowadays. Rogers unflinchingly examined painful emotions, and gave practical, gentle wisdom on how to deal with them. He assured us all that we were special-and that no one could take our place. Often spotlighting the differently-abled, his curiosity and interest showed us that those who we might think are \\"different\\" from us are really the same, sharing--at core--similar emotions, fears, setbacks and triumphs.I picked up Life's Journeys According to Mr. Rogers in the book store, and began to tear up when I read one of the passages. I knew I had to buy it--and so I did. My husband made the comment yesterday \\"Mr. Rogers is like a spiritual practice for you.\\"And he's right, really.What surprised me about this book is the spiritual depth of Fred Rogers. Sure, I knew he was kind, compassionate, insightful, and curious-but I didn't realize just how deep his understanding of the human condition and of Spirit flowed.A few gems from this book:\\"Every human being has value. This is the basis of all healthy relationships. Through living each day as it is given to me, I've learned that. It cannot be \`taught', but it can be \`caught' from those who live their lives right along with us. What a privilege to be able to look for the good in our neighbor!\\"\\"There are times when explanations, no matter how reasonable, just don't seem to help.\\"\\"The outside things of life certainly do change and often quickly, but the inside things remain. Our parents and their parents and their parents-all of us-were created by Love. Love with a capital L. And we spend our lives trying to recognize that we truly *are* lovable and capable of loving.\\"\\"We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are.\\"\\"What's been important in my understanding of myself and others is the fact that each one of us is so much more than any one thing. A sick child is much more than his or her sickness. A personal with a disability is much, much more than a handicap. A pediatrician is more than a medical doctor. You're *much* more than your job description or your age or your income or your output.\\"The profound wisdom of Fred Rogers resounds through this gem of a book, reminding young and old alike Who we are, and what we're capable of when someone believes in us.Thank you, Mr. Rogers, for believing in us."},{"Title":"Life's Journeys According to Mister Rogers: Things to Remember Along the Way","review":"My children (three sons) grew up watching Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood on public t.v Now, my cat Star enjoys watching the reruns. Alas, our beloved Mr. Rogers could not live forever, but he left behind (thanks to his wife Joanne) some of his plain-spoken wisdom. Here are just a few which spoke to me:\\"The media shows the tiniest percentage of what people do. There are millions and millions of people doing wonderful things all over the world, and they're generally not the ones being touted in the news.\\"\\"The greatest loss that we all have to deal with is the loss of the image of ourselves as a perfect person.\\"Each person in the world is a unique human being, and each has unique potential. One of the important tasks of growing is the discovery of this uniqueness: the discovery of \\"who I am\\" in each of us -- of \\"who I am\\" in relation to all those whom I meet. \\"It's really easy to fall into the trap of believing that what we do is more important than what we are. Of course, it's the opposite that's true. What we are ultimately determines what we do!\\"\\"We don't always succeed in what we try -- certainly not by the world's standards -- but I think it's the willingness to keep trying that matters most.\\" No matter what our age, no matter what our condition, life's disappointments show us the limits of what we're able to do. But, of course, in dealing with them, we just might create a new forward striving. \\"You are a very special person. There is only one like you in the whole world. There's never been anyone exactly like you before, and there never will be again. Only you. And people can like you exactly as you are.\\"This little book is filled with all of the sayings we heard him explain to us on his show. The trolley is on the cover to remind us of all his wonderful characters. He is sorely missed, but this book (the young librarian said \\"this is wonderful\\" as she checked it out for me along with five other books) will let young children who did not get to see him 'live' still learn from his vast amount of knowledge. Thanks to you, Fred Rogers, for letting us go on part of your journey and for the things to remember along the way. Thanks, Joanne, for assembling them as your special gift to a special person.

Looking back, I think at the time I was too old and not old enough. His program appeals to a younger crowd than I was at the time, though his message is truly understood by an older, more wiser crowd.Now, two children later, I really \\"get\\" him. I was intrigued by this book when I first saw it at our local yoga studio after having watched Mr. Rogers some time ago again with my daughter and really being wowed by his message. What he said in that program, I cannot remember. But it was simple and profound whatever it was and my daughter \\"got it\\", too.And so is this book - simple and profound. He provides reflections on life such as, \\"There is a part of all of us that longs to know that even what's weakest about us is still redeemable and can ultimately count for something good.\\" He also presents a stong message of being OK with how you are, right now. He urges us to accept ourselves as we are and realize that we all have a gift to give to the world.I have given the book to some parent-friends of mine, though non-parents will find his message hopeful and accepting as well."},{"Title":"Life's Journeys According to Mister Rogers: Things to Remember Along the Way","review":"For some reason, I wasn't all that big a fan of Fred Rogerswhen I was younger . . . it's not that I disliked the guy;I just never watched him (nor did my daughter).However, it seems that since he died in 2003, I have takenmore of an interest in his work . . .

The book is a collection of some of his insights on the world and the people around us. I truly believe that he had a gift to see through the smoke and fog to get at the heart of the emotion. Like Charles Schultz and Bill Cosby, Fred Rogers had the gift, but unlike Charles and Bill who mostly spoke to adults about being a child, Fred spoke to children about being children. He used the wisdom learned from experience (just plan living life) to inform and to educate but mostly nurture the child. This book I believe is meant for us adults that need guidance but want it simple and easy to digest.

As the title indicates, Mister Rogers shares 150 pages of his personal insights and anecdotes just the way you'd expect him to if you were watching the neighborhood on TV. One of our favorite pages addresses a Fred Rogers mantra about the uniqueness of every single human being. \\"You are a very special person,\\" he writes. \\"There is only one like you in the whole world. There's never been anyone exactly like you before, and there never will be again. Only you. And people can like you exactly as you are.\\"Kids of all ages responded to this gentle man, because we all sensed his deep kindness. A personal connection with Fred Rogers is appropriate here: when our daughter Amanda was 3 her grandmother died, and, in her grief she wrote to her hero, Mister Rogers. a few weeks later Amanda received a personal letter from Fred Rogers comforting her in her time of loss.

Just neat thoughts from a great person."},{"Title":"Life's Journeys According to Mister Rogers: Things to Remember Along the Way","review":"I have been gripped recently, nearly 5 years after his death, with a wave of Mr. Rogers nostalgia. After reading Tim Madigan's wonderful \\"I'm Proud of You,\\" about his friendship with Fred Rogers, I wanted more. It seems that this 1-CD tribute would do the trick, slaking my thirst for words of wisdom from this warm, sweet man, while perhaps not overdoing it. I was disappointed. The CD consists of a series of short snippets gathered from Fred's writings, read by Lily Tomlin and others. This sounds like a wonderful way to pay tribute to the man, but comes off wrong. Fred had a way of making even the most treacly saying seem profound. Then there was his stance of complete acceptance, non-judgment and kindness that made his words seem salving and utterly non-threatening. In the voices of others, these sayings lose their power and become simply \\"nice,\\" and even trite.The best parts of the CD were where Fred himself appeared, in recordings of music from his shows (\\"I'm Proud of You, \\"I'm Still Myself Inside\\") and in his words to the graduating class of his alma mater, Latrobe University. Here, in extended segments, Fred's warmth and humanity had time to take root.Beautiful as the sentiment may have seemed to the participants, the essence of Fred Rogers cannot be removed from his slow, gentle delivery or his meek and inviting persona. I would NOT recommend this product for anyone who wants to experience the extraordinary person who was Fred Rogers. Madigan's book helps, but as for me, I am still seeking a relatively short volume or CD that lets me experience the affirming and healing grace of God that was Mr. Fred Rogers."},{"Title":"Life's Journeys According to Mister Rogers: Things to Remember Along the Way","review":"Last month for the Red Head reading over my shoulder...the Gift came from another, Bright Redhead brunettie!

World War II was over and the nation was enjoying a time of great peace and prosperity. In the late 1940's, most super hero comics faded from view due to changing tastes. Furthermore, the crusades against comics in the 1950's and the resulting creation of the comics code authority meant stronger restrictions on comics causing many companies to close up shop, notably EC Comics. One character who managed to survive not only the changing tastes but the comics code authority was, of course, Archie Andrews. But even Archie was affected by the new code, believe it or not. There's a rather funny anecdote in the introduction to this volume about how the staff had make sure all scenes of cleavage were covered up. It still didn't stop them from drawing Betty and Veronica very well-endowed however.This volume moves Archie into perhaps the era that Archie is most associated with, especially by early baby-boomers; the era when Rock-n-Roll first made its influence known on Archie and the gang...the era of sock hops, malt shops and cruising. This trade paperback highlights the entire Archie gang in a collection of hilarious and nostalgic stories, brimming with 1950's allure. Here are a few of my favorite stories from this volume:\\"Winner Lose\\" Archie Comics #64 1953. Archie buys a beat-up boat to compete with Reggie in a big race. Veronica promises all of her boat dates to the winner. Archie comes out the victor but when Jughead crashes the boat, Archie finds he's won the battle but lost the war.\\"Safe at Home\\" Archie Comics #64, 1953. Archie visits Veronica while Mr. Lodge is hosting several potential investors for a new venture. Archie thinks the men are planning to rob the Lodge safe and calls the police. Mr. Lodge is NOT amused!\\"Skip, Hop & Thump\\" Laugh #75, 1956. The first sock hop in Riverdale as Archie explains the concept of the sock hop to Betty & Veronica. The pair compete over the boy's socks but when they can't get into the sock hop, they have a rude welcome waiting for Archie.\\"Going, Going, Gown\\" Laugh #80, 1957. Veronica is bragging about her expensive new gown from Paris that she intends to wear to the big dance. She then finds out that Betty is going to wear an exact copy of the dress that she bought locally. Mr. Lodge gives Betty $50 to buy a new dress. When Veronica shows up at the dance to impress Archie, he is not there. He and Betty are out spending Mr. Lodge's money!\\"Wheels of Progress\\" Laugh #98, 1958. Archie is embarrassed when his aunt gives him a pair of roller skates for his birthday. Betty and Veronica offer to teach him how to skate but he is reluctant...until he gets a look at the blonde bombshell skating instructor!\\"Like Real Gone\\" Laugh #104 1959. In a bit of an end of the era type story, Archie and Jughead bid goodbye to the 1950's by acting like beatniks replete with all the beatnik jargon.\\"TNT Hee\\" Archie #106, 1959. Mr. Weatherbee thinks that Jughead has invented a powerful new explosive formula in the chemistry lab. He's so excited that he contacts Washington. But it turns out that Jughead was just trying to make nail polish for Veronica.In addition to the wonderful stories there are great pages re-printing many of the classic covers from the 1950's. It's a treat to look back at these fifty year-old stories and see how the characters and fashions changed with the times. A real treasure trove for Archie fans.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 2: Best Of The Fifties Book 1","review":"&quot;Archie Americana: Best of the 1950's,&quot; is composed of story highlights from the years 1953-1959. Spanning 96 pages, readers will effortlessly breeze through the dozen or so stories basking in the home-spun charm that fans have come to appreciate over the decades. Personally, I feel that the artwork of 'Archie' comics was at it's apex in the 1950's thanks to its great attention to detail and for the fact that character design seemed to have been etched in stone from this point on. While this book will entertain, its true value is in providing historical reference to the serious reader of this series."},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 2: Best Of The Fifties Book 1","review":"This is one of my favorites from the collection.

Arrived perfectly, quickly and eventhough it is a second hand book, it looks as new."},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 2: Best Of The Fifties Book 1","review":"It was fun to see that we had Riverdale fifty years ago and reassuring to see that so little has changed between then and now. Good-hearted doofus Archie, his nonconforming best friend Jughead, all-American Betty, foxy Veronica and self-serving Reggie are here in detail, and under colorist Bob Montana's steady pen appeared very much then as they do now. The fashions have changed, but anyone with any Archie experience will at once notice Archie's gridmarked red hair, Jughead's \\"crown\\" beanie, and all the characters' googly white eyes and heavy eyebrows.While there is some topical satire in the book (a take on Elvis Presley is especially delightful), what matters most is that the same kind of predicaments that came up in the ongoing comic books (and in THE ARCHIE SHOW in the late 1960s and 1970s) are still in place today. Archie is still struggling to grow up and out of his adolescent clumsiness, and his inability to choose between Betty and Veronica as a girlfriend, rang true back then too. Which girl will go to the dance with him? Can Jughead be counted on to run interference? These are the type of topics that amuse and have not aged.Even at a discount this memoir is pretty pricey for modern times, especially considering that its page count (96pp.) is the equivalent of only four dime \\"floppies\\" of 24 pp. apiece at Fifties prices. Happily, the cartoons are on a decent matte paper, not cheap newsprint. The slick paper of the graphic novels might have been even better, but then we can't expect total perfection. The main thing is, the reader will be entertained, diverted, and (possibly) enlightened -- or at least up to speed on poor Archie's classic attempts to do the right thing in spite of a pretty clumsy track record. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 2: Best Of The Fifties Book 1","review":"I loved \\"Archie\\" comics as a kid, reading them in the '60s and early '70s, as well as reprints of early comics from the '50s.

All of the other books that I have reviewed, I have had to \\"talk down\\" to the lay-reader and try to explain in common sense terms why the book is good or bad. Now with this book (overpriced as it is), I finally can write a real scientific review. This book is very good, for what it is---the 5HT-2A signal transduction pathway. Yes, this is probably the main pathway that causes depression (besides HPA axis disregulation, although the 2A pathway is involved with HPA anyway). And it's also the main pathway that helps a person taking SSRI's overcome depression.It explains that the 2A pathway shunts over to the noradrenaline (NA) pathway, thus providing energy and neuronal remodeling and dendrite regrowth. This is a discovery that had previously stumped researchers, because they realized that the 5HT and NA pathways must be interconnected, but they didn't know how they were. However, I think that this book brings to light an even more interesting discovery---patients with severe, suicidal depression have elevated intracellular calcium levels. Not only does the 2A pathway shunt over to the NA pathway, it also funnels into the \\"calcium\\" pathway, a complex and often redundant pathway that controls many different cellular functions, including muscle contraction. I believe that somehow the calcium pathway becomes dominant over the NA shunt, and (again, besides HPA axis disregulation) that's why patients become depressed. And certain calcium channel blockers (ex. Nimodopine) can act as antidepressants! Much more research is needed into the calcium field of brain research. The calcium pathway may also be involved in SSRI side effects, since this pathway may be stimulated in some patients, making things potentially worse, or possibly explaining why these patients are treatment-resistant. I have a chapter on this phenomenon in my book, if you care to read about it."},{"Title":"You Don't Always Need a Lawyer: How to Resolve Your Legal Disputes Without Costly Litigation","review":"This is a fine book It covers arbitration, etc. intelligently, yet understandably.

At the heart of the book is a paradox: you can make money out of your own ignorance and that ignorance can even protect you from investment mistakes and manias. Particularly interesting is Melton's system of protecting against your own and most advisors' ignorance by using his world equity market asset allocation model. He strongly advises against overweighting your investments in your home market, the one usually favored by home country financial advisors. According to Melton professionals and amateurs are basically ignorant in predicting market movements and who can argue with this given the shocks of the last three years? Spending too much time analyzing world markets doesn't necessarily make one a more successful investor. Overweighting any one market in your portfolio is dangerous. After arguing that equities are the best long-term investment, Melton claims that keeping to a disciplined regional (North America/Europe/Asia/Emerging Markets)asset allocation ratio and a disciplined country allocation ratio within these regions actually lowers the overall risk of a portfolio and disciplines investors not to overweight positions in their portfolios. Melton provides historical examples of the diversity from year to year of single country and regional stock market returns.Does Melton's method work? Well, it has done for me. I set up a small mutual fund portfolio based on the Melton Model using about 15 country funds (Melton would recommend about 25 but my finances didn't stretch that far). The returns have been good in areas I would never have considered before reading this book (Australia, for example)and in areas we are now often being told to steer clear of (the U.S.A., for example). Left to my own devices I would have probably avoided investing in those countries but because of Melton's disciplined asset allocation approach I resisted short term psychological caveats and the market analysis of the business community and went ahead having faith in Melton's paradoxical view that you can exploit your own ignorance to invest successfully while at the same time avoiding the madness of crowds (and the investment community), by investing in a disciplined manner.I intend to remain a disciplined investor and this book has set me on the right path."},{"Title":"Dante: The Divine Comedy (Landmarks of World Literature)","review":"This printing of this classic work seems to be over abridged. As someone who has read other versions, this work seems to be a good starting point for getting into the heavy work. Yet, it is little better than a more indepth Cliff Note."},{"Title":"The Assault","review":"Hopefully the successful audience response to the film of Arenas' &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; will encourage readers to explore the unique and vastly enriching glimpses of Castro's (or any dictator's for that matter) Cuba. The author's style is indelibly his own, reporting and commenting on the conditions of political supression, whether he elects to satirize in the first person/s as in &quot;Color of Summer&quot; with its over the edge surreal view of contemporary Cuba, or placing the narrator from within as in &quot;The Assault&quot;. Truth, as he viewed it, is so ludicrous that it becomes black comedy, not unlike Goya's &quot;Goyescas&quot;. But for all the unsettling details of this tale of destruction of all that matters in our past, this book, once read burns a spot in our minds that makes it almost necessary to revisit it lest we forget the joy of freedom. Tough reading, but highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Assault","review":"Tells the tale of the terror of totalitarianism. People are as animals. Life is a joyless, horror.

Focusing on Monet's work during his three stays on the southern coasts of France and Italy, this exhibition catalogue showcases paintings executed under the most extreme effects of light.Grandson of Camille Pisarro and a noted art historian, Joachim Pisarro writes, &quot;Monet's decision to paint by the Mediterranean in 1884 was bound to an inner strategy: his art was a constant search for shatteringly new pictorial motifs.&quot;We are not disappointed, the lushly overgrown vegetation and brilliant sun in his landscapes provides spellbinding visual excitement.&quot;What is astonishing about Monet's work in the south is the degree of elasticity, of pictorial metamorphosis, and of technical virtuosity it required from the artist.&quot; Mr. Pisarro said. &quot;A century after these paintings were produced, their impact remains undiminished.&quot;An insightful biography and history, Monet and the Mediterranean holds 120 striking color plates."},{"Title":"Monet And The Mediterranean","review":"Claude Monet's fascination with the Mediterranean began in December 1883, when Pierre-Auguste Renoir invited him on a trip to the Riviera. En route to the sea they visited Paul C&eacute;zanne in L'Estaque. By the time they reached Monaco, their first Mediterranean stop, Monet was completely enchanted by the warm southern climate, its lush, exotic vegetation, and the extraordinary quality of light. He was to return again and again to the southern coasts of France and Italy to paint some of his most superb work.&quot;Monet And The Mediterranean&quot; unites over 100 paintings created during the course of three major trips Monet made to the Mediterranean from 1883 to 1908. The sheer beauty of the nature these works depict is breathtaking, as are the luminescent colors of his palette and dazzling light effects. The artist's use of light is frequently dramatic, as he often painted scenes at sunrise, midday and sunset.Joachim Pisarro has brilliantly communicated, through this text, his deep love for painting and art history. He has combined and provided here a biography, history, and critical interpretation that allowed me to view some of my favorite paintings as if for the first time. This volume features over 100 color plates, with introductory commentaries for each series or group of paintings. The artist's love of the region and its light is evident in his work - from olive and citrus trees in the Italian fishing village of Bordighera to the vast seas and skies of Cap Martin and Cap d'Antibes to the shadowy canals and golden Ducal Palace of Venice. The Mediterranean was, perhaps, Monet's greatest muse, providing him with a climate, light and color that possessed him with what curator Joachim Pissarro calls an &quot;ineluctable need to paint.&quot;A real treasure of a book! Makes a wonderful gift!JANA"},{"Title":"Monet And The Mediterranean","review":"Gorgeous collection of and commentary on Claude Monet's painting sorties into the Riviera regions of France and Italy in the 1880s and his several months in Venice in late 1908. The paintings in this beautifully printed book (originally a catalog for a 2000 exhibiition) are uniformly stunning in the exuberant color and Eden-like subject matter. Paintings done in Bordighera on the Italian Riviera, for example, show a semi-tropical landscape that must have been somewhat overwhelming to paint for a northerner, even an experienced landscape artist like Monet. There is saturated color in everything, starting with the sea and certainly including the lush vegetation and Mediterranean architecture and natural features. This is equally so for the landscapes done on the coast near Menton/Monte Carlo--they are truly dazzling. The paintings of Venice are unique for a place that had been painted for centuries by the world's best artists. Monet's impressionist eye found a new way to portray many familiar buildings and monuments that does justice to the subjects, but basically puts the prominent focus on light and color.What is also admirable about this fine book is the purposeful inclusion of many paintings of the same scene but at different times of the day or from slightly different angles. It provides visual insight into how Monet approached his subjects and how he famously dealt with the challenges of changing light in plein aire painting.If you have never visited the Riviera towns represented in this book, you will certainly want to do so after a look at just the cover. While these places have all become summer meccas since the 19th century, they retain most of the charm and natural allure that appealed to Monet and inspired these paintings."},{"Title":"Publishing Timeline 2000","review":"This fascinating book traces the history of publishing in a timeline from prehistory to the year 2000.

According to Lubbock,\\" The labour was atorment, a care, and a delight, as his letters and the Prefaces themselves amply show. The thinking and the writing were hard and full and critical to the point of exasperation; the purpose was high, the reference wide, and the terms of discourse had to be conceived and defined as successive need for them arose. He had to elucidate and appropriate for the critical intellect the substance and principle of his career as an artist, and he had to do this, such was the idiosyncracy of his mind-specifically, example following lucid example with the consistency of mathematicl equation, so that in the Poetics, if his premises were accepted his conclusions must be taken as inevitable.\\" p. viiBlackmur says that criticism has never been more ambitious, or more useful. He cites James' definition of his task in his preface to 'Roderick Hudson'. \\"These notes represent over a considerable course the continuity of an artist's endeavor, the growth of the whole operative consciousness, and best of all, perhaps their own tendency to multiply , with the implication, thereby of a memory enriched'.Among the prefaces included are those to 'Roderick Hudson' ' What Maisie Knew' 'The Princess Cassamissima' 'The Spoils of Poynton' 'The Altar to the Dead' 'The Tragic Muse'' The Lesson of the Master' ' The Aspern Papers' 'The Awkward Age''The Portrait of a Lady' ' The American'James famous advice to the writer about ' trying to be one upon whom nothing is lost' certainly seems to apply to himself in his effort to understand and deepen the meaning of his own work both for himself and for his readers."},{"Title":"Why Not Be a Missioner?: Young Maryknollers Tell Their Stories","review":"If you are Catholic and have ever thought of becoming a foreign missionary as a lay person or religious, I would recommend reading this book.It gave interesting and challenging personal stories of people (mostly young professionals) who have decided to serve God in some capacity with the Maryknoll missionaries in a foreign country."},{"Title":"Audels Sheet Metal Workers Handy Book","review":"Just what I needed and what I was looking for in this type of industry, the way the work used to be done.

Therefore, I would like to reccommend this book to others and correct a statement made by Mr. Doty in his review on this page. Mr. Doty objects to the sparse style, and he is entitled to that opinion. However, as his example he unfairly implies that the section on The Business Plan consists only of four sentences, when in reality that section is five pages. With that statement he denigrates the whole book.The term &quot;handbook&quot; in the title connotes brevity and lack of great detail. Clearly it was not intended to be a textbook. As a handbook, it gives what it promises.Mr. Doty would be well advised to read more carefully, and not to make misleading statements in online reviews based on a cursory perusal."},{"Title":"Business Start-up Handbook","review":"This may not be the textbook for the seasoned entrepreneur, but, for the novice considering starting a business for the first time, it is an easy-reading guide to the important issues that need to be addressed if the venture is going to be successful.

If you want to become more successful in selling or in life generally, do not read this book.Study it!"},{"Title":"Tom Hopkins' Low Profile Selling","review":"Tom Hopkins's book, How to Master the Art of Selling, is the Bible for many sales people. In that book, he outlines the 7 steps for selling: prospecting, originating contact, qualification, presentation or demonstration, handling objections, closing, and getting referrals.In Low Profile Selling, he builds on that book by focusing attention on the 4 areas that make the most positive difference in creating a higher income (originating contact, qualification, handling objections, and closing). His message is that the emotional tone you set in these four areas makes all of the difference. &quot;Act like a lamb. Sell like a lion.&quot;These observations are based on the distaste that many customers have for the usual strong-arm tactics that many salespeople use. Mr. Hopkins encourages you to use questions to do your work for you, and provides many scripts and examples of how to do this. Although I think he is on the right track conceptually, I found the material here clearly inferior to the newer book, Socratic Selling, both in terms of explaining the need for questions and in the tone of the scripts. I found the material here to still feel manipulative to me as a potential customer.In chapter three, he encourages you to build rapport. Again, this is the right concept, but the execution is clearly inferior again to any of the many good books on Neuro-Linguistic Programming. Consider &quot;How To Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less&quot; as a much better resource in this area.I graded the book down two stars for its obvious weaknesses in explaining the details in these two critical areas. Basically, I think Mr. Hopkins needs to update this book to expand and improve these two sections.Should you read this book? Yes, I think so. It will give you a good overview on the importance of connecting emotionally with the other person. Chapter 6 is excellent on the importance of the words you use to make the person you are talking to comfortable or uncomfortable. The goal setting work in chapter 10 will also be very helpful to you (although it would have worked better at the beginning of the book). I do suggest that you also read his earlier book and the two new ones I cited above that he did not write if you want to make the most improvement.After you have finished reading and applying the four books discussed above, I suggest that you also spend some time sharing these principles with someone you care about who is also involved in sales. You will improve much more by teaching this material to someone else than by just focusing on applying it yourself.Exceed all your goals quickly!"},{"Title":"Tom Hopkins' Low Profile Selling","review":"Salespeople, do not kid yourselves.
