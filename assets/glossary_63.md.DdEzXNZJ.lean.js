His 5th grade class is reading it. He loves it! Great short stories inside."},{"Title":"Zlateh the Goat and Other Stories","review":"When Shlemiel went to Warsaw and Zlateh the Goat are both collections of short stories awarded a Newbery Honor in 1969 and 1967 respectively. They were written by Isaac Bashevis Singer, a Jewish author well known for his short stories, who received the 1978 Nobel Prize in Literature.These two collections included several stories that I really enjoyed and many that I didn't much like. Several stories in each book took place in the city of Chelm and mentioned the 7 City Elders (described by the author as fools). One of the residents of that city is Shlemiel, who appears in several stories and is also, undeniably, a fool. Although I like to think I have a sense of humor, and I enjoy a good taste of the ridiculous every now and again, sometimes, it's just a little too much. The two collections contained just a few too many stories dealing with the utter foolishness of these people for me to truly enjoy the reading. To give a quick example, a short story from Zlateh the Goat entitled The Snow in Chelm begins like this:Chelm was a village of fools, fools young and old. One night someone spied the moon reflected in a barrel of water. The people of Chelm imagined it had fallen in. They sealed the barrel so that the moon would not escape. When the barrel was opened in the morning and the moon wasn't there, the villagers decided it had been stolen. They sent for the police, and when the thief couldn't be found, the fools of Chelm cried and moaned.For some, I'm sure these stories would be very enjoyable and amusing tales. However, reading story after story involving more and more absurdities became just a little too much for me. Between the two books, almost half the stories dealt in some way with the preposterous happenings of the residents of Chelm.However, I generally found the stories that did not mention Shlemiel or the Elders (and people) of Chelm to be very entertaining, and often delightful. I especially enjoyed the stories, Rabbi Leib & the Witch Cunegunde, and Shrewd Todie & Lyzer the Miser and the message of Utzel & His Daughter Poverty from Warsaw. My favorites from Zlateh were the stories Fool's Paradise, and Zlateh the Goat. These stories are all clever and well written, often with a warm moral, subtly teaching the reader ways to improve and become better without beating you over the head with the moral.For the most part, I enjoyed reading these stories. It's always nice to get a new look at a culture I know very little about. In the foreward to Warsaw, Singer mentions that while each are retold using his own language and ideas, several of the stories within came from legends and stories told by his mother and grandmother. I love the different folk tales from various cultures, so that was fun. I did enjoy reading these short stories, and am glad I picked them up."},{"Title":"Zlateh the Goat and Other Stories","review":"Singer and Sendak are an unbeatable combination. Sendak is amazing in what he can do with pen and ink (no color). I think those who are familiar with Yiddish culture would appreciate these stories more than those who are not."},{"Title":"Zlateh the Goat and Other Stories","review":"This book was so awesome. I'll give you my take on just one of the stories (Zlateh the Goat): Singer begins the story by providing a simple yet descriptive setting, so I was able to effortlessly picture it in my mind: a family stricken by poverty in a small, rural village at Hanukkah time, facing a poor harvest. Singer quickly established the father's dilemma and his pathetic solution to sell the goat. He identified the relationship of the family with each other, and their with Zlateh, the trusting goat who allowed herself to be led into the snowstorm.Singer used many adjectives in describing Aaron's journey to town, as it turned from a day of sun into a violent snowstorm. I felt as if I were experiencing the situation myself, as the sunny day quickly turned into darkness and clouds of hail, then snow. The drama of the sudden danger Aaron found himself in was made realistic with the adjectives Singer used. The drama of the story was made more intense as Singer punctuated the story of survival with the descriptions of the goat's expressions, which pulled at my heartstrings even more. He had already made it clear to the audience how trusting the goat was of humans, even as she was led into the harsh conditions of the snowstorm and her trust slowly changed into distrust.Singer allowed the audience to feel the bewilderment of Aaron as he was caught in the sudden snowstorm, then allowed the audience a sense of hope when the haystack was discovered. It was an unpredictable and ironic way that Singer designed Aaron's survival: the goat provided warmth, food, shelter, and love for the boy who leading her to the butcher. Singer brings his readers along with Aaron and the goat with his continued and plentiful use of adjectives. He also uses emotions that are shared by reading audiences from all over the globe, which helps the readers identify with the characters in the story.There was even a little humor toward the first part of the story, as the goat was wondering why she was being led away, then \\"came to the conclusion that a goat shouldn't ask questions\\" (Singer, 1966, p. 46). Finally, the story concludes with a happy ending. I loved the way Singer ended the story by painting a picture of the warm stove, the children playing as the Hannukah candles flickered, and the love of the family and the love between Zlateh and Aaron. It was the kind of story that I find comforting and satisfying to curl up with in front of a fire.Every single story in this book is similarly heartwarming, I highly recommend for adults and children alike."},{"Title":"Zlateh the Goat and Other Stories","review":"I do enjoy a good story, and Zlateh is full of them, with nice drawings by Maurice Sendek. But they do get kind of drab. These aren't stories that are overly funny or have an intellectual twist at the end that I was expecting. These are stories of a culture and they capture the strengths and weaknesses of that culture and do so quite wonderfully. Just be warned, the cultural quirks and expectations of the stories in this book will receive less appreciation from our technology-loving culture than they deserve. The book itself is a quick and comfortable read and has the potential for an excellent bed-time book for 4-8 year olds."},{"Title":"Learn Office 97","review":"This book gives you a step-by-step guide to learning all of the major pieces of Microsoft Office--Access, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

A painless way to learn the basics of these programs!"},{"Title":"The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass","review":"In 1873, Fr.

He's intelligent, well-spoken and has a deep base of knowledge of the F1 universe. This book literally picks Matchett's brain for every scrap of knowledge about the mechanics and science (and art) of Formula 1 racecar design. It's built around a somewhat affected premise of a long airplane flight conversation with some fictional F1 fans. This is the only part of the book that feels a little weak. He doesn't write fiction as well as facts, and his new-found friends come off sounding like a group of wealthy British twits. One even asks Steve \\"What say you, old man?\\". Please tell me no one still says things like that.I still strongly recommend this book. I learned a lot about F1 car design and the science of racing in general, as well as some interesting background on the people involved in the sport."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"I actually read this book about 3 months ago but forgot to publish a review of it. I bought this book hoping that I'd get some detailed info regarding current F1 cars. Although the book covered many topics relating to the cars, it just didn't have the info I was looking for. I've been looking for something that will provide detailed info regarding the design and function of the various components on a modern F1 car. It's possible that the book I'm looking for hasn't been published yet. At any rate, this wasn't a bad read for an F1 fan."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"The setting is rather contrived at best (airport lounge for Concorde and a collection of rich, boozing, but technically uninformed F1 fans). The information delivered is adequate, and there are a number of good tidbits, such as the challenges of creating carbon fibre brake discs and the relative advantages/costs thereof.For those familiar with F1, there is not all that much there, but for those who have an interest but lack much of the technical background to appreciate the level of ferocious competition, it can be a good eye-opener. The informal, chatty style fits the contrived scene."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"Matchett's latest offering opens the readers' eyes to the pinnacle of motorsport engineering that is Formula One and he does not disappoint.Discussions on this book center around a car's \\"stressed members\\" namely the monocoque, engine and gearbox. Also mentioned is the design of the fuel tank which I find particularly interesting in light of BAR's \\"disqualification\\" from the 2005 San Marino Grand Prix for essentially using the same design as described here.The reader also gets to differentiate between a pull rod vs a push rod suspension, twin keel vs single keel, oversteer vs understeer. Quite interesting also are Matchett's insights into the tire war.My only beef with this book is that for a technical introduction to Formula One, it should contain more schematic drawings so that a reader who is not a mechanical engineer can readily grasp it without going through secondary sources. The context in which this book unfolds i.e. in an airport lounge among a group of stranded passengers seems out of place and sometimes gets in the way of the technical detail.Little shortcomings notwithstanding, this has proven to be quite a good technical introduction to Formula One and inevitably makes the reader look beyond the drivers and pay closer attention to their steeds which are the real works of art."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"Covering all aspects of the modern F1 car from nose cone to diffusers, Matchett serves up a masterful analysis of what's in an F1 car and why. Couched in the form of a chance encounter with F1 enthusiasts, his artful descriptions of the hyper technology and old fashioned elbow grease needed to extrude the final magnificent result are a pleasure to read.To the enthusiast, this book will be a page turner. To the newbie, an approachable, non-condescending, very informative read.However, the travelogue introduction and conclusion are a bit of an indulgence. They do, however, help the reader get to know Steve the person, reminding us that he is in some ways a regular guy who eats at diners in Manhattan and sips coffee in Paris, in addition to being at the pinnacle of the motorsport-journalist world, and enshrined in F1 hall-of-fame-of-the-mind for his role in the 1994 World Championship."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"This is one of the best books out there for a Formula one novice interested in the technical aspects of a Car ."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"Steve Matchett is a former Formula One mechanic who has become a successful writer and currently is a commentator for Speed TV and ESPN. In this book, Matchett weaves a tale set in an airport bar, where he and a few others wait for hours and hours for a delayed trans-Atlantic flight. To past the time they discuss what would make up an idea F1 car and team. However, the book is actually much better than this rather tissue-thin back story would suggest, although Matchett swears that the events he uses in the back story did happen, although he did alter the time sequencing and people.Once you get past the setup, most of the rest of the book is an enjoyable discussion of Formula One technology, construction techniques and race craft. Matchett does touch upon the historic background of many of the subjects, but mostly he deals with the modern era. His style is informative without being too wrapped up in techno-speak. And, just as if he was conversing with a group of people, there are questions asked by his fellow would-be passengers that allow Matchett to explain and illustrate points so that the layman could comprehend them.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes racing, has an interest in F1 and would like to find out more about it without having to delve into much more technical books. As is always true in F1, as soon as a book is published the information in is becomes out of date, but enough of the currently technology of F1 has been around since before Matchett wrote this book that it does have relevance to the current racing season. And Matchett is a good writer, dubious back story or not."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"Although the writing is fine the technical content and graphics in this book are very 'lightweight'. There is nothing here that a casual enthusiast who reads F1 news stand magazines would not already know. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"For anyone interested in Formula 1 engineering (or automotive engineering of any sort), Matchett's book is the perfect introduction to the topic. It is at once engaging and informative, droll and illuminating, and no real fan will come away without a greater insight into the machines that make up so much of the sport. Who knew an exposition on the contrasting design philosophies of push-rod and pull-rod suspensions could be so riveting? While a rabid few will pine for greater detail and pedantic density, \\"The Chariot Makers\\" will more than satisfy the curiosity of the vast majority, and I suggest that even the most knowledgeable will gain much insight, given Matchett's unique perspective as an insider in the sport. Well done."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"This book lit me up on Formula One. The author's writing style is witty, interesting, informative and conversational, making it an easy read despite the technical nature of the subject.You'll learn about how the Formula One car is a compromise; engineering ideals vs. mechanical necessity, and technological development vs. the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile(FIA) regulations. The author's enthusiasm is infectious - especially the idea of the engine and gearbox as a single unit, which, along with revolutionary engine designs will never be realised due to FIA regulations. He remains objective about the FIA considering that its rules often stymie development.I like the scenario that provides the book's structure (a conversation with enthusiasts about putting together the ideal car) as you also learn how much it costs to build a car; whether to have the engine designed in-house, what you'll pay to a major supplier like Ferrari, and where on the car significant gains in horsepower can be made.I haven't read other F1 books to give a comparison, but I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"I really enjoy the commentary offered by Steve Machett on Speedtv, so I purchased this book. Well done! The technology is what attracts me to F1 and Machett covers enough detail to entertain the F1 enthusiast, without going into boring details. Now Mr. Machett, can you write a book that explains how some F1 teams spend $100's of millions of dollars more than others, yet only achieve 1 to 2 seconds per lap advantage? Or, in the case of Super Aguri, the low budget team outperforms the factory Honda team! I'd like to get a behind the scenes look at this phenomenon."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"Lots of fascinating detail on what makes up an F1 car. Sounds boring, but it isn't.Where he goes wrong is in trying to wrap up his telling as a fictional conversation with traveling friends. It seems grafted on and amateurish, when his skill at describing the engineering the car is good enough to stand on its own."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"Strange the way the book is written around Steve meeting a few F-1 fans in an airport. Nice reading but I miss illustrations!"},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"Like others have mentioned before, this is an excellent book on all the key aspects of of design of a Modern day F1 car. It covers all the bases methodically, from engine design to suspension to chasis toaero, its all here and Steve's utter command of the subject shows thru. I found it to be a compelling read.The only complaint, if i can call it that is the narrative about the fictional friends gettign stranded at JFK airport etc...i found that i could easily skim over those parts carefully and not lose much info. The pictures are an afterthought and the book could have done with more diagrams etc. Again, the narration is good enuogh to mitigate the impact,however.If you have a reasonable understanding of F1, this is a must read to appreciate its beauty and all that goes into the sport and its cars."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"Matchett is not the best storyteller with some contrived attempts at humor, characters from, \\"Three Men in a Boat\\" and a strange setting.

As part of Speed TV's F1 team and Technical Editor of the UK's F1 Racing magazine, Steve is well informed and the book is good read for F1 fans and a must-read for those with a passing interest in the sport. As a matter of fact, all his books are a worth reading..."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"This is a excellent introduction to the how F1 cars are designed and put together. Matchett does wonderful job walking the reading through the process of building a winning F1 car without burying them in too much technical detail. In addition he provides the reader with a history and evolution of the sport, cars, and regulations. This look back over the history of F1 gives the reader a clear(er) understanding of why the cars of today look the way that they do and what has been tried in the past.Who would enjoy reading this book? An F1 fan who enjoys the races is but has little understanding of how the cars work and language the announcers use when discussing what the teams are doing to the cars over the race weekend. At just over 200 pages the reader will quickly be up to speed on how complex and challenging building an F1 car is and why some teams get it so wrong.What the book is not, is a super technical breakdown of an F1 car and Matchett makes no bones about that fact. Several times in the beginning of the book he explains that if you are looking for mechanical engineering explaination, hard numbers this book more touches on the surface of the components.Some reviewers have complained about the fictional story that Matchett uses to move from chapter to chapter and it can be a little tiring. That said, this isn't an F1 text book and Matchett had to come up with some way of creating a flow through the whole book. The story he creates helps put the reader at ease and is written in such a way to create a dialog between Matchett and the reader (the characters asking the questions you are most likely thinking). You can skip those few pages in each chapter certainly not be lost in what is going on in the book.Why only 4 stars? Well I agree with the other reviewers who would like more drawings. What slows the reader down most often is stopping to try and picture what Matchett is explaining in detail. Another 10-20 pages would really help the reader see more quickly and clearly the parts he is discussing. It is surprising that a mechanic off all people would try and convey these parts to the reader with just words. I am sure that Matchett did not work all those years putting an F1 together by written word only."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"Absolutely stunning explanation of high tech world of F1.Hoping next one is internal view of f1 politics."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"This is readable, educational, funny, and really useful. If I had to suggest a single book on the F1 car, this is it, without question. You will learn the historical development of all the aspects of the modern F1 car, and why Matchett thinks some approaches are better than others. The aspects, such as engine, transmission, aero, monocoque, and connections are explained with the best clarity I've ever found. I liked his other books. This one is, in my view, his best. I kept thinking, \\"Oh, now I understand!\\" I've read more technical books. This one gives you knowledge and understanding."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"I have read all of Steve's books and am again so pleased with his latest addition. \\"The Chariot Makers\\" is a clearly written, funny and informative account of what goes into the production of a modern day F1.Steve spells out the differences that make a winning car and the incredible degrees taken by F1 teams to make a difference in the cars. As a reader, Steve's passion for the sport and his vast knowledge make this a quick read.I was disappointed when I got to the last chapter! I didn't wnat the book to end.If you are interested in the subjects that Steve comments on during the Speedtv broadcasts, this is your book. If you are more interested in life behind the sport, try \\"A Mechanic's Tale\\"..."},{"Title":"The Chariot Makers: Assembling the Perfect Formula 1 Car","review":"This is a great read.

He does a great job in going through the elements of the car from the monocoque to the brakes and provides the why not just the what. Some reviewers thought the background story of the stranded travelers was thin, but that aspect of the book was short and gave Steve some personality.

From time to time the soldier slaves revolted and such revolts were put down brutally. Male slaves were routinely castrated and the children of female slaves were taken from them. The slavery system covered most of North Africa, the Middle East, Iran and parts of India under Islamic control. Due to the Koranic blessing, SAudi Arabis did not outlaw slavery until 1964, nor did Kuwait until 1968. No discussion of the world view phenomena is complete without an examination of this \\"eastern\\" slave trade. Note also that the Inca and the Aztec practiced human slavery in a non-capitalist setting. The author would also allow you to forget that it wsa the hated colonial powers of England and France that pushed for the end of slavery in North Africa, not the Islamic east."},{"Title":"Capitalism & Slavery","review":"Slavery was widespread through the Inca and Aztec cultures. Islam embraces slavery without reservation, it is expressly approved in the Koran. Segal documents the fact that 11 million Black Africans were kidnapped from their home by Islamic traders from 700 A.D. to 1900 B.C. Mohammed left many pages of directions to SLAVEHOLDERS on how to handle their slaves. The Ummyad dynasty of Islamic rulers castrated male Black African slaves and used them in battle between 700 A.D. and 1200 A.D.By the way, where does one find a successful, stable, democratic non-capitalistic society? Planned economies don't work."},{"Title":"Capitalism & Slavery","review":"The transformation from subsistance society where everyone more or less consumed what they produced, to international capitalism required as a precondition the accumulation of capital. That is, some people had to be able to produce more than they consumed before they could have anything to invest.Williams contribution to the literature of this transformation is to focus on the role of the slave trade. On the one hand, it provided a source of raw materials (human beings) which could be sold at a profit by traders, and then used to produce even more wealth by the buyers (slaveholders). This double accumulation of wealth went a long way toward allowing a few very wealthy people to accumulate capital, which coul;d then be invested in things like machinery.At the same time, the slave trade provided an economic foundation for a large scale international trading network (the famous molasses, slave, rum triangle, later includeing cotton). Without this international network of shippers and merchants, the English (and later New England) cotton mills would not have had anywhere to sell their manufactured product (cotton cloth), nor a cheap source of cotton to use as raw materials.Williams' ground breaking contirbution was to link all of this together, and argue that without the immoral slave trade, the industrial revolution, and thus capitalism as we know it, would not have happened. The inescapable conclusion is that since much of modern wealth was founded on slavery, some form of reparations is warranted."},{"Title":"Capitalism & Slavery","review":"The basic theory underlying Eric Williams's Capitalism and Slavery is that slavery in the colonies, particularly the West Indies so far as this analysis is concerned, brought about capitalism, and thereby led to its own decline.The first five chapters of the book explain the nature of British economics prior to the American Revolution. Synthesizing information rather than expressing his own view, Williams discusses triangular trade among England, the African coast, and the slave-holding colonies. In essence, England exported goods and ships, Africa exported slaves, and the colonies exported slave-produced raw materials.American independence destroyed the mercantilist scheme of triangular trading. The ex-colonies now had no incentive to trade with the West Indies at their monopoly prices, instead turning to French islands for their sugar, at considerably lower prices. Consequently, British businessmen were no longer interested in giving economic protection to the West Indies because doing so without mainland North America would cost them money. One basic tenet of Adam Smith's capitalism is that business should be efficient and profitable, and monopolies simply were neither. The laissez-faire approach, or Smith's \\"invisible hand,\\" meant eliminating monopolies and letting economics take its course.During this time the Industrial Revolution also occurred, generating new machinery, most notably Watt's steam engine, and simplifying the extraction of raw materials. Ironworks were now much more efficient, for example, as was the process of turning wool into useable cloth. These advantages put Great Britain in a position to economically dominate the world. During this time also Spanish colonies in South America began breaking away from Spain, opening up vast regions for British trade. Similarly, Asia became a possibility for a wide variety of goods, most notably, in the scope of Williams' book, East Indian sugar. All these opportunities and Britain's economic superiority culminated in the end of monopolistic practices.Slavery had precipitated these developments by generating fantastic wealth through triangular trading; without slavery, that trade scheme would not have existed. Once these developments came to pass, however, slavery proved itself largely pass?. Without the monopoly on West Indian sugar, slave trading became substantially less profitable. At the same time, when the American mainland split from Great Britain, suddenly Britain was no longer dependent on slavery for economic success, but instead could be a global distributor for goods. Furthermore, abolitionists in England gave cry to the crime of slavery, since they were no longer directly dependent on it, and eventually Britain banned the slave trade.Williams's analysis is interesting and well worth reading. That said, his assertion that slavery declined is only partly true; it was alive and well in the southern United States. Furthermore, while Williams claims slavery brought about triangular trading, which in turn brought about the Industrial Revolution, one wonders if slavery simply expedited the arrival of the Industrial Revolution. Finally, he focuses to a significant extent on British humanitarianism in ending slavery; cynically, one must consider the relevance of slavery to those humanitarians, and how many there were after the Industrial Revolution."},{"Title":"Capitalism & Slavery","review":"I recently read this book for graduate school and highly recommend it. This book was written in 1940 and while critics have been able to pick at a few details within the book, noone has every successfully disproven his entire thesis - that the rise of industrial capitalism would not have been possible without the existence profits derived from slavery and the slave trade. Williams does a splended job of illustrating how slavery influenced all facets of the triangular trade, which in turn shaped Britian into an economic power. It also brings put the economic reasons for the abolitionist movement (namely, that abolitionists were motivated by free-trade, no necessarily compassion in their opposition to the slave trade).This is a must-have book for anyone interested in a strictly economic look at slavery, it's rise, fall and demise."},{"Title":"Capitalism & Slavery","review":"This is a very, very excellent piece of work.

As the first Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago Dr. Eric Williams has left us with a gift."},{"Title":"Capitalism & Slavery","review":"The author is both an historian and a political scientist. He, also, perhaps unwittingly, is a brilliant theorist. Because of the latter, this treatment of capitalism and slavery is a superb, comprehensive, dispassionate, critical and scholarly analysis of the invention and perpetuation of the English led industrial revolution, and the role slavery played as an inportant concomitant in carrying that revolution to completion.In this regard, there is both a long and a short version of the story. The short version sticks most closely to his theory about the morality of capitalism, so it is only appropriate to give the short story in this review, which is this: Slavery and monopoly (mostly of sugar and cotton) powered the English led industrial revolution. Everything else is just cultural decoration, a tying up of all the moral loose ends very much after the fact, and building post hoc rationalizations for how (not why) slavery was engaged in. The why is already self-evident: It was done for profits and for no other reason. But slavery was its own economic closed system.This gets us to the second part of the book, the amorality or moral innocence of economic processes. This is a theme that runs along side the narrative in the subtext. For my needs, this part of the book was perhaps the most important part. For like Charles Beard (in his fabulous book \\"An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the U.S.\\"), this author also puts in the foreground the economic origins of many well-known social, political, and intellectual movements (including of course, the topic of this book, slavery). In doing so, he clears the air and resets the moral parameters for those who might want to deal exclusively in morally correct fantasies (like myself) when dealing with an issue as sensitive as slavery.What he tells us here, with a kind of moral clarity that cannot be mistaken for anything else: is that every brick in Buckingham palace was cemented in Negro blood. But then he gives us a brutal lesson in the ethics of (or the lack of morality in) economics: Politics, economics and morals in the abstract make no sense. The infrastructure of political and economic systems are more important than their respective super-structures, and are more important than the ideological base that sustains them after the fact. This is not to say that morality and ideologies do not count or that all men are simply racist and thus venal. However, the chilling message of the book is one that we already knew from the bible: \\"Where your treasure is; there will your heart be also.\\" That basically is the moral story of the European pursuit of slavery.We thus tend to forget that the use of Negroes as slaves was not at first imposed by any Hitler-like racial doctrine. It was based on a simple economic calculus: Black slaves paid better than enslaved Indians, Irish or Scottish prisoners-of-war, or the use of indentured white servants more generally. Plus, and (this was the economic deal breaker, especially with the coming of the ban on the Atlantic slave trade), the children of Negro women were slaves in perpetuity. Slaves could be bought and sold; used to produce crops, and then perpetuate or replenish themselves(!). A black slave thus constituted a tight closed economic loop, out of which emerged free-standing profits, more capital, and the bonus: more slaves. End of story. Morality did not play a role here; it was purely economics in the raw. So long as the system was profitable, it was rationalized, defended, and praised. Justification for continuing it, became its own ideology and its own legitimacy.The author's finely-tuned theory teaching us that the only thing that cannot be seen in hindsight is how economic forces tend to coalesce as they come into being with their own built in justifications. They do so gradually, almost imperceptibly, having an irresistible and cumulative effect that is difficult to reverse, once started. Morality takes a back seat when gradual processes emerge and when questionable economic practices are used to either feed the family, build a nation, or an empire. Drug trafficking is the perfect modern case in point. Moral reckoning can always be delayed and dealt with after the fact, when profits have run their course. Such was the case in both the slave trade of the 17th and 18th Century, and the drug trade of today. The warning of this book is a morally sobering one: Capitalist profits always try to bring with them, their own moral legitimacy. We see it again in the 2006 Housing crash based on a greedy Wall Street Ponzi scheme.The longer story of the slave trade, we already know: its origin and development, the Atlantic triangulation, the coming of the American revolution and the development of British capitalism. But here we begin to understand how slavery so easily got under the moral radar of a European world full of religious Puritans claiming to be struggling for their own freedom. Five Stars"},{"Title":"Capitalism & Slavery","review":"The last two reviewers who seemed to criticize Williams for not discussing other forms of slavery miss the point. Williams was not engaged in some sort of West bashing but attempted to explain the significance of slavery in the development of the Caribbean. Insofar as Islam is concerned, the reviewers once again miss the essential point. Rather than investigate what Islam actually says about slavery they go with a knee-jerk assumption. Here is what Kecia Ali has written about slavery in Islamic society:\\"The Qur'an, which Muslims believe to have been revealed by God to the Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century, makes numerous references to slaves and slavery (e.g., Q. 2.178; 16.75; 30.28). Like numerous passages in the Hebrew bible and the New Testament, the Qur'an assumes the permissibility of owning slaves, which was an established practice before its revelation. The Qur'an does not explicitly condemn slavery or attempt to abolish it. Nonetheless, it does provide a number of regulations designed to ameliorate the situation of slaves. It recommends freeing slaves, especially \\"believing\\" slaves (Q. 2.177). Manumission of a slave is required as expiation for certain misdeeds (Q. 4.92; 58.3) and another verse states that masters should allow slaves to purchase their own freedom (Q. 24.33).The Qur'an also suggests certain means of integrating slaves, some of whom were enslaved after being captured in war, into the Muslim community. It allows slaves to marry (either other slaves or free persons; Q. 24.32; 2.221; 4.25) and prohibits owners from prostituting unwilling female slaves (Q. 24.33). Despite this protection against one form of sexual exploitation, female slaves do not have the right to grant or deny sexual access to themselves. Instead, the Qur'an permits men to have sexual access to \\"what their right hands possess,\\" meaning female captives or slaves (Q. 23.5-6; 70.29-30). This was widely accepted and practiced among early Muslims; the Prophet Muhammad, for example, kept a slave-concubine (Mariya the Copt) who was given to him as a gift by the Roman governor of Alexandria.Traditional Islamic law (fiqh) elaborates significantly on the Qur'anic material concerning slavery. The enslavement of war captives is regulated, along with the purchase and sale of slaves. While it is not permissible to enslave other Muslims, the jurists clarify that if a non-Muslim converts to Islam after enslavement, he or she remains a slave and may be lawfully purchased and sold like any other slave. (This rule closes a potential loophole allowing for slaves to gain their freedom by the simple fact of conversion.) The law also prescribes penalties for slave owners who maltreat or abuse their slaves; these penalties can include forced manumission of the slave without compensation to the owner.Islamic law devotes special attention to regulating the practice of slave marriage and concubinage, in order to determine the paternity and/or ownership of children born to a female slave. A man cannot simultaneously own and be married to the same female slave. The male owner of a female slave can either marry her off to a different man, thus renouncing his own sexual access to her, or he may take her as his own concubine, using her sexually himself. Both situations have a specific effect on the status of any children she bears. When female slaves are married off, any children born from the marriage are slaves belonging to the mother's owner, though legal paternity is established for her husband. When a master takes his own female slave as a concubine, by contrast, any children she bears are free and legally the children of her owner, with the same status as any children born to him in a legal marriage to a free wife. The slave who bears her master's child becomes an umm walad (literally, mother of a child), gaining certain protections. Most importantly, she cannot be sold and she is automatically freed upon her master's death.\\"As for the Aztec, they had a system of slavery that also came with a bundle of rights, far different from the chattel slavery of the European variety."},{"Title":"Capitalism & Slavery","review":"Although there may be complainants about Dr. Williams not addressing certain forms of slavery throughout history it has to be kept in mind that his thesis was about the hows and whys of African enslavement in the Caribbean.

It can be technical but if your looking for a book that explains the economics of slavery this is the book for you. It focuses on the West Indies and Europe, especially Britain.

It goes up through the dissolution of the agreed framework and attempts to explain Bush Sr., Clinton and Bush Jr's administration policies. Feffer does a reasonable job but constantly offers very opinionated views against the Bush administration that aren't very well thought out. I found the book interesting and informative and enjoyed reading it but my mind wouldn't allow me to believe everything he said because of the obvious agenda to discredit the current administration. The author does show that the North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il's isn't completely crazy and that there may be a small amount of logic to his leadership. Understanding DPRK's history gave me a more understanding view of their desperate situation of trying to survive in a world that has completely changed since the beginning of their State."},{"Title":"North Korea/South Korea: U.S. Policy at a Time of Crisis (Open Media Books)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

The Rhee regime had little popular support. In 1948 on the island of Cheju, in suppressing a rebellion, the regime killed about 60,000. Overall the U.S. backed regime killed about 100,000 oppositionists in its first five years.. South Korea started many border clashes with the North beginning in the Summer of 1949 causing huge casualtiesKim Il Sung, in the famous early 1950 meeting that gets anti-communist ideologues all excited, was granted permission to invade the South after he convinced Stalin that he would get the operation over with quickly and thus hopefully discourage the Americans from intervening militarily. The Americans were eventually able to push the North Koreans back. . Macarthur's deliberately provocative march northward up the peninsula towards the Yalu river, Korea's border with China, brought the Chinese army into the conflict. The Americans engaged in extensive bombing and napalming of civilians. They wiped off the map about three quarters of North Korea. In June 1953, they started bombing dams and water reservoirs in North Korea, which effects included the mass flooding of rice and other agricultural fields. Thus by inducing starvation the Americans induced the North to agree to a truce. Some Nazis got hanged for implementing such a policy during WWII. The North Koreans committed their share of atrocities.U.S. planners were embarrassed as the North's economy regularly outstripped the South's into the mid-70's. General Park Chung Hee seized power in the South in 1961. He set up a state planning economic regime. It was based on tight state discipline of labor and consumption austerity with workers treated pretty badly. Unrest spread and in 1980, the military under the new dictator General Chun perpetrated a bloody massacre in the city of Kwangju. A revitalized labor movement eventually forced democratic change on the U.S. backed military. By the late 80's South Korea was one of the top economies in the world; in 1960 it had been at the level of Sub-Saharan Africa. Its principles violated all the prescriptions of the free market-as did the rest of the Asian tigers and has the U.S. with its military-industrial complex fueling its hi tech economy. . In any case, South Korea was pressured to remove controls on capital flows and this led to the Asian financial crises of the late 90's. Western companies swarmed in to buy up the fire sale of bankrupt indigenous companies. This incident of course, makes North Korea pause about extending its free market reforms) as does the extreme poverty and social chaos existing in China's Free Market revolution.In the 70's North Korea borrowed from foreign creditors and fell heavily into debt. Agricultural plots for private sale were allowed in the 80's. The latter led to clearing of land and deforestation, which contributed mightily to the floods contributing to the future famine in the mid-90's.The communist block disappeared as a source of trade and subsidies. One of the key pillars of the 1994 agreement with the U.S. was to move towards the lifting of U.S. sanctions on the country. The Clinton administration made and broke promises regarding the sanctions issue and helping the North become a member of International financial institutions. Meanwhile, it greatly increased the amount of arms flowing to U.S. allies in the region. Aid in constructing the light water reactors was scant. The Clinton administration promised North Korea the lifting of all sanctions if it would freeze its missile program; when North Korea agreed to this, it then further demanded its missile production be completely eliminated. In 1998, it announced that its North Korean plans included a possible first strike on it and revived missile defense research..The only \\"admission\\" of NK might have been that they merely have the capability produce nuclear stuff. In the meeting with James Kelly, they made huge concessions on many issues. The North Koreans paint an exaggerated picture of their military capabilities to deter the neoconservative militarists in the Bush administration. and American elites want to exaggerate it to justify subsidies and sales for American arms manufacturers. The author writes that American planners also want to keep the Korean peninsula divided and the conflict alive; they are fearful that Korea would be part of a potentially powerful economic and political block in NE Asia including Russia and China.. The North has not the technology to make its missiles go far and be accurate. It has not the ability to miniaturize its warheads that it might use, assuming the not confirmed notion that it has preserved enough plutonium for a nuclear bomb from its pre-1994 operations. There is no evidence its missiles have heat shields to protect them from burning up on re-entry into the atmosphere. In other words it has not the capability to deliver biological and chemical weapons, which it may not have enough of to be any remote threat. Its nuclear related facilies are about 50 years old and unable to obtain any repair. The neoconservatives raised a bugaboo about two possible nuclear processing facilities in the late 90's and North Korea allowed them to be inspected but nothing was found. North Korea's army is badly malnourished and under clothed. It seems to have been put to heavy use in rebuilding the country's crumbling infrastructure instead of military training. The author quotes an account of a naval skirmish between North and South in 1999 where the North Koreans were so backward they had to operate the vessel's weapons exposed on deck while the South Koreans were all tucked inside their vessel with all the latest radar and computers. In North Korea's entire government budget is several billion dollars less than South Korea's military budget.North Korea has a vicious dictatorship, the author writes but the Americans have made things much worse.The Bush administration has greatly cut back on food aid in the country which significantly reduced, though far from eliminated the malnutrition problem in the country."},{"Title":"North Korea/South Korea: U.S. Policy at a Time of Crisis (Open Media Books)","review":"In one sitting, this book offers the inquiring reader a complete lesson on all that one needs to know about one of the most dangerous spots on the globe.

Feffer's lack of objectivity is most obvious when discussing what he calls &quot;mounting evidence&quot; of US germ warfare against the North during the Korean War.

Because of his background in both medicine and business (he has both MD and MBA degrees), Doctor David Friend understands healthcare from both of these perspectives. &quot;Healthcare.com&quot; describes, in nontechnical terms, how we've gotten into the current untenable situation, why it must change, and how technology and the internet may &quot;save the day.&quot;In the 1960's, when costs were relatively low and insurance paid for everything, the laws of supply and demand resulted in what Doctor Friend terms &quot;Wastecare,&quot; using a &quot;sledgehammer when a flyswatter would do.&quot; In the late 80's and early 90's, as costs began to skyrocket, payers began to cut back. Insisting on getting more for their money, they pressured hospitals and doctors to provide &quot;Hollowcare&quot; which was the &quot;driving force that sent patients home from hospitals before they were ready.&quot; Ultimately, Doctor Friend believes we need to achieve &quot;Efficientcare&quot; where costs are minimized not by reducing services but rather by increasing productivity. This can be achieved, by streamlining the processes of data acquisition, and implementation of treatments, giving physicians more time to synthesize information and deal with patients. It is here that the internet plays a key role by decreasing the constraints of time and space: Rather than being constrained to a paper chart, patient data become readily available from any computer on the planet, while X-rays taken in Atlanta can now be interpreted instantaneously in Anchorage or Antwerp.This book is an excellent roadmap and should be required reading for corporate benefits officers and public officials who are involved in making health care policy decisions (for their companies or for recipients of medicare / medicaid).

The translator often tries to match the rhythm and sound of the original work while writing in the second language. In this instance, Ben Belitt chooses to forgo keeping Neruda's rhythem and sounds and inserts his own word choices. Sometimes this strays very far from a &quot;literal&quot; translation of Neruda's words, but after all, this is poetry. Some metaphors and play-on-words simply cannot be translated. Therefore, a translator should be allowed a little freedom with word choice.What is unforgiveable, however, is to completely change the tone of the poet's voice when translating his or her work. A perfect example lies in the poem &quot;Caballos,&quot; or &quot;Horses&quot; on pages 180-183. Throughout the poem, Neruda expresses his wonder at ten beautiful horses, describing them as &quot;godlike&quot; and &quot;elegant.&quot; Belitt does a decent job of relating these feelings until the 25th line. Neruda writes &quot;cortadas en la piedra de su orgullo,&quot; which Belitt translates as &quot;carved in the stone of their arrogance.&quot; If I were to tell you that the word &quot;orgullo&quot; can be translated as &quot;pride&quot; or &quot;arrogance,&quot; which would you choose for a poem that genuinely praises something? To throw a word with negative connotations in with such carelessness is evident of how Belitt pays little attention to the feeling and emotion behind Neruda's poems. This example is not meant to be nit-picking. Rather, it is just one of many oversights that subtly changes the meanings of the poetry.Mistakes like these do cause English-only speakers to be turned off to Neruda's poetry. Please look to another translation, in particular one that has been rated highly BY THE READERS. The praise for this book, if you read the back cover, is actually for Pablo Neruda's poetry. No one will deny that Neruda was a master, it is the translator that is lacking."},{"Title":"Five Decades: Poems 1925-1970 (Neruda, Pablo) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"I just sat down for a quiet night of reading some wonderful Pablo Neruda poems while sipping from a soothing cup of warm tea, and I was rudely shocked at the ham-handed translations I found on the pages of this book!I am not particularly a fan of poetry, but Mr. Neruda's transcendent and passionate work has always held a special place in my heart. I discovered Mr. Neruda's poems in the original Spanish some time ago, but I bought this edition more recently because I feared that the last few years in Italy had eroded by Spanish skills to the point that I'd benefit from having my native English to refer to for help. Instead, the translations left me appalled.Anyone reading Mr. Neruda's poems for the first time with this book could only assume that this great poet was a mediocre talent trying to impress beyond his abilities. The rhythm is gone, the intelligence is altered, and the word choice sometimes sounds as if it was produced by one of those annoying Internet translation programs. At points, I was seriously left wondering if Mr. Belitt is even a native English speaker.It's a terrible shame, too, because it's so nice to have both languages in the same edition. And while I am strongly critical of Mr. Belitt's translations, I cannot at all fault his selection of poems: all of the Neruda poems I like best are here, whether they are well known or obscure.As I am about to file this review, I see that all but a couple of my fellow reviewers came to the same conclusion I did.

Ben Belitt appears to be a poor poet who wants to make himself great by editing the work of master poet Neruda. His translations are sloppy, his wording is confusing, and he seems to write just to hear himself talk. Does he speak either English or Spanish? His style would indicate that he simply searched through a thesaurus for the longest synonym he could find. Did he get paid by the word, or is this some cruel joke to intentionally butcher great works? Neruda's work is straightforward and rich, and from that comes the magic of his voice. Belitt steals the sound, tone, and quality of Neruda and replaces it with his own convoluted and idiotic style. Somehow, Belitt managed to ruin Neruda's brilliant anaphoras, surely the easiest part of a poem to translate. Even a foreigner to Spanish can feel Neruda's rhythm in his text. Was Belitt trying to ruin it? I find the only way to read this text is to ignore the English side entirely and rely on Neruda's Spanish text alone and hope I can pick up enough of the Latinate words to fully understand Neruda's genius.

Still, I was jolted by Belitt's language.The English translations here seem not at all what Neruda intended! They are awkward and stilted where the originals sing. Clarity becomes confusion. Meanings are lost. \\"Respeto\\" becomes \\"deference.\\" \\"Fria\\" becomes \\"glacial.\\" Where repetitions bring a wonderful rhythm to a Neruda original, Belitt feels compelled to switch it up for some near-synonym. Commas drop in from the sky. Line breaks are changed for no reason (or rhyme). Words intended to fall at the end of a line, for emphasis, are transposed with ones originally in the middle. Extra words, extra meanings are thrown in. Consider this final phrase of Dream Horse:\\"desnudo sin herraduras y radiante.\\"Roughly translated it means \\"stripped of (or freed of) its horseshoes and radiant.\\"Belitt turns it into: \\"naked to the bridle and iron, shimmering, whinnying there.\\"I am no poet and no translator.

When that fact is not honored, the true expression of the poet's singular voice is not honored. These are not Neruda's poems at all, but the poems of Ben Belitt masquerading as the poems of Pablo Neruda. It is more than a little infuriating, as I read the often murky and incomprehensible English \\"translations\\", to glance at the plainly superior original Spanish versions and get a bitter eyeful of just how much ridiculous liberty was taken by the translator. It is almost as if Belitt tried to \\"improve\\" Neruda's vocabulary, as if such a thing was necessary or even appropriate. Neruda's own clear voice is disrespected and his poems obliterated in this book. The endless embellishments are like layers of soot, smudge, and graffiti obscuring the vibrancy of an Old Master's greatest murals. I am appalled by such lack of faithfulness. Belitt is probably a good poet, but Neruda is a better one, and I wanted to read a collection of Pablo Neruda's poetry, not Belitt's.

Luckily I know Spanish and can sense the richness of Neruda's immortal work.Neruda's \\"Enigmas\\" is rendered nonsensical by Ben Belitt, it should read more like Robert Bly's Translation.EnigmasYou've asked me what the lobster is weaving there withhis golden feet?I reply, the ocean knows this.You say, what is the ascidia waiting for in its transparentbell?

This is a great collection, covering an immense spectrum of work, if you are familiar with the intricacies of the Spanish language, or are at least familiar with a lot of Pablo Neruda's writings, it definitely adds something as far as interpretation goes.

For instance, Rumpf speaks of the bombing of Dresden as a catastrophe \\"so terrible that the details in all their horror will never be fully known now.\\" True enough, but one has to ask: How many perished in Dresden: 30,000 or 300,000? Rumpf doesn't say. In like manner, he describes the bombing of Wurzburg as one that destroyed \\"everything and everybody in it\\". Oh really? Not even a small nuclear bomb would do that.Rumpf also omits essential facts in his analysis. For instance, he laments the destruction of Nordhausen without mentioning the existence of the nearby underground V2 factory (Dora). While the factory itself could not, of course, be knocked out by bombing, its productivity could be reduced by destroying the surrounding above-ground urban-industrial infrastructure. The bombing of Nordhausen was part of this strategy.Rumpf comments on the attitudes of the Nazi leaders: \\"All this inferno of death and destruction seemed to leave Germany's leaders unmoved. The total warfare they had so boastfully proclaimed was now on their own doorstep. And it was more terrible than even they had ever imagined. The German people were left to reap the harvest of hatred their leaders had systematically shown. It was the ordinary men and women and their children who had to pay the bill. And those men who had always sworn that their every action was guided by their love for Germany were revealed in all their naked ugly egoism. The war was lost, long lost, and they knew it. They could have ended it with a word, and spared the German people unnecessary suffering.\\" (p. 150).Is Rumpf implying that the war was OK as long as the suffering was limited to the recipients of German aggression? In any case, Rumpf forgets how Hitler came to power: The German people elected him in free elections. When voters go to the polls, they fully understand that they are voting not only for their own future, but also for that of their co-nationals and, of course, their children. In MEIN KAMPF, the Fuhrer-to-be planned a large war against the Slavic east for lebensraum. By voting for Hitler, the Germans were voting for death and destruction against other peoples. The fortunes of war made it boomerang against the Germans, who now also had to suffer. In the final analysis, the German people had a choice about the precipitation of a new war; the Poles and other recipients of German aggression had no such choice."},{"Title":"Manchester Streetcars (NH) (Images of America)","review":"O. R. Cummings has long been noted for his encyclopedic knowledge of New Hampshire traction lines, and nowhere does he show this better than in Manchester Streetcars.If you want to see a prime example of how to write a definitive, concise history of a traction line, this is the book for you.Why? Its 128 pages cover a definitive pictorial roster, including those from the horsecar era. Renumberings (often neglected) are noted, as are disposition dates of equipment not making it to abandonment. The system is covered geographically, with important street names, intersections, and landmarks always noted. Branch lines are not neglected and covered in separate chapters. The downtown Manchester area containing carbarns, important junctions, and the B&amp;M, gets special treatment. The history of the system is interspersed throughout the captions and in narrative, always at the right point.The photographs used are first rate - there isn't a dud among them. Directions being travelled (oft times overlooked by others) are included, so you know where you are and where you are looking.My only quibble - and it's a minor one considering all that has been included - is a wish for more detailed maps. The ones given are not faulty, incomplete or erroneous. I'm just a map freak.O. R. Cummings has done us all a great service in this volume. I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"Fire Down Below","review":"Wonderful prose, beautifully observed character study, as WG slips into the skin of an extremely priggish and snobbish early twenties aristocrat as he comes of age and begins to understand a little more of the virtues of the ordinary people around him. Sea journeys of that era were long, tedious, largely uneventful and extremely uncomfortable. All 3 books in the trilogy carry this perfectly: the maritime atmosphere is conveyed as perfectly as the arrogant character of the narrator. However, the tedium of the journey also comes across in the virtually non-existent plot which makes the books drag on somewhat. It is probably, though, as brilliant description of the English class system at the start of the 19th century as you will read. I believe that the books in Trilogies should be able to stand alone, if they are to be sold separately, &amp; on that basis, this trilogy definitely fails.

Great Huge Images to get your teeth into."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"The only other Aldous Huxley book I ever read was \\"Brave New World,\\" and that was at least ten years ago. For most people, I think that is the only Huxley book they know about. It's a shame, because this book, \\"Ape and Essence,\\" is a true Huxley gem. The back of the book says Huxley wrote this in 1948 as a response to the use of atomic weapons in WWII and the emerging Cold War. \\"Brave New World\\" showed us a future of soma-laden people cared for by the state from cradle to grave. \\"Ape and Essence\\" doesn't have anything nearly as pleasant as soma. In this new world, people are ruled by a satanic theocracy after a nuclear war.The book is pretty easy to describe. Two Hollywood types find a manuscript that dropped off a truck bound for the incinerator. The script is entitled, \\"Ape and Essence,\\" by a William Tallis. Somebody didn't care much for his script; they marked it incinerate and underlined that word twice. The two read the script and try to find Mr. Tallis, only to discover that he died a few months earlier. What follows this brief introduction is the script, in its entirety.\\"Ape and Essence\\" is about a post-nuclear holocaust world. New Zealand escaped the holocaust, and now they are sending explorers to America to see how the world is coming along. The main character here is Dr. Poole, a botanist. The survivors who roam the ruins of Los Angeles capture Poole and agree to let him live if he can improve crop production. Poole witnesses some unusual behavior amongst the natives, behavior that is explained to him by the archpriest of Belial.Huxley uses this odd world as a backdrop for his own views on humanity in the 20th century. Huxley feels that mankind never got past the beast (or ape) inside. The beginning of the script shows apes dressed as humans, engaging in such delightful activities as chemical warfare and mass killing. These apes even keep Albert Einstein on a leash, signifying man's inability to use our genius to overcome our basest instincts. While strange at times (almost David Lynch-like), I don't think this is too strange for an intellectual like Huxley. He relies on extreme images to capture his despair over the state of mankind. The time frame in which Huxley writes is telling. It's 1948, only a few years after Hiroshima and just about the time the Cold War is really cranking into gear. Huxley must have been appalled that just a few years after the most destructive war in human history, even more horrors are starting to lurk on the horizon.Huxley makes special mention of a few of man's ideas that lead to this type of nightmare. Both progress and nationalism are killers of mankind, according to Huxley. Nationalism, or the idea that one state is divinely sanctioned over all others, leads to useless killing. As Africa and the Balkans clearly show today, Huxley is not only insightful for his own time, but also prescient for today, as well.The idea of progress is just as important. Why, with man's ability to create, does he so often use his talents for destructive purposes? It is progress that led to industrialization, which led to cities full of people with created needs. These needs found expression through war, when one set of people decided to take things from others to fulfill their own needs.Huxley is insightful and his views on what makes humanity tick are dead on. I thought his use of a movie script to convey his ideas was clever, even though it is uneven at times. Huxley does seem to recognize the growing importance of media in disseminating ideas, and perhaps that is why he chose the format he did. I had to chuckle over the idea of this becoming a film in Huxley's day. The Catholics, who were keeping a close eye on Hollywood at this time, would have had a field day with this script-Satanism and unusual mating rituals would send them into histrionics. You can't go wrong with Mr. Aldous Huxley by your side."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"Not as well-crafted as Huxley's better-known _Brave_New_World_, and I think I can guess why. Huxley, despondent over contemporary events and trends, must have felt crushed with utter despair and yet spurred by the conviction that he could not remain silent. Under such stress it's hard to attend to belleletristic niceties. Huxley also was experimenting with form. The story is presented as a stylized movie script, in the same sense that Goethe's _Faust_ is a stylized drama.Nevertheless, this is a powerful, passionate, and haunting book. I cannot think of any other book which makes such a frighteningly real case for Evil as an operative principle in the world. Even more amazing, this case is presented under the guise of what looks and sounds like a B-grade horror flick. Imagine if, say, Dostoevsky had written his great novels as comic books -- and they still had the same terrifying, probing depth as the novels. That's essentially the effet that Huxley achieves, and it is uncanny.Huxley is speaking of the condition of modern civilization *as it is*, under a set of grotesque, phantasmagoric masks. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"Aldous Huxley's Apes and Essence is science fiction combined with the allegorical drive of a Swift's Gulliver's Travels. It ought to assume a proud place beside other works on retro-futures -- novels like, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and films of the Mad Max genre. Huxley is convinced that we opted for the worst of both worlds -- East and West -- by failing to curb the capability of science with the wisdom and moderation of Eastern mysticism. Here too is the brave new eugenicsl, and insofar as Huxley is trying to point to this as a future dilemma, he is decisively on track."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"This book is an unbelievable prophecy. I find it more erie than Orwell's 1984. The story lacks the smoothness of Brave New World, yet it's importance is equal. To look to the future of society is to read Brave New World and Ape and Essence, and figure out where we are headed. I can already see some of the philosophies described in the book in our society as we speak, and we have not yet had a nuclear holocaust. All I can say is that this book is a must read and every bit as important as Brave New World."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"I read this book quite rapidly (two days) and really liked it.It's 1948, Ghandi has just been assassinated, and two guys connected to the movie business come across a script that's just fallen from a trash truck. They set out to find the author, whose script makes up the bulk of the novel.There are a lot of wonderful \\"postmodern\\" touches here -- for example, one of the main characters in the script picks up a copy of Shelley that's about to be burned, and ends up reading it at the grave of the fictional author of the script saved from the trash heap.In addition, this book's scenes of apes lording themselves over human beings unquestionably inspired Planet of the Apes.And finally, the novel's descriptions of classical music in its portrayal of a dystopia probably influenced A Clockwork Orange. In fact, Anthony Burgess named Ape and Essence one of the best novels in English since 1939:\\"Novels like Ape and Essence seem now to be very much products of their time [immediately post-Hiroshima] and rather dated. But this is Huxley -- clever, brutal, thoughtful, original -- and his fictional tract clings to the mind....It is a nauseating vision of a still possible future....\\"Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"I first read Ape and Essence in a single sitting about 1950. I was then 29 or 30 and so deeply impressed by the novel's power and its comment on the state of our world that I felt it was the end-all of literature and there was no need to read any more fiction. Indeed, my appetite for novels remained sated for more than a year. I read the novel again with its second edition a few years ago and was scarcely less impressed. This novel fully ranks with Brave New World and Point Counter Point, and deserves to be recognized as one of the best 100 novels of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"Compared to Ape and Essence, Huxley's more celebrated dystopian comic fantasy, Brave New World, bursts with sunny optimism about the future. World War II, which intervened between the two books, unquestionably accelerated Huxley's depair. In Brave New World, the people of the far future had lost their edge, their creativity, their sense of the tragic; that seemed like a sorry enough fate to readers in the pre-Nazi, pre-Hiroshima 1930s. But Ape and Essence posits a crueller and more desperate post-apocalyptic future.Huxley delivers the bad news in his trademark style, a savage yet mannered irony that must have inspired Terry Southern a generation later. Most of the story is told in the form of a manifestly unsellable film script by an imaginary unknown. The script's narrator sets the scene by briefly describing World War III in chilling detail: if you're not afraid of thermonuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, just read the few pages that Huxley devotes to them. Your current mundane nightmares will take a serious turn for the worse.The script does end on an upbeat note. But it's in a '40s movie. Huxley himself gives absolutely no cause for optimism. Nearly sixty years ago he specified fanatic nationalism and contempt for the natural world as the most dangerous attitudes on earth.Now look around you.Still scary after all these years, Ape and Essence is for those who like their dystopias blackly humorous and seriously thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"I recommend everyone read all of huxely's books.

I still find myself wandering into the library, grabbing the book and thumbing through the pages for passages that inspire and depress me!"},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"When you are a conservative, here's what passes for optimism : things aren't very good (they're definitely worse than they used to be) and they are likely to get worse still; but there will always be a small, but hardy, band of resistors, summoning the species back to first principles, and, in the long run, we may even prevail--God willing. That's not particularly optimistic, is it ? Moreover, to many, what's particularly objectionable about this dark view is that it flows from a fairly low estimation of our fellow men, which is perhaps best expressed in Edmund Burke's aphorism : &quot;There is no safety for honest men but by believing all possible evil of evil men.&quot; Unpleasant they may be, but these attitudes are on full and glorious display in Aldous Huxley's novel, Ape and Essence.The story is told in screenplay form--a narrative device which I found awkward--a script having blown off of a truck which is hauling studio detritus to the dump. The deceased screenwriter, William Tallis, posits a future in which most of the world has been devastated by nuclear war. Their island nation having been spared major damage, the New Zealand Rediscovery Expedition to North America lands on the California coast in 2108, looking for survivors. Dr. Alfred Poole gets separated from the rest of the party and taken in by the Belial worshipping natives.In the wake of the catastrophe--which they refer to as the Thing--the remaining Southern Californians are held in thrall by the sterilized priests of Belial, who seek to limit knowledge and quash human desires, relegating the populace to a single two week period of sex a year (following Belial Day), which produces an annual litter of mutant babies, some of whom are actually healthy enough to replace the dead and dying adults. This suffices to fulfill the rather limited purposes of their decimated society : to serve Belial by accepting the punishment that has been visited upon them and to avoid extinction. Dr. Poole falls in love with Loola, a native girl, and they run away, the book ending with them on their way to Bakersfield, stumbling upon the grave of William Tallis, where they quote from the poem Adonais by Percy Bysse Shelley :That Light whose smile kindles the Universe, That Beauty in which all things work and move, That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love Which through the web of being blindly wove By man and beast and earth and air and sea, Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me, Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.and share a hard-boiled egg.Such are the bare bones of the rather meager plot, but the real meat of the book is Huxley's scorching attacks on Man's faith in himself :Cruelty and compassion come with chromosomes; All men are merciful and all are murderers. Doting on dogs, they build their Dachaus; Fire whole cities and fondle the orphans; Are loud against lynching, but all for Oakridge; Full of future philanthropy, but today the NKVD. Whom shall we persecute, for whom feel pity ? It is all a matter of the moment's mores, Of words on wood pulp, of radios roaring, Of Communist kindergartens or first communions. Only in the knowledge of his own Essence Has any man ceased to be many monkeys.and on the idea of Progress :Progress --the theory that you can get something for nothing; the theory that you can gain in one field without paying for your gain in another; the theory that you alone can understand the meaning of history; the theory that you know what's going to happen fifty years from now; the theory that, in the teeth of all experience, you can foresee all the consequences of your present actions; the theory that Utopia lies just ahead and that, since ideal ends justify the abominable means, it is your privilege and duty to rob, swindle, torture, enslave and murder all those who, in your opinion (which is, by definition, infallible), obstruct the onward march to the earthly paradise.I have to admit that I've always been so intent on using Brave New World as a scourge against totalitarian Utopias, I blinded myself to the deeply anti-technology aspects of Huxley's vision. But you can't make the same mistake here, as Huxley clobbers the reader over the head with his contempt for &quot;science&quot; :...what we call knowledge is merely another form of Ignorance--highly organized, of course, and eminently scientific, but for that very reason all the more complete, all the more productive of angry apes. When Ignorance was merely ignorance, we were the equivalents of lemurs, marmosets and howler monkeys. Today, thanks to that Higher Ignorance which is our knowledge, man's stature has increased to such an extent that the least among us is now a baboon, the greatest an orangutan or even, if he takes rank as a Saviour of Society, a true Gorilla.As court jesters once served to deflate the pomposity of kings and as servants followed Roman Emperors, whispering in their ears, &quot;Thou art human,&quot; perhaps it is the role of conservative literature, not so much to educate or convert, but to remind men of the signal human sin of hubris. If such truly is the case, it can rightly be said that no writer has done so better than Aldous Huxley.GRADE : B"},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"Ape and Essence is a brief, bizarre, and ludicrously overwritten work of dystopian fiction.

I didn't really like the ending. Otherwise, it kept your interest throughout. Not bad"},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"Two motion picture executives stumble across a screenplay in the lot. The majority of the book is the text of that document. It is about a future era, post World War III, when the residents of Southern California worship the devil and sex is outlawed except for two weeks once per year. The resulting infants are increasingly more deformed due to radiation fallout. The action of the 'film' seems to be mostly an excuse to espouse the philosophy that human kind, following the Second World War were increasingly destructive and not in cohesion with the Order of Things (i.e. Nature, God, etc.) and that led to their downfall. A lot of the points Huxley makes seem particularly true and relevant even now in the late 2000's. Although the first few chapters were almost incomprehensible to me, due to choppiness, jargon, and references to popular events and figures in the late 1940's, once the narrative turned to the screenplay, it was a fascinating tale. The pop culture references that I didn't really comprehend continued throughout the book, and it's quite possible that I've missed out on a lot of the points that were being made due to my having been born several decades later and not being familiar with those references."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"According to an online source, Huxley aimed in his writing to produce a perfect fusion of novel and essay. He intended his books to be filled with interesting opinions and striking ideas. In 'Ape and Essence' these goals can be clearly discerned, but their development is somewhat on the sketchy side. To begin, the book is actually a novella, which took around 6 or 7 hours to read, and I don't think I'm a terribly fast reader.That is not to say that ideas of considerable import can't be conveyed in a story of that length, but if they are going to have much depth of development, they must be pretty focused. Focus is the ingredient which was sacrificed in this book, to try and achieve the goal of a fusion between essay and fiction.There are two very disparate sections of the book. First, there is the introductory chapter, 'Tallis', where two Hollywood screenwriters stumble onto a mysterious script by an unknown writer. Their interest is whetted and they try to track him down, only to find he had died weeks before. This short portion ostensibly revolves around the relationship between the two screenwriters. The unnamed narrator plays passive analyst as his partner, Bob, rambles on about his financial and marital difficulties. The narrator gives us, the readers, an ongoing sly, ironic and entertaining commentary which he doesn't share with Bob.The narrator, who is obviously Huxley's spokesman, is a supremely sophisticated and intellectual screenwriter. He weaves into his observations on Bob's predicaments many philosophical and literary references. In these few pages, in the midst of the narrator's commonplace conversations, he is mentally racking up thoughts and reflections on: Gandhi, Christ, Keats, Byron, Shelley, Beddoes, Martin Luther, Rembrandt, Breughel, Piero, Plato, the Parthenon, the 'Timaeus', the \\"Republic', Marxists, Fascists, Churriguera, Catherine of Siena, Goya, Lady Hamilton, Ninon de Lenclos, and la petite Morphil. If you weren't familiar with all those people, don't feel bad. I made ample use of internet sources to fill in the gaps in my knowledge.After finishing the book, if you return to this introductory section you will realize that the ruminations of the narrator laid the groundwork for the larger story which is contained in the abandoned script. Bob epitomizes the vapid, self-absorbed, materialistic modern world as contrasted with selfless martyrs and saints such as Gandhi, Christ, and Catherine of Siena. The world usually finds it necessary to kill such people, because they interfere with the \\"order\\" of the state. The restless striving of the Romantics is a willful ignoring of the simple and nourishing spiritual solutions of the saints. The ivory-tower speculations of philosophers in quest of their proprietary versions of the 'truth' have led to the inglorious tyrannies based on Marxism and Fascism. In particular, this desire of each group to be right has led to the irrationality of wars based on nationalism and ideology. Besides the philosophical themes, Bob's troubles with women foreshadows the sexual adjustments visited on humanity in the script-story.The second section 'The Script' shows us the results of mankind's willful stupidity. But before we get into the story proper, there is a short sequence of a few pages where we are given an allegorical picture of the events which led up to the main drama. Baboons, with scientists such as Einstein and Faraday as slaves, are busily developing and perfecting ever more potent weapons of mass-destruction. It doesn't take a genius to figure out who the baboons are, and what the likely result of their tinkering will be. But sandwiched in between the first, realistic part of the novella, and the projected world of the future where humans are again humans, although in some cases mutated, it seems disruptive to have this isolated fragment of animals as people.The remainder of the book, which is by far the largest portion, delves into the way humans have adapted to the destruction of civilization, and endeavors to continue that fusion of fiction and essay. Philosophical and theological ideas are the animating forces behind the events which transpire. To give the story human interest, there is the struggle of a post-apocalyptic man and woman to make a humanly acceptable life for themselves despite the recurring irrational tyranny of those in control.It is a bizarre world of the future which Huxley imagined, with a new religion devoted to Belial, or Satan. The normal relation of the sexes has been disrupted both by mutation and imposition of the authorities. The weirdness of this future society might have attracted a cult following for the book if the highly cultured essayistic element weren't so blatant.After reading the book, I can say that it stirred up thoughts that the human race may be on the wrong path, but as the story itself suggests, there seems to be little to be done except try to pursue your individual happiness to the best of your ability. The ideas of the book were too general and spread much too thinly to broaden our understanding in significant ways."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"I remember the first time I tried to read this book and couldn't shake the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; image that danced around my head.

Somewhere between these two stages of hislife and artistic career, Huxley wrote Ape and Essence. Itshumor is almost indistinguishable from its horro, a trulysuccessful work from that point of view only. Add to thatone of the most unique narrative formats ever used (a 30some-odd page short story acting as a preface to this sci-fiscreenplay), an absolute irreverence for contemporary Holly-wood and the future of organized religion, a contrasting ofguilt with passive irresponsibility, and an uncharacteristic(for Huxley) optimistic ending. This is one of those booksyou'll never see in a book store and you might even be hardpressed to find it in most libraries. Still, it's nothingshort of a treasure. It's sharp and warped and it makes youthink a whole hell of a lot."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"It is too bad that one cannot give eight stars out of five for this book. Ape and essence is a very funny novel about a movie writer, William Tallis who wrote a screenplay. Unfortuanately the screenplay got rejected after it got discovered by a couple of studio writers who found the screenplay after it fell off of a truck. The screenplay was one of thousands being sent to the incinerator. In fact, on the screenplay cover, was written in pencil, &quot;Rejection slip sent, 11-6-47, for the incinerator.&quot; Twice underlined.The two studio writers decided to visit William Tallis at his ranch in California only to discover that he died 6 months before.However, we readers are treated with the script in its bawdy entirety. The book is funny because it is a parody of the Hollywood mentality and that any writer would take the time and have the audacity to write such a script and hand it in to a studio for consideration. And that this script would be rejected as a matter of course, for Ape and Essence was written in 1947, and can you imagine a moviegoing audience of that era walking away after seeing such a film?! The film Ape and Essence includes such surrealistic imagery such as a female baboon frying sausages, Michael Faraday and Albert Einstein on a leash, held captive by baboons, a Chief wearing a jacket freshly plucked from an exumed corpse, the scream of the slaughter by bulls' pizzles and priests expectorating and spitting when confronted by the spectacle of the manin character, Alfred Poole, having sex with various women. &quot;Don't mind us,&quot; a priest explains,&quot;after all, Belial day comes only once a year.&quot;The movie ends with a scene of eggshells falling onto a grave.That is a very Eraserhead, and Pink Flamingos type of ending for a movie.

Firstly, Ape and Essence is a topical satire of Hollywood that remains true today. The story starts with one Hollywood writer who has been turned down for a raise, walking with his friend in a Hollywood lot when out of a truck falls a script, one of thousands of such scripts; written on it, is &quot; Rejection Slip sent, 11-6-47, for the Incinerator. 'Twice Underlined&quot;.It is a hilarious story, ribaldly funny in its imagery and implications with a hilarity that is unmatched. The audacity for a writer to send in such a script, some of the images the reader is treated with, are a stout housewifely baboon, frying eggs, Michal Faraday on a leash held captive by a female ape, two Albert Einsteins, each on a leash held by apes. The Einsteins are placated with sugar cubes while the apes gorge on rum and bologna. A Chief wearing clothes freshly plucked from a corpse. A religious high patriarch expectorating as Poole, just finishes making love to two women.&quot;After all, Belilal day come once a year&quot;, the scenes are hilarious and end with eggshells from a boiled egg falling on to a grave. A very Pink Flamingos and Eraserhead type ending.Now can you imagine an audience in the late 1940s watching such a movie. Half of the audience would walk out and those that did not would have their minds totally blown!!!I wonder if I will ever read a novel as thoroughly funny and entertaining as Ape and Essence?"},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"Huxley starts this novel with two Hollywood types discovering a screenplay by William Tallis. They track him down only to find out that he has passed on, and the rest of the novel is his screenplay. Taking place in the year 2108 we come to find that there has been a Third World War and North America and other parts of the world have been nuked. The danger of the radiation has subsided and people are beginning to explore these parts of the world. The main character Dr. Alfred Poole happens to be with an exploration crew from New Zealand and they are studying California.We come to find that the people are mutated from the radiation, are experiencing the bottleneck effect and know that their race will eventually reach extinction. They've also created a Satanic theocracy to govern their lives complete with rituals and societal values that are realistically exaggerated versions of what actually exist in the world today in regards to sexism and religion.While vastly different than Brave New World, both novels carry Huxley's ability to evaluate his current society--the scientific and technological advances, as well as political corruptions--and imagine them forward into scarily accurate and possibly prophetic depictions of the future of the human race.Interesting note: Pay attention to how William Tallis wanted to buried and how he is actually buried."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"To me, Huxley was someone who had cultivated his mind with great passion and independence, and was also a great writer. The former attribute makes the novel, which is very well written, also a very probing and insightful look at humanity.It is interesting that the grandson of Thomas Huxley, a scientist that expanded on Darwin's theory of evolution, should be so keenly aware of humankind's tendency to devolve, rather than evolve. In a post-apocalyptic setting, a group of ape-people essentially worship Satan, although they know that he has been their downfall since the beginning of time. They see him as the cause of their suffering, but nevertheless try to live a life that they believe would be in accordance with his will.I took this symbolism as sign of a race that has been so totally destroyed that they have resigned themselves to the worst that humankind has ever been. When Huxley wrote Brave New World, the nuclear bomb had not been invented, and this enormous threat obviously shook the world, although we take it almost for granted these days. I think Huxley dealt with that threat pretty well here.I think overall that this book is a very interesting take on post-apocalyptic society, one of the best. I don't think it is the most masterfully crafted thing that Huxley ever wrote. Also, I didn't find it a fun book to read. I found Brave New World to have much more humor. I think that lack of humor may be one of the downfalls of this book, but at the same time, why should one find humor in this utterly horrifying situation? And having said all of that, if you find Huxley to be a great thinker or you like his imagination, I wouldn't pass up this book.Huxley wrote with optimism, cynicism, foresight, and in this case, horror. It seems to me that all of the possible outcomes he talked about are coming true.I also recommend The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell which come in the same book."},{"Title":"Ape and Essence (The collected works of Aldous Huxley)","review":"This novel is a must read for anyone who has the slightest interest in Aldous Huxley...

The movie industry employees seek out the writer only to find he has been dead for a few weeks. After this revelation, the book jumps into the actual script. The script reads like a cheap romance novel. In a strange savage land, a man from civilization falls in love with a primative woman. They face conflict, but there forbidden love endures. They run away together and live happily. And we never find out what happens to the ever so fortunate movie mogels who rescued the script from incineration.Was Aldous Huxley suffering from writer's block when he wrote this?

It is not very good."},{"Title":"Female \\"Circumcision\\" in Africa: Culture, Controversy, and Change (Directions in Applied Anthropology: Adaptations & Innovations)","review":"This review is of both this book and Ellen Gruenbaum's \\"The Female Circumcision Controversy.\\" The rating only applies to this book.A seemingly endless parade of more-or-less interchangeable articles and books about female genital cutting (FGC) appeared in the 80's and 90's, each apparently attempting to outdo the last in the ferocity of its denunciation of the patriarchy, its explanations as to why FGC is nothing at all like male genital cutting (MGC) and its affirmation of the horrors of FGC. Recent years have gifted us with a triumvirate of fresh, insightful books, willing to re-examine all aspects of the topic, puncturing tired old dogma with insightful scholarship and refreshing skepticism. (The newest of these three works, the recently published Genital Cutting and Transnational Sisterhood, edited by Stanlie M. James and Claire C. Robertson, will be reviewed next issue.)The opening chapter of Female \\"Circumcision\\" in Africa: Culture, Controversy, and Change, written by its editors, makes it clear we are in for quite a ride with this book. Shell-Duncan and Hernlund question the accuracy of the \\"laundry list of adverse health outcomes\\" so pervasive in earlier works on FGC, noting that they often stem from \\"observations by British colonial surgeons and gynecologists in the 1930s and 1940s.\\" Self-reported retrospective survey data, the bread and butter basis for the contentions of old-school FGC writing, suffers from recall bias. The editors argue that FGC is often less extensive than is assumed (for example, infibulation often leaves the clitoris intact) and also note evidence that other sex organs partially compensate for loss of sexual pleasure by becoming more sensitive. Shell-Duncan and Hernlund highlight the striking absence from the literature of systematic evaluations of FGC's impact on fertility, and also stress the ceremonial importance of both FGC and MGC as markers of transition from androgynous childhood into gendered adulthood.The book's authors repeatedly allude to critics who have inquired into the basis for ignoring male circumcision while opposing even a ceremonial nick of female genitalia.Increasing trends away from traditional practitioners and toward medicalization of FGC in Africa is changing the nature and impact of the practices. Several authors discuss the growing African backlash against western feminist opposition to FGC, which all too often is superficial and ideological, lacking sensitivity to the procedure's cultural meanings. Lynn Thomas, writing about Kenyan campaigns to eliminate FGC, notes that Africans have come to resent Westerners' focus on their practices while neglecting more pressing developmental issues such as the need for adequate food and water and for control of AIDS.Several authors springboard their own analyses off of Janice Boddy's seminal 1982 study interpreting genital cutting as symbolically accentuating women's fertility by deemphasizing their sexuality. Both Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf and Gerry Mackie raise fascinating cross-cultural comparisons with Chinese footbinding, noting that mothers in both cultures provide almost identical rationales (enhanced marriage prospects, conformity) for forcibly modifying their daughters' bodies in what they portray as an act of \\"mother's love.\\" Mackie provides a fascinating analysis of analogies between FGC and Chinese footbinding, writing that \\"both customs are nearly universal where practiced, are persistent, and are practiced even by people who oppose them.\\" He shows that eliminating both practices requires the offering of a socially acceptable alternative to avoid the potential disaster of loss of girls' marriageability. Associations of parents must join together and pledge to favor marriages of their sons to uncut women, as was done in China with footbinding. Such practices, according to Mackie, tend either to end rapidly or persist indefinitely, as was the case with footbinding, which lasted for 1,000 years and then ended within a generation. For her part, Abusharaf painstakingly yet fairly takes the notoriously intransigent Fran Hosken to task for her egregious oversimplifications of \\"the complex tapestry of values that account for [FGC's] resilience among a wide range of societies,\\" which ironically renders Hosken's own work ethnocentric and fatally unconcerned with the \\"specificity of women's experience.\\"In the next chapter, Lori Leonard, writing about the recent adoption (!) of FGC in Southern Chad, similarly critiques Mary Daly's interpretations of FGC which ignore \\"socioeconomic, political and historical context, us[ing] inflammatory and distancing language... and thereby effectively alienate precisely those women whom they purport to help.\\" Leonard intriguingly notes that infibulation may have started in certain countries as \\"a practical solution to the need to control body odors, particularly those produced by menstruation, given off by female herders.\\" Claudie Gosselin writes that in Mali she has found \\"a significant number of people who felt insulted by the statements of anticircumcision activists because the information presented contradicted their own knowledge and common sense.\\"Michelle C. Johnson comments that Muslim Mandinga populations in Guinea-Bissau \\"linked circumcision for boys and clitoridectomy for girls first and foremost to religious identity--a factor that has been significantly less explored in the ethnographic literature on the subject.\\" Women in these communities believe circumcision is necessary for them to have the right to pray. For both males and females, stoically enduring the cutting is highly valued as demonstrating strength and courage. Moreover, the pain and suffering from the initiation play \\"a transformative role that extends beyond the ritual context of initiation into everyday life.\\" Mandinga women consider the actual cutting of the clitoris to be the most important part of the initiation.A number of the book's contributors show that legislation and other external attempts to \\"eradicate\\" FGC have proven to be poor tools for social change, as consciousness-raising from within is much more effective. Ylva Hernlund notes that legal approaches can be counterproductive; fear that a law will be passed can lead to all girls being circumcised \\"before it is too late.\\" Mackie writes that a \\"legal prohibition is most appropriate at the climax of the national process of abandonment, not at its beginning.\\" He adds that criminalizing a practice before most people oppose it will be ineffective, which may suggest a cautionary message for those of us tempted to rely primarily or exclusively on legal techniques in our efforts to eliminate male circumcision in North America.Several authors decry the unjustified conflation of various forms of FGC and an overemphasis in the literature on the less common but more drastic infibulation. A number of the book's contributors write that in direct contradiction of feminist dogma, females tend to defend the institution of FGC more vigorously than their male counterparts. Males also speak more negatively about their own initiations relative to females. While we find FGC horrifying, as Mackie fearlessly writes, \\"for an insider FGC is more like dentistry than it is like violence.\\"The most fascinating article comes last. Fuambai Ahmadu, born and raised in her \\"formative years\\" in Sierra Leone, has spent the majority of her life in Washington, D.C. but decide to return to her home village and undergo its excision rite. Ahmadu relates her harrowing yet fascinating tale with admirable honesty, intelligence and perspective, not to mention virtually unparalleled authority, concluding that today, in the wake of her own excision, she is \\"'neutral' in terms of continuation of the practice.\\"No single author could possibly produce a book as broad-ranging as the volume edited by Shell-Duncan and Hernlund, but Ellen Gruenbaum gives it her best shot. Based on her five years of work in the rural Sudan with infibulating communities, she offers us a thoughtful and engaging meditation on cultural, social and physical aspects of FGC, Gruenbaum \\"categorically reject[s] the simplistic analysis that female \`circumcision' is a conspiracy of men to oppress women.\\" She shows that FGC is not \\"a single phenomenon with a single purpose such as \`controlling women' or \`suppressing female sexuality.'\\" Trained as an anthropologist, the author analyzes her experiences as they relate to the suggestion that patriarchy explains FGC, the ritual and its meanings, marriage and morality, ethnicity (circumcision status often serves as a marker of one's tribal identity), sexuality (Gruenbaum's subjects made it clear to her they did experience orgasm), and economic development. Female circumcision, the author writes, \\"offers a major test of whether it is possible to reconcile cultural relativist respect for cultural diversity with the desire to improve the lives of girls and women across cultural boundaries.\\"Regarding the potential for eliminating the practices, Gruenbaum notes that \\"women's insecure position in society needs to change before fundamental rejection of circumcision can be achieved.\\" The possibility of developing alternative rites is mentioned, such as the Kenyan example of \\"circumcision through words\\" in which no cutting is done. Gruenbaum's book includes a helpful list of organizations focused on FGC and mentioning NOCIRC along with eight other groups.Useful charts and maps in both books help to render more accessible and comprehensible the sometimes bewildering range of prevalence and type of practice in Africa's different countries. Bettina Shell-Duncan & Ylva Hernlund and Ellen Gruenbaum have crafted engaging, thought-provoking works likely to prove invaluable in the years ahead as attention to analogies and differences between MGC and FGC can be expected to grow."},{"Title":"The Timetables of History A Horizontal Linkage of People and Events","review":"As a writer and teacher, this book has been very helpful.

For example, the year I was born, 1945 was the year that Vitamin A was synthesized, that Carousel played in New York, that Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Guggenheim Museum and that George Orwell wrote the Animal Farm.

This publication contains the 4x4 odysseys that start in Shoshone, Beatty, Scotty's Castle, Ballarat and Trona. This quality work is accompanied with various appendices, an extensive bibliography and an index. The Mitchell Scale is the defacto standard in assessing the difficulty of dirt roads. Given the remoteness, ruggedness and enormous size, four wheel driving in this area is very dangerous. Don't find out from experience why the place is called Death Valley. Get Roger Mitchell's \\"Death Valley SUV Trails;\\" it is the single most useful guide to the National Park's backcountry roads.\\"40 Excursions\\" (2006) replaced \\"46 Excursions\\" (2001). This review appears under the 2001 entry since there currently is no entry for the updated version. It is laughable that copies of the book are starting at $45.00 since the newest version can be had for twenty bucks at any regional gift shop or through the publisher's web site (Track & Trail Publications)."},{"Title":"Death Valley SUV trails: A guide to 46 four-wheeling excursions in the backcountry in and around Death Valley National Park (Great Basin SUV trail series)","review":"This book provides information on a large number of great trips in the Death Valley area. I've personally used this book as a guide for several trips and have found it to be reasonably accurate (which is difficult considering the constantly changing conditions in the Death Valley area). The author provides a lot of extra information pertaining to human and natural history which adds to the interest of the trip and gives ideas for further research. The author has also written several other useful guides which are also very useful."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"My husband and I loved the affirmation of this book. We laughed out loud at some of the metaphors. We thought the book had such great insight, that he had me buy it for our 2 married daughters. I certainly will help keep what's important in your marriage in perspective when your children are little."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book explores issues that go deeper than the usual. It is great for a woman's study because it can help stir up some topics that aren't often discussed but are sorely needed to be talked about in a safe environment. If a husband knew how good this book is, they might go and buy the book for their wives!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Paul writes that older women should teach the younger to love their husbands and their children. These women have fulfilled that calling in their authorship of this incredible book. It touches on the topics our parent's and churches neglect - topics so important that marriages fall apart over them! It's time to think about sex, ladies, and it's time to think about it the way God wants us to...I urge you, if you have hangups or problems with intimacy, read this book - with the help of the Holy Spirit as your teacher, God will SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE!!!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I would recommend this book to couples having difficulty in marriage. I reaad the book because I wanted to know what it said."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"If you are struggling in your personal intimate life with your husband, please read this book. It is very balanced, biblical, and compassionate. I love how these ladies are very balanced in their thinking and really delve into the scriptures for accuracy and clarity. It is very liberating to read this and have your mind renewed through scripture about how God created sex to be a beautiful celebration between a husband and a wife. I have really been liberated in my thinking and now I seek to please my husband, which I could never do before. I was too bound up in my emotions and thoughts because of very negative experiences that I had before I was married that tainted my view of intercourse. I wasn't able to really enjoy it the way God intended. I realized that I have robbed my husband of so much pleasure for so many years. No longer! This book has changed our marriage for the better."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I was utterly amazed that the books I purchased were just like brand new! In hard back editions and extremely new condition! I had purchased 5 at one time and they all were awesome!! Thanks so much! I will be a repeat customer!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book has been awesome in answering questions women just don't ask and don't talk about. A great view of marriage and intimacy from God's point of view."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book has great Christian perspective for those who are already married or who are soon to be married. It calls attention to the gift of sex that God has created for us and reminds us of the crucial role that it plays in the health of a marriage. The best part of this book is that it explains the different ways that men and women view sex and how it effects their emotional relationships with one another. I would definitely recommend this book to other Christian women who want to make their marriages the most they can be!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"this is a very practical straightforward book, but you should preview the questions before you purchase it in order to see if it applies to you and your particular circumstances."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"So many people have issues in their past and this really helps you to realize what some of those issues might be because sometimes we don't know that there are things in our subconscious.This is a book that will help you as an individual and as a married couple. My husband and I both have read this book multiple times and each time we get something new out of it. I don't recommend reading it in the bath tub, as I have replaced our copy about 5 times due to excessive water log!You have to actually know someone well, or counsel people to be able to recommend this book to others. It is a very personal subject and therefore is not easily brought up. However, if you do find yourself with those types of opportunities, this is a great book to recommend."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book sounded more promising than it turned out to be. Alone, it has little real value, but if used as a base for conversation (like a women's Bible study or in premarital counseling) it has real merit.1. The authors say things that need to be said and take a moderate view of sexuality. They are neither prudes nor libertines. I'm in my mid-20s and could feel comfortable talking through the book with a spiritual mentor or my mom.2. It isn't an idealistic book promising unbridled passion. As a single, I found the discussion of how to work sex, marriage, and family together good, interesting, and realistic. They encourage women to make time for love and sex, to see it as a priority that underpins marriage and as such, enriches the whole family.3. This is really about boundaries than it is instructional or explicit. Lots of other sources do that, and they mention resources.4. They went over a lot of personal, inner-life issues that stand in the way of many women having a free, open sex life with their husbands. Sexual abuse, past sexual sins, abortion, body image, etc. are addressed compassionately and clearly. They speak freedom and forgiveness.The negatives are worth considering...1. I didn't learn anything, except that when I have kids, it might be a good idea to have a schedule to get the kids out and give us some alone time. They give suggestions for how to do that on a budget.2. Most of the ideas for keeping the romance there were pretty cheesy. Maybe my generation is bombarded so much with sexuality that I'm inured.3. This is a really big one for me--the book is duty-oriented. The first time it comes up, it's a nice example. Then it keeps coming. For a women's sex book, this focused a lot more on his needs than I thought was good. I got the message that yes, women are sexual and that's good, but your needs are still second to his because he's using sex to express the emotions he's not capable of saying (since he's a man and all). Carry on in your duty is the answer for a few problems or scenarios that I thought would be better dealt with in a therapy session with a Christian sex therapist (like inability to orgasm).Would I buy it again or give it to a friend? Yes. If I were giving this to someone, though, I would give it with caveats and suggestions to read some other sex books. If people are looking for instruction and know what they believe already, why not branch out into the secular world on this topic since they write a lot more books on the subject than our side?"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I bought this book because as a Christian wife, I had some questions about what is not allowed by God in the marriage relationship. This book is an excellent source for women who are seeking answers to many different questions about sex and marriage. I highly recommend this book to any woman who is looking to improve her overall relationship with her husband."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I am a Minister to a young married couples class. One couple asked me to lunch and asked me questions regarding intimacy that I had never encountered before. Chapter 11 of this book was a tremendous help and, Praise God, allowed me to begin a reconciliation within a young couple.I do not agree with the one dissent in the reviews before mine. If God did not want us to enjoy sex within marriage then why did He inspire Song of Solomon?This is a Great Ministers Resource. Please give it a look."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book provides an awesome resource for all women, whether you are struggling with issues of intimacy or even if your sexual relationship with your husband is great. The authors give inspiring reasons to keep your sexual relationship with your husband as a lifelong priority and plenty of fun ideas to keep your sexual passion growing. This book includes a powerful study program to help grow in your sexuality as well as find healing from past hurst and mistakes; it makes a very good mentoring or counseling guide. I worked through it personally with a trusted mentor and found that to be the time I have personally grown the most and my marriaged is greatly changed because of it. There are some tough issues and deep hurts addressed here. I really recommend working through the book with someone else because sometimes it seems to difficult to work through these issues without someone else's accountability and encouragement. As other reviewers mentioned, it does not address fertility, and I think that issue is beyond the scope of this one volume and deserves a book of its own to be addressed properly and sensitively."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"...Christian women discuss privately among themselves. With gentle candor, Dillow and Pintus explore the biblical basis for sex within the framework of a covenant relationship while exposing worldly myths and misconceptions that have crept into our thinking. The authors include helpful hints for righting past sexual wrongs, becoming an exciting lover, and staying faithful to your life partner. A great book! It should be required reading for every married Christian woman."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I am engaged, and just finished reading this book. It has been so incredibly helpful. I would recommend it to any woman (whether married or not) because I think it accurately displays the aspect of sex like the Bible intends for it to be. I have never had sex before, yet learned so much from this book because it discussed sex as it's meant to be- in such a healthy, beautiful way. It is also a great book for anyone who has been abused or has not lived in an environment in which sex was a healthy thing."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book really helped me to view sex through God's eyes. I feel rejuvinated in this area because God has opened my eyes to the way He not Hollywood thinks about sex. It asks and answers great questions and includes suggestions and prayer focuses for your renewal. I would buy this book 100 times!!!!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"If any of you were like me who struggled with being a godly AND sensuous wife, then read this book! This book has set me free!! Intimacy with my husband has grown deeper as a result.This book also gives biblical insight on God's wonderful gift of sex. The authors do a wonderful job of explaining Song of Solomons in the way it was intended. It's true that you can go to the Bible for information on anything!!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book has helped me tremoundously regarding 'intimate issues' in my own life. I am highlighting MANY areas in the book and sharing the knowledge with other christian women friends who struggle with being a Godly and sensual woman at he same time. Each 'issue' is backed up by Scripture and that has been so helpful to me. Alot of time and effort has been taken by the authors to delve into scripture and study what God says to us about 'ministering' to our husbands by becoming the kind of wife GOD himself would have us to be. I highly recommend this book to anyone searching in these areas of your life."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This is my favorite book on sex for christian women. When I first tried to read this book I threw it in the woodstove and burned it!!! So marred was my view of my own sexuality. I bought the book again and made myself read it. I diligently did the 12 week bible study in the back of this book applying God's word to my own sexuality. I became a new person! This book changed my sex life with my husband, for the better! If you are a christian woman and believe in the power of God's word then get this book."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"For any bride-to-be looking for some contemporary, educational, clear-cut information and wisdom - we give this at every bridal shower!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"THis book is an excellent biblical reference to the issues women struggle with in relationship to the differences between men and women."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"It is so important that we realize this book is for married people, not older teens. This book applies christian principles to sexual intimacy between husband and wife not for those who fornicate. I encourage all to keep this book sacred and not use it as a tool to engage in sinful sexual practices"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Excellent book. Authors did a remarkable work in giving biblical foundation for their book. Personal comments were appreciated as well as information from studies on this topic. Highly recommend to all married women."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This is a great read for any Christian woman. It addresses issues that you probably won't hear during a normal conversation. And let's face it...all married women have questions. This is a classic that I have ordered for all my married nieces."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book is great reading for the Christian woman. I have found in my ministry that it is very difficult for many women to make the transition from being single to married. A single woman in the church is required to keep herself sexually pure but after she is married she is expected to be the sexual partner of her husband. Many Christian women come into marriage with wrong views of sex and their own sexuality. This book addresses many of their concerns in a simple, straightforward and frank way. This book is not a \\"how-to\\" manual, however it is written for adults only. I confess that a few of the sections of the book made me blush.Men should consider reading this book as well. In fact, I would recommend that married Christian couples read it together. If nothing else, after reading the book, men will understand more about their wives' perspective of sex. The husband will come to realize some of his wife's fears, anxieties and concerns regarding sex in the marriage relationship.I would further recommend that pastors keep a copy of this book on the shelf to help them in marriage counseling and premarital counseling. The book deals with a very important topic in every married person's life. The material and perspective is relevant and Biblical.Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Before receiving this book in the mail, I'd expected an old-fashioned view from the authors on what they thought sex in a Christian marriage should look like; however, Linda Dillow and Lorraine Pintus were honest and straightforward in their approaches to common questions that we ask about sex. What also helped is that the authors retrieved candid \\"snapshots\\" from real women who had both real issues and real accomplishments in various areas of their sexual lives with their husbands. It made me feel better knowing that other women faced some of the same sexual issues that I have in my own marriage.The questions at the end of each chapter, and at the end of the book, serve to \\"cement\\" what we've learned and help us to be completely honest with ourselves. The best part of the book is that we're offered tons of scripture that \\"back up\\" what the women are informing us of. The book is not entirely based on their opinions. I'd definitely recommend this book to any married woman--young or old/spiritually mature or spiritually immature. It has definitely helped me to improve my sexual relationship with my husband."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Well written and biblically based; teaching us how to enjoy our sex lives... Christian or not, we should all have access to these types of insightful perspectives before we get married. Thank you - Lorraine and Linda - for taking time to explore the issue, using such refreshing and concise information that we can all relate to and apply to our lives."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book is a great book for married couples with children. It is difficult to think about having sex with your husband, when you have 3 toddlers at your knees. It is a practical guide to keep your marriage sizzling, from a Christian perspective."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I'm really enjoying reading this book. It has a wonderful message, and is very easy to read. It's definitely worth the money."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"If your wife has a negative attitude toward sex due to bad past experiences or conservative religious constraints because she has been taught to see sex as \\"sinful,\\" \\"dirty,\\" a \\"burden,\\" or something that \\"only men enjoy,\\" then I recommend this book. My wife had religeous/upbringing constraints that gave her the idea that sex was dirty, a burden for women, and something that only men enjoyed. She read the first three chapters and to my dismay changed her attitude about the topic by helping her to dispell years of toxic attitudes toward sex. Can't wait to see what will happen when she reads the entire book! Although the book is based on a Christian point of view toward sex (sometimes giving the impression of being boring and preachy simply on the basis of writing it in a Christian-point-of view), it is not patronizing or preachy. Its aim is to break down negative views about sex and to replace them with more positive attitudes toward sex, in the view of God, in an effort to promote a healthy sexual relationship among [married] couples. The author treats sex as a gift from God when it is used responsibly. It uses scripture to support healthy sexual relations; it does it in a manner that does not condemn sex but encourages sex among married couples. I would agree with another person who commented that this book would be a great gift to married couples and to those who are about to marry."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Intimate Issues by Linda Dillow and Lorraine Pintus is subtitled 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex, and boy, does it deliver! I think that many people have the idea that Christians think that all sex is bad and that even happy Christian marriages are boring and cold in the bedroom. The authors are determined to put that myth to rest, and if it isn't a myth in your marriage, to teach you that it's absolutely ok to have a vibrant and happy sex life. By incorporating Scripture and personal anecdotes the book explains that sex was created by God to enhance marriage and should be a beautiful part of it. The authors use The Song of Solomon to illustrate exactly what a wife's role in sex should be, as well as what is acceptable biblically (a lot more than you'd think) and what's not. They also tackle issues that may be causing trouble in the bedroom like self-image issues and physical problems. Sex can be a determining factor in whether a marriage survives. Whether your sex life is fabulous or floundering, there's a lot of great info in this book for everyone."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"First thing you ask is, why is a man reading this book? Well, both my wife and I had questions and have been searching for answers, and things to do to spice up our marriage of 26 years. I bought it mainly for her. It turned out that after I read the first paragraph about the preacher and sailing, I could not put it down. It allowed me to venture into a area about women and romance that will truly change our life as we know it. The title is a little misleading, because men (because we are macho) will probably pass on this one. I strongly urge all males to read and share with your wife this amazing book on christian marriage(I will bet that your arousal of the mind will not be the only thing that will be affected) The authors did an excellent job in their research and should be congraulated."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I have read a lot of books, trying to find my place in my christian marriage. THIS is by far the clearest and most honest and direct book I have ever seen. I am half way through the book and already I have seen changes in my attitude! I am already planning on reading this book again when I am done. If you dont know what a christian wife is suppose to do to be Godly with her husband, THIS is the book to get!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This is the best book!!! I read it in 2 nights and now I want to reread it and do the individual questions after each chapter. If you think your sex life is stale then you NEED this book! It will totally transform your way of thinking!!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book is perfect for the new bride, but also for any woman who is married and seeking a better understanding and appreciation of sexuality. It talks about many issues that a woman needs to think about, but rarely feels free to address in Christian circles. Also, it is firmly grounded with references to Biblical texts. It helped me become excited again about God's good gift of sexuality."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I take my hat off to Linda and Lorraine for thier candor, compassion, &amp; leadership as unabashed, sensuous, and Godly lovers of thier husbands. It is absolutely awesome to find a truly Godly perspective on a subject that, throughout history, has often been just as convaluded in religious circles as secular. Even if you think you have it all together in this area, give this study a try. You will be pleasantly suprised at the growth it will stimulate in this important and beautiful aspect of your marraige. As a side note if you are looking for a book on sexual purity/questions before or outside of marraige I highly recommend &quot;And the Bride wore white; seven secrets to sexual purity&quot; by Dahannah Gresh."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Once again, Linda Dillow offers her help and wisdom. She is an ispiration to all who read her books. Based on Scripture, she answers all the questions a woman, and a man, can have on sex. Specifically, she let's us know what is NOT okay and what is okay between a married couple; while remaining respectful and tactful in her presentation. I read portions of the book to my husband;he too has enjoyed listening to her insight in helping us to live a life in the light with God."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I'm preparing for marriage, and I was curious about a lot of the issues in this book. Despite different portions of the book being super conservative and quoting some verses of the Bible that I think are translated a bit too literally, given the context of the scripture, I think it is a great book with a lot of solid information and advice that I will utilize in the future!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I reccomend this for any wife, any time in her marriage. It's also a great gift for a Christian woman to read before she marries. It starts things out in the right context. The authors are wonderfully honest about issues concerning sex in marriage, everything from rekindling the flame or overcoming past guilt or pain. A very useful tool for understanding and improving this aspect of your marriage."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I'm sorry to say that this book is typical of christian books on sex. The authors have a pre-determined opinion on a sexual subject, look for passages in the bible to support their opinion, then say that this proves they were right. They, like most christian authors, use the more common MISTRANSLATIONS of the bible (e.g. King James Version) and also ignore the passages in the bible that contradict their opinions. They also ignore what are the common interpretations of passages by biblical SCHOLARS (people who know what the bible means by studying the bible and related texts for most of their lives, along with the history and languages of the biblical cultures) and instead choose to believe whatever is the common interpretation that people they know have chosen. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! If you truly want to learn about sex, you should do so from someone with at least a rudimentary education. God gave us a capacity for learning. I don't believe he wanted us to blindly follow people who have no good reason for what they believe other than that's just what everyone they know thinks. Also, the reason why so many women give high praises to this book in their reviews is that the author, since she is giving only opinions, tells misconceptions about what the bible says about sex that are believed by other women, thus reinforcing these misconceptions as well as earning praise for saying things with which others already wanted to believe. If you are in a marriage, think very carefully about what the effect will be if you do (or more likely do NOT do) the things this book says."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book was wonderful. It made such a difference in my marriage. I would recomend this to all married women, and any woman who is engaged."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"God used this book in an amazing way in my life. It really brought encouragement and help my marriage. I have given it to many other people and they have also found Godly advise in it. I got the book many years ago right after I had heard Linda Dillow speak. I now have her new book,Intimacy Ignited: Conversations Couple To Couple,it is also very good."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I bought this book after several women in my bible study mentioned it; we were doing Every Woman's Marriage at the time. They couldn't say enough great things about this book. Eh, I wasn't impressed. The author seems to be very repetitive. I have limited time to read with a toddler and reading the same things over and over is frustrating! I didn't get any great ideas from the book. Will probably sell mine used on Amazon in the near future!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book did a miracle in my life!! It was truly inspired by the Holy Spirit because after having read so many other secular and Christian books about marital issues, nothing compared to the impact &quot;Intimate Issues&quot; had in my life. I was never able to be changed from inside out like I was after I read it. Some books offer quick-fixes and external make-overs that deal with the issue in very broad, superficial, and unrealistic ways. I am very thankful for Linda and Lorraine. By reading their book I was freed to get the best of God's gift in its fullness. Publishers, please get this book translated into Portuguese!!! I had the chance to lead a study group on the first chapter during a visit to a church in Brazil. The Brazilian ladies want more. This book doesn't speak to American ladies only; it will certainly be a blessing to other Brazilians as it has been to me."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Thank goodness :) In my opinion the best part of this book was realizing that I'm not the only Christian woman who is asking some of these questions. Their advice resonates with what I've read in the Bible, and I found their discussion of the Song of Solomon absolutely fascinating. I'll never read that part of the Bible the same again. I have only one request... how about this question being addressed: how do you maintain a healthy sex life while trying to conceive or during infertility?"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book should be in every room of the house!!!

Be sure not to read the secret at the back of the book before you finish the book.

It did wonders for me as far as encouragement."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book will be a valuable resource to any women.

I bought this book originally because my husband and I are new parents, and with the hustle and bustle of it all, we lost a little intamacy! I needed some christian answers to some of my concerns and questions, and this book had EXACTLY what I was looking for!!! Great answers, straight form the bible regarding love, marriage and sex within the marriage! I will tell you I was a little concerned when I looked at the date this book was written...in the 80's! I figured this book would be SO OUTDATED, but it was not! If you are having intamacy issues, or are looking to see what God's word says to some tough sex questions this book is a MUST READ!!!!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This is a great book about how God designed true lovemaking to be! It's definitely geared toward women, but I have even discussed some things with my husband. It definitely opened our conversation up to a wide variety of topics. Great investment if you desire to be a sensual wife for your husband!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I loved the book Intimate Issues. It hits on real topics women face, and a lot of them! The authors aren't afraid to speak honestly, share personal examples and challenge you to live your life as Christ calls you to. This has been the most head-on resource I've found on this topic and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This is a well designed book for women, and especially married women. In a day of mixed-messages, the authors scholarly searched Scripture in order to provide the reader with answers to some twenty-one questions a group of Christian women presented about intimate sexual matters related to a Christian woman and wife. A must read for young wives, and a helpful read for all wives regardless of age!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I highly recommend this book. I wish I would have read this book 8 years ago when I first married. My husband actually read the book first and highlighted specific parts of it for me to read more closely( I of course had to rebel and put off reading for a few weeks when he did that). When I finally did read it I was transformed. I had such a negative view about sex and had to face my own issues. The Lord really helped me to see sex from His perspective and my husband is very appreciative. Now I no longer view sex as another thing on my list. I look forward to it. This book will change your life.

A necessary read for all married women. Dillow answers many questions that Christian women have regarding sex and a godly marriage."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Okay, I'm not woman; but my wife is, and we both read and liked this book. Here's our combined review:Pros:1. Easy to read - Conversational style of writing and clear points. We each read it in one sitting.2. Adults only - Sometimes a grown-up discussion is required. This is a book for married women (and men). It is explicit and direct (without being crude) about physical sexual information. It is definitely not appropriate for girls (or boys).3. Scriptural approach - Instead of just giving motherly advice, the authors take the Bible seriously and frequently use it as a home base to direct their thoughts. Mind you, this is not a Bible study per se'. There is plenty of 21st century, frank counseling advice, but it is blended and based upon Biblical principles. Provides a scriptural index to locate where specific passages are mentioned - useful to Bible teachers.4. Practical - Lots of ideas for rekindling relationship, romance, plain sex and other aspects of adult relationship. These are ideas you can start this week.5. Both authors relate from personal experience - Both have personally wrestled with sexual questions and counseled many women. These personal accounts add a human dimension to the principles discussed. This isn't just another \\"name it and claim it\\" woman's book. Many personal stories are provided including tough ones where women are still struggling/praying through difficulties. This book explains their stories.6. Focuses on Song of Solomon - The erotic portions of the Song indicate an expressive, sensuous, even adventurous attitude in romantic sexuality. These authors aren't the first to recognize its racy sections - which has led the church to skate around it in too many cases. It is part of God's word and has a purpose; this book helps illuminate the subject.7. Good tool for adult couple communication - The frankness and openness from a woman's perspective is valuable to both men and women. This is not just another \\"men are pigs and need to change\\" woman's book. Men can learn quite a bit here without being put-off.8. Emphasizes prayer - Example prayers to help with feelings of sexual inadequacy and temptation.9. Role of Christian liberty - Scripture sets the boundaries of proper sexuality, don't just rely on Victorian era prudence. There is no compromise if the Scripture forbids certain practices, but there is responsible liberty where Scripture is silent. Provides 3 Biblical questions to ask if you aren't sure whether specific modern sexual practices belong in your marriage, (p203).10. Men - Accurately describes male sexual needs and psyche - basic, but accurate.11. Exercise - the physiological benefits for healthy sexuality are briefly explained. Encourages women to take care of, and appreciate, their bodies as they are right now. Don't try to be a supermodel.Cons/concerns:1. More insight into males - Needs more insight into male sexuality; men are half the equation. It is a women's book and does mention men have emotion and identity wrapped up in sex, but it does not provide enough examples of how this can affect common male-female relationship problems. The Scriptures showing how David, Joseph (of Genesis) and others handled, and mishandled, sex would be consistent with the books' approach, but are not discussed. Of course there are page limits for writers.2. Lays a lot at the woman's feet - It's definitely not just another \\"men are pigs\\" book - there are already plenty of those. In fact, a feminist would likely critique this book for telling women to see sex with their husband as a pleasant responsibility in marriage. If it's not pleasant this is probably rooted in a spiritual issue. The book does not try to make women sex slaves in marriage, far from it. But, there are times when sex is treated as a ministry to your husband because he has so much emotion and expressive love tied up in sex, more so than women do. This may not sit well with some women; it will probably sit just fine with most men ;-&#62;.3. Forcing modern openness about sex into the Bible? - Some conservatives might criticize the book for reading 20th century women's sexual liberation back into the Scriptures. There are some very explicit interpretations, especially in the Song of Solomon. Of course, the physical acts weren't invented recently; they may just get more attention now than in ancient times, or, maybe not. At the very least, the motive of the authors seems proper to me. Their interpretation is a corrective to the hyper prudence and stifling of healthy marital sexuality, within the Church, for many centuries. There are some risk-taking interpretations - and I think they have merit to at least be seriously considered. You'll have to read the book and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"For too long Christians have looked to the world for our view of sex. It's time we looked to the One who created it. This book is not fluff or an instant solution and it is frank enough to make many women blush. If you are willing to turn the most personal aspect of your marriage over to God, reading this book is a great place to start. I wish I had read it when my husband and I were first married. It would have saved me years of wrong attitudes and mistaken beliefs. I especially appreciated the scripture to back up every point. The 21 questions in the title are definitately questions that my Christian friends and I have thought about, but didn't know where to go for answers. I can't wait to share this with other women."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Women have questions about sex. Christian women in particular are often uncertain when determining what God's parameters for married love are. It is only right and good to examine each and every aspect of our life with the guidance of the Holy Ghost as we ask God to examine our heart and reveal any areas that may be unpleasing to Him. This task can be daunting when we begin to explore the most intimate areas of our lives. Raised in homes and churches where the subject was largely taboo, or feeling uncomfortable asking questions, many women find determining God's will for their sex life a lonely, awkward road.Delving into both the mundane and the sacred, co-authors Linda Dillow and Lorraine Pintus have stepped up to the call, providing women with a guide to discovering God's glorious, joy-filled vision for marital sex. The title seems to imply a work filled with dos, don'ts and suggestions; while all these are present Intimate Issues: Twenty-One Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex digs much deeper into underlying thought patterns, forgiveness, sexual healing and much more.The authors are ever gentle as they encourage women to seek the scriptures for themselves, to repent and get right with God, to seek Him for healing in the places they've been so deeply wounded. Their heart is well depicted in the cover art, a cup of coffee that symbolizes a warm conversation between friends as they share openly, honestly and respectfully.I've had the opportunity to read several titles aimed for Christian women on the topic of sex, each seeking to portray the act of love in the positive, life-filled context we find expressed in the word of God. Many of these works provide helpful advice, but never have I read a book that provides such a deep transformation of the mind by drawing upon scripture, prayer and true-life examples. Each chapter is a mini-therapy session in and of itself.With the section \\"Change My Heart, O God\\" additional scripture readings, reflection questions and action points are shared. Chapters exploring sexual pain from the past provide additional spiritual guidance through areas of bondage and limitation. Imagine a beloved and trusted friend praying with you through the pain of past abortions, sexual sin, and memories of abuse; Dillow and Pintus are those friends and their words in print provide much needed loving, grace-filed support. A 12-week Bible study is also included for use singly or in a woman's small group setting, providing additional journaling, prayer and reading opportunities.While the book's entire emphasis is upon the spiritual and calling on God to renew our minds and hearts in this area, if you have questions regarding the mechanics of love-making, you'll find answers here as well. While not a comprehensive manual, the questions most-asked by women regarding the physical aspects of their intimate relationships are related here as well. A wide variety of common concerns are addressed in clinically accurate language without ever descending into the vulgar and crude. As an aside - I love comprehensive indexes, and Intimate Issues provides both an index of scripture references used throughout the text as well as a topical one, should you need a specific answer immediately.Sisters, do take note of this work. It delves deeper and provides much more than comparable titles. Though written expressly for women (with the exception of the activities which involve your husband), I found myself sharing new understandings with my husband in joy and delight. I'm adding their work for couples (co-written with their husbands) Intimacy Ignited: Conversations Couple to Couple: Fire Up Your Sex Life with the Song of Solomon to my wish-list. If the quality displayed in Intimate Issues follows through in their work for couples, it too will be a powerful tool for the examination and transformation of marriages and an effective agent of spiritual growth."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I belong to a Bible study that is reading this book. What an amazing time it has been to fully ingest God's word and understand WHY HE created sex in the first place. Our views of sex have gone from to procreate to do it whenever and where ever with whom ever you want. I think that many of us Americans can say we tried that and what did it get us but some mixed up emotions and feeling in some ways used up? Was it all it was cracked up to be? Perhaps it wasn't all it was cracked up to be because we weren't going about it in the way it was planned in the first place. I always thought Christians or God's way would be for prudes....hello? Have you read the Bible? I hadn't. I had no clue. I had no idea that if you follow God's plan for sex in marriage ONLY that it could be so much better. I had no idea that God commands us to have sex almost contantly! We are only to obstain to pray for a short time and then rejoin so as to not be tempted by Satan? Read the book. Be transformed. I think this book or any book on this topic should be a must for any young couple deciding to get married. Heck, it should be earlier introduced to kids that question sex, so that they truly understand what God had planned...and to abstain not to be a prude, but because the best is yet to come. Renew your mind. Change your attitude. Enjoy God's gifts. These are lessons I have had to learn."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This wonderfully written and detail-specific book has transformed not only my sexual relationship with my husband but my image of myself as a Godly woman trying to walk wholly with the Lord. Linda and Lorraine speak frankly about attitudes and relationships, both with my husband and with my God. I did not expect a book on sexuality to have such a deep impact on my spiritual walk but it makes sense for it to have this effect now - it's an area of my life I was trying to work on without the Lord and failing miserably. I'm looking forward to doing this as a group Bible study with other women from my church. Whether you're really struggling with sexual issues or just want to move on to a new level of intimacy with your husband, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"but pretty much answered all of my questions! Ladies, have you ever been sitting with your friends, and really want to bring up a topic like this, but just can't find the nerve, for fear that you'll be labeled some kind of immoral nymphomaniac freak? Well I have, plenty of times, and that's why I'm so thankful for this book. It's like having 2 godly best friends to ask your most intimate (and sometimes embarrassing questions) to. Some of the advice surprised me, such as ok-ing the use of vibrators but vetoing pornography, plus giving all the personal anecdotes and biblical references in praise of everything from orgasms to oral sex. This book will help Christian women create the kind of sexual experiences they truly desire within their marriage. Also included is what to do when your sex drive is revved up but your husband's is in low-idle."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Intimate Issues, 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex, by Linda Dillow and Lorraine Pintus, is a book about God's intentions for your sex life. \\"What do you mean? God cares about my sex life?\\" You betcha. Not only does He care, but He created sex as part of His gift to you and your spouse; He intended for it to be a crucial part of marriage.Believers routinely become too religious for their own good. By that I mean they worry about their image to the point that they stop being real and authentic. They're so busy being a \\"good Christian\\" they hide behind a facade which is far different from the human being underneath the mask. As a result, they shy away from honest conversations about how they feel, what they think, their struggles in following Jesus, asking honest questions about God, etc. When you add to that the taboo subject of sexual relations, every Christ-follower feels completely alone on topics related to intimacy.Intimate Issues is a great book to address all the questions you were afraid to ask or, in my case, all the questions you didn't even know to ask! When I started to read this book, I was a little irritated. I thought, \\"Why am I reading this book? I don't need to read this. I have an extremely open and healthy attitude about sex. I know God intended for us to enjoy sex within the union of marriage.\\" Then I came to the subject of forgiveness for past sexual sins. Wow. I had no idea the condemnation I felt for things I did before I became a believer. I had asked God to forgive all my sins; I thought I'd forgiven myself. Boy, was I wrong! This book is leading me to freedom in that regard (I say \\"leading\\" as opposed to \\"led\\" because for many women, it's a process.)It's true that the world is too permissive when it comes to sex, but it's also true that most in the church are too repressed, rejecting God's gift of marital intimacy and the important role it was intended to play in marriage. Intimate Issues by Linda Dillow and Lorraine Pintus gives the reader an opportunity to have honest conversations about sex in a God-centered environment. It's like talking to your two best Christian friends about the topics you may not be comfortable discussing face-to-face. In addition to talking about what God intended for the marriage bed, difficult subjects are covered such as healing from sexual abuse, what to do when your husband's sex drive is low, dealing with impotency, recovering from guilt of a past abortion, pornography, and other tough topics. This book is a great resource, one I dare say any married woman should read!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"What a blessing this book has been to my marriage! My husband and I have struggled with the issues outlined in this book for a LONG time and it was as if God was speaking directly to me. It so totally explained how men feel, what they need, and yes, how they even struggle with the issues of pornography (and how it can wreck a marriage). It also helped me to wipe the slate clean of past sexual issues and partners and start a fresh, new relationship with my husband. It outlined in a gentle, loving, and often humorous way of how we need to set our &quot;self&quot; aside and view our husbands and marriage as a ministry. How our union and our sexual health is blessed by God. To be pleasing in His eyes is to be pleasing to our mate in all ways. Incredible! I have a different view and outlook on our relationship and the feelings I have for my mate are healthy and wonderful! I am thinking of recommending the bible study at my church or between my close friends."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Authors Linda Dillow and Lorraine Pintus created more than conversations, woman to woman, in their book INTIMATE ISSUES: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex. This is not a clinical book. The authors say, \\"We are not sex therapists, psychologists, or sociologists.\\"When you read the book you have a sense Dillow and Pintus are women like you and me, married to men like our husbands. Men desire an intimate relationship with their wives. The authors give clear direction and examples of how to develop a more desirable togetherness in a marriage setting. They also address issues of how to find forgiveness when a spouse is unfaithful, whether with another person or pornography; how to accept yourself when your body is aging and still allow your mate the pleasure of your body, lumpy or not; how to renew the love you felt for your spouse on your wedding day, to build a bridge into his world when everyday life demands all of your energy.INTIMATE ISSUES is a book backed up with Scripture and many other authors and clinical studies. A great book for the pastor's library, or to give as a tenth anniversary gift--something to rebuild the fire when the romance has cooled.The good news is, Intimate Issues is a book with answers--a much needed book for today's women. Thanks Waterbrook Press. The book has a 12 week study guide in the back of the book, also."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book is INCREDIBLE! It is thorough and hits on many topics that may actually be the underlying problem in your physical relationship with your husband (examples are: abuse as a child, previous sexual relationships, your husband's involvement in pornography, etc.). You will be challenged to grow as a wife, and view your husband through God's eyes. You will find out what it means to be sensual (I think that was my favorite part).However, the best part is that you will be utterly bathed in scripture. Obviously, our Pastors cannot preach these issues in detail from the pulpit on Sundays! So, this book privately walks you through God's word and teaches you all that you've missed before. It is well researched, and gives you insight into the original text (for those of us who never took Greek or Hebrew!).Love your marriage enough to read this book!"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"I reluctantly went to a bible study on sex. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how &quot;Normal&quot; I am. I would strongly encourage every married woman to bless their community, (yes I did say community) by reading this book. The truth about sex is that is was God's idea, design, and a wedding gift to the married couple. To think of sex as dirty, or anything less than a wedding gift that keeps on giving is an unopened gift of comfort, and pleasure. This book gives great permission and freedom from a biblically based view to women to ENJOY sex FULLY.It is a safe way to study about sex with other women without having to reveal anything &quot;personally&quot; in a group setting."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This book is truly wonderful, for ANY married woman-whether you are a newlywed, or if you've been married for 30 years.

This book has unique and surprisingly refreshing ideas, facts and stories--with a totally biblical premise. I highly recommend purchasing it, and maybe even forming a women's study with the 12 lessons in the back of the book.

Linda Dillow and Lorraine Pintus address real issues that are important to Christian women who want to be spiritual and sexual.In this book you will find out what God really thinks about the sexual relationship between married couples. To begin, the authors spend a few chapters explaining why sex is a good holy idea not a sinful experience. After they have dispelled some negative beliefs they dive right into 21 questions and the sometimes revealing answers.If you are not used to saying \\"God\\" and \\"Sex\\" in the same sentence then you might be in for a few surprises. Throughout the book there are meaningful prayers that speak of a merging of sexuality and spirituality.While the authors do include differences between men and women, there is also helpful advice on how to avoid having an affair, how to deal with a husband who lacks sexual interest in their wives and how to deal with a husband who is into pornography. There is also a chapter on Post-Abortion Syndrome and sexual abuse. Some of these issues may seem difficult to talk about but this book takes on each topic and presents spiritual solutions so you can have a more fulfilling marriage relationship.I can also recommend the following books written for a Christian audience:The Act of MarriageThe Act of Marriage After 40Intended for Pleasure~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"This is an honest and frank discussion of \\"intimate issues\\" from a Christian woman's perspective.

I have owned three now, because I tend to give them to friends and then we wish we had it back in our library. I have always wondered why no one ever speaks on the rules of Christian Sex. I frankly tend to think that most Pastors choose to be silent on the topic because they are unsure or afraid to misslead you. I also have always thought that the same line of thinking has put Christians in bondage with the when in dout, just don't do it line of thinking. Isn't it funny, God speaks crystal clearly when he lays down laws everywhere else in the Bible. Could it be that God dident lay down all of do's and dont's in regards to sex in merriage because he left it up to you and your spouse? I aplaud the two ladies who had the courage to step up to the riticule of the victorian mindset, and explore the scripture for what was written, not what was injected by Religion. As with all translations, you should trust the spirit to guid your decisions, just because something is ok in one couples life dose not mean that is will be ok in another. If there truly is a condemnation of an act or practice, God dosent mince words. Thanks again ladies, for the best book ever published on this topic.

Because of course, it was from a Christian POV - I should read it.I want those wasted hours my life back. I went in with a very open mind, and with complete positive intent towards the authors... but.I mean \\"BUT!\\" It was not extremely well researched, it was from a complementarian/women-only-submission point of view and quite frankly was a \\"service him all the time, and learn to enjoy it\\" kind of book. The more you get together, the more you'll like, and the more you'll want, and the more you learn about your body, the more things will work out. (not quite)And when it was not that way, it was very double talk... \\"Don't lose weight just because he says so! learn to love your body\\" - but every answer for the fact that you might not enjoy sex, or the fact you've had kids - \\"lose weight, exercise etc --- you'll feel much better about sex\\". Why not a full doctor checkup? Why not \\"see your OB/GYN stat!\\" or \\"talk to a marriage counselor\\"?Then there was the go in the mirror and look at yourself and praise every body part that G-d so wonderfully made, and declare it so. Yeah.There were some major stretches with Scripture.There was some good in there, but like a pie with poop in it, it's not worth sifting through and finding the good parts of the pie to eat - it's all been contaminated.

I'd heard it recommended for those who are preparing for marriage-- I don't think I would recommend it for that audience. It's more specificially for women already in marriages who are unhappy with the sexual aspect of their marriage, or who don't have a proper understanding of the Christian meaning of sex. Note: not all Christians will agree the authors' ethics, and some ethical issues that one would think were important --such as the use of potentially abortificient contraception-- aren't touched on at all. In fact, I was kind of surprised that the authors didn't say much about pregancy, contraception, etc. Though they talked about how to maintain a sex life when one has kids in the house, they didn't say much about trying to conceive or trying not to conceive! Though they specifically say at the beginning that sex has many purposes, the main purposes they focus on seem to be pleasure and relieving one's husband's tensions. They do deal well with a number of problems and issues within that span, though."},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","review":"Don't waste your time.

This didn't happen. I was so disappointed with the book that I discarded it at a local book sale the day after I read it. Looking back, I think I should have discarded it in the trash. The attitude that anything goes in a marriage that isn't explicitly denounced in the Bible seems a bit foolish to me yet it is one that keeps popping up time and time again in Christian literature. There are many gray areas in the Bible that can become blurred in todays world. An analogy would be dressing modestly. We are told to be modest in our attire, but just what is modest attire? To the Amish there is one standard, the rest of us are left to &quot;do what is right in our own eyes&quot; in this area. And for the most part, today's Christian women fail in this area. Often you will not notice a difference in the way a Christian woman dresses today when she is compared with an unbeliever. Thus the Bible's statement to dress modestly, leaves us with the responsibility to know just what that is, and I believe that comes with growing in grace and wisdom. The fact that the Bible does not explicitly state that blue jeans and tank tops are immodest, doesn't mean that they aren't. A notion I have begun to take to heart lately. What does this have to do with sexual relationships in marriage? I think that Christians are crossing that same line in this area as well. Reading this book, we are presented with what is suppose to be a novel idea-that sex between marriage partners is nothing to be ashamed of and should be enjoyed-and then we are given ideas on how to enhance this area of our lives. What the book fails to do is take the area of sexual relationships between a Christian man and wife to a higher level than that of any modern day sex primer. Naturally, anything created and done according to God's laws is good and brings a sense of well-being, the question is, just what is good and pleasing to Him. The book never really is able to offer Biblical proof for example that oral sex is sanctioned by God. yet gives full support for the idea that this act is okay simply because it is not explicitly prohibited by the Bible. Much like the question of blue jeans and tank tops, the reader is left to do &quot;what seems right in his own eyes&quot; . There has to be a better way to find out what pleases God than simply saying &quot;if it isn't explicitly prohibited in the Bible, then go for it&quot;. There also has to be more to the marriage relationship than seeking carnal gratification.Christians need a sex primer that is able to powerfully explain just what is acceptable and pleasing to God and WHY it is acceptable with sound theological arguements, otherwise we are left to do &quot;what seems right in our own eyes&quot; and this will lead to more and deeper sin since we are prone to sin. This book did not leave a lasting impression on me with regard to the statement by Paul to not take a wife as the pagans do, in lust, but rather in a holy and honorable way. Just what is a holy and honorable way, how does it DIFFER from the way of the world. I found no difference , between what is stated in this book, and what can be commonly read in any woman's magazine today. Sexual union causes two to become one, and &quot;where two or more are gathered in my name, I am there in the midst of them&quot;. Thus sexual union between two Christians should indeed be a holy and honorable experience if Christ is there in the midst of this union between husband and wife. I for one am not willing to settle for what the world has already offered to me, mere physical gratification. As Christians, let us seek to know the fullness and richness of this gift God has given us. I think it goes much deeper that what is offered in this book. It is my hope, that in offering this dissenting view, that some will at least question the notion of anything goes in marriage, or that it is simply about physical gratification. Marriage is not a license to sin And the marriage bed is honorable only if it is kept undefiled by immorality. We as Christians today need to truly seek to know what is moral from what is immoral in regard to all things. Be it modest attire, business transactions, sexual union between husband and wife, and virtually all areas of our lives. Don't take the easy road that if it isn't explicitly forbidden it is okay. Seek to grow in grace and wisdom. I hope to find a book someday written by a Christian man in this area, that displays a powerful witness for the Lord for Christian spouses today. I don't think women should be teaching in this area. We are prone to deception."},{"Title":"College Is Only the Beginning: A Student Guide to Higher Education","review":"College is Only the Beginning was the required textbook for my freshman orientation class back in 1986.

The style is the same as the Grant volume, and the format is the same. None the less, it reads very well and is very informative, although not as entertaining as I would have liked, thus the 4 stars. One thing for sure, you'll get to know Lee very well reading this book. And there are many lessons to be had from the reading, possibly one on every page, if you feel so inclined.As with the Grant volume, Mr. Holton takes one area of leadership and reports how Lee acted in regards to that item (Patriot Voice, Duty are 2 examples). Each discussion is contained on one page! A very good use of words by the writer makes this work. Then it's on to the next, then the next, the next, and so on. One can read one page and think about it, or take a couple of hours and polish off the whole book!! I perferred the slower method.However you choose to read this bbok, make sure that you do read it, and the Grant volume also.

T. Shedd starts his monumental work by pointing out that one of the strongest defenses of Christian doctrine is found through examining how various theological concepts have come about and changed over time. This history is the story of how our understanding of God, ourselves, and the relationship between God and us has grown.The first volume is divided into several sections. The first is the influence of philosophical systems on Christian doctrine. This examination includes the effect of the teachings of individuals such as Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero as well as the teachings of particular schools and movements like the Mystics, Scholastics, and Reformers.The second section is the history of apologies. This is the history of the Christian reply to objections raised by skeptics throughout the ages. The Christian church first faced attacks from Judaism and paganism in the form of Ebionites, Gnostics and Pagans. It had to deal with the problems of the relationship between faith and science and examination of Biblical and ecclesiastical miracles. Apologetics is always an interesting area to deal with as we examine the various objections to the Gospel raised by different groups in different periods of time. The text includes the apologetics of individuals like Anselm, Aquinas, Bernard, Hume, and Kant as well as movements like deism and rationalism.The third section is the history of theology and Christology. This is the one that I found to be the most interesting. First he covers the arguments for the evidence of the existence of God and examines the thoughts of people like Tertullian, and Anselm. Of course any section on the existence of God would not be complete without an examination of the ontological argument, which he covers well.One of the most divisive problems of the early church was the concept of the Trinity and Christology. How do you resolve the idea of a God who is God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit while still believing in only one God? How do you resolve Christ's relationship with God? Was he fully human? Was he fully divine? Was he two persons in one body or one person that had divine and human natures? As the church wrestled with this many different ideas arose and gained converts. Mr. Shedd does an excellent job of examining these different schools of thought and how they differed from mainstream thought. Although such issues were predominantly put to rest with the Council of Nicene, they still affect the church today.The first section in the second volume is the history of anthropology. The first part of this section discusses theories on the origin of the soul. This was a great concern for early Christians and still evokes some debate today. Were all souls pre-existing and placed into human bodies? Are souls created out of nothing when a new person is born? Are the soul and body both propagated (tranducianism)? The section continues into the doctrinal history of sin, free will, whether infants that die do so in a sinful state, and regeneration. Even today the debate continues over whether newborn children inherit evil or whether they inherit guilt.The second section of this volume is the history of soteriology. How has the Christian doctrine of atonement developed into the way we believe today? Perhaps no other doctrine is more critical to the Christian than that of vicarious substitution, or the substitution of Christ's sacrifice on the cross for our sins. What is the role, if any, of penance?The third section is the history of eschatology. One of the hottest topics seems to always be studying the end times according to the Bible. William Shedd covers all the most common concerns from Millenarianism, to the Second Advent, to resurrection, Purgatory, and the final state of Christians and non-Christians after the resurrection.The fourth and final section is the history of symbols. This section includes an examination of the various creeds and other statements of faith through Christian history. Included are the following creeds and confessions as well as many others: The Apostles' Creed, Athanasian Creed, Lutheran Confessions, Reformed Confessions, Papal Confessions, Confessions of the Greek Church, Arminian Confessions, and Socinian Confessions.This two volume set is an excellent work for those who want to examine the history of Christian doctrine over the ages and is a highly recommended purchase for all serious students."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"I like tarzan books. This one was great as well. Tarzan finally got to see some of his enemies die, which was satisfying for me. Also, I enjoyed the &quot;lord of nature&quot; aspect of the book. Anyone that can control a pack of apes and a panther is pretty cool. After I read this book, I just wanted to fight another animal to the death. After I killed it, I would stand above it with the blood running down my throat and scream like tarzan does. I recommend this book for any father who is worried his son might grow up to be weak. Once again, great book."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"Although this is not my favourite of the Tarzan books, it is definitely an excellent story.

Once more he has to rely on his wits and his above-human strength and physique to survive in the jungle. Making several new friend (not all of them human) he has to track down Jane, his son and the men who captured them.&quot;The Beasts of Tarzan&quot; is an excellent adventure story and well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"this third installment in the tarzan series does not in the least dissapoint. the new characters plot and setting make this book a must read for tarzan fans."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"While this novel was well written, I still often found myself bored silly reading it.The tale of Tarzan, Lord Greystroke, was wonderfully told and concluded within the first two novels (\\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" and \\"The Return of Tarzan\\")...but in all honesty, I really felt it should have ended there. A third novel (and I'm sure the 20 or so sequels that followed this one) was not needed at all.As mentioned in the title, I found this third novel really disappointing. I stopped reading it a couple of times because I found it so tedious and dull (which was never the case with the first two novels), and was glad it was over when I finally finished it!Honestly, the only good part about it was seeing Tarzan's determination to save his family, and the long over-due conclusion to a particular character. Other than that...I really felt it was a waste of my time.Which is a shame, because Mr. Rice Burroughs is quite a fine writer, and the first two books were fantastic."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"\\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" is the third novel about the Lord of the Jungle by Edgar Rice Burroughs. \\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" finds the ape lord settled in civilized London as Lord Greystoke. But he becomes the target of his enemy, Nikolas Rokoff, and his henchman Alexis Paulvitch. The pair abducts Tarzan's Jane and their infant son Jack. Tarzan ends up stranded on a desert island, but with the help of Sheeta the panther and Akut the great ape he makes it back to the mainland. There he meets Mugambi, the giant chief of he Wagambi tribe, a character who goes on to become Tarzan's lifelong friend and ally (a welcome relief after the way virtually all of the natives were just a different sort of jungle animal for Tarzan to torment and kill). This odd group heads off together after the kidnappers into the deep jungle and when Tarzan finds them he lets his inner beast come up with creative ways of making them pay for the mistake of taking his wife and son. If you start reading the Tarzan novels in particular, or the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs in general, in the same order that they were written, then \\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" is pretty much around the time that it becomes clear that the storyline is usually the same. Our hero is separated from the woman he loves and spends most of the book getting her back. You can throw a baby into the mix, change the impediments placed in the way, or alter the locale from Africa to Mars, Pellucidar or the Land That Time Forgot (far and away the best part of the recipe), but the basic plot remains the same. Burroughs was also getting tired of having to write about Tarzan, which he would prove in the next book in the series, \\"The Son of Tarzan,\\" where baby Jack grows up to become Korak the Killer. Unfortunately there were more than twenty more Tarzan novels to come, which would rely more and more of a formulaic approach."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"This is as addictive as previous Tarzan's stories. In this one the archenemy of Tarzan finally gets his desserts. You have to read it!"},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"\\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs was published in May and June of 1914 in \\"All-Story Cavalier\\". The better known details of Tarzan and Jane are handled in the first two books, but this book seems to get less of a mention than those two, or even then the following book in the series. For myself, I think this book contributes a key factor to the legend of Tarzan, that of his mastery over many animals, and his ability to call them to his aid.At the start of this book, we learn that Rokoff has escaped, and by the end of the first chapter he has kidnapped Tarzan and Jane's son, as well as Tarzan and Jane, though Tarzan doesn't know that Jane has been taken. Rokoff takes Tarzan to a tropical location by boat, and forces him to sign over his fortune, before letting him off. Tarzan believes he is getting off in Africa, and so he believes he will quickly be able to make his way back to society and chase down Rokoff, but he soon learns that he is on an island.For a while, it looks like this book will somewhat mimic \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" in it being a series of events depicting Tarzan vs. Rokoff, or Tarzan vs. some kind of wild animal, but that is not the completely the case. Burroughs puts his wonderful imagination to use and puts forward the idea of Tarzan being able to force his will over some beasts, and indeed some humans as well, and that he can then call them to aid him, and that they can call him as well. So, while it is true that the book essentially deals with those same kinds of events, Burroughs manages to make them much less repetitive to the reader than they were in the first two books.Many of the weaknesses of the first two books still exist here, but to a lesser extent, and that is why I found this to be the best of the first three Tarzan novels. One of the oddities of this book is that it ends with our heroes being in much the same position as they were before. We do meet some new characters, such as Akut, the leader of a tribe of apes, and Sheeta, a panther which Tarzan manages to master, and a villain or two are eliminated, but other than that their situation is much the same when the story ends. Ultimately, the story isn't as repetitive as the previous two books, and Burroughs' new ideas help it feel fresh and new, so I am giving this a higher rating than the first two books of the series."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"Tarzan, aka Lord Greystoke, and his wife, Lady Jane Porter Greystoke, are happily ensconced in their London home with their newborn son when the wrathful and utterly monstrous Russian villains from the previous book (THE RETURN OF TARZAN), Rokoff and Paulvitch, hatch a scheme to wreak their vengeance on the ape-man and his family once and for all. The child is kidnaped, and the parents separately taken away - Tarzan is thrown off on Jungle Island off the west coast of Africa, there to make his way slowly back to the continent to find his wife and child, and to rid himself of his enemies once and for all. One would think that by this time the wily and seemingly resourseful villains would know that just shooting Tarzan in the head is the only way to get rid of him, but that wouldn't be much fun, would it?On the island Tarzan makes friends with a tribe of anthropoid apes similar to those that raised him, in particular their somewhat smarter chief Akut; later he also finds powerful allies in Sheeta, a half-tame panther, and Mugambi, a native African chief. Finally in this third book, the legend of Tarzan as movie- and tv-viewers were to know him is complete: now when he makes his terrible battle cry, the \\"beasts\\" of Tarzan are at his beck and call to do his bidding. He has truly become \\"Lord of the Jungle\\".The Jungle Island sequence aside, THE BEASTS OF TARZAN is something of a letdown from the previous two books; the plot is an example of what would become all-too typical in Burroughs - take away the hero's wife and have him chase the bad guys for the whole book. All of the major characters, good and bad, make dumb mistakes at various points upon which the plot hinges; isn't Tarzan versed well enough in the ways of human deceit by this point not to be duped into going down to the bad section of the docks at night, alone, just because a stranger tells him that he'll get his child back? Too many examples of smart characters acting stupid, and an abundance of coincidences, make this more than a little silly at times, and the pacing is ridiculously fast even by Burroughs' standards.On the plus side though, his writing does improve here; he manages to create some real pathos in the character of the \\"evil\\"-looking, but kind-hearted Swede who protects Jane in the middle of the book, and there's a striking passage near the end where Rokoff kills a young tribesman and steals his boat that has a real poetic quality to it - a real feeling that indeed, these African \\"savages\\" in their natural habitat are far better off than we cynical and greedy westerners. We also get to see Jane acting more resourceful and less the damsel-in-distress than before; this is the first time where she really seems to be an appropriate partner to her super-heroic husband.Still high-grade pulp entertainment, then, though perhaps the weakest overall of the first half-dozen or so books in the series."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"First off, if you are interested in the Tarzan series, you can get this book and the next one together in theTarzan 2-in-1 (The Beasts of Tarzan/The Son of Tarzan) (Tarzan the Classics) (v. 1)for about half the price.In this third Tarzan things start out with Tarzan settled in to English life. Of course, its not too long before he finds himself in the jungle again, this time accompanied by a motley crew of jungle animals. This book was not quite as good as the first two, though it was still quite entertaining. It also seemed to be a little shorter."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"Tarzan, back in civilisation, soon has to leave again. The dodgy Rokoff is now again a free man, and continues to give Lord Greystoke problems. This time it is a kidnapping, involving his own flesh and blood, and his wife.Tarzan must become the ape-man superhero again, but he is not without allies, in the jungle animals, and the native Mugambi, a friend."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"BEASTS OF TARZAN is an escapist's dream come true. There are so many adventures and cliff-hangers in it that you'll wish it would just go on and on and on. Villains abound. Lions, crocodiles, and savage tribes all try to best The Ape-Man. Fortunately, Tarzan gets much needed help, always just in the nick-of-time, from his small band of friends: Mugambi the chief of the Wagambi, Sheeta the leopard and Akut the king of the great apes on Jungle Island. Did I mention that Tarzan's bitterest foes are involved in the events that begin the story and cause our hero no end of worry? No? Well, if you are familiar with the first two books, you'll know instantly who I mean.Another rollicking adventure by Edgar Rice Burroughs set in the jungles of Darkest Africa. 5 Stars"},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"Burroughs is a fantastic writer, and his details of everything from characters to settings are vividly descriptive. Unlike the first two stories in the series, TARZAN OF THE APES and THE RETURN OF TARZAN, I didn't feel this story moved well. There was a lot of action and great characters, but much of the story seemed redundant. I read over and over about Tarzan eating raw meat by preference despite his being \\"civilized.\\" I didn't think that added to the plot. Plus, there were several instances in which both Tarzan and Jane misjudged other characters or made poor decisions that put themselves or others in peril. Once or twice would've been believable; but when it kept happening, the story became less appealing.Don't get me wrong, THE BEASTS OF TARZAN is still worth the read. It has all the adventure and danger that you expect from a Tarzan story, and, for me, the dimension added by animal characters was extremely interesting. If the first two hadn't been so fantastic, I probably would have given this one a higher rating. I'm looking forward to reading the other Tarzan stories.

I shied away from Tarzan because I never was a big fan of the movie interpretations. When I finally got around to reading it I was amazed. I see why the Tarzan series was Burroughs most popular. You see concepts that could not be described on film.

Book #2, \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" (1913), was a fairly direct sequel to the initial classic outing, while book #3, \\"The Beasts of Tarzan,\\" picks up the tale several years later. This novel originally appeared in serial form in the pages of \\"All-Story Cavalier\\" magazine in 1914 (the popular pulp had debuted in 1905 and would end its run in 1916), with a cover price of...10 cents. It made its first book appearance two years later. The shortest of the first four Tarzan books, coming in at a mere 159 pages (I refer here to the popular series of Ballantine paperbacks of the 1960s, which introduced Tarzan to a whole new generation of readers), it is a relentlessly fast-paced and compact affair, and fairly gripping from its very first page.On that page, Tarzan--now the father, with his bride Jane Portman, of an infant son, Jack--learns that his archenemy from book #2, Nikolas Rokoff, has just busted out from a French jail. And on page 2, he discovers that Rokoff has wasted little time in wreaking his vengeance on the noble Lord Greystoke. Jack has been kidnapped, and Tarzan and Jane are soon captured and brought by ship to the deserted \\"Jungle Island,\\" off the coast of west Africa. Tarzan is marooned and left to his fate, Jack is to be handed over to a tribe of cannibals, while the devilish and lustful Rokoff has other plans for the nubile Lady Greystoke. All this, in just the first 13 pages! Ere long, Tarzan explores his desert island, becomes friendly with an ape tribe headed by the intelligent anthropoid Akut, tames a vicious panther named Sheeta (Tarzan's rescue of Sheeta and subsequent bonding with the jungle cat may recall to some readers the Biblical story of Daniel and the lion), and finds his very own Friday: Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi of Ugambi (!), a black native who, ultimately, also bonds with the Ape Man. And so, with this motley crew of man and beasts, Tarzan attempts to make it to the mainland and rescue his son and wife....\\"The Beasts of Tarzan,\\" as mentioned, is absolutely relentless in its pace--indeed, the entire novel is essentially one long chase sequence--and wastes zero time whatsoever in setting things up. Bang, right out of the gate, we are off and running, and the thrills just never let up! Action highlights of this entry are Tarzan's underwater fight with a crocodile, Tarzan and his crew invading a ship full of cutthroat mutineers, Tarzan's escape from the clutches of a cannibal sacrifice, and Jane's solo flight through the jungle, the crazed Rokoff at her heels. As usual, the book's chapters are arranged in cliffhanger fashion, with Burroughs practically daring his audience to stop reading. Also, as usual, the novel is presented with overlapping and concurrent story lines alternating for our attention, a device that is a tad confusing in some instances. Still, it all ultimately manages to hang together. The character of Tarzan here is very much the savage we have come to love from book #1 (he was a man of civilization for at least half of book #2), killing his animal prey and cutting out bloody steaks to devour raw. In a fascinating early segment, Burroughs shows us how remarkably proficient the Ape Man is at staying alive in the wild and at woodcraft, as Tarzan, on his first day on his desert isle, makes himself a stone knife, a bow and arrows, a loincloth, an arboreal shelter and a fire; no one on CBS' \\"Survivor\\" has ever done better, to put it mildly! The novel is an excellent showcase for Jane, also, who has not previously seemed nearly as brave and resourceful; likewise, the villainous Rokoff is presented as more diabolical, vicious and cravenly than ever, and his comeuppance toward the novel's conclusion is a satisfying one.\\"The Beasts of Tarzan,\\" in short, is a highly successful, extremely exciting entry in the Tarzan series, if not a perfect one. Par for the course, Burroughs makes a few flubs here and there (such as when he refers to Rokoff's lieutenant, Alexis Paulvitch, as \\"Alexander,\\" and when he writes that Tarzan had, in book #1, given the ape Kerchak a chance to escape, rather than Terkoz), but most readers will be too caught up in the fast-moving sweep of events to care, or even notice. As I've written elsewhere, even after almost 100 years, these books can prove highly addictive. For example, in \\"Beasts,\\" Paulvitch manages to escape Tarzan's clutches and flee into the jungle. Guess I'm going to HAVE to proceed on to book #4 now, \\"The Son of Tarzan,\\" to see what happens next...."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan","review":"The first two Tarzan novels were filled with action, adventure, and excitement. The third book,the beasts of Tarzan is much less exciting, as the plot is very repetitive.This time around, tarzan learns that his son has been kidnpped by an old enemy. Tarzan tries to rescue his son but ends up stranded on an island.Possibly the worst parts of the book were the ones that focused on Jane, since she can often be very dull. She, too has been taken, and she again lands on the same island ss Tarzan.While this book may not be the best in the series, I would reccomend it to anyone who is interested in the Tarzan books because it concludes the second one."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"Honestly, I just loved this book. At times, it was tough to read because it was so realistic- and sometimes, real life is hard to take. But I was transformed while reading this. My own prayer life has changed. The way I view my life in relation to those around me- changed too! Parker has done an incredible job of taking the reader to the edge (hence the name, I guess) and letting them know the impact that one life, one decision can make- good or bad. I highly recommend this book to folks who might not think spiritual warfare is for real- it'll open your eyes. And maybe while being entertained, your life can be transformed, too!"},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"This is really two stories in one. It is very good and well worth reading.The author uses the same basic story with two very different endings that are based upon the actions, including prayer, of the protagonist, Richard Sullivan.It shows a very powerful picture of how an individual can be affected by spiritual warfare and can have a major effect on the lives of others through prayer and other actions. It does this while portraying a very realistic picture of the struggles faced by everone, including Christians, on a day to day basis.Although the author may not be quite as polished as Frank Peretti, he is very good and writes in a similar way.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone and particularly to Christians."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"Though this story was published over 12 years ago, the articulation of Parker Hudson reads true to everyday life. Simply, I had to know the outcome of each character's choice to get a sense that the right thing would be done. Parker Hudson\`s vivid depiction of one\`s bout with varying levels of confusion provides a scope into the belly of spiritual warfare. \\"On the Edge\\" tells a truth about one's struggle with acting on seeds of destruction or bearing good fruit from planting seeds (thoughts, words or action) that promote life by experiencing joy and peace here on earth as God prefers, until final judgment. I too was brought to tears feeling witnessed to the magnitude and glory of a mass prayer outreach. Mrs. Hudson, \`Thank You' for your insight with supporting your husband on this project as a demonstrated witness in the power of God's love to change/restore one to walk in his image. There are many who operate on the \`edge' that desperately need the results of a powerful committed prayer team. Functioning as a wife, I long/pray for this spiritual order to blanket my home and community. Like a glass of pure ice-cold water, most refreshing is communicating with one who \\"gets it.\\" An understanding that this a intimate portrayal concisely reveals the wages of sin... \\"On the Edge\\" should immediately be brought to DVD syndication, delivering a global impact to those who may not utilize this medium, so all can be blessed by this ministry. \`Thank You' for the healing...:)"},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I loved this book! I thought it painted an amazing picture of how individuals affect people around them by their choices, actions, words, and prayers. I have chosen this book for my book club and I think our discussion group will be dynamic and interesting! This book is well written and very thought provoking. You will not think the same way after reading it! I loved it and I think it's a must read!"},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I could not put the book down. I travel for my job and read it on one trip. I felt such a connection to Richard Sullivan. I never understood those voices in my head. I always thought it was my mind putting those thoughts into my head. I finally understand that Satan was making me doubt myself, as well as, other negative thoughts. He was tearing down my self-esteem one piece at a time.I loved the book so much that I shared it with family, friends, and complete strangers I met on airplanes. I mailed the book to strangers I had met with the hopes that they too will find answers to questions about our journey through this earthly life and how every choice we make affects the lives of hundreds of people.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a Christian book you cannot put down until the last page is read."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"This is the only book I've ever hurled against a wall. (And it felt so good, I did it again.)I know some people enjoyed this book, but I found the writing cumbersome (the first line is something like &quot;Balzor was proud&quot;) and extremely preachy and judgmental. Would-be readers ought to be warned that halfway through the book, the author writes the characters into a corner and stops the book, then starts it over with a different set of conditions (&quot;This is what would have happened if someone had witnessed to this family fifteen years earlier...&quot;) I felt that was an authorial cop-out."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I believe that this book is a tremendous teaching tool. God has been most gracious in providing an avenue for me to teach This Present Darkness in the classroom (in a public school) and I can't wait to teach On The Edge. I believe it will cement what the students' learned about spiritual warfare and will tie it in with their personal lives. So many of my students are going through the same type situations as the characters in the book. On the Edge is an easy read - packing dynamite lessons for Christians and non-Christians, alike."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I am blessed to work with the author of this well written novel. I am an avid reader and was given a copy of &quot;On the Edge&quot; by another co-worker. I took the book home and immediately started reading it and from the onset, I found it a book that I absolutely couldn't put down. I don't want to give away any of the contents or storyline, however, I will say this, if you are struggling or if you are challenged in your christian daily walk and just can't explain some of what goes on in your life, this book will OPEN YOUR EYES to the tricks/schemes/wiles of the enemy. Parker, thank you for allowing God to use you to write such a powerful book. It's an eye-opener and a life-changer, indeed."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"Hudson grants readers a chilling, but accurate look at life without Christ and does not hold back as he exposes the evils attacking today's families. There is a heavy anointing upon this book and a call from God to prayer, as Hudson shows the realities of lives touched by the lack of prayer versus being covered with prayer. In the lines of Frank Peretti, Hudson's work is as good, if not better in its realistic portrayal of the spirit realm and the demonstration of how one's prayers either hinder or release angels from carrying out their missions to serve mankind for the Almighty. I encourage you to read this novel - and read it with a prayerful heart to receive the message God has given to Hudson to share with the world."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GROW IN THIER PRAYER LIFE. THIS IS TRULY THE BEST SPIRITUAL WARFARE BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! IT IS A MUST READ FOR FAMILIES FACING A NEW MILLENIUM AND THE SPIRITUAL CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH IT. THE ONLY REGRET I HAVE ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THAT I HAVE ALREADY READ IT. IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE I TREASURE AND WILL NEVER FORGET."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"This book is absolutely amazing! Until I read it, I didn't truly have God in my life. I always felt so unworthy and it was beyond my comprehension that God would forgive me of all of my sins and except me as one of His chosen. My sister who was finding so much joy in knowing God was at the library one day and saw &quot;On the Edge&quot;. She'd already read it and, on a whim, decided to check it out for me to read. My family and I went on a cruise about a week later and I took it along. All I can say is it totally changed my life! It just clicked for me, I gave my life to the Lord aboard that ship and slowly I began to change in ways I didn't even know I needed to. I truly started to understand it was real when my family noticed the huge difference in me and I began to find pure joy in studying His Word and having a personal relationship with Him. That was five years ago and just recently God led me back to it, I ordered it online and it was even sweeter reading it the second time. God has truly gifted the author in being able to relate to the soul and I will forever be appreciative of His gift through F. Parker Hudson."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"Simply excellent. Breathtaking, inspirational and applicable to everyday life. Not at all preachy. At times it hits so close to home that it is impossible to put the book down."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"The imagery in this book is so gripping and the story line is so compelling that the reader's only challenge will be how to put the book down. Even without the critical Christian message, the story line is hard to resist. It is impossible to read this book and not come away changed. I cannot wait to read Hudson's other book, &quot;The President.&quot;"},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I am not an avid reader, I am too much of critic and cynic to be one. But I finished Parker Hudson's book in only 3 sittings within a weeks time. In the pure entertainment sense, it is a fantastic read and I could not put it down. What Parker Hudson achieves in the climax of the book is a masterpiece, such that I am convinced it was inspired. But more importantly, I found myself looking at the characters and looking at myself in a way I found unsettling but also relieving. The truth was so well revealed that I could not help but devour the messages underneath. Many times before I read this book, I had heard the saying &quot;the greatest lie is closest to the truth&quot; and the idea that pride was a sin. But I never really understood, or perhaps accepted, what these two things meant until I read On the Edge. This book is so true to life, in its essence, that I found it completely humbling. It caused me to admit that these subtle ways in which pride invades ones life, are all too present in my own life and in society. One can tell (barely) when reading On the Edge that Mr Hudson is not a professional author, something I found quite refreshing. And I think it is for that reason that the subject matter is raw and real and truthful. I gave the book a five star rating because although the plot is several times slightly transparent and a little bit forced, I don't care - there is TRUTH here. And there are precious few books in my life that I can say have changed me for the better and made me more honest with myself, and there is no price for that."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I LOVED this book!! On the Edge has totally strengthened my determination to be faithful in my prayer life. What a graphic view of how important it is to pray for those around us, and the fate that awaits those who don't turn to Christ. I have recommended this book over and over again to people who want to allow God to use them. This book has been such a blessing to my Christian walk."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"This very powerful work, gives the reader a profound picture of spiritual warfare at it's best. While the term &quot;Spiritual warfare&quot; is new to many, the battles that are depicted in this writing are not. Mr. Hudson presents a very poignant portrayal of how serious the demons are about their assignmnents and of how our daily decisions work to fuel the flames of war.This is a must read for anyone committed to battling Satan.I recently met the author and was even more blessed when I learned this book was truly inspired by the Holy Spirit. To be obedient enough to allow God to use you in this manner is a testimony of Mr. Hudsons's belief."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I don't want to give away any of the story line, but suffice it to say that Hudson has a very unique writing style and I found it intriguing and compelling. Even though this book was written in the mid-90s, it is 'right on' for today (2013) and the culture we live in. I am imspired to 'press on'. Couldn't put this book down !!!"},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I couldn't put this book down. When I finished, my face was flooded with tears of joy. This book helped me to understand how the evil forces are involved in the whispering of the terrible lies in our hearts, and how they can be silenced through prayer. It finally makes so much sense. I am so glad to have 'found' this book! Thank You, God!"},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"In Parker Hudson's words, \\"On the Edge\\" presents a fictional account of a family in America today, including their friends and business associates. The 400 page book is split evenly in 2 parts, and both halves deal with Richard Sullivan's world. [--- Warning: Spoilers---] The main difference between the 2 parts (Books 1&2) is in the first part Richard wants to solve his own problems and his family is destroyed, whereas in the second he submits to the God, and his entire family gets saved and becomes a positive influence upon those around them. The author, who lives in Atlanta and who attends Michael Youssef's Church of the Apostles, confessed that he looked for mistakes in his life and in the lives of people he knew as an inspiration for this book. This book deals many problems and issues families deal with today - and includes topics such as Marriage, Marriage on the rocks, Salvation, Pregnancy, Abortion, Adoption, Affairs, Premarital Sex, Peer pressure, Homosexuality, Pornography, Crime, Morality, Power of Prayer, Power of an Example, Spiritual Wars, Business Deals, Collaterals, Devils, Temptation, Pride, Envy, Lust, Rebellion, etc.Besides the impact of the \\"inner voices\\", some things I found very powerful in the book include:* We are instruments in God's hand. Richard Sullivan had a much better life in Book 2, when he became a Christian. Yet Tom Spence, a Christian, was shot in Book 2, and not in Book 1. When we commit our lives to God, he may use us in ways that may not seem the best, yet the outcome for His Kingdom is always the best.* Always be aware of the maturity level of the persons you deal with. If you wronged someone, don't aim to make a confession just to get rid of the guilt. Be aware of the burdening your confession may cause, but give the other person the option to take it as it is (Richard's affair confession to Janet in the book)."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"On The Edge is a brilliant fiction read that really makes you think. It's not often a book will hold up a mirror to your life and show you some things you'd rather not see in the world. On The Edge was that book for me.Every Christian needs to get a copy of this book and read it cover to cover. It's helped me gain a deep understanding of how the forces of darkness try to undermine joy, peace, and truth."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"Regardless of your type of faith, If you believe in a heaven or a hell, angels or demons On the Edge by Hudson is a must read! Excellent fictional book that sparks a lot of imagination as you read it. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"If you start at night, you will be up all night and the next day trying to finish. This book takes the importance of an effectual prayer life and whops you in the face. As you read through the potential effect if prayer by a father, a child, a mother, anyone, you will be encouraged to get on your knees and fight like a man, or woman, or child. But Parker has taken the truth of the word and reiterated the power of prayer through these characters. Pick up the book....and get ready to fight."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I can remember when I was a kid that I had such a love for reading. Reading would take me to a place of safety and allow me to see places that I never thought I would get a chance to see. \\"On the Edge\\" did this exact same thing for me. It gave me such an insight into wrestling against the principalities of this world. Ephesians 6:12 (King James Version) 12For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. This book has caused me on purpose to rethink what someone actually hear from me when I am talking to them, especially my wife. It has taken me to another level of prayer for my wife and children. Mr. Hudson I pray that you will continue to allow God to use you to write under the anointing. I am buying a book for my son that is 13 years old because I am sure that he will be able to relate to Tommy in some facet. I have always known how important the role of the father is in his children and his wife life but Parker made me see even more so why it is important that we don't just send our kids to school but that we are praying for them daily. I am now about to read \\"Ten Lies, Ten Truths\\".

Not since This Present Darkness, have I come across such an in-depth work exposing the spiritual forces and invisible battle we all must face - with an added dimension of the \\"inner voices\\". The dialogue is detailed and the shifting points-of-view (often omniscient) may be a little hard to follow, but there is ample reward as the climax nears and the author skillfully pulls the plots (in both parts) together with surprising and true-to-life action. I consider this a critical study in spiritual warfare, in being wisely equipped.The Ninth Generation: Conquering the Giants"},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"Somehow Parker Hudson was able to balance a great/fun beach read type page turner and with very weighty subject matter making this one of the most important and exciting books you will read.

You cannot read this and and remain unconvicted in your role, your part in the battle going on in the world today. It forced me to realize that the war rages on - whether I choose to acknowledge it or not - and through my ignorance, I can be used just as easily to destroy as to save, others around me. This is a &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; meets &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot; experience."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"This is one of the best books I've read about the reality of the spiritual realm and the impact of prayer (of lack thereof!) on the salvation of souls. The Sullivans and the other characters in the book are incredibly realistic - I could have been reading about any number of people I know. The author gives us a realistic glimpse of the way blinders are kept on unbelievers minds through \\"anything goes\\", \\"just this once\\", \\"everyone is doing it\\", and \\"it's not THAT bad\\"....the deadly impact of NOT knowing God or His word and having any foundation on which to base decisions.He also very well describes the serious the consequences of God's own people failing to pray. I've definitely taken a hard look at my own prayer life and how I can better help the lost souls around me: be there for them as a friend, speak up, and PRAY! The book is biblically based and very solid in Christian theology. Really makes you think, and keeps your interest all the way through!!!"},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"When I first began reading On the Edge, my initial impression was that it was a little &quot;hokey&quot; or even simple. Yet as I read on, I found myself getting into the characters, then the story. I have to admit it completely captured my attention. Without giving away the plot, I'll just say I was devastated by the outcome of Part One, but then delighted at the final outcome at the end of the book. I heartily recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"This book is a very pleasant surprise. It reads well from cover to cover with only a few pages that caused my interest to wane. I would recommend this book to any Christian or Non-Christian reader over 15. The subject matter is heavy and should be reviewed by parents. The book is, in a sense, similar to Frank Peretie's &quot;This present darkness&quot; but deals with the drama and action of real life. I could not put it down and was only disappointed by the fact that I have now finished it."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"When I first heard of Hudson, it was played out like he'd be the next Frank Peretti. Not so, but he is good. This book was very simplistic and at times, extremely repetitive, which made it very difficult to keep the pages turning. I had to force myself to read a lot of it. For instance, Richard and Kristin having &quot;lunch&quot; together. The first time it got my attention, the second time, ok, the third time, let's see something new, please! That got old. The Tommy story in part 1 was pretty much the same old story. Unfortunately, that as well, got very, very old, even if new stuff was added here and there.But, I know when I read a book, that Mr. Hudson wrote this from the heart. He cares about people. He cares about saving souls. He cares about seeing people come to know Jesus Christ! That is a big step to making an awesome career to writing better stuff in the future. The part about the demons were where Hudson was able to break some ground. What I wished for more of were the personalized angels as well as the demons. You see that in Peretti's &quot;Darkness&quot; books with angels such as Guilo, Tal, such as that who are ready to fight for you with almost an intensity that you feel, not just perched on a restaurant building and choking the life out of a demon. Now, it may be a little unfair of me to compare Hudson with an author such as Frank Peretti, but when you think of spiritual warfare, Peretti's the first name that comes to mind.This probably won't be my most popular review to date, but if I weren't being honest, I'd be just as bad as an enemy because Ephesians says to speak the truth in love, as I've attempted to do without cutting into Mr. Hudson. I just hope I don't sound like Publisher's Weekly sounds at times where they don't even read half the book, and still bash it! I gave this a fair chance, and Hudson does have potential. I most certainly WILL read more of his stuff. You don't get rid of me that easily! But I do thank Parker Hudson for a sincere writing, straight from the heart."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"Why do people make the mistakes that lead to terrible problems for themselves and their families? How can they see the source of their problems clearly and find solutions? Hudson doesn't argue that a right relationship with God can help the saved avoid all sorts of family crises, or how it offers a celestial get-out-of-jail-free card. Rather, for his very believable characters, faith and prayer are the tools they use to find solutions.For me, two features set \\"On the Edge\\" apart from other works of its type. First, the characters struggle against very real human desires. Have you ever felt, in your congregation of faith, that there were only seriously nice people preaching to other seriously nice people? That they were talking about a God of sunny breakfast nooks with checkered curtains, not a God that dealt with a business or office, and certainly not a God who saw into bars and cheap motels? That feeling has bothered me often. I've stood there singing, \\"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound/ that saved a wretch like me,\\" and meaning every word of the song, while wondering if the rest of the people in my row ever had so much as a base impulse. Hudson's characters follow their desires straight into some of the oldest and nastiest traps in the world. They need industrial-strength help - and they find it.Second, Hudson's business experience shows though in making his characters' world convincing. So much recent fiction, in all genres, seems to have been written by folks who went to school for a long time and then set out to write. Hudson's business leaders aren't that different from my everyday world. Reading the newspapers would have you think that the world consists of ruthless, unethical business types who are successful only because they haven't been caught yet, and that business is not and activity for people of faith. There are so many people of strong faith who are successful in business, but this is one of very few places where I have seen such people described in a believable way."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down. This is such a story of the spiritual battles and temptations each and every family faces in today's world. Parker Hudson shows the reader just how much of an impact a spiritual walk with God can make in a family and how important a Christian leader is in the home. I could see myself and my family in Richard Sullivan and his family and that is what makes the book have the force behind it that it does. Seeing the worldly walk and its consequences vs. the godly walk and its rewards will move you to action, seeking a closer relationship with God."},{"Title":"On The Edge","review":"I love this book! It changed the way I see everything--the way I look at people, circumstances, problems, reality...everything! If you are looking for something to shake up your world, read this book!What makes this book different from most Christian fiction books I have read is that it is just so real. The characters are real, the problems are real. Hudson pulls no punches as he introduces us to these people and events. He does, however, pull back the curtain on American families and on the spiritual world, and give us a glimpse of what life is REALLY like.A lady in a church I pastored read this book and it changed her life as well.

Initially I found it disappointing - a typical space opera with the obligatory violence, ugly aliens, beautiful women, and even a bit of implied sex. But I did find what appealed to me. This novel heads off into the extraordinary and even has a thoughtful message about the unseen harm we might be doing - even if it is inadvertent. There is also one startling moment of crisis and realisation in a dramatic moment for the lead character - even though it isn't key to the story, it is breath taking.other recommendations:'Counter Clock World' by Philip K Dick'Ramunujam' by Robert Kanigal"},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man: v. 9","review":"The Clone Saga, from the Amazing Spider-Man books, remains at the top of the list of story arcs Marvel would rather forget. So I was amazed when it was announced that Bendis was going to tackle the epic story in the Ultimate universe. The difference, however, is that his story is thought-out, riveting, and concise. There's some pretty big and dramatic twists to the Spider-Man story collected here, and I'm not going to spoil them. It's a great read."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man: v. 9","review":"Ultimate Spider-man is a fantastic book series to begin with. Couple that with the fact that Bendis took one of the most notorious stories in comic book history and fixed it... well, you just need to read it. The volume contains what would take two trade paperbacks to hold and it looks good on a shelf. Of course it looks best next to the other eight volumes of the series, but you get what I mean."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man: v. 9","review":"This collects Ultimate Spider-Man issues 97-111. More of the same from Bendis and Bagley here - which is a very good thing. One of the most teen to adult accessible comics being written continues a stellar run. This marks the end of Bagley as artist, but Immonen comes in without missing a beat.Two main arcs are portrayed in this collection. The first one has a rash of Spider-clones, of varying physical characteristics, tearing up Queens. It takes the assistance of the Fantastic Four and S.H.I.E.L.D. to put them down. Bendis continues to play with the 616 Universe mythos, altering the origins of the clone saga and even the powers of legendary villain Doctor Octopus. Throughout this struggle, Peter Parker remains a believable teenager dealing with crap he shouldn't have to. Some of the bits are predictable, such as the Richard Parker scenario, but others surprised me and will have long lasting effects - notably the Aunt May situation (will leave details out to avoid spoiling that).The second arc deals with Daredevil recruiting various vigilante superheroes to bring down the Kingpin. The group is familiar to readers of the comic (DD, Doctor Strange, Moon Knight, Shang Chi, Iron Fist) but how it all goes down will surprise you. The pacing of this arc is a bit too quick for me - once the mole is revealed, it resolves rapidly. The exposition on motive is also a bit short and doesn't quite hit home. The highlight is Spider-Man standing up to Daredevil and imposing the limits on the group.Overall an excellent collection that any Spider-Man fan should enjoy - and I continue to recommend this entire series for any new reader to comics."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man: v. 9","review":"First off, LOVE all the Ultimate Spider Man books. Got em all, great stories by Bendis as well as great art... My only problem with this Volume is why did they release that skinny, smaller version a couple of months ago? I thought that it would be like a side story, then continue in Vol. 9. That sucks. So now I have all the Ultimate series on my shelf looking all prestine and sweet then I have this small, skinny SpiderMan and a couple Marvel Zombie books that weren't the same size....

The story is as engrossing as any of others but more linear, and the involvement of the Starbridge characters comes about from plot circumstances, rather than supplying the main impetus of the book. I loved this book and felt Carter had a lot to say to me as a person both exploring her work interactions and uncovering her own deep rooted spirituality. I wish I'd had some of her pithy precepts guiding me when I worked in a male-dominated profession. I'm always sad to finish a Howatch book because it means returning to real life where there is very little means or time for grappling with ones own spiritual beliefs. One aspect of the story I found less convincing was Kim's occult involvements - the motivations for him to succumb were never compelling nor completely spelled out; the sexual compulsion component escaped me.If you crave great characters, good plotting, and intense theological musings, then any of the Starbridge series will luxuriously satisfy these urges, especially this one. If you are otherwise leery of the theological aspects, then you owe it to yourself to expose yourself once to the gentle sampling in the &quot;High Flyer,&quot; just to be sure it's an honest aversion rather than reactionary prejudice. By the way, another writer superb at combining Anglican theology and great mystery is Sara Maitland - check out her book &quot;Ancestral Truths.&quot;"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"After the sheer and absolute brilliance of 'The Wonder Worker', Howatch had her work cut out for her, and The High Flyer is a respectable novel follow on. With any other author, this probably would have garnered a 5-star rating from me...In The High Flyer, Howatch tells the story all from one view-point - that of Carter, a high-flying lawyer in London who has just met Kim Betz in time to keep her 'Life-Plan' on track. The only fly in the ointment seems to be Betz's ex-wife who is quite 'nutterguff.' However, despite some brittle moments where Carter saves herself from some nasty shocks in the early stages of their marriage, nothing prepares her for Kim's reaction when she announces she will eventually desire a child or 2 in accordance with her life plan.From here on, it is vintage Susan Howatch with some deep pshycological probing and assistance for this provided by Nicholas and Lewis from the small St-Benet Church. I don't know how to tell people that you just shouldn't be put off by the underlying Church of England theme in Howatch's Church of England series - these are by far amongst the best books on the market and The High Flyer is no exception!"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"I am always looking for and rarely ever find a novel that I truly can't put down. &quot;The High Flyer&quot; is one of these rare birds. It's a profound novel about a woman's quest for faith and Christianity-- yet it's also a strongly-plotted novel with ghosts, sex clubs, stalkers, Nazis-- you name it, this novel has it! A friend of mine bought 10 copies of Howatch's &quot;Glittering Images&quot; and gave them as gifts. I may do the same with &quot;The High Flyer.&quot; It is a fabulous book! It's entertaining yet profound. Absolutely a marvel!"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"I have not read Howatch for several decades, since her &quot;Cashelmara&quot; and &quot;Penmarric&quot; days. I really loved those two novels, which were historical novels with strong romantic elements. Ordinarily I would not expect to like a novel where the author had &quot;found religion&quot; because such a book is usually preachy and proselytizing or, at least as written by Americans, it usually is. I can accuse Howatch of neither flaw and perhaps it is her being English that gives her a wholly unique point of view regarding faith and religion. She has most intelligently plumbed the depths of the English Anglican faith and applied it to a contemporary novel with romantic, suspense and paranormal genre elements. By rights, such a combination should be a complete mess. However, she pulls it off, which takes enormous skill by an author. It probably could be classed as the thinking person's &quot;Exorcist.&quot; The heroine, Carter, is a high flying London lawyer who marries the same only to discover that he has deceived her on many levels. Foremost among his deceptions is that he is involved with Mrs. Mayfield, a woman with esp powers who pulls him into occult practices. Carter's personal legal assistant is a man and through him she meets ministers of the Anglican faith who counsel and protect those who are victims of such practices. The only facet of this novel that some readers may not like is the actual counseling sessions Carter has with these ministers. They unfold just as real time counseling sessions might unfold and are primarily rendered in dialogue. I found the subject matter so fascinating that reading all of this dialogue did not bother me. However, those who are not interested in the religious elements of this story may find those slow going. Much to my delight, I found that Howatch wrote six other novels in this vein prior to this one so last night I began reading the first, &quot;Glittering Images.&quot;"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Why do I keep reading Susan Howatch novels? Because I can't resist the positive way she depicts Christianity in general and Anglicanism in particular. Because I am enthralled with her images of a loving God and supportive, healing communities of people.What I am finally realizing, though, is that Howatch's novels are actually romance novels. In High Flyer, the cunning corporate female protagonist so sharply and tellingly depicted in the early chapters of the book abruptly degenerates into yet another sniveling, quivering Howach heroine desperately in need of male protection by chapter 10. Such a sudden and drastic transformation is just not believable. And, oh my, there are a plethora of knights in shining armor poised to rescue her. Her next love interest is already slavering at her feet even before the plotline conveniently disposes of her husband. Books like this one are at once entertaining and infuriating.And, amid all the psychobabble, how often do real adults employ (constantly!) terms like \\"fruity-loops\\"?"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"This was a book that I literally could not put down, despite morning meetings, and a long day at work. The book had intricate characters, richly detailed, central characters were sympathetic and the tension between the main characters was palpable. More interestingly, to a Hindu by birth, brought up in a convent, the explanation of Christianity from a very different angle, a more living breathing personalised kind of spiritual presence that strengthens the protogonist was nothing short of magical. Additionally, the villain was not pure black and white either but rich shade of grey that again, reminds one of people you have met. The book operates at multiple levels. In short, a must read - especially for anyone who wants to both enjoy a thriller but also wants to gain some spiritual pleasure out of peeking into another world, hidden from us by a thin veil. The book made me feel as if the veil had lifted away for a moment."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"I agree with the reviews by Episcocrank and Diane Davis. I was enthralled with the Starbridge Series (six books) even to the point of planning to read them again one day. However, Wonder Worker was a trifle disappointing and The High Flyer more so. The latter is far too long, and all of the \\"counseling\\" sessions were too prolonged and repetitive, as was Carter's dilemma itself following Sophie's demise. I won't give this author up, though, and I'll soon begin The Heartbreaker."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"This book like the Wonder Worker continues in the vein of the Church of England series, which is one my favorites. While the plot was fairly strong, the writing was not up to Ms. Howatch's usually excellent standards. The bare bones stuck out too much--I felt like I was reading an earlier draft that had not yet had the rough edges polished off. The dialogue, especially Carter's interior dialogue was clunky, repetitive and unconvincing. Many of the events seemed labored and over the top. Did her husband Kim really have to be a Nazi and involved in the occult, and in perverse sex? Themes were pushed hard instead being more quietly illustrated by the story itself. Howatch still writes a gripping spiritual thriller, but this needed more work."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"This is the first time I've ever read Susan Howatch. The book just caught my eye in the library and I like books with psychological dealings in them. I really got into this book, especially because the beginning was so captivating. Carter's (the main character) word usage was creative and very funny.. I found myself laughing at how she expresses what she is feeling throughout the book. However, about 300 pages into it, I was feeling rather sick of the endless telling and retelling and all that of all of Carter's problems. I was like yeah yeah yeah.. OK, so she thinks her husband is wacko, that's nice MOVE ON! I skipped about 20 pages of dialogue and was able to figure out exactly what was going on when I started actually reading again. That was the only complaint that I had to this novel; it oculd have been about 50 - 75 pages shorter. It was all in all a great read though; I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it. I've never read any other of the books and it looks like they are all part of some sort of a series but I had absolutely no problem following along. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"This was really one of her best books. The transformation that Carter/Catriona undergoes was fascinating to read and the deception perpetuated by Kim was equally amazing. Howatch always makes me think about my faith and she does it in a subtle, effective manner. This was difficult to put down and a book that I was sorry to finish."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Susan Howatch has written one of my all-time favorite books, but this isn't it. While her exploration of the psychological and spiritual issues central to human behavior is skillful and thought provoking as usual, &quot;The High Flyer&quot; left me with a feeling of distaste. Maybe it was the lily-gilding of her central malevolent figure. I couldn't help thinking the insights into the nature of evil would have seemed more relevant had he not been portrayed in almost cartoonish proportions. Pick a sin, any sin, and he's committed it. Most ethical battles are fought in a gray area without the benefit of such a clearly delineated enemy.Or maybe it was the grating repetition of cloying phrases like nutterguff, fruity-loops, tiger-thumper, fluffette, etc.Most likely, it was the reduction of the strong female character to a quivering mass of uncertainty, an empty vessel needing to be filled with the beliefs of others - primarily men of varying degrees of sexual attractiveness - in order to find peace. Forcing her heroine to examine and reorder her priorities is one thing, but Howatch seems to condemn her basic strength and independence as well, and - for me - that just didn't fly."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Susan Howatch continues her remarkable series of books that explore the deepest understandings of Christian psychology. Drawing on both ancient and contemporary wisdom about human nature, she paints a gripping portrait of the personal crisis that reveals to an ambitious young woman that God is the ulitmate reality and that she has falsely assumed she wanted what the world told her she wanted while she actually needs to discover both God and her True Self."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"At about page two hundred, when the first part of the novel has a resolution, i was wondering how the author was going to fill the next 300 pages. well, she does it by using thousands and thousands of words having obsessive conversations with a number of people about what happened during the first two hundred pages. The first part of the book was very good. She should have wrapped it up shortly after that. instead, it just became ridiculous. [SEMI SPOILER FOLLOWS] maybe someone just should have told our high flyer that some of the other characters in the book are a bunch of lunatics. perhaps then she could have moved on. also, the author really needs to limit her use of words like \\"nutterguff\\" and \\"fluffette.\\" this became very annoying."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Carter Graham is a high flyer. This is the term for incredibly successful corporate executives that live on top of the world making amazing amounts of money and associating with the other rich. She meets her husband Kim at a time in her life when she is ready to execute her life plan - get married, have children, and continue to be a super successful attorney. Not an item of her life is out of place and everything is going according to schedule. But just when life couldn't be more perfect things start to fall apart. Kim's ex-wife starts to stalk Carter in an effort to tell her something about Kim's past. There are rumors that he was involved with a group that dabbled in the occult. Then he starts to act suspiciously and Carter cannot tell when he is telling her the truth and when he is lying. Add to this death, Christianity, and poltergeists and you have The High Flyer.This novel begins solidly enough with an interesting story about a power couple and the crazy ex-wife. But just when Carter's life is starting to fall apart is when the book falls apart. The plot is too unbelievable to describe. The portions touted on the book jacket as involving \\"spiritual redemption\\" are simply preachy. The cast of characters is as weird and disjointed as possible. The pace abruptly slams on the brakes and then the reader is left to wonder what he has gotten himself into and when it will end. The second 2/3 of the book is so slow and strange that you will wonder if it is all worth it.Admittedly, there is a strange ending that is somewhat entertaining, but at the end the only word to summarize the whole experience is, Huh?"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Once again Howatch manages to blend western medicine, psychology and spiritual healing in the setting of St. Benet's Healing Centre.This novel has less psycho babble than Wonder Worker and has a strong, suspensful plot, all told from the perspective of the main character, Carter Graham. It is refreshing to see Nicholas, Alice and Lewis from Carter's perspective. There is also the addition of a new character: Eric Tucker.The occult, ghosts and poltergeist activity appear in this book and are thoroughly defined and described. Nicholas also tackles Calvinism and describes the judgment of God using a moving analogy of the Sheepdog Trials.Carter is an atheist who very gradually begins to embrace the light of Christianity and the need for healing. We see her struggle to accept people as they really are, not as she would like them to be. And just like Alice did in Wonder Worker, Carter ends up helping Nicholas as much as he helps her."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Howatch tackles a very diffcult problem, an understanding of the depths and devestations wrought by evil people. She does so by developing a very interesting character (evil personified) and another, a young female English barrister, who bears the brunt of the evil. Involved are some of her other characters from the Church of England series, e.g., Nick Darrow, a depiction of someone who is very human but trying hard and often successfully to help people. Harsher reading than most of Howatch' works, but fascinating stuff."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Susan Howatch is one of the most important spiritual writers of our time. Her grasp of grace and unconditional love always leaves me with more peace than I had before reading her books. I have read every one of her books over the past twenty years and always check the &quot;just released&quot; rack for more from her. I was excited to discover HIGH FLYER a few weeks ago, bought it immediately - and read it in two days. The plot kept me turning page after page into the wee hours of the morning. But the best part of the book came at the telling of the &quot;sheep dog trials&quot;. I will not spoil the story by saying more, just that I highly recommend this book! Thanks, Susan, for another great read."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"This book started out as an interesting story about strong people and social situations.

For me it was a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"This is the first Howatch novel I've read and it's difficult to fathom what enticement would ever draw me to another of her books. I am frankly amazed at the number of positive reviews for this seemingly unedited, should-be-at-least-200-pages shorter, astonishingly boring tale. While I enjoyed spending time on the pages with some of her ancillary characters, the author has managed to give us a \\"heroine\\" who is altogether annoying, cloying, and in many instances just plain dumb. She is the sort of character who in a horror movie would walk all the way through a dark, scary house without turning on a light. Carter's actions are repeatedly attributed to unconvincing and confusing motivations and she is grating, tedious, and self-involved to an off-putting extreme. I also enthusiastically concur with another review's mention of the character's incessant use of nauseatingly cute-sy pet expressions (most of which don't even make sense) and howlingly bad dialogue as being particularly tiresome. Lastly, though I do have an interest in theology, psychology, and the paranormal, here the navel- and soul-gazing seems unbearably endless.So, them's my 2-cents."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"I discovered Susan Howatch several years ago in Wheel of Fortune, still my favorite book.

This story is very thought provoking."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"My eagerly-awaited copy of The High Flier now lies on the living room floor, tempting me to read it all over again. As usual, once I started this latest novel by Susan Howatch, I couldn't bear to put it down!Set in 1990, this book is the latest installment in the Starbridge series and once again we see Alice, Nick Darrow, and the other denizens of the Healing Centre at St. Benet's church. This time, however, the story is told from the point of view of Ms. Carter Graham, a 35-year-old lawyer who nearly &quot;has it all.&quot;Carter's life is following her plan perfectly, and her most recent success is her marriage to Kim, a fellow lawyer-barracuda. Things aren't what they seem to be, though, and Carter finds herself sorely in need of the healing powers of Nick Darrow and crew.As with all of Howatch's books, the emotional wrenching and soul-searching is so powerful that I found myself experiencing it on a personal level. Once again, the Ultimate Reality is explored and experienced, however reluctantly.And now I know that I will be forced to wait several more years until Ms. Howatch produces another novel. My name will be on the waiting list!"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Once again Ms. Howatch, masterful author of her 6-volume Starbridge series and other novels such as &quot;The Rich Are Different&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, weaves a thrilling plot and fascinating new characters together in her latest novel, &quot;The High Flyer&quot;. I won't reiterate the plot, as this Amazon.com page will detail all one needs to know very well without my help. However, I will say that - once again - I'm having difficult tearing myself away from the book. I want to take this work slowly yet, as is always the case with Ms. Howatch, I find I can't stop once I start a chapter or a section. I'm happy to report the re-appearance (still in vital and believable form) of Nicholas Darrow, Lewis Hall and Alice Fletcher from the latter volumes of the Starbridge series. Seeing them again felt like a reunion with old friends. They may be familiar characters but they are as fresh as newcomers Carter Graham, her mysterious husband, Kim, and the intriguing and ever-so-sexy Eric Tucker. Being a writer myself, I know how difficult it is to create characters - then recycle them - as believable entities. With &quot;The High Flyer&quot; - as with all of Ms. Howatch's novels - I just stand back and admire and pray that someday my talents will equal one-tenth the writing skills she displays, once again, so well in this novel. Additionally, her Starbridge series and &quot;The High Flyer&quot; continue to bring me a spiritual depth of story on a realistic, rational and intellectual plane that I get nowhere else, either in novels or organised religion or philosophical debate. Her characters' lives are blown apart, only to come together again through ministry, faith and a continuing belief in the elasticity of the human spirit. As with all her other works, this one is one you shouldn't miss. (My only regret is having to wait 3-4 years between fixes!)"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"High Flyer is Susan Howach at her best and beyond. The first half of this novel is so fast paced it's a roller coaster ride of surprise after surprise as the drama unfolds. Just when you think you've figured out the story's direction, it turns on a dime and takes a whole new twist. You won't be able to anticipate this compelling tale. It's a contemporary, psychological thriller, a romance, and a mystery involving the supernatural, the church, sex and big business in a brilliant mix that grips the reader right from the start. The second half of the book is paced just a bit slower holding the reader captive in a reflective study that brings unexpected clarity to what you think you already understood. A compelling read! Old familiar characters and fascinating new ones keeps your interest from start to finish."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"This is a novel about spiritual warfare.The protagonists are a sinister New Age practitioner called Mrs. Mayfield, and two flawed, eccentric Anglican priests. Caught in the middle are the narrator, a ferocious thirtysomething career woman called Carter Graham, and her husband Kim.The first half of the book is a fast-moving adventure story, with the plot being driven by revelations about Kim's past (involving Mrs. Mayfield, and his first wife, Sophie). For much of the second half the pace slows and more serious themes emerge. Carter moves from her earlier indifference to Christianity towards a tentative engagement. There is much discussion of the nature of evil.The underlying theology is Anglican (roughly equates to Episcopalian), liberal but clearly supernaturalist, and greatly informed by Jung.I enjoyed this book. I haven't read any of Susan Howatch's novels before, and I am sure I shall read others. It's hard to find a writer to compare her with (some have apparently suggested Trollope, which I think is just batty). To me she reads like a modern and much more populist version of Charles Williams (novelist from the 1930s and 1940s and friend of C.S. Lewis).I had some reservations. I felt that a reader who just wanted a good adventure story and didn't have any interest in theology or psychology would find parts of the book tedious and would want to skip them. I also found the writing uneven. Some of the dialogue clunks. Carter's idiosyncratic vocabulary (e.g. \\"tiger-thumpers\\" for sexist men who try to sabotage high-flying women) became tiresome after a while. And the social context of the characters is not always happily observed. E.g. I don't believe that a partner in a London commercial law firm would shop for an important dinner party at the local branch of Safeways supermarket!Despite these reservations I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who shares the author's interests. Three stars is a fair verdict."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"I truly love Susan Howatch's writing style. She is delightfully articulate and her characters are all so well defined. I started off really loving the book, but after reading more and more of it, I began to feel as though she wrote this book on several different occassions and just couldn't figure out which direction to go in next. The characters became disappointing when they lost their credibility. I just couldn't buy into the whole tangled web after a while; it didn't sound at all plausible. I couldn't figure out why the main character, Carter, would feel anything other than repulsion for this man that was once her husband.

The author has combined a walk into mysticism and the occult into a fascinating tale. The mixture of characters makes thisvintage Howatch."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Thank God for novelists like Susan Howatch. At a time when Christian novels are so full of the apocalypse and end of days Ms. Howatch's The High Flyer comes through! An intelligent story of the struggle of good against evil and the ultimate gift of redemption that sings praise to the Living God with faith and reason. It is obvious that Ms. Howatch has been well blessed with a healthy vibrant faith that is fully integrated with an equally healthy and strong intellect.Perhaps Carter's dialogue is a little tough to take, but then so is Carter. (Who isn't when they think they have all the answers?) In a world where success is the misguided measure of our worth as human beings, I found Carter to be very familiar in her failings, in her strengths, her struggle, and in her vulnerability. And so very redeemable. Thank God for the journey and the gentle companion who is never what we expect.P.S. David Ford's &quot;The Shape of Living&quot; is a very special added bonus!"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Is this the same author who wrote the Starbridge series? I found this book to be contrived and overwritten--the story could have been told in half the space. There is a wearisome repetition of coined words; the dialogue is tedious as the main character examines her soul/values/morals at length with everyone who crosses her path. Enough!"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"I've read this book 3 times since it was published, as I do all Howatch's books. This novel gives us yet another twist on Nicholas and his coterie that is compelling and thoughtful, but also fun to read. Her books on the church consistently speak to me in a way that nothing else about Christianity does. Because of her, I'm becoming a &quot;closet&quot; Christian! I wish the Christians I've encountered were more like her characters -- real people with problems but also with integrity and commitment to something greater than themselves. When they are portrayed as rigid or stiff necked, the plot usually involves a BIG dose of humility accompanied by a change in perspective. These novels inspired me to expand my reading to include Farrer, Underhill, Julian of Norwich, and The Cloud of Unknowing. I check every week to see if she's got a new book coming out -- hope it's soon!"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"I am a long time reader of Susan Howatch since her Penmarric days. I was thrilled with her Starbridge series, which showed her maturation as an author with her subject matter but which left in place her wonderful plots and characterizations. A Howatch book is still, even in this less than stellar attempt, an invitation to late nights and stalled plans.However her last 3 or 4 books (including the last 2 in the Starbridge series) are starting to get stale. How many times will Ms. Howatch present us with demonic possession, with psychic powers, with people endlessly crying over their past? Yes, yes, by now we know that psychological disintegration and spiritual crises are but two sides of the same coin. We know that exorcism is the flip side of psychoanalysis. And we know that showing the cross and loudly saying the name of Jesus Christ will banish any demons. But do we need to read this over and over again? Isn't Ms. Howatch a little bit tired of all this?Ms. Howatch has so much talent as a writer that I hope she moves on and gives us a book (or set of books) with the freshness and brilliance of Glittering Images or Glamorous Powers."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Novel gets a little tedious and obsessive towards the end. I got the feeling that Susan Howatch was trying to sort it out for herself by explaining the characters and her spirituality/theology in a more analytical way. Good story with marvelous descriptions and lurking spirits. I am a fan of this Anglican Graham Green, so it is worth the read! You'll turn the pages rapidly toward the end, not because you can't wait to see how it ends, but because you've already eaten the meal of the story and now the detailed recipes aren't as interesting as the food itself."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"Carta Graham has married in haste and is now repenting at leisure. She had a life-plan and one of the items on the list was marry of man of a certain age and status. Her husband Kim seemed to fit the bill on paper, but now that she is married she is encountering parts of his personality she never dreamt existed and there are strange, odd currents in her marriage that include poltergeist activity, ghosts, a persistent ex-wife determined to impart information and finally a sinister faith healer. When this explosive mix of elements finally blows up, Carta Seeks help with a Christian healing center.All of Howatch's later work has the thinly disguised purpose of proselytizing but her plots, characters and psychology are so entrancing that the reader forgives the attempt at conversion. Howatch is that sincere. Howatch also believes in the cycle of sin, atonement and redemption and we follow all of the characters through this cycle. She is also clear about the imperfections of humanity due to original sin and our constant striving for health and wholeness because of being made in the image of the creator. It is quite a mix and I say this as an agnostic.I enjoyed all of the St. Benet's novels immensely and The High Flyer was no exception and is in many ways the most complex of the trilogy in terms of balancing the psychology with the soapy plot. The Wonder Worker is more controlled and the Heartbreaker is more soapy. The High Flyer exists in perfect equilibrium as the middle volume of a trilogy. Highly recommended to fans of Howatch and fans of epics and anyone who likes a juicy read."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"This novel was too good to put down. I finished it in just two sessions in two days. Ms. Howatch did a wonderful job of creating the characters and in keeping me glued to the story line.

As much as I wanted to go on reading non-stop, there were times when I simply had to put the book down to deal with my own beliefs and value system. The blend of our current addiction to become workaholics at all costs and our ultimate need for spirutal sustenance makes this a most thought evoking novel.Having read and enjoyed Susan Howatch's Church of England series of novels as they were published over the years, I expected a great novel when I picked up The High Flyer and I was not let down. Truly a wonderful book by a very talented author. I am already looking forward to reading The Wonder Worker."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"I've read Susan Howatch's book since I was in my teens-I'm 38 now-and her books just get better and better. Her ability to really dig into her characters thoughts and actions and to see situations from so many different perspectives, none of them judgemental, amazes me. I cannot beleive that this is the same author who wrote the somewhat simplistic &quot;April's Grave&quot;! &quot;The Rich are Different&quot;, &quot;Sins of the Fathers&quot;, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and the whole Church of England series are the spellbinding works of a completely mature writer. If you haven't read any of the above I highly recommend them all. Ms. Howatch has such a remarkable ability to take extraordinary events in people's lives and bring them down to earth and show us the outcome of these events from several different perspectives. I am definitely a true fan and order her books from Amazon before they're even released!"},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"The High Flyer demonstrates Susan Howatch is a more than competent writer, able to develop interesting characters, a suspenseful story and believable dialogue, but I had great difficulty with the message of this book.Clearly, this book is written from a Chrisitan perspective and as such values forgiveness and redemption and talks a great deal about Jesus Christ. That's okay by me and I even admire how Howatch pulled that off without sounding preachy. Not many writers are willing to write about faith without apology.Despite being impressed with how Howatch deals with faith, I'm not so impressed with her female characters. Howatch draws a stereotypical central charcter whose basic problem is that she dismisses her &quot;feminine&quot; side in favor of a life plan dominated by acheiving &quot;macho&quot; (Howatch's term) success (being a high power lawyer, earning &quot;megabucks,&quot; living in the right place, marrying a similar high flyer). Her husband's admission that he married her because she's &quot;just like a man&quot; leads her to realize that he can't see the real (feminine) her. In an internal dialogue she explains, &quot;The reality was that I was a woman. My masculine persona, adopted long ago to help me survive in a cut-throat world dominated by men...&quot;Here's the best example (and, amazingly even pedantic than the last section): as a young woman, the main character chooses to change her name from Catronia to the masculine Carter. The end of the book sees her return to a more feminine name and hints at the possiblity of a more traditional marriage.The central antagonist is a powerful women who has harnesses evil forces to destroy others and run a cult. There are no other female characters worth discussion.All in all, I left the novel wishing Howatch liked women more and feeling that the main point of the novel is to convince women to give up their quest for equality, respect and dignity. Reads a little like a backlash to me."},{"Title":"The High Flyer: A Novel","review":"It held my interest is the only positive statement I can make about The High Flyer. On the whole I was quite disappointed. I had loved several of Susan Howatch's books including Penmarric and Cashelmara so I was looking forward to this one.

Unsurprisingly, it's not quite as good as the original. Much of the whimsy has disappeared from the concept, though one can't fault the direction the story takes; I'm sure the question popped up every time Judi Barrett took the &lt;em>Meatballs&lt;/em> show on the road: \\"why don't the people of Chewandswallow use all that food to feed the hungry kids in [fill in the blank]?\\" And that's exactly what we get here; Kate and Henry, our protagonists from the original, find themselves back in Chewandswallow in a dream Kate has. This time, the town has turned its food-based weather into a thriving export industry, sending its bounty around the world to feed the hungry and end drought. Quite civic-minded, and to be honest, a little boring. What saves it from obscurity is Ron Barrett's faithfulness to the artwork of the original; you'd never know nineteen years passed between book A and book B, and the two can be read together without any sort of jarring when you cross between them, thanks to the artwork's similarity. If you've read the first, you'll eventually come to this one, though I doubt you'll be tempted to revisit it as often. ***"},{"Title":"Pickles To Pittsburgh","review":"I gave this book, along with several others to one of my nieces who loves books; I'm told she loved it!"},{"Title":"Pickles To Pittsburgh","review":"My grandosn loves this sequel.

The failure to close the Falaise gap and the subsequent german escape is an example of indecision by both Eisenhower and Bradley.

With maps every chapter or so, this would definitely be a five star book. (I don't know if the original had them, but the pb doesn't)"},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"I am currently rereading this book after receiving it as a gift in 1971.General George S. Patton, Jr. has been one of my lifelong heros so it's no surprise that I'm taken to books on him. I'm also a realist concerning him and will be the first to concede that the man was far from perfect in his personal life as well as a military leader. Ladislas Farago's epic biography does the supreme job of telling the whole story, from both sides of the fence, including Patton's triumphs of military genius to his emotional breakdowns and insecurities which lead many times to him weeping openly in front of his staff.But this is so much more than just a book on Patton. Ordeal and Triumph is an exciting, easy to understand walk through the African and European theaters of WWII and it's pivotal battles. Where Farago writes in great detail, he never gets overburdened with details. At just under 900 pages, you may wonder how that can be but he takes Patton from his ancestry up through his days in Europe after the war, and chronicles not only the battles, but all that went on before and after, including the baffoonery that happened on a daily basis within both the British and American military commands.And that's one of the scary revelations that is brought out time and again in Ordeal And Triumph. Between Montgomery, Bradley and Eisenhower, it now looks like it was only by the grace of Providence that the Allies won the war at all. The combined military leadership was timid, reserve, old school, by the book that was decades and even centuries old, head strong, non-creative, and just plain stupid in just about everything they did, UNTIL Patton was released in France with the Third Army. And even then, he was hampered until finally Bradley let him loose. Unfortunately, by that time, the German forces had had time to retreat, which had been a familiar occurrence in most of the battles preceding D-Day and it was this, along with many other errors that prolonged the war up to a year.Farago's biography, first published in 1963, would become the basis for the 1970 moviePatton (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), starring George C. Scott, along withA Soldier's Story (Modern Library War)by General Omar Bradley. And even though Scott played Patton with a low, gruff voice, when in reality Patton had a thin high pitched voice, those who knew him said that everything else about Scott's portrayal was spot on.I highly recommend this book, in either hard cover or paperback edition, for any student or person who is a history buff, especially of war and battle tactics. It is researched meticulously, drawing from every documented source available, as well as from personal writings and diaries of Patton and many others who were there and fought along side the man whom some say singlehandedly won the war. But it is also just a facinating story of one of the most colorful characters this country has ever created. A man who was comfortable cussing at the drop of a hat, but was a profoundly spiritual man who daily, on his knees, sought the wisdom and blessing of his creator to help righteousness win over evil."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"\\"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph\\" is a full life biography of one of the most colorful and successful officers ever to wear the uniform of the United States. It claims to be the book on which the movie was based and many of the anecdotes so beloved in the movie are presented in the book, although, occasionally, with slightly different details.Author Ladislas Farago informs the reader of Patton's ancestry, beginning with his immigrant ancestor who, presumably, left Scotland to avoid debtors, justice, or both. He continues with the Congressman and series of generals, including ones who died in the Revolution and Civil War, in Patton's line. He brings us to the subject who, he tells us, grew up on a ranch in California, where he made the acquaintance of Rudyard Kipling and John S. Mosby.Patton's own tale is larger than life. His days at VMI and West Point are mentioned, but they are not the focus of the story. The focus is Patton's active duty career. He saw action with Pershing in Mexico and World War I, where he was introduced into the world of armored warfare.This book enables the reader to understand the crucial role which Patton, in cooperation with Eisenhower and others, played in bringing tanks into the American arsenal. Having taken command of the tank corps in World War I, he tested its potentials. Between the wars he maintained his research into armor, preparing for the day when the U.S. Army would embrace the weapon.Throughout this work, Patton is shown as a leader whose dash and unconventional behavior is the key to his notoriety and success. In his first tank action, at St. Mihiel, Patton incurred the wrath of his superiors by extending his attack far beyond its expectations in a spectacular, but undisciplined advance. His performance in the 1941 maneuvers in Tennessee would lead to instructions for the famous Louisiana maneuvers later that year to \\"Not let Patton run wild again.\\" Despite the efforts of the judges to restrain him, he did \\"run wild\\", ending each part of the Louisiana maneuvers prematurely.Patton's high point was, of course, World War II. He entered it as field commander of the first major American force to see action in the war, the Western Task Force in the invasion of French North Africa, Operation Torch. This was an operation of diplomacy, not one of dash and maneuver. Predictably, Patton's performance was less impressive than later efforts would be. It was not until he was advanced to command of II Corps, after the disaster at Kasserine, that Patton's emphasis on training and spirit would begin to yield the results for which he became famous.Patton's next theatre of operations was the Sicilian invasion. It was here that his rivalry with Field Marshall Montgomery, which would continue to the end of the war, began. Here theme of Montgomery slugging it out with the best that the enemy had to offer while Patton made rapid advance against light opposition was born. It was in Sicily, too, that the slapping incidents, which would plague Patton and the American war effort, occurred.With the conclusion of the Sicilian campaign, Patton was transferred to England where he distracted the German's with his Phantom Army while others prepared for action. It was not until the month after D-Day that Patton began his legendary command of the Third Army and its dramatic sweep across France into Bavaria and Czechoslovakia. Throughout this Patton would be in constant battle with Eisenhower and Montgomery for supplies, almost as much as he was with the Germans for prisoners and territory.The last days of Patton are shown as a discouraging wind down of the career of a general who predicted that: \\"Peace will be hell on me.\\" The inability to obtain a combat command in the Pacific reflected Patton's standing among many of his fellow officers. His failure as Military Governor of Bavaria illustrated the weakness of his political skills.Farago provides the reader x with an introduction, later efforts into the order of battle, but also into the complex character interactions among the leading personae dramatae. The deteriorating relationships between Patton and Eisenhower, as Patton's indiscretions created repeated distractions for Ike, are contrasted with the improving relations between Patton and Bradley as Bradley, originally disgusted by Patton's bravado, gradually came to appreciate Patton's aggressiveness in contrast to the comparative lethargy of Montgomery.You see how much I was excited by this book. I read this in preparation for a one night continuing ed class about Patton. It provided me with most of what I needed to know in order to teach the class. I am well satisfied with the way it covered its subject. I am confident that you will be also."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"I have read most of the biographies of WWII Generals and politicians, yet this one brought tears to my eyes when I saw evidence of a massive jealousy and ego on behalf of America's generals and politicians because Patton was \\"insensitive\\". How we would rather a person be sensitive than proficient, such is the case with Patton. His ideas and plans would have saved America thousands of men, yet, the command and politics played behind the scenes to steal this man's thunder border on the obscene. Well written, well researched and proofed, I get the impression that the author went into the work somewhat biased against Patton and emerged as his fan, as anyone would who have read all the accounts of this war. I highly recommend this book for the historian who wants to know the truth. Sadly, our country has not produced any general of this caliber since WWII. The axiom is proven here; performance, personality and politics are necessary for greatness, but not necessarily in that order."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"This thick book has larger typeface than the small paperback I read years ago, however the binding was poor quality and during the first reading the spine cracked open in the middle despite my careful handling of the book. It's an open question whether I got a lemon or this publisher's work is shoddy, but there it is. The book itself is highly readable and Ladislas Farago does a good job in balancing anecdotes with stating historical facts to keep the reader entertained while informed as well."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"This was an enjoyable read as well as an excellent military history. Farago took a complex and mythologized character (Patton) in a complex military and political environment ( WWII) and wrote a history that reads like a novel. It comes close to the can't-put-it-down category. The paperback edition would have been improved by maps such as those found in the other excellent read, \\"A Soldier's Story\\" by Omar Bradley. It is more readable than Carlo D'Este's \\"A Genius for War\\" but focuses more on the military aspects of Patton's life.Farago portrays Patton as a general who was shrewd and instinctive and well studied in the art of war. He was deeply patriotic and a devoted to his Army . Despite his trials under the cautious leadership of Bradley and Eisenhower he never lost respect for either. His opinion of Montgomery was higher than most popular history would have us believe as well. His main problem with Monty was not Monty's ego but Monty's inability to get the job done as happened in Sicily, Falaise and Arnhem. Patton's faults and eccentricities get popular attention but his virtues as a combat leader and tactician far out weighed any of that. Had he been let loose in Europe the war would unquestionably have ended sooner. He could never have filled the shoes of Ike or Bradley but he was among a very small number of Allied generals including Hodges, Middleton, Patch and Simpson who knew that aggression wins wars. My father who served with Patton in North Africa and Sicily never liked the man but he respected the general. Watch the movie that was based on this book, but if you really want to understand a military genius read \\"Patton - Ordeal and Triumph\\"."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"If you like war history, you will love this book. From battlefield plans and stratagies to personal thoughts, Patton was fascinating. Some great quotes and some strange tales....I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"This book is a wonderful and instructive biography as well as a fine reference of the war in Europe written by a very good writer.Farago has nailed it right on the head.His description of one of America's greatest generals ever to command our forces was a joy to read.Patton is the model,the archetype, albeit a man with many faults but a man you would want to be on your side not theirs if you ever had to go into battle.A book visited by Francis Ford Coppola when hired to write the screenplay for the movie of the same name.You remember that one don't you.Many scenes and dialog were practically taken and used verbatum.The book traces him from his beginnings to his untimely death with just about everything in between.How his early days of struggle went on to shape and hone his adult personality, what drove him despite being considered an oddball primadonna by his peers.Yet all who knew him, worked for him or served under him grew to respect the man and what he tried to accomplish even at the expense of having to deal with his persona.I wish I could have met him just once.When given a job to do he did it with effectiveness and flair.The fight with Germany may have gone on longer than it did if Patton was never there.True, he did have many flubs some of which could have ended his career and nearly did several times.George had a big mouth and a short fuse which often got him into trouble with his superiors but as a military tactician he was brilliant and they knew it.The Germans feared him and in his many battles with them he usually came out on top.We need more men like him in the field today not these politically correct yes men who prance around trying to win hearts and minds.Look where that tact has gotten us, nowhere fast as more American soldiers come home in coffins.This book,nearly 900 pages long takes some time to get through but it is worth it.It will leave you with a complete and accurate picture of the man,his trials and tribulations and the battles he faced on the field and in the office.A more inspiring leader of men you will never find in modern times.He did believe that he was at many battle fields in the long forgotten past which may have helped him to find his destiny.A writer of poetry,a lover of fine wine,horses,discipline, an aristocrat in many ways yet war was what he was made for and this book will fill you in on all the details of his life and of some of the most difficult and famous battles in WWII Europe.There are many other biographies you could read about him perhaps too many, you need to narrow your search to just a few.If you value your time and want to get to the nuts and bolts of the man known as \\"old blood and guts\\" then look no further. Sure you could watch the movie but that just scratches the surface of the man.If you want to know what kind of leader we need today defending us at home and abroad or just want to get to know Patton himself, then this book should be your first choice for doing just that."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"this is one of the best biographies of george s patton that has been written. i have read 4 other biographies on him and none of them compare. he was not only a military genious and our greatest and most feared general to the gemrans, but, he was also very ecentric. he was very controversial, but, when leading troops into war there was no comparison. his belief was to attack, attack compared to montgomery's take it slow and be careful. the third army loved him ever though of his harsh ways and members were proud to say that they served under patton. if the supreme commander had given patton the oil and supples he wanted instead of \\"pleasing\\" montgomery, the war might of ended sooner than it did. if a person wants to know about patton's life, they should read this book."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"I am not writing a review as demanded mmmm pppp kkkk oooo iiii pppp oi po lk kk oo ll"},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"Reading this and Gen.

Of course Bradley's is an autobiography, so that accounts for a bias there. The Patton book delves deeply into Gen. Patton who was a complex person, and it does not gloss over his faults. But some of the military issues can be understood only by examing other sources as well."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"The book was one of the best I have read, it clearly told the story of General Patton and put to rest some of the falsehoods about the General."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"Patton: Ordeal and TriumphLadislas Farago's book, PATTON: ORDEAL and TRIUMPH is the first of a second generation of military history books about the United States Army in the European Theater during World War II. On the back cover the reader is informed that, \\"The book survived an assault of law suits which sought to prevent its publication. That is was published is a testament to the courage and perserverance of the author and the original publisher.\\" Throw in Ladislas Farago's excellant writing and thorough research and you have an easy 5 star selection.To say that Farago's book on Patton is revisionist is a classic understatement. Right after the war ended, George S. Patton's book WAR AS I KNEW IT(1947), Ralph Ingersoll's TOP SECRET(1946)and Captain Harry C. Butcher's MY THREE YEARS WITH EISENHOWER(1946)were published. These books tended to tell the truth, as best these three men knew it at the time. Patton had died from an automobile accident shortly afer the war ended and his memoirs were published by his wife Beatrice Patton Waters. These three books revealed an unpleasant secret, that the Anglo-American Alliance was flawed at the highest levels of the allied command. The British and Americans never could agree on the right strategy to use against the Germans. This was in stark contrast to accounts written by Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower and the senior U.S. Commander in Europe, General Omar N. Bradley.During the war Eisenhower had gotten high grades from both British and Americans for his committment to the Anglo-American Alliance. He continued this policy after the war had ended. Eisenhower admitted that there were disagreements between the allies, but suggested that these disagreements were settled amicably and caused no serious problems in their ongoing strategic efforts to defeat the Germans. General Bradley (in A Soldier's Story, 1951) was far more critical of British Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery but never questioned Eisenhower's broader point that the alliance was a huge success. Forrest C. Pogue, Martin Blumenson and other official and unofficial U.S. Army historians adopted Eisenhower's position on disagreements between the allies, which is to say that they were surpressed. George Patton, Harry Butcher and Ralph Ingersoll were treated as renegade officers, poor historians and men with a grudge against Eisenhower or the British.For twenty years Eisenhower's official version of the war in Europe was seldom challenged then in 1964 along came Ladislas Farago. Farago's solid reputation and his impeccible research were impossible to ignore. So the official gatekeepers of U.S. military history tried, but failed, to surpress publication of the book. Farago's book gave George Patton's reputation an immediate shot in the arm. The famous movie PATTON followed and 10 years later the British began releasing copies of their hugely successful ULTRA intercepts of encoded German ENGIMA radio traffic. What ULTRA revealed and what a series of revisionist historical accounts of the war have since documented is that Patton, Ingersoll and Butcher had gotten it right back in the late 1940's.Farago takes General George S. Patton, Jr. through North Africa, Sicily and the slapping incidents, Eisenhower's doghouse in England, the Knutsford incident, command of the fictional First U.S. Army Group, still in Eisenhower's doghouse, the waiting before given command of U.S.Third Army, finally command of Third Army, the breakout from the Carentan, turning the corner over one good road at Avranches, the mistake going into Brittany and the drive onto the open German southern flank at Le Mans. Farago tells it all in infinite detail. Farago's writing about the Battle of the Falaise Gap is very good, almost an hour by hour account. Farago recounts Patton's drive across France, his gas shortages, banging his head against the Germans at Metz, anticipating the German attack in the Ardennes and his drive into the southern German flank to rescue the defenders of Bastogne. Farago also gives an accurate blow by blow description of British efforts (P.M. Winston Churchill and C.I.G.S. Alan Brooke)to secure American troops to serve under British Field Marshal Montgomery. The British were very short of men and were incapable of conducting sustained offensive operations on their own. If the reader wants to understand how British efforts to undermine the American command influenced Allied strategy and how General George Patton's place in the pecking order of Allied generals was secured, Ladislas Farago's, PATTON, is a great place to start.For additional reading on this subject the reader may want to consider: Carlo D'Este's PATTON: A GENIUS FOR WAR, Martin Blumenson's THE BATTLE OF THE GENERALS, Canadian Major General Richard Rohmer's PATTON'S GAP, or William Weidner's EISENHOWER & MONTGOMERY at the FALAISE GAP."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"Loved this book, a fascinating portrayal of a flawed but brilliant military leader and tactician. Could of won the war by himself if Ike had of let him, and if Monty's ego didn't get in the way all the time! The fact that he was perhaps not a perfect man does not take away from the fact that he was a leader and warrior of the highest calibre.The book contains good detail regarding battles, locations etc, but not so much that you get lost in the details.Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning more about this larger than life WW2 General."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"I was lured into buying Patton because I read somewhere the war would have ended sooner had the generals listened to Patton. I found this statement to be partially true andpartially far-fetched - mostly true.

While the movie was great, this shows much more of General Patton than the movie ever could. It shows his early years, including fighting in WWI where he basically developed the American Tank Corps. It also shows how he almost did not make it to WWII, due largely to his own actions. It goes without saying that General Patton was one of the best American generals in WWII, but few people realize how close he came to being \\"sent home\\" (i. e. forced out of the Army), during the period between the wars and even during the early part of the American involvement in WWII. The only complaint about the Kindle version of the book is that the maps at the end of the book are almost impossible to read. It is only because I was stationed in Germany, that I was able to visualize where the action was taking place."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph","review":"The book, \\"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph\\" is a well researched book.

The book is based off of a conference sponsored by the Cato Institute, so it has a libertarian slant. The first section on copyright theory is helpful if you aren't familiar with it, but I found that the arguments were basically the same ones I read in my copyright casebook. A large chunk of the book talks about the DMCA and in particular its anti-circumvention provision, with most of the writers complaining against it. The points they make can get repetitive, and I found myself skimming them after a while. I was disappointed that the writers weren't more creative about their topics; there are certainly other issues going on out there. There are a few chapters towards the end that talk about patents, and since I know nothing about patents and didn't get the book to learn about them I didn't bother with those chapters at all."},{"Title":"High Performance Oracle8 Tuning: Performance and Tuning Techniques for Getting the Most from Your Oracle8 Database","review":"I have all of the Oracle tuning books and this is the one that I use most often.

I wish I could get back the hours I forced myself to finish this piece of garbage.For the life of me, I can't understand why publishers keep printing this book. I've read better articles about dialogue by amateur writers online. Why'd they pick this guy to write this book? Most of what he has published is non-fiction or poetry. Many of the few fiction books he's published were co-authored."},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"I purchased this book a while ago, and never had a chance to review it until now. This book is quite awful.&quot;Why you might ask?&quot; Well, Virginia, this book's format is really unhelpful and tries so hard to be cute it might as well be hanging in a Christmas stocking and tied up with a bow.Each chapter in 'Dialogue' is meant to discuss a different technique for writing dialogue. But the author tries too hard to be cute with an on-going discussion between himself and a fictional persona that the real purpose: illustrating the different dialogue types is obscured. Also, the 'fictional banter' is cute at first but quickly becomes more torturous than nails on a chalkboard.This book fails for me as a writing reference because its neither quick nor either to use. Perhaps if they re-issue this book, the illustrations of each method could be done in a more structured and less obscure way.I give this two stars for its torturous uncomfortable prose....Experienced writiers may be able to glean some tidbits from the long-winded narration."},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"This book is probably the worst how-to writer's book I have ever read. Actually, I'll admit I didn't read much of it. I kept waiting for the author to break out of his ridiculous \\"Socratic method\\" style and get to the point, but as far as I could see he never did. The style alone sets up an impenetrable barrier between author and reader - if there is any useful content in the book, it's so far buried underneath the annoying chatter that you're unlikely to ever find it.The only good thing about the presentation is that it's so hard to follow, it's unlikely anyone will actually take its bad advice. It reminds me of a Nigerian email scam I received once where the instructions were so convoluted and poorly written that even if I had wanted to take part in the scheme, there was no way I would ever figure out what the steps were supposed to be.I can't imagine how anything like this actually could have been published. It's a joke."},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"Unfortunately, real conversation usually makes for poor literary dialogue. There's an excellent book (called &quot;Dialog&quot; by Lewis Turco and published by Writer's Digest Books) that explains this rather well."},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"\\"This book was awful,\\" I said to Lily.\\"I know!\\" she replied empathetically. \\"It's horrible! It is, without question, the worst 'how to write' book I have ever read.\\"This book is an unmitigated disaster, start to finish. I don't even know where to begin!The biggest annoyance was the author's unskilled use of the Socratic Method; the entire book is one giant dialogue between a fictionalized author and his foi, with bits of a fictionalized editor thrown into a few places. At one point, Turco's fictional editor says, \\"your strategy in this book is certainly unusual and imaginative ... however, I don't believe it has precisely the effect you intended.\\" Unless, of course, his intent was to bore the bejeezus out of his audience...Throughout the dialogue, the Author (always capitalized in the book) comes across as egotistical, condescending and impatient. Speaking of \\"impatient,\\" I found myself incredibly bored throughout the book, and often sighed with exasperation. I wished it would either have moved more quickly or covered the points more thoroughly - one or the other. Instead, it lives in some frustrating middle land, neither informative and interesting nor quick and light. It's vexing and leaves soooo much to be desired. At many points, my brain shrieked \\"why can't this just END?!\\" and yet I kept reading, hoping to glean something useful, hoping the author would have something good to offer. I searched in vain.The Socratic dialogue would have been useful in places, to show examples and illustrate do's and don'ts; however, as a style for the entire book, it just drove me like oxen. The story is not interesting enough to read as a storoy, and it's not informative enough to read to learn anything. Turco could have either used a different style, or he could have made Fred Foyle (ha, ha - get it? \\"Foyle,\\" \\"foil?\\" Oh, wackiness!) a more interesting and sympathetic character. As it stands, he was a whiny, frustrated, completely uninteresting nuisance.Worse, Turco frequently makes comments which lead me to believe he understood that this book doesn't work - and yet he forged ahead, seemingly oblivious to his editor's and his own misgivings. Argh! Passages such as this are sprinkled throughout:\\"I thought he'd never leave,\\" Fred writes. \\"Sure I can type. Whatever he can do, I can do as well or better. This business of being Fred Foyle is a drag. Why could it have been I whom am the author instead? I could have invented him instead ... no, I'd have invented someone else, just to get even ... only, if I were the author and he weren't invented, how could I get even with him? Man, this is getting too philosophical for a book on how to write dialogue in fiction. Let's keep it simple.\\"Ah, if only Turco had taken his own advice!He also uses the same example of a dialogue involving a secretary and a teacher over and over and over again, despite his own admission that it's *boring* and painful. ARGH! He uses stereotypes and many places, and one of his example stories, \\"Savants,\\" was so incredibly offensive that I was tempted to put the book down right then.I truly cannot convey how awful this book was - the *entire* time I was reading it, I had this huge, impatient tightness in my chest, pleading with me to stop. But, as I said, I kept going in hopes of learning something.To be fair, there are a few handy tidbits in here (don't use too many adjectives and adverbs in tag lines, don't go on and on, and don't use overly-complex tag lines as an excuse to avoid writing the dialogue itself,) but there's nothing that can't be learned elsewhere with less torment.My advice? DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! If you happen across any copies of it, back away slowly without making any sudden movements. It is EVIL!"},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"I've read all the books in the Elements of Fiction Writing series and this is how I'd rank them.&quot;Scene &amp; Structure&quot; &quot;Characters &amp; Viewpoint&quot; &quot;Beginnings, Middles &amp; Ends&quot;The above three books are invaluable -- must reads. They are the best of the series, in my opinion, and are packed with good information on every page. Well-done.&quot;Conflict, Action &amp; Suspense&quot; &quot;Description&quot; &quot;Plot&quot; &quot;Manuscript Submission&quot; &quot;Setting&quot;The above five books are good, solid reads. Again, they contain good information and cover the subject decently.&quot;Voice &amp; Style&quot; &quot;Dialogue&quot;To me, the last two books need to be rewritten. They are by far the weakest of the series. Both suffer from an annoying style, particularly Dialogue, and both are very skimpy on real information. Neither one is very helpful.This is the order in which I'd recommend reading them."},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"I'm sure there must be good books on dialogue out there, but this doesn't seem to be one of them. This is good for the absolute novice, but not for someone looking for more meat. The device of creating a &quot;person to talk to&quot; in the Socratic method falls flat on its face -- very boring dialog between the two &quot;main characters&quot; (of the author and his created counterpart) kills the lessons of the book: how to keep dialogue interesting.Instead of this tripe, look up the book &quot;Stein on Writing&quot; by Sol Stein. Chapter 11, The Secrets of Good Dialog, lasts 12 pages and is worth infinitely more than this book, and bonus! there are 34 other chapters to learn additional writing techniques as well. Get that instead of this... you'll spend your money wisely."},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"\\"So, why does everybody think this book sucks?\\"\\"Because, for the most part, it does,\\" the Reviewer answers.The Reader fixes the Reviewer with a quizzical look, \\"Why, what is wrong with it?\\"\\"The biggest problem is that it is completely written in dialogue. As the Author of the book pointed out, dialogue is supposed to contribute and further a plot and make it interesting. The problem with this book was that there was no plot to further and no story to make interesting. This book isn't fiction nor should it be, this is a book on a non-fiction matter that the Author decided to turn into a story,\\" the Reviewer says.\\"So, it doesn't work?\\" asked the Reader.\\"Not at all! In fact, the editor of the book is turned into a fictional character as well and even he or she is opposed to explaining dialogue in his chosen way. If I want a story, I'll pick one up. I wanted something that will teach me and this book wasn't it.\\"The Reader contemplates the opinion of the Reviewer and asked, \\"How should it have been different?\\"The Reviewer scratches his goatee while thinking quietly to himself and replies, \\"Well, first of all, this should not have been done in Dialogue. Like I said, it didn't work. It turned out to be a conversation that jumped all over the place and was very distracting from the subject matter at hand. It should have been done in textbook style with subjects neatly covered before moving on instead of jumping back and forth between topics.\\"Also, I would include story samples that were not written by the Author, as they all were. That made me loose credibility with the Author.\\"Finally, the Author thinks he is funny and hits us with a lot of \`witty' dialogue during the banter between the Author, Fred Foyle, and Nan Dedditor (Nan the Editor). Sadly, he isn't funny and it distracted from the subject and just plain irritated me. If the book was not done in dialogue the \`humor' would have not been in the book and it would have been better,\\" the Reviewer explains.\\"But, was there anything good with the book?\\" the Reader asked.\\"Don't get me wrong, I did find some useful information. But you've got to dig for it and if you wish to refer to it later on, good luck! The topics are scattered and revisited so much that finding anything again is complicated.\\"The Reader then asks, \\"So, who should read this book?\\"Again, the Reviewer thinks about it for a little bit, \\"I would recommend other writing and dialogue books long before recommending this one. If you've got nothing else to read and still want to learn about Dialogue then pick up this book. You might learn something. But I don't think this will do much for most people who want to learn how to write better.\\"The Reader looks the Reviewer in the eyes and says, \\"This review annoys me.\\"The Reviewer looks back at him and says, \\"I am attempting to show you how this book is written. I've never written a review this way before and hopefully never will again. Please forgive me.\\""},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"I read two other books in this series (Plot by Ansen Dibell and Beginnings, Middles, &amp; Ends by Nancy Kress) and they were excellent, so I decided to try this one.Unfortunately, Mr. Turco suffers from twin delusions: one, that he is humorous, and two, that his device (teaching dialogue through the use of Socratic dialogue) is useful, amusing, or instructive. I barely limped into chapter three, and restrained myself from throwing the book at the wall only because I was in the employee kitchen, and not my own home."},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"I purchased this as the accompanying text to an Internet course. In conjunction with the lessons, it was mildly helpful, but as a stand-alone I would have gotten nothing from it.Unfortunately, the author chose to write this book about dialogue in the form of a dialogue--a clever premise, but not easy to follow. With the exeption of some actual stories, most of which he wrote himself, the examples are incorporated into a dialogue between the author, and his creation Fred Foyle, with a visit now and then from Nan Dedditor(get it?). Nan doesn't care for the format, or for the author using this as a vehicle for his short stories. Frankly, I think Turco would have done better to listen to what Nan had to say.I found the format very confusing. I had to read over some passages several times before I could post my lesson. Besides that, only one of the stories was any good. The others had apparently been written by the author in earlier times--or perhaps that was just his way of excusing a rather amateur style.All in all, I'm glad I got this used, and didn't pay full price. It's not something that can easily be used for future reference."},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"I was very disappointed in the book. The book was very hard to read because the dialogue was very boring. (He wrote the book as if he was having a conversation with himself.) This style made it useless as a reference manual.I would recommend the following books instead: Writing Dialogue by Tom Chiarella and Film Scriptwriting: A Practical Manual by Swain &amp; Swain."},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"What a collossal disappointment this book was - if Amazon had a zero star option, I'd choose that.Dialog is, of course, a key aspect of writing a good novel, and the added challenge is that written dialog in a novel is not the same as simply transcribing what people say in real life. There are a complexity of conventions and simplifications and devices and &quot;tricks&quot; and &quot;skills&quot; that are needed in order to craft the dialog that is so essential in a readable - and sellable - novel.This writer's oblique attempt at illustrating what he talks about, for me at least, completely failed. I don't just mean partially or largely. I do mean completely failed. :( Consequently, as a text on how to write dialog, the book was a complete disappointment, and although I grimly read every page of it (although I'll confess I did skip some of the overly long samples of other writing), at the end of the experience, I felt I'd learned nothing.Fortunately, reviewers before me have been kind enough to suggest some better texts on this topic. I just wish I'd followed their advice in the first place, and hope that you, dear reader, will be smarter than I! :)"},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"Slim volume. Too much info about obvious techniques: how to use quotations, quotations within quotations, how to properly format a script, etc. NOT enough explanation about the ways in which dialogue can establish desire, opposition, conflict, setting, and character. Overall, the book is well written (grammatically correct), well thought out (clearly defined concepts) but LACKING in any USEFUL substance (ie, ways the writer can USE the dialogue to MOVE the narrative forward). This book is OK for a high-school level introduction to the elements of dialogue."},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","review":"I tried reading this cover to cover and, as another reviewer noted, this &quot;Socratic&quot; style of the author in a conversation with a beginning writer is irritating and self-consciously unfunny. However it DOES unintentionally provide an example of what NOT to do in dialogue: draw it out endlessly, in a circle going nowhere. If brevity is the soul of wit, this book has neither brevity nor wit. Just about any other book on dialogue--or even a book with just a solid chapter on dialogue--would be a better investment."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"Laurie Colwin wrote a gem. It should be read at home, on trains, in airplanes, on the subway. It should be bought for loved ones, for brides and grooms, for parents and siblings, for best friends. It should have won the Pulitzer."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"A friend recommended this book and I loved it. From her quick recipe for soup to making shepherd's pie for 150, Colwin's writing is beautiful and familiar. She's got a sense of humor and excellent taste buds. I can't wait to read everything else she wrote."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"A wonderful set of essays and cooking suggestions! By the end of the book, I returned to Amazon and ordered three more of Colwin's books. Not only were the recipes intriguing and easy, but I ended up wishing I could invite her to my house for dinner! Unfortunately, at the end of the book, I noticed that the author had died suddenly and unexpectedly 20 years ago at only 48 years old. I truly felt that I had lost a friend when I learned this...her outlook on life and cooking were so appealing."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"Loved this book so much I bought the next one, too. She's a great writer and I enjoy the fact that she can so easily write about what she obviously loves doing.

Since her passing, I have kinda put her at the back of my brain. recently I ordered her old essays and really enjoyed the writing. The material is dated. It was the late 80's. Still, her candor and style are impressive. If you're a foodie, read her. You'll love her as I do."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"Home Cooking-a cook in the kitchen by Laurie Colwin is a fun, easy to read essay style book I purchased used through Amazon. Recipes make it interesting along with the personal stories. Good time well spent."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"I came to Laurie Colwin by way of her column in the late lamented Gourmet Magazine. Her commentaries on dinner party disasters, the trials and joys of jam making, the search for the perfect gingerbread charmed and drew me in. More significantly, they made me realize that thoughtfully prepared meals are the frosting on the cake of life and that talking and thinking about food are just as enjoyable as eating. I was devastated by the news of her untimely death, and was thrilled to come across this book and its sequel, More Home Cooking.Food was a continuous exploration to Colwin. Her approach to cooking was to experiment with what ingredients were available and to spend time analyzing why some things worked and some didn't. While many of her recipes were not keepers in my household, her spirit of adventure in the kitchen was and still is and has led me to develop recipes and menus that have become treasured staples. And, if nothing else, the recipe for Tomato Pie with the biscuit crust is sublime and well worth the cover price of the book. Since I can't remember if it's in this one or the other one, you'll have to investigate both.Colwin's stories about her own kitchen failures; the brownies that came out like firebrick, the rosti that turned black, and the lemon pudding that no one would eat are timeless delights and show us that cooking is an art as well as a science and should always be considered in context. First and foremost though, Colwin was a gifted and skillful writer. The infamous starry gazey pie incident would not be as hilarious nor as memorable without descriptions of the other guests, the elegant house where it was served, and the woefully inadequate other components of the meal. Human and honest, Colwin appeals even to readers who live far from sources of goat's milk yogurt or Latvian bread.The real juice of these two books is in their ability to inspire the reader to go on his or her own voyage of culinary exploration. They will inspire one to seek out Jane Grigson, MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David; purchase an unfamiliar vegetable and throw a handful of cheese into the polenta. Experiment and find things you like, is the message, and don't be afraid of stove and market. Generous in spirit, funny, smart and creative, Home Cooking is a must have for any foodie's collection."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"Not a new book by any means, but a good one none-the-less. Laurie Colwin, was a writer who used to do some writing for Gourmet magazine. I always enjoyed her articles, until a chilling note in Gourmet magazine announced she had died. Given that, I had wondered what some of her books were like. This is the first of her's I've read.This book is more of a recollection of various different cooking/eating experiences.We've all had them, but we may not have Laurie's passion or experience in the kitchen.It is a pleasant book to read and weaves through many of her early experiences, as well as some many years later. Imagine this book as a collection of conversations you might have with someone over a transatlantic flight. One story weaves into the other until you have a patchwork of a person's life relative to a single topic. In this case; cooking, relative to home cooking and entertaining on a small scale.Laurie was a practical cook by all accounts and this comes through in her recipes and writing. The only complaint I might have is some of the recipes are not specific enough. Some of the quantities are left \\"to taste\\". Having not made some of the items before, it is hard to judge what \\"to taste\\" would be...She was an excellent writer. I will miss her Gourmet magazine articles and it saddens me that I have only a limited number books of hers to read in the future."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"I enjoyed reading the 2nd \\"Writer in the kitchen\\" book and thought I'd backtrack and read the 1st. I enjoy this woman's writing style very much. Light, witty, very engaging. It's sad this woman died so early. As for the recipes, for the most part they are pretty ordinary if not downright boring by today's standards. I realize these books were written many years before the avalanche of cooking magazines and chef's cooking shows and cutting edge restaurants. So, at the time the books were written, the simplicity of ingredients and casual cooking style was probably very refreshing. If you don't cook much, both these books might give you confidence to start. The cranberry pie thingie was great."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"LAURIE COLWIN'S WONDERFUL COOKBOOK IS FULL OF WONDERFUL RECIPES AS WELL AS HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS TO THE NOVICE OR EXPERIENCED COOK.

LAURIE COLWIN WAS A GIFTED STORYTELLER AND THE TALES SHE SHARES HERE ARE AN INSIGHT INTO HER HOME LIFE AMIDST HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THE RECIPES THEMSELVES ARE ENJOYABLE IN THE READING AND IN THE EATING. HER CAREFREE APPROACH TO COOKING AND HER OBVIOUS ENJOYMENT OF PREPARING FOOD AS WELL AS EATING IT ARE EVIDENT THROUGHOUT.

Even Ms. Colwin admitted that she bought cookbooks just to read them, but I'm sure she tried some of the recipes as well. She described, by name, several cookbooks she had on hand, most or all out of print, and it made me wish I could read them as well. To show how cleverly she turned a phrase, I was inspired to cook something and did! I tried a recipe for bread that, when she wrote it, had me almost tasting it. Alas, said bread did not turn out as hoped. I had someone else (an experienced cook) try it as well, and it was somewhat disappointing. No big deal. I'd rather read than cook, anyway."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"This is a wonderful homage to the delights of food. It's more than a cookbook,fun and readable like the best novels, but as easy to read as one of your favorite magazines. It's filled with Laurie Colwin's humor and cooking knowledge. She also tells us how food is a mirror of our lives. I like how she says you don't need a lot of fancy equipment to prepare really delicious food."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"I had read Laurie Colwins columns in Gourmet for years, and each time felt as though I had just had a great conversation with a friend.

I,too, always seem to find my way into someones kitchen, prefering to watch and peek and learn from someone than the usual cocktail or dinner party chat.

Here, she shows that she was also a terrific cook. With a few words, she can conjure up images of splendid meals, as well as some spectacularly awful ones.

(Unfortunately, the author has since died.) She writes well and describes horrific meals as well as delicious comfort food. A few recipes are included, but it is primarily a book about cooking. It's a great book to keep near the bed to read while you are eating a late night sandwich. The book can be picked up and opened to any chapter. The author writes about food in a fun way and makes something we all have to do from time to time (some of us more than others) interesting and motivating. I have to end now, so I can go make a sandwich."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"My friend Cindy- who is an absolute sweetheart- surprised me one day with two books she thought I should read- Laurie Colwin's Home Cooking: A Writer in the Kitchen, and the aptly named followup, More Home Cooking: A Writer Returns to the Kitchen.Colwin was a popular and prolific novelist with a loyal following, but these two collections of essays are, I suspect, even more popular than her novels. She is a writer with an easy style, and an unpretentious voice that draws you in to her world. Consider this opening to the first essay in Home Cooking:\\"Unlike some people, who love to go out, I love to stay home. This may be caused by laziness, anxiety, or xenophobia, and in the days when my friends were traveling in Nepal and Bolivia, I was ashamed to admit that what I liked best was hanging around the house.I am probably not much fun as a traveler, either. My idea of a good time abroad is to visit someone's house and hang out, poking into their cupboard if they will let me.\\"Colwin comes across as very much the homebody, and very much a fan of home cooking. You have to love a food writer who has chapter titles like Repulsive Dinners: A Memoir. And you can't help being captivated by a writer who explains her love of reading cookbooks by describing her discovery that good cookbooks have all the great food descriptions of a Barbara Pym novel, but without all the messy plot details. Colwin's books are full of wonderful stories of cooking and dining with friends, and recipes. They're mostly simple dishes that don't require any special technique, and that can be counted on to delight company. Some seem a bit dated now- the book came out of pieces written for Gourmet Magazine in the 80s and 90s- but they're still all good, even if a bit evocative of the spinach-dip-in-hollowed-bread era.If your favorite social activity is dining at home with friends, if you like home style cooking rather than exotic \\"foodie\\" cooking, or if you just like reading about cooking from someone with an unpretentious enthusiasm for good, simple food, I think you'll be delighted by these books."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"A great way to spend a summer morning or better yet a winter one! Grab your hot cocoa and enjoy."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"I haven't run across much food writing that can make me laugh out loud, but this book did just that. These are chatty, revelatory, often humorous essays on cooking, entertaining, and domestic life in general. Colwin's approach is warm and accessible. You need not be a cook to enjoy the book, but it might make you want to start using your kitchen for more than just the microwave oven. There are informal recipes scattered throughout the book, and some more formal ones at the end of most of the essays. She demystifies daunting tasks such as baking bread, and encourages the reader to \\"always try everything, even if it turns out to be a dud. We learn by doing.\\"If you've had your share of kitchen disasters, Colwin is here to commiserate. She shares some of her worst mistakes, as well as a few of the disgusting foods other people have tried to feed her. There's her attempt at Dundee Cake, where her guests were served \\"a ring of buttered sawdust in which was embedded a series of jujubes.\\" And then there was the peculiarly crunchy tortellini she served to some guests who had been smoking a lot of marijuana, after which one of them said, \\"Hey, wouldn't it be groovy if we could dump this whatever it is in the garbage and go out for dinner?\\"The 33 essays range from basics like fried chicken and potato salad to special cases such as How to Avoid Grilling, How to Disguise Vegetables, and Kitchen Horrors. The variety of topics makes the book especially useful and much more enjoyable to read. I'll be keeping it on hand for kitchen reference, and just for laughs."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"It's hard for me to believe, but there was a time when I didn't eat lots of things, and one of those things was red bell peppers... and then I read Laurie Colwin's swooning appreciation in her essay about the vegetable and was seduced into the produce section. I never looked back. This book, unlike many of the cookbooks acquired before and since, actively changed the way I looked at cooking and was like having a dear friend invite me into her kitchen to hang out while she puttered around. I still, after many years, often cook from this book and its companion, \\"More Home Cooking\\", as well as reread them for the sheer pleasure of sharing Laurie Colwin's deep delight in food."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"Lauri Colwin takes an easy attitude to cooking and claims to enjoy simple meals that are simple to make. Her writing was very enjoyable and even humorous, but I'm always a little suspicious of cooks who say, &quot;Oh, it's easy.&quot; These things probably are easy for people who like to cook or at least don't dislike it.I don't like to cook. Unfortunately, I sometimes get hungry, and I like to eat good food. Liking good food and not liking to cook don't go together very well. Lauri Colwin devotes an entire chapter to potato salad, a chapter she begins &quot;There is no such thing as really bad potato salad. So long as the potatoes are not undercooked, it tastes pretty good to me.&quot; I'm here to tell you that is simply not true. Colwin never had the misfortune of eating some of my early potato salads. For years, I made really bad potato salad, and the potatoes were not undercooked. What exactly was wrong with my potato salad? I wish I knew. I followed Mother's recipe. She made great potato salad, but mine tasted like dirt. Have you ever tasted dirt? It's nasty. Finally, I gave up potato salad (I don't care for supermarket potato salad) and just regarded it as a gourmet treat whenever someone else served it. About five years ago, I decided to try again. It was delicious. Now I'm not ashamed to take my potato salad anywhere, and it often gets compliments.Sometimes I think the food knows when you don't want to have anything to do with its preparation and refuses to cooperate. I have a very long list of foods that don't want to cooperate. Reading Lauri Colwin's book isn't likely to make me a better cook, but at least it made me think it might be pleasant to be one. Her breadmaking saga is especially entertaining."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"I believe this copy was described as excellent. It wasn't; it was a rather beat up library copy, but the price was good."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"It think the author scores points for writing this book because of her fame AFTER her death."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"A talented and extraordinarily accessible writer, Laurie Colwin died unexpectedly at the age of forty-eight in October 1992. In &quot;Home Cooking,&quot; as in her other books, Colwin's writing charmingly combines an easy, conversational style, an innate curiosity and a good-natured disrespect for things fancy. She was a decidedly unstuffy columnist for GOURMET magazine for some years, giving the magazine a needed breath of fresh air.If you have not already partaken of the pleasures of reading Colwin's work, I urge you to buy a copy of &quot;Home Cooking.&quot; Colwin is insouciant, opinionated and very funny. My favorite chapter in &quot;Home Cooking&quot; is entitled \\"Repulsive Dinners: A Memoir\\". It begins:\\"There is something triumphant about a really disgusting meal. It lingers in the memory with a lurid glow, just as something exalted is remembered with a kind of mellow brilliance...I am thinking about meals that are positively loathsome from soup to nuts, although one is not usually fortunate enough to get either soup or nuts.\\"With great relish, Colwin describes several perfectly horrid meals, the most striking of which is a variation of the medieval starry gazey pie, \\"in which the crust is slit so that the whole baked eels within can poke their nasty little heads out and look at the piecrust stars with which the top is supposed to be festooned.\\"The recipes in &quot;Home Cooking&quot; seem almost like afterthoughts to her meanderings on entertaining, home and hearth, and disguising vegetables, but they are mostly very good and always very simple. Colwin's gingerbread recipe is particularly delicious, and will make your house smell like a Christmas party. Highly recommended both as a cozy read and as a source of reliable recipes. We lost her too young, but Laurie Colwin lives on in &quot;Home Cooking&quot; and her other fine books."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"This is the first book containing a collection of Laurie Colwin's columns for Gourmet magazine. Colwin died suddenly of heart problems at age 48 in 1992. Many of you may have read her fiction (A Big Storm Knocked It Down, Happy All the Time, etc.). When she died, she left an additional 12 columns, some of which are in &quot;More Home Cooking&quot;, a companion to &quot;Home Cooking&quot;.&quot;Home Cooking&quot; is a great memoir, disguised as a collection of columns about food! It has stories, vignettes, food lore and advice, and...oh, yes some recipes. I love the titles of the columns--some were: Alone in the Kitchen with an Eggplant; Repulsive Dinners: A Memoir; Kitchen Horrors.Colwin was an engaging, amusing, clever, and elegant writer. She was not afraid to stand back and laugh at herself as she told about kitchen mistakes she had made. Her nurturing nature is apparent in her writing. I would have loved to have known her, to have had her as a friend.I have read this book, or portions of it, many times and it keeps getting better."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"I've always loved Laurie Colwin's novels and short stories. I've always been an avid (and an immodestly talented) home cook. So I was delighted when she first began writing her monthly food columns in Gourmet magazine. What a brilliant idea to ask a skillful writer of fiction to create columns devoted to food. Of course, I've owned the two collections gathered from those wonderful columns, but decided I had to get a new set to give to a friend. This month's Gourmet magazine offers Anna Quindlen's loving memories of Laurie Colwin, which triggered my ordering the books.After reading the first volume, I had to write her a letter. I was telling her about a recipe to which she responded by saying, &quot;sounds way too complicated to me.&quot; The recipe had only three ingredients. We would periodically exchange letters (she actually sent postcards). So when she died of a heart attack at the age of 48, I was stunned and profoundly sad. I thought I would be reading her Gourmet columns for years to come. Now that wonderful voice was silenced.I've made Colwin's simple roast chicken many times. Her chocolate cakes are predictably wonderful, but it is her recipe for &quot;Damp Gingerbread,&quot; that I return to most often. And when I do, I invariably reread one of her chapters. You can't imagine a more vivid and cozy writer. It's Colwin's distinct voice that captures my imagination--the simplicty of her prose style, the elegance of her thoughts and her refusal to take anything too seriously (except her daughter) that I find most appealing. This is writing that makes you smile. You can actually smell things cooking in these stories. I hope they stay in print forever for generations to admire. So the next time you're thinking of roast chicken (and who doesn't) pull down a copy of HOME COOKING."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"Laurie Colwin's columns in \\"Gourmet\\" were a reason to subscribe to that publication. Unfortunately, heart problems claimed her life when she was 48. Her writings have been compiled in this book, Home Cooking, and a sequel (unpublished columns she left after her untimely death in More Home Cooking.)Ms. Colwin was always opinionated, so you may find her obsessions with such things as yogurt, beets and boiled beef not to your food tastes. But even if you never make a single recipe in this book, the writing is some of the sharpest and best there is.The book does have a set of gingerbread recipes that make it entirely worthwhile. Colwin spent some time trying to find the Holy Grail of gingerbread. This homey treat is often overlooked, but greeted with glad cries at the end of a simple meal of soup, especially if served with a lump of good vanilla ice cream, or even home-made applesauce. This book will save you a search for a better recipe than ones typically found in standard cooking books. Her roast chicken advice is also not to be despised. All in all, one of my favorite books just to read on a dreary day."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"I discovered Laurie Colwin by accident (luck!), and have fallen in love with her writing. I read &quot;Home Cooking&quot; in two days, and then went on to devour &quot;More Home Cooking.&quot; Reading this book makes you feel like you are in Laurie's kitchen with her, just chatting and creating some delicious food. Her musings are interesting, inspiring, and down to earth. In many ways, she is the anti-Martha Stewart, as she openly admits short cuts she takes (cutting up canned tomatoes while they're still in the can!), and discourages purchasing lots of kitchen paraphenalia. Throughout all of her writing and her cooking, the biggest ingredient is love. I felt warm all over reading this book, and whether you're into cooking or just having a great read, I'm sure that you will too!"},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"I first read this terrific book about eight years ago and my copy is dog-eared and stained with &quot;pure cane syrup,&quot; etc., as apparently are the copies of other reviewers. I read it when I need to feel comforted, consoled, uplifted, as well as when I need a recipe. On a disturbing note, I read on the back flap of a more recent book of Colwin's that she had passed away. I wrote to the publisher, saddened that we would never hear her wonderful literary voice again, but received no reply."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"This book is so much fun to read. It feels like you're in her kitchen, having a good chat with an old friend. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys food, cooking and/or entertaining."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"Lori Colwin brings a smile to your face and makes you laugh out loud as you read through her experiences of living and loving food.The &quot;homecooked&quot; recipes,included in annecdotale format make you want to get into the kitchen and cook something wonderful to share with your family.My copy of this book is dog eared with recipes I've tried and must try.This book is an excellent addition to anyone's collection, and a must for Foodies !"},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"This book was my first by Laurie Colwin, and I have re-read it many times. I especially love the recipe for beef barley soup, which I had always wanted to make but wasn't sure how to go about. She makes cooking seem a very natural part of living and family life, like you can fit a home-cooked meal into all the other things you do like the carpool and the laundry and your job. I also love the horrible meal chapter."},{"Title":"Home Cooking","review":"'Home Cooking' by Laurie Colwin is the kind of book that really makes you wish you could become friends with the author. Unfortunately, the author is no longer with us, so there is a lot more than the usual barrier between celebrity and mere mortal between reader and writer.The chapters in the book are essays composed of both culinary and autobiographical material, although the book is not a memoir a la Ruth Reichl's two books. It is also not culinary criticism or exposition in the style of John Thorne. It is most similar to the kind of essays written by Elizabeth David, one of the author's heroes, and M.F.K. Fisher.The author has the advantage of most good writers in that she has lived in interesting circumstances providing fuel for her writing. One premise for much of her culinary advice is based on the fact that for several years, she lived in a very small Greenwich Village apartment with no oven, two hot plates, no sink and a tiny refrigerator, with literally enough room to hold no more than three people at a time. Amazingly, the author was able to actually entertain in this tiny space, using the bathtub and commode as a means of washing up the dishes.Much of the culinary advice is quirky and some is actually a bit dated, as it predates the microplane and the cheap plastic mandoline. I suspect the author may have changed some of her opinions if these tools had been available. Colwin's advice about knives is also a little dated, as she swears by carbon steel blades rather than modern stainless steel. Since there is no evidence that she sharpened her own knives, I suspect a modern Santoku knife may have changed her opinion. Even so, the essays are a testament to cooking with only the bare minimum of equipment and space.It is not surprising that Ms. Colwin's recipes never made the 'Best of' series, as they are quirky rather than true gourmet fare. While another of Ms. Colwin's heroes is Edna Lewis, the very influential writer on Southern cooking, Ms. Colwin's recipe for Southern Fried Chicken does not follow Ms. Lewis' lead on a number of things such as an overnight buttermilk marinade. He does, however, keep to the gospel of pan frying rather than deep-frying.Ms. Colwin's writing provides much more food for the soul than it does food for the gut. Reading this book makes one wish that Karen Duffey would have channeled her not inconsiderable talent for the simple in her book 'A Slob in the Kitchen' into a style more like Ms. Colwin's very entertaining twists on culinary matters.Highly recommended reading for foodies."},{"Title":"Understanding .NET: A Tutorial and Analysis (Independent Technology Guides)","review":"Back in the 90's, David Chappell wrote one of the Microsoft classics, Understanding ActiveX and OLE. That book marked David as an author who can communicate complicated topics in an organized and understandable form. When I heard that he had created a similar attempt for .NET, I had to check it out.This book is an explanation of key tenets of .NET and how the .NET technologies are related. The text is also mixed with straight shooting opinions, real-world application and analysis, and comparisons to other competitive computing environments. If you have had a curiosity about something in .NET, David probably addresses it in one of the analysis sections. The Microsoft camp and the Java camp alike will appreciate David's frankness as he tells it like it is, whether a Microsoft weakness or strength.This book should be intended for:* Those who need an overview of .NET like technical managers.* Non-Microsoft developers who want to see what all the fuss is about.If you want to score some points with your boss, provide this book as it is destined to be the next technical manager classic. What David did for COM, he has now done for .NET."},{"Title":"Understanding .NET: A Tutorial and Analysis (Independent Technology Guides)","review":"If every technical book was written by Chappell there would be no 'complex' topics or 'hard to grasp' concepts. Some people are born with the gift of good communication and he is certainly one of them. Almost every paragraph is accompanied by a margin note summarizing it, which is very helpful for navigating or even skipping sections that are not of interest. The 'grey' analysis boxes are the author's way of giving us his valuable opinion rather than pure fact. I really do wish this was the first book I had read on .NET.The 'Tutorial and Analysis' starts by putting .NET in context and defining the .NET Framework, Visual Studio.NET, the .NET servers and Web Services amongst other terms/concepts. This first chapter is also effectively an overview of the 6 chapters that follow it: Web Services, CLR, languages, ADO.NET, ASP.NET and the best overview of the huge .NET Framework Class Library I have come across. There are simple code examples demonstrating the theory but of course they are just &quot;tasters&quot; and further books for each major area are required in order to start coding for real.Technical managers and newbies will be mad not to get their hands on this book; however for those with hands-on experience the benefit is there only if the big picture is still not clear."},{"Title":"Understanding .NET: A Tutorial and Analysis (Independent Technology Guides)","review":"The .NET Framework is not just another new technology; it is an entirely revolutionary view of the world of software development. And it comprises such an incredibly vast body of knowledge that one or two fat books will not make anyone well versed. Ultimately, mastering this subject will require nothing less than a small library. David Chappell's Understanding .NET is an excellent choice as a master volume and foundation for this library--as a sort of glue that will hold it all together. In this book every major area of .NET is probed and placed in context, and Chappell's writing style is extremely succinct and focused. I highly recommend this book to every software developer and manager.Understanding .NET provides an objective and comprehensive overview of .NET, including chapters on how Web Services work, functionality of the Common Runtime Language, comparisons between .NET programming languages, how to work with the Class Library, new features of ADO.NET and ASP.NET, a description of .NET My Services, and how all of these parts fit together.Most obviously, this book is a perfect starting point for developers who may be skilled in DNA or some other architecture but new to .NET. The familiar terminology and intelligent references provide engaging, informative reading, and there is enough density and new information to make every paragraph worth reading. This is not one of those easy-listening books where the reader is advised in the preface to skip the first three chapters.This book also has much to offer developers who may have been working with .NET for some time but somehow missed the beginning of the movie. When plunging into a particular area of a new technology, especially one as vast as .NET, it is quite easy to never be completely clear about the main plot. By placing each major aspect of .NET clearly in context Chappell enables developers to back off for a moment to see the big picture, quite likely leading to exploration of new areas and a more comprehensive \\"understanding\\" of the environment.For technical managers who want a clear understanding of the workings of the .NET Framework but naturally can't afford to make a career out of the details, Understanding .NET is a must read. This is perhaps as far into the details as a manager needs to go, but it should be mandatory material for any technical manager worth his or her salt. Because of Chappell's focused writing style, this book is even suitable for a layperson who needs to be a step ahead.Understanding .NET is no sissy book, and at the same time it's not rocket science. It is an aptly titled volume with a wealth of information that everyone involved with .NET needs to know. --Review by David A."},{"Title":"Understanding .NET: A Tutorial and Analysis (Independent Technology Guides)","review":"This book is the first you should read if you are moving to the .NET framework. It covers everything at a high level, zooming in on specifics just frequently enough to provide a solid basic understanding.

It's an excellent overview of.NET that is both objective and interesting to read.NET is a critically important to Microsoft professionals. Unfortunately, it's also a huge platform that can be daunting and downright confusing. Chappell's .NET book cuts right through Microsoft's marketing dribble and explains exactly what the platform is and why its important. The book provides enough technical depth to give you a good understanding of the .NET platform without getting lost in what is obviously a very complex set of technologies.As an architect, developer, and author I give this book my highest recommendation.

Wow, was that tough reading!! Some of the information was good and yet it was really too raw to be an &quot;easy read&quot;. I was looking for something that would begin to put some of my .NET puzzle pieces together. After reading David Chappell's book I now have the puzzle together with a nice clear picture. I liked the balance he gives to the treatment of .NET vs. Java. He values both environments and understands the competition between both can only benefit software development going forward.

Unlike his earlier books, this one's not from Microsoft Press, and the reason undoubtedly was the editorial independence demanded by the author. A number of digs and jabs are directed at Microsoft (the corporation and its business practices, not the producer of this technology, which he generally admires), especially in the shaded sidebars.

I've found it to be well written (I've been able to read it from cover to cover in about a week or so), and it provided me with just the insights I needed for .NET.In particluar, I liked the broad persepctive of .NET technology it offers. This is essential for later conducting one's own search via reading the on-line stuff and other material (you'll never find something if you never knew you ought to have searched for it...).The technical examples are very good - they illustrate the points the author is making, without needlessly burdening the reader with details & complexities that are sometimes found in books that focus on \\"how to write XYZ\\" .Note that the book covers .NET 2.0.

The author explains the overall concepts and the reasons for their existence rather than specific features of the .NET environment. For example, the role of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the sequence of source code to executable machine code for the languages supported in the .NET environment is thoroughly covered.Brief descriptions of the features and differences of the primary languages of .NET, C#, C++ and Visual Basic are also covered. In this case, the detail is probably more than you would be interested in, as few people will be reading this book to learn about the control constructs in these languages.There is an overview of the .NET framework class library, a survey of the role and how to use ASP.NET to build dynamic web pages, how to access data using ADO.NET and a mile-high view of how .NET is used to build distributed applications.

However, we all have to admit .Net is huge and constantly changing. It's tough to keep up on all its facets, let alone, put them into some sort of historical context. This book does that for you. What's more, it explains the why's and what-for's behind the various .Net pieces better than any other book I've run across. I think even experienced dotnetters will enjoy quite a few 'ah ha' moments reading this book.If you're a management type, the first chapter alone is gold. Read it, learn it, and you'll probably be able to understand what your average dotnet programmer is saying. Best of all, when they call the Intermediate Language \\"bytecode\\" (which I've noticed happens pretty often) you get to correct them: \\"bytecode is Java - in dotnet we call it IL.\\" Surely this moment of triumph alone is worth the price of the book.One criticism: Why a lion on the cover? I think it makes this book look like one of those learn how to program X in 30 days books, that is, a cheap poorly written ripoff. This book deserves better!

An added feature of this book is the &quot;extra asides&quot; in each chapter discussing topics that are important to IT professionals, such as &quot;Java Bytecode versus MSIL&quot;, &quot;Why Enterprise Servers are not .NET&quot;, and &quot;Making .NET Cross-platform&quot;. This is the kind of information an IT professional needs when one is trying to sell a .NET solution to an IT manager or executive whose only exposure to technology is what s/he saw on &quot;Tech TV&quot;. It is also the kind of information that assists the IT professional who works on other platforms/languages (mainly Java programmers) with understanding .NET in relation to what one does.Also, I believe that if a programmer/software engineer new to .NET understands the architecture, then the programmer/software engineer will have an easier time with learning and using the .NET languages (Well, I find that to be true in my case). This book will give the new .NET developer or engineer a good foundation to allow one to make informed decisions when designing a .NET application.As an IT professional and adjunct university professor, I would highly recommend this book to IT professionals learning .NET, and I would highly recommend this book as a textbook to be used in a school teaching .NET in their curriculum."},{"Title":"Understanding .NET: A Tutorial and Analysis (Independent Technology Guides)","review":"If you looking for an easy to read, a quick, and concise primer on Microsoft's .NET there is no need to look anywhere else.

I found this book to be an excellent introduction to the important changes that .NET brings, particularly geared to the professional developer. The book is much more technical than I expected, but Chappell's writing style is clear and easy to follow even on difficult concepts.This is not a \\"how-to-code\\" book, although there are code examples here and there. Instead, it serves basically 2 purposes. One, it introduces the new features and capabilities that the .NET framework brings to development. Two, it speaks to the paradigm shift for a developer to move from a Windows DNA (VB 6, C++) method of programming to programming in .NET.There are several things I really liked about his book. One, there are many margin notes that cover the basic idea of each paragraph or section, making it easy to skim and find relevant information, especially for someone in more of a management role. Two, there are a number of \\"side-note\\" articles that further explain certain concepts or talk about certain frequently asked questions, such as \\"VB.NET or C#,\\" \\"Is ASP.NET too hard?\\" or the inevitable comparisons to Java. In fact this book does an excellent job at bringing up similarities and differences between the .NET framework and Java. It is the author's view that it is beneficial to the development community, assuming .NET catches on, to have 2 strong platforms competing and making each other better.Overall, this book is right up there with what I feel is the best VB migration book (Moving to VB.NET by Appleman) in providing a clear roadmap to the many developers taking the plunge into .NET. It is much more broad in scope, but strikes a good balance between technical information, commentary, and a teaching spirit.

The first are those that are so good that everyone recommends them to their friends and they become popular. The second are those that are so good that people may actually want to keep it a secret. This may be the second kind. I cannot understand why I am the first to write a review. This book offers itself as a history not about art but about the art market. At times one gets lost in the flurry of names, dates, and prices, but it is all here. And as a hidden bonus it says nearly everything that is worth saying about both the economics and the psychology of collecting. This is a brilliant book that should by now have shaped the course of writing art history. Of course, it hasn't.My only criticism for the current reader is that it was written in 1992 soon after the art market exploded (not the author's fault) and desperately needs an update. This is like saying Vasari needs an update. Sadly I do know of anyone currently active with the experience to write such a book.Peter Watson himself is an extraordinary combination of talents. He is also the author of two other excellent books on intellectual history. I think this would put him in a unique position to write a defining work on the aesthetics of Modern Art particularly since so much of contemporary art is involved with ideas. Watson has written, \\"I believe that a whole book needs to be written about the aesthetics in the wake of Pop Art: its significance has not yet been fully digested or understood.\\" (pg. 470) I would only beg that it might also include his views on minimalism and conceptual art and whatever the hell is going on now. Other than perhaps Robert Hughes, Watson may be the only person capable of completing such a project. Of course, I fear there may be many out there who would prevent him from doing so. He's that good."},{"Title":"From Manet to Manhattan: The Rise of the Modern Art Market","review":"Art is communication, it is culture. The development of a marketplace for art that did not represent the traditional historical scene or portrait was done by the willingness of artists and dealers to risk their incomes by supporting honest communication and expression. The results have been a vigorous response by contemporary culture in support of the arts. This is an important read for anyone who understands that our lives and well-being are as linked to our cultures as to our military power."},{"Title":"Wild Star","review":"First, I enjoyed this story, but I didn't give it five stars for personal reasons. I did not like that the hero lacked so much self-control! What was his problem anyway? He talked to poor Byrony very crudely and I really couldn't see what she saw in him. In fact, he viewed her as an object that belonged to him! The nerve of the man! I am glad that Byrony developed a back bone and stood up for herself, otherwise I would have been completely irritated with her. I liked that the author took us back to Brent's &quot;Beginnings&quot; on the plantation, he definitely had some demons to work out before he could really let go of his past. In that respect, I enjoyed the psychological view to the way he thought. Although this story made me angry at times, (very angry) I was never bored with it. In fact I hardly realized how close to the end of the book I was, so I rate this story high. If you don't mind egotistical, immoral, lack of self-control men, then I recommend this book, thankfully the other characters more than make up for the hero and he does seem to finally get his act together."},{"Title":"Wild Star","review":"This is only the third or so Catherine Coulter romance that i have read, and it did not dissapoint me in the least. Brent seemed to have some serious issues though, not trusting women, acting like he was sleeping with his mistress when he wasn't, and kissing Lauren(his stepmother) near the end because he said that \\"she asked him to kiss her\\". Byrony(the heroine) was polite and reserved throughout most of the novel, but when she bought that whip!!!that was funny. Also near the end she gets in a small but satisfying catfight with Brent's stepmother over that kiss. I can't seem to find any of the other \\"star\\" books at my local bookstore or library, but when i do i'm going to devour them. One setback of the book was how exceedingly rude Brent was towards Byrony. He never expressed remorse over anything he did, but still, i found myself loving him and Byrony as characters the whole book. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a different kind of romance."},{"Title":"Wild Star","review":"I really love catherine coulter's books but this is one of my favorite.

This one is my favorite out of this series. Also, it is one of my all time favorite books. (I haven't read Jade Star yet though) It has everything I was looking for in a romance book. I really liked Byrony and Brent. Byrony gets the short end of the deal up until the end of this book, but she never complains or regrets any of her choices. Brent is strong and plays protector very well. Byrony's father is an abusive man and she will do anything to get away from him. Even marry a man she doesn't love to escape him. After she marries, she realizes that her husband had another motive for marrying her. It is a pretty sick one too. Anyway, the night she finds out about her husband, she runs off into town and stumbles across some drunks. Brent comes to the rescue and from there on out, it is Brent and Byrony trying to overcome their pasts. Brent comes to find out that he owns a hugh plantation and they go back there to figure out what to do with it, because he also owns a saloon that he wants to keep. There is some trouble and this is where Brent really finds himself. He has to face his past. Then Byrony finally gets to face her father and all is well. Lots of action and romance and drama. Kept me interested from page one. I have a hard time reading books to the end without skipping pages, but I read every page in this book."},{"Title":"Wild Star","review":"I read Midnight Star first and immediately wanted to read the rest of the series. Wild Star, I thought, was disapointing. The male character, Brent, never seemed to change. He was constantly donineering and seemed to enjoy making his wife feel like a fool. The female, Byrony, seemed mostly meek and never seemed to fight back, just always giving in. I did, however like the visits with Chauncy, Del and Saint Morris. I am about to start on Evening Star and I hope it's better than this one."},{"Title":"Wild Star","review":"I could not put the books down and I passed the set on to my sister as soon as I finished it."},{"Title":"Wild Star","review":"I bought this book because it is one of my favorite authors(Catherine Coulter) first forays into writing.... Her writing has much improved over the years from this one. Brent is a jerk with moments of maturity. Byrony is a simpleton who kinows her worth but can't or won't define it. I just didn't get this book. Yeah lots of sex and all that but it was like something that happened to her and not with her in mind. I would not recommend this book without letting the potential reader know that if you like to be bossed around, and told you are nothing but a vessel for a husband, you will love this book. Otherwise read at your own risk. I know this book is crap but I also know that this is a phenomenol author and this was merely a bump early in the road."},{"Title":"Wild Star","review":"This is the third book in the series. I am reading it for the second time and it is better the second time around. I can't say I was disappointed with any of the 4 books in the series. They are all different and each book talks about the other characters from the previous books. I wish CC would write yet another book in the series. I think this might be my favorite series to read out of every author that I read, and I read a bunch! Once you start reading one, you can't put it down. If you enjoy reading books for the romance, these 4 books are all equally very steamy with romance. You won't be disappointed!Brent can be a bit of a pig and doesn't really apologize for the awful things he says to Byrony, but I think he might make up for his shortcomings in the end. He sure is sexy though!"},{"Title":"Wild Star","review":"Catherine Coulter is fast becominng a favorite of mine.

VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Tom Ripley is always motivated by something. In The Talented Mr. Ripley it was greed, jealousy, and the realization that his European vacation might have to end. In this novel, the more obvious reason is, as stated on the cover, that he has been slighted at a posh gala event by the other protagonist, Jonathan. But does this warrant the subsequent murders, bombings, burnings that follow in his game? I don't think so. I think that Tom Ripley is, no matter what he might say to us, bored. This makes the title oh so illuminating. Since the first novel, he has married--though we learn very little important information about Heloise--and is living in France. The plot of this novel seems like an attempt to spice up what has become his provincial life.Ripley is cold-blooded, refined, exacting, the opposite of scrupulous. He is no psychopath, he merely commits horrid crimes, guiltlessly and thoroughly. He is easy to hate and hard not to like--one of those amicable vilians. What I like most about Highsmith's novels, and the first of this series in particular, is her ability to create a very dark, forboding, scenes that are so tense, they seem to squeeze you in between the lines. That is what was missing most in this novel. It is indeed a page-tuner, and worth an afternoon's read. But in the end, it does feels like a game. There are few moments where the reader is completely aghast that he is actually going to get away with it. By now, we expect at least that of Tom Ripley.But what happened to Jonathan, the novice assasin? I don't want to give anything away here, since this book is just as much about him as about Ripley himself; but, there comes a point in the novel where he seems to turn 180 and seems to forget exactly what made him get involved in Ripley's game in the first place. I couldn't follow the transformation. He gives up too easily.Overall, a worthy read, but if you are a Ripley tyro, or if you want to lose sight of humanity and wonder just how evil a single person can be, read the first one."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"If you liked the Wim Wenders film 'American Friend', then this is the original! All the other books will fall into place after this."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"If you have not yet read The Talented Mr. Ripley and Ripley Under Ground (the weakest of the three first books in the series), I strongly suggest that you pursue those books before Ripley's Game. There's a continuity of character development that you will miss otherwise.The premise for Ripley's Game is the most interesting of the first three books in a series: How will a dying man look at morality when he knows his days are numbered? Ripley's Game has a second advantage over The Talented Mr. Ripley and Ripley Under Ground -- there are no plot devices where Ripley fools the same person over and over again with alternate disguises. Another advantage over Ripley Under Ground is that Ms. Highsmith has a new character who can be totally developed in his many complex facets, much as Tom Ripley was so brilliantly in The Talented Mr. Ripley.The title is particularly clever. In one meaning, it describes one aspect of the plot. Ripley has become interested in how an innocent man might be persuaded through careful psychological nudges to perform an anonymous murder. In the other meaning, Ripley becomes the hunted, the game that killers seek out -- as in famous short story, The Most Dangerous Game. There's a possible third meaning as well -- that Ripley is ready to tangle with a tough situation.As the book opens, Tom Ripley's criminal friend Reeves has come up with an implausible idea -- encourage the Italian mafia to run itself out of Hamburg by starting a war between rival families. To do this, Reeves needs an untraceable, innocent-looking killer who will quickly disappear. Reeves spots the possible targets, but cannot think of anyone to do the killings. Although Ripley has nothing at stake, the problem intrigues Tom. He remembers a local owner of a framing shop, Jonathan Trevanny, who has an advanced case of incurable leukemia. How might making the man afraid of dying sooner affect his willingness to kill? The story proceeds from there with many twists and turns that are more realistic than in The Talented Mr. Ripley or Ripley Under Ground.Before the book is over, you learn a lot about how people create their own situational morality. You will find yourself surprised by the reactions of Ripley, Trevanny and Trevanny's wife. It makes for very interesting reading. I especially enjoyed seeing Ms. Highsmith go back to do more with developing new dimensions of Ripley's character.The book's main problem with the book is that it usually moves at the wrong pace. The leisurely, untroubled sections are developed at about the same pace as the dangerous action sections are. As a result, the book feels like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is being played at the exact same average tempo throughout. The contrasts don't work as well with such an approach. In addition, the leisurely parts are too fast and the action parts are too slow.The Boy Who Followed Ripley comes next in the series.After you finish this book, take time to honestly think about what you would do if you had been Trevanny. It makes for a series of fascinating speculations to consider."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"What a shame. Such a great writer, such beautiful descriptions and settings, great attention to physical detail.But this time, a serious flaw causes too many cracks in the story. For the first time, Ripley gets his hands dirty almost as a lark. In this novel the sophisticated psychopath protagonist slips in to contribute to a killing for no discernible reason. Unlike other Ripley murders, there is zero motive for Tom taking part in a certain garrotting that is pivotal to the series of events in the story.Ripley just ends up looking foolish.Only a game, definitely. Highsmith stretched the reader's faith a bit too thin for this book to be taken very seriously.There are a few good moments, most notably a true Highsmith form of contrasting and paralleling thelives and actions of disparate characters.It's odd, though. Here's a middle aged Ripley set in 1974, smack in the middle of what was arguably the least classy decade last century. Ripley is meant to be a man of class and style. It's as if it was just not the right time to bring him to life in another book."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"I think that book is a great thing to spend your leisure time for. The content and the structure of the detective story is well done. Now and then your have to reflect what the action is for but on the whole it is a very interesting and exciting book. Even the text is comprehensible for people using English as a second language."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Again Ms. Highsmith brings us into the warped mind and world of Thomas Ripley. Somehow it all seems to make sense when you look at life from his point of view. Again I rooted for him to come out scott free and although The death of Jonathan was a disapointment, I was happy that Ripley didn't get caught. He seems to find himself in compromising situations that to him seem perfectly normal. Having to deal with the mafia this time seemed too big a job to handle, but he did it. Thank you Patricia Highsmith for another sucessful Ripley adventure."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"I like this book very much. It's a very good written novel by Particia Highsmith. The story is about some murder that a Jonathan Travanny, a man with a blood disease, has to do. A man called Reeves gave the order. First Trevanny does the job alone, but by the following murders Ripley helps him. Ripley and Trevanny almost become friends, but Trevanny's wife doesn't like Ripley and she doesn't know that her husband is a murderer. But in fact Jonathan Trevanny did the job only to earn some money for his wife and his son Georges because he is fatally ill and does not expect to live much longer. At the end Trevanny dies because he is hit by a bullet from a Mafioso.The sentences are very easy, and there aren't a lot of difficult words. I liked to read this book, because there was always a certain tension."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"In her book about plotting and writing thrillers, Patricia Highsmith said that European critics and publishers think of her books as novels, not merely as thrillers. After reading &quot;Ripley's Game&quot;, one can certainly sympathize with the European point of view. &quot;Ripley's Game&quot; is an excellent thriller and an excellent novel.I suspect that this book finds Tom Ripley in mid career. He's married and living on a French estate thanks to the generosity of a father-in-law who despises him. A series of chance events provide Ripley with the opportunity to simultaneously repay an insult and to help a friend commit a crime. The ensuing action comprises one of Patricia Highsmith's most interesting stories.Ripley engineers events so that the man who insulted him ends up committing the crime for his friend. But a sense of guilt and an adventurous spirit compel Ripley to come to the man's assistance. Since crimes never succeed in the exact manner intended, Ripley and company soon find themselves in a desperate situation that requires a lot of maneuvering.By the end of the story, at least two people with conventional mores wind up behaving in a manner that contradicts their ethics. While Ripley's point of view is a little more subdued than usual, he still displays a few humorous touches. In the scene where he decides that he must garrote a Mafia leader, for example, he becomes excited at the thought of &quot;his first Mafia effort&quot;. Later when he must explain the presence of two dead Mafia hitmen to a frightened housewife, he becomes the country gentlemen informing her that these people are vermin whose death is regrettable but who deserved their fate.Patricia Highsmith usually writes from the point of view of a single protagonist, and since all speech and action is conveyed through that person, we quickly see things from his or her point of view. In this novel, however, the action is disseminated through two points of view, Ripley's and that of his puppet/accomplice. The result is both interesting and unsettling. On the one hand, we really get a sense of what other people think of Tom Ripley, and how much of his criminal life is apparent to them. On the other hand, it's a strange change to observe Ripley from the outside instead of seeing the action from his point of view.&quot;Ripley's Game&quot; examines the forces that motivate a normally law abiding citizen to commit a crime. In the process it causes us to question how circumstantial our own morality and legal obedience may actually be."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"The best of the Ripley books. It starts off like the Eurostar train - that can only go at a slow speed on the English tracks; but once it hits France it takes off at 200 mph. Once again the charming sociopath starts a chain of events that keeps the reader glued to the page, turning them faster and faster to the explosive ending. The best of the best."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Tom Ripley after playing a foolish trick on a fellow townsman for slighting Ripley, unknowingly sends the mans life into a tailspin. In this novel of the series Tom is faced with trying to put back together the life of a good man whos life has been turned upside down by the unwitting events that Tom sets into play. The consequences and choices that are made by these two men are heart rending and leaves the reader feeling quite unsettled to the very last page. A dark and fascinating read."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Although every Ripley book is a great book (except for maybe The Boy Who Followed Ripley Home), this isthe best.The usual twisted morality, plus a violent showdown with the mob.A thrilling testament to modern individuality.Try not to take his side."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"I cannot urge people strongly enough to read this book. Tom continues his capers in style, and what a delight to follow along. Introduces many major elements in what would become a very entertaining series of books. Read with amazement as Tom Ripley begins an actual relationship with another human being(!) Highsmith writes with such flair that I feel like I've BEEN to 'Belle Ombre' after reading these books! Highest rating!"},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"You might as well know you're reading a review by a bona fide Highsmith addict; her books have everything a good novel needs --solid plotting, convincing characters whose choices govern the storyline, deep truths, and a strong local flavor. &quot;Ripley's Game&quot; has plenty of this, and like most of her books it's next to impossible to put down -- esp. the last 100 pages.I didn't like #2, &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot;; it seemed amateurish and at times even improvised. &quot;Game,&quot; on the other hand, is a masterpiece. Here Ripley takes a backseat to the alluring and amazing character of Jonathan Trevanny, who gets caught up in a plot to assassinate mafiosi in Eastern Europe. There's enough food for thought in this book to fuel about a dozen other novels, and the interrelations between the characters -- esp. Trevanny and his wife -- are fascinating and utterly convincing. Right now a film is planned, with Malkovich as Ripley and Dougray Scott as Trevanny; I hope they don't screw it up!Incidentally, this &quot;sequel&quot; stands firmly on its own and doesn't require knowledge of the first two books; I can't wait to get on the Ripleys 4 and 5.As the Washington Post said, this isn't for the weak-minded or impressionable -- but absolutely mesmerizing. There's no one like Patricia Highsmith."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"This third crime novel using the character of Tom Ripley has mysterious intrigue written all over it. It's got a mix of Italian Mafia blended with Alfred Hitchcock-like suspense. I'd love to see this sequel made into a film like THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY. The subtle homosexual hints in the book made me realize that the female author had plenty of gay friendships. In any case, she had a great talent for writing that keeps you on the edge of your seat. A few lines in the book that I liked were: There's no such thing as a perfect murder. That's just a parlor game, trying to dream one up. Of course you could say there are a lot of unsolved murders. That's different... Gone was the excuse of paintings that Tom wanted framed. One didn't help Tom kill people, help him get rid of corpses, because one was going to frame a few pictures."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Reeves Minot, an old acquaintance of Tom Ripley's, is dabbling in the illegal gambling world of Hamburg and he wants Tom to get rid of one or two Mafia people who bother him. But because Tom has been enjoying a peaceful and secure existence in his house in Villeperce since the Derwatt affair, he is not prepared to do the job himself. Instead he suggests - more as a practical joke than anything serious because the man had been nasty to him once at a party - a person called Jonathan Trevanny to do the two killings. Jonathan is a thirty-five year old, mild mannered picture framer in Fontainebleau suffering from leukaemia and he agrees to do the job because of the comfort the 90 000 Dollars will bring to his wife Simone and small boy George. But killing Salvatore Bianca and Vito Marcangelo is going to have consequences that not even a Tom Ripley could have foreseen. \\"The Mafia never forgets\\" indeed!...A very entertaining Ripley mystery in Patricia Highsmith's famous style in which one can feel danger and menace lurking permanently in familiar surroundings."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Ripley's Game is the third novel in the series by Patricia Highsmith, taking off where Ripley Under Ground left us since we learn the he got off scot-free once again. Ripley's thin skin shows in this novel when he is coldly received at a party given by Jonathan Trevanny that he takes as an insult. He repays Trevanny by suggesting to Reeves, for whom Ripley has done a few smuggling jobs for, that Trevanny could be approached to do a couple of Mafia hits.Jonathan Trevanny is a sympathetic character; married with a young boy named Georges he has a framing business in Fontainebleau that allows him to just get by and he is also dying of leukemia. Ripley informs Reeves that Trevanny might be convinced to do the job because of his leukemia and the money that he would get from the jobs would leave his wife and son well off. Patricia Highsmith fleshes out Trevanny very well and spends a great deal of time over his feelings and motivation for accepting the Reeves' assignment. The step-by-step relating of events leading up to Trevanny's first murder I found riveting, and Tom Ripley disappeared into the background. Tom eventually rejoins the story and develops a bond with Trevanny but Reeves' plan to start a Maria family war does not go as planned. The ending, for me, was more satisfying than that of Ripley Under Ground and made me interested in the next installment.A film was made from Ripley's Game which adapted the book with some substantial differences that would be expected. The film is notable for John Malkovich's performance as Tom Ripley who was far more successful than Matt Damon in conveying Ripley's charm and amoral attitude. I recommend the book as being a interesting development in the Ripley series, well-written and definitely something that will hold your interest."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"For some reason Tom Ripley is back. One of the most famous anti-hero in the policial literature is back to kill and play his game one more time. But Tom Ripley doesn't like to kill. But we, readers, are always willing to read his next adventure.Having his own moral and ghosts, Ripley is one of the most fascinating characters created in the 20 Century. He is so peculiar, and nuanced that many writers tried to copy him, or even invent someone similar, but none works. After all, there was only one Patricia Highsmith, a master of thrillers.There was such a tie linking her to her creation that it is hard to tell where one finishes and the other begins. Both are very cultured, smart, with good taste. But I don't believe she's ever killed anyone --on the other hand, Ripley did. Not because he likes doing that, much the contrary. But it is like a snowball, and he ends up forced to take charge of the situation and someone gets brutally murdered. That's how his life is, since his debut in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\".Back again in \\"Ripley's Game\\" the character is forced to get involved in a crime. One more time he is forced to face all the moral and personal dilemmas of killing another human being. At this time, he's set in Italy leading an extravagant life, but not bothering people, until someone needs his help.As one of the most complex and well-developed characters in the noir literature, Ripley does not disappoint his fans. He is ready to show all his knowledge and also his skills to eliminate someone. And with her talent, Patricia Highsmith, one more time, makes us fall for the \`villain'. In the hands of a less talented author, Ripley would be a pretentious mad man, that we would love to see caught by the police. But with Highsmith's skills we love him, and can imagine him being caught.\\"Ripley's Game\\" is the third book in the serie. And since the character was introduced in the first novel --The Talented Mr. Ripley-- Highsmith does not beat around the bush. The novel begins in the full swing introducing a new character that will be almost as important as Ripley, and this new man will force Ripley get back in action.It is advisable to read \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\", before Ripley's game so that the reader will know who he is and what he's been through."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Although recognizably by the same author, this book is, unfortunately, like most sequels far inferior to the orginal (&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;). It works as readable crime fiction, but does not rise much above it. A critic once noted that Ripley is unconvincingly rescuscitated as a happily married man in the sequels and I'd have to agree. You still might like it if you're expectations aren't too high."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"The first Ripley novel, \\"The talented Mr. Ripley\\" is not as compelling as the 2nd and 3rd part, but it's necessary to read the first book in order to really understand the sequels.

That's why I rate it 1 star.Maybe the time that passed between writing vol. 4 and vol. 5 was too long?Somehow Highsmith could not create the same magic that her first 4 Ripley books possess."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"This is the second of the Ripley thrillers and was published in 1974.We have the anti-hero Tom Ripley coercing a stranger into committing \\"two simple murders\\".

I did complete \\"Ripley's Game\\" but it was a near thing."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"\\"Ripley's Game\\" is the third in Patricia Highsmith's five novel Ripley series. Readers may be reminded of her book \\"Strangers on a Train\\" because in that book and movie a stranger gets talked into committing a murder. At the beginning of the book we see Reeves, the shady fence, and Jonathan Trevanny much more than we see Tom Ripley. Ripley has set up Trevanny for Reeves.Jonathan, a picture framer, is a major character almost eclipsing Ripley. Nearing death from cancer, he agrees to murder in order to provide his wife and son with a future.Ripley believes in the power of positive thinking, unfortunately with a crooked bent. He always feels justified. It's a very exciting twist to the story when Ripley, pro-active and self-confident, surprisingly shows up on a train to practice his killing skills and to rescue Trevanny from failure.Highsmith continually demonstrates her ability to create unnerving suspense and shock readers. Reading a lot of Highsmith, you get the impression that Ripley's amorality and dodginess are part of her own cosmic view of life; she's cynical about traditional morality. Ripley operates outside of normal codes of morality, beyond the limits and the norms of \\"civilized\\" society.Ripley is like today's TV anti-hero Dexter who also flaunts the law, kills, and gets away with it. Highsmith liked, probably admired Ripley as a character and sometimes used Tom as her own signature. Ripley, always skating on thin ice, thinks up ridiculous half-baked and half-mad schemes, felonious games.Highsmith has an eye for homey details which enrich her narrative skill, giving the story a sense of authenticity, ordinariness. Heavy on exposition, she usually tells rather than shows, ignoring the dictum of writing teachers, but she does it so well, it pays off.Why do people turn to Tom for solutions to their problems when he can't solve his own insoluble messes? Heloise is the ideal wife for Tom, uncritical, amoral, self-absorbed. Glosses over what she is told even though she knows he's dodgy.The last section of the book really doesn't make much sense, but it's fun. Nothing is ever easy in a Ripley novel. Ripley's only code of morality is survival. To others he is a tainted person, a leper.Up until this book Ripley has committed three murders and engineered a suicide. He kills five Mafiosa in this book, and goes free to show up in the fourth novel."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"\\"Ripley's Game\\" by Patricia Highsmith, opens with the following sentence: \\"There's no such thing as a perfect murder...That's just a parlour game, trying to dream one up.\\" An apt statement from Highsmith's unlikely hero Tom Ripley, but one that also sums up the novel as it begins. The third novel in her Tom Ripley series finds Tom playing a nasty prank on an unassuming man, in which he soon finds himself involved in a grisly game of life and death.Tom Ripley is no stranger to controversy or murder. Ever since he first appeared in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" he has become an enigmatic character - a psychopath that the reader roots for time and again. The disappearance and mystery surrounding the Dickie Greenleaf affair has tainted Tom's name forever. Even though he has managed to build a comfortable life for himself and his wife in France, his name still rings with suspicion and trouble seems to find him in the most unlikely ways. Due to his unseemly history, Tom is irked when the mortally ill Jonathan Trevanny seems to scorn him. Tom takes it upon himself to involve Trevanny in a plot that soon sets the unsuspecting man in the path of murder and revenge.\\"Ripley's Game\\" is unique with regards to the previous novels in the series; for much of the novel, Trevanny is narrator with Tom as observer. Even when Tom steps in to aide Trevanny because he feels guilty (if that is possible for Tom Ripley) about involving the poor man, Trevanny remains the main character. Highsmith's writing is superb as usual, making readers loathe and love Tom Ripley all at once, and making readers justify along with her main characters the outrageous actions they take to preserve their lives. \\"Ripley's Game\\" is a quick-paced mystery that is a worthy addition to the series, and leaves readers desperate for more."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Those who only saw the movie &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; will be quite surprised by the fact that Ripley is now married, living in a very nice mansion in France, working as an amateur artist and an active participant of the underground markets for stolen and forged paintings. Therefore, there must be other previous books that explain his change of sexual preferences and activities. (I do not know their titles)That situation, will not preclude you from enjoying this book since it have a good suspense and have characteristic not easily found in most &quot;bestseller&quot; type of novels. Here the good guys are not really that good, and the people from the mafia simple criminals, but the author does not give you specific reasons to feel aversion against them. As a result, you might find yourself wandering why you care at all if Tom Ripley and company can succeed in their endeavors. But you do!!! This made the novel particularly interesting for me."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"I have to admit, I liked the original \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" more, but this was still a fascinating book at what motivates people to commit murder. We have a dying man, who slighted Tom Ripley, and is now fingered by Ripley and a friend to go kill some Mafia figures. Money that might not be tempting in ordinary circumstances becomes reason enough at the prospect of dying and leaving his family destitute. What I liked was that Jonathan didn't jump up to do the murder, nor have a sudden change of heart. He was sort of swept up in the whole thing. And what is interesting is that Tom comes as close to forgiving as a psychopath is capable--he did come to Jonathan's rescue more than once. A complex game, indeed, with an ending that will keep you guessing right to the end. It does leave me wondering, though, how does Tom keep getting away with murder?"},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Ripley's Game is the third installment of Highsmith's Ripley series. I was not expecting too much after reading the second in the series (Ripley Under Ground). To my surprise, the book is actually a very good read.In Ripley's Game our favorite psychopath, Tom Ripley, is a bit bored. When his spy/crook buddy in Germany asks for suggestions for an assassin (for hire) Tom, most cruelly, chooses a fellow American in Paris who is terminally ill. The reader is then taken on a wild ride where both Tom and his reluctant killer inductee are chased by Mafia hit men.Ripley's Game is certainly the most violent of the first three Ripley books, and Tom Ripley has really transformed himself into a monster. The real power of this novel is Highsmith's analysis of a dying man choosing to kill for money to help his wife (soon to be widow) and child. It's a very strange and macabre situation, but totally plausible.Bottom line: a violent and depressing Ripley novel. Yet Highsmith's trademark deconstruction of (usually reluctant) killers is in excellent display. Don't let Ripley Under Ground dissuade you from continuing on the Ripley series. Ripley's Game is a very worthy read."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"\\"Ripley's Game,\\" a thriller initially published by American author Patricia Highsmith in 1974, was third in Highsmith's Ripley series, called by enthusiasts her Ripliad. In it, her charming, ever-so-civilized, murderous psychopath Ripley, now happily settled in a lovely French villa, as a result of his numerous evil deeds, is angered at being snubbed by a hapless Englishman. So our protagonist sets in motion a game that will not have very good consequences for that Englishman, Jonathan Trevanny.The game, involving Mafiosi as murderous as Ripley, and pan-European train and plane rides, is one that most people - including me--, who know only as much as they read in the papers about the Mafia, would consider impossible ultimately for an individual to win. There are so many more of them, and they are so institutionalized. Trevanny, a man who previously had led a blameless life, is really not equipped for this game. But he is tempted into it by the money, and the fact that he has leukemia, then considered invariably fatal (great strides have been made in its treatment in the last few years, as, ironically, it somewhat resembles AIDS in its workings.) And he has a charming French wife Simone, and child Georges, to provide for when he is gone. The game will change Trevanny, his wife, and even, possibly, his child. And, even Ripley, a bit.This book, as the other Ripleys, has been favored by European filmmakers, and it's easy to see why. The plot is exciting, and fast-moving; its settings whether cosmopolitan, or rural, are generally lovely. And it stands on its own as a quick, enjoyable read. Dialog is flavorful, narrative writing, muscular. In either case, book or movie, there's less actual gore and violence than you might find in more current similar enterprises: Highsmith was a thrifty writer who could do a lot with a little."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Check out the 2002 John Malkovich version of Ripley's Game. A marvelous interpretation of an \\"older, wiser, more talented\\" Mr. Ripley. Much more than the Damon TTMR, this one made me want to read the books. And what a great read \\"Game\\" is. Very cinematic in the violence and suspense."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"I had no idea when I saw the German film &quot;The American Friend&quot; dir. by Wim Wenders (with Dennis Hopper), that it was based on this book by Highsmith. I subsequently came across this novel, and enjoyed it all over again. Wender's film version is a very faithful adaptation, and Hopper's Ripley is perfect. This is a great story of a friendship between two men."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"I was sent this book by a good friend for xmas; definitely an insightful choice. It is my first experience from the series, and I will definitely look forward to reading the rest of them.This isn't a &quot;mystery&quot; in the usual sense of the word; you always know &quot;who done it.&quot; What you don't know is really more interesting, and keeps you reading right to the end. And there are many things you need to know other than who pulled the trigger.The Ripley character is fascinating in some ways since you can get in his head sometimes, but that doesn't let you know why he does what he does. He morphs from hero to villian and back again without warning. Can you forgive what he does? Well... decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Ms. Highsmith again successfully takes us on one of Thomas Ripleys adventures that gets him mixed up with the Mafia. A formidable opponent I would say. His warped thinking doesn't seem so warped as you follow his logic and life. I again rooted for him to come out unscathed although a loss of a personal friend truly touches his heart. Extremely interesting and adventursome. Will Mr. Ripleys life ever calm down? He sure has a knack for delving in the criminal element. Murder again has a role in this book and vengance is pointed at him. Another success, Thank you Ms. Highsmith."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"The others are right: it would help to read the first two novels in order to appreciate the character of Tom Ripley. This is important for this installment because this is the novel where Ripley almost has a soul -- he actually undertakes his usual nefarious activity in order to atone for his own malignant action (first a rumor, then a murder plot). The characters don't exactly deepen Highsmith's narrative, but she overcomes the problem of writing a creative mystery by bringing more and more characters into the mix -- the mysterious Reeves Minot, who appeared in Ripley Under Ground (an underrated novel, in my estimation), becomes a rather important character. And the unlucky pawn in Ripley's game, Trevanny, lends the story the closest thing to a moral center that one could hope for. Oh -- and the action scenes are relatively plentiful, and exhilirating."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Patricia Highsmith's character Tom Ripley is one of the most interesting to follow. His growth from one novel to the next is fascinating and every time you think he's going one way, he goes another.In this novel, Ripley tackles the Mafia, with intersting results. He crosses the Mafia through Jonathan, a man who had spited him, and Tom pays back as only Tom (psychopath that he is) can.The novel is intersting, full of detail and exquisitely crafted. It is also a novel for the patient, as the pace, and the setting, is completely European.Reccommended."},{"Title":"Ripley's Game","review":"Since I purchased a single volume which included the trilogy \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\\" \\"Ripley Under Ground,\\" and \\"Ripley's Game,\\" I felt compelled to read the last installment, even though I probably would have stopped with the second one if purchased one at a time. Alas, \\"Ripley's Game\\" didn't thrill me. Sure, we still have the compelling main character who, like a toned down (non-cannabilistic) Hannibal Lechter, wonders whether his wine is properly chilled or how to play a Bach sonata on his newly purchased harpischord right before he bludgeons an enemy's head with a heavy stick. Here, his murderous choices aren't nearly so repugnant as in the two earlier Ripley novels, since those he kills are members of the Italian Mafia.In fact, the central character of \\"Ripley's Game\\" is not Thomas Ripley at all, but Jonathan Trevanny, dying of a fatal blood disease, who sets aside his morals and agrees to murder members of the Mafia for money (paid by Reeves, a \\"colleague\\" of Ripley whom we've met before), so that a war might be started amongst the Mafia families. Honestly, as a fan of \\"The Sopranos,\\" it seemed at times that Highsmith's portrayal of the mob was nothing short of naive and pedestrian. The fight/murder scenes have an odd flatness to them, and are certainly not one of Highsmith's stronger points.One thing which kind of bothered me was that Ripley's comments to a character named Gauthier - that Trevanny had taken a turn for the worst -supposedly sets certain key events in motion. In fact (and I re-read this part to make sure), it was Gauthier who told Ripley about Trevanny's illness in the first place.In any event, the character of Thomas Ripley is certainly an intriguing one, and though I'm probably not going to read the two subsequent Ripley novels, someday I'll rent the two movies based on \\"Ripley's Game.\\""},{"Title":"Tales from the Soul","review":"It is rare a book draws me in.

It would be a box office smash and a classic!!!"},{"Title":"Taekwon-Do: From White Belt to Yellow Belt","review":"This book is aimed at newcomers to Taekwon-do, and as is to be expected, it only covers the elementary stances, blocks, kicks, and punches. All of the photos are in full colour, and Corder's explanations are generally are easy to follow. Not all of the examples are perfect - the action shots are sometimes unclear as to how the author moved from one position to another - however even those with a few weeks of dojang experience should be able to grasp the techniques displayed in the book. There is a nice glossary in the rear of the book with the Korean/English names of all the moves/commands covered, as well as sections on basic sparring techniques and self-defence. I found the sparring section particularly useful for three-step and two-step counter attacks. The major disappointment of this book is that there are no examples of the white-yellow belt tuls (Saju Jirugi, Saju Makgi, Chon-Ji, Dan-Gun), and there is only a passing mention of the early grading requirements. Still, this book is a handy reference to those who are new to the martial art and is recommended."},{"Title":"Taekwon-Do: From White Belt to Yellow Belt","review":"For a beginner this book might be of some interrest in that it shows you some basic hand and foot tecniques, and some wery basic sparring combinations (for training purposes only), but when dealing with the different types of blocks the author does not mention how the arms are being held prior to the actual blocking, somethinig that is essential for all beginners to know. As i said before, this can be fun for the beginning student or the one thinking about taking up classes, since there is not many books out there hwo represent themselfes as pure ITF Taekwon-Do books, but if you have been training ITF for six moonths or more you should rather put money aside to buy the condensed ITF Encyclopedia by General Choi Hong Hi..... For black belts and high ranking colour belts..... stay away from this book, it has nothing for you in it, ecxept nice pictures"},{"Title":"An Exaltation of Larks","review":"Reed has produced a brilliantly written piece of work in An Exaltation of Larks. His characters are alive and three dimensional. His portrayal of a small college campus is flawless. His writing is crisp and to the point. And his imagination is wonderful. I would give it five stars but there are just so many great books out there. This one, however, is a must read for those who appreciate good writing with a touch of whimsy and mystery thrown it."},{"Title":"An Exaltation of Larks","review":"I'm only in junior high, so adults who read this might not count my opinion, but I thought this book was so good! I couldn't put it down and I definitely can't say that for a lot of books. I agree its not the best I've EVER read, but Reed creates such an interesting and thought provoking synopsis that I was blowen away! This was actually fun to analyse! I've never read a book twice but I'm thinking of making an exception for this one, there's just so much I could of missed. I understand that older people have to sound more distinguished than authors, acting like this novel just lacked plot, flow or whatever and acting like they could write better, but sometimes your wrong. This was a good book, stop kidding yourself! For all of the rest of you out there...read this one!"},{"Title":"An Exaltation of Larks","review":"Reed's novel spans the entire history of the universe in broad strokes exploring the nature of life and existence. Paradoxically much of the story focuses on a late 1970s college campus, so beautifully captured the writing makes your heart ache. All this and a cosmic mystery well done."},{"Title":"An Exaltation of Larks","review":"Perhaps for readers of \\"hard science fiction\\" or whatever genre this book belongs to, this story makes some sort of sense but to me it did not.It starts like a fairly conventional campus story set in the winter on some liberal arts campus possibly in New England. We meet our protagonist, who edits the student newspaper and is apparently irristible to co-eds. His paper has uncovered a financial scandal involving the college president.So far so good. Then everything changes. Apparently the world is being taken over by mutant ninja turtles seeking to turn back creation and bring into existence a new universe in which we all have eternal life. Or something like that.To tell the truth, I couldn't make head or tale of the plot from that point on and quickly lost interest. Who are these turtles? Who cares. I felt like the army officer who used to appear in Monty Python sketches saying \\"too silly, too silly.\\"Oh and the book has some pretty nasty sex as well."},{"Title":"An Exaltation of Larks","review":"The plot is a gloss on a silly time travel/transcendence of Universe theme; a half-smart quasi-Buddhist shtick that leaves one feeling empty and cheated when the story finally unfolds. Along the way we get some generic and purposeless sex, and a story that is supposed to be mysterious and edgy. I give the book a second star because the author writes well, and phrases his silly plot in good style. Perhaps a good rule for science fiction that dips into quasi-crystal channeling mysticism might be to embrace some final meaning, either dark or light. This book leaves one muddled and unhappy, not thoughtful or uplifted. I cannot reccomend the book, but the author writes well enough to deserve more chances."},{"Title":"An Exaltation of Larks","review":"I read all genres of science fiction and fantasy and like a beautiful moment, this book will forever remain in my memories. I read this book in a couple sittings and although the end failed to fulfil my wishes for the characters it did not completely disappoint. As in life, you don't always get what you want. Instead, you may end up with something immensely more satisfying. Yes, the last part is very strange and dream-like, but keep reading. The meaning of the title is in there, somewhere!"},{"Title":"An Exaltation of Larks","review":"This book has great character development and scene setting which goes on for the first 2/3 of the book. I give it the highest rating for this. However, the rating comes down in the last chapter, which gets weird with strange dream like sequences that I don't care for much. This is the type of book you read in college where you have to try to analyze everything the author is trying to say. I'm not sure what it was. For example, I'm not sure what the title is referring too. I'm also not sure what the power struggle was all about. The author seems to try to convey great significance to an event that seemed trivial to me. The back cover credits compare this author to Phillip K. Dick, but except for the weird dream sequences, Reed's writing is much better. This book reminded me a lot of Vonnegut's Slaughter House Five. The same sort of time travel weirdness and symbolism with great writing. So an average rating for great characterization and scene but a general weirdness that I don't care for."},{"Title":"An Exaltation of Larks","review":"College boy girl chaser enters the Twilight Zone.

Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"The Good City","review":"The media sound bites we are assaulted by tend to polarize peoples by demonizing an \\"other.\\" In the poems of The Good City, by Sharon Olinka, we find the antidote to such reductive thinking. Through visceral specifics, the reader is brought into individual stories through a series of dramatic monologues. The voices are hauntingly authentic.While a broad political perspective prevents one from looking at the lives affected in a conflict, Olinka's strategy is to make us look up close--until we can hear each dramatic speaker's heartbeat and smell coffee being brewed. Hence, her poetry is political in the best sense, for it is the antithesis of jingoism. When we approach each person, despite his or her affiliation, we are reminded that governments, not individuals, wage wars.Worse yet, most conflicts--as in the \\"Katastrophe\\" of 1922 depicted in this collection and as in the current situation in Iraq--are often manipulated by more than one government. And the mechanisms of war, then and now, have been propelled by a thirst for oil.But Olinka is not a politician--she's a poet, a maker. As such, she remembers that a poem cannot have a valid life without its organic connection to the senses, the sensual, the erotic. It is, ironically, through her tender evocations of the body and its limitations that she brings the reader closer to the speakers' souls.Those personae come from different ethnic groups, genders, religions, and yet, through the power of sensory detail, the reader engages intimately with each one. That is more healing than volumes of politically correct theories. Suffering, after all, is never theoretical. It doesn't enjoy that luxury. Olinka's approach is instructive. She is urgent, as if to say, \\"This is not simply a historical event that occurred 84 years ago. It is happening today and will continue to do so until we acknowledge each other's humanity.\\"The Good City reconnects poetry to its tradition of political verse, from Aeschylus to Brecht to Akhmatova to Yeats to Hikmet to Ritsos to Levertov. Although many political poems devolve into didacticism, Olinka never falls into that snare. She, like Levertov, remembers to show, more than to tell.Olinka \\"shows\\" by constructing environments that approximate the filmmaker's art--an art that first flourished at the period evoked in The Good City. This profoundly visual and auditory verse invites the reader to enter. But know that to step into the charred terrain of these poems is to be forever changed."},{"Title":"The Cosmos on a Shoestring: Small Spacecraft for Earth and Space Science","review":"This books focuses on small spacecraft - the wave of the future. It's one of the few books out there on the topic and it addresses the risks that NASA seems to have forgotten about. The author correctly predicted that satellites would fail at a higher rate when 'better, cheaper, and faster' was attempted. It's an important contribution to doing things smarter. Though the book is actually a report, it should be read as a primer of what engineers and managers should avoid doing if they want to avoid failure."},{"Title":"The Cosmos on a Shoestring: Small Spacecraft for Earth and Space Science","review":"Expect this book to read like a report - evidently it's a White House document published for the public. It's blocky, but the material is a very accurate assessment of the recent history of spacecraft. The author correctly predicted that more spacecraft would fail, like the recent ones that crashed into Mars. This is definitely worth your time if you're tuned in to what's really going on in the space program - just don't expect an exciting read."},{"Title":"The Cosmos on a Shoestring: Small Spacecraft for Earth and Space Science","review":"The author does cover many of the key issues. But a &quot;real world&quot; leader or manager will find it very difficult to glean useful information out of this book written like a academic research paper."},{"Title":"The Cosmos on a Shoestring: Small Spacecraft for Earth and Space Science","review":"The author clearly spent a great deal of time researching the topic. However the text is written in a fashion which makes it hard to follow, much less to sit down and read.

Richard Brautigan's simple words and weaving prose embrace the reader into an erotic story of life in Brautigan-land. The idea of a library for unpublished books is on of the most outstanding metaphors put onto paper during the twentieth century. Brautigan again tells a story in his own unique way, a true favorite of a select few. To discover Brautigan, The Abortion is a must. To discover life, Brautigan is a must"},{"Title":"The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966","review":"Richard Brautigan , the beatnick author/poet, has always been the type of writer who's books only leave you with a feeling; the type of books that when people ask you what the book you're reading is about you can only give a puzzled look. (like it was a stupid question.) I think a friend put it best when he said, &quot;Brautigans books are just words; they're a relaxation technique for the mind.&quot; Of course, there is more depth and continuity to them than that, but not much.Howere, in his book &quot;The Abortion&quot; Brautigan not only manages to stick to one topic, but to make it nearly as moving as his other novels.&quot;The Abortion&quot; chronicles his life as a librarian. Of course, it is no ordinary library; it is a library where people who can't get their books published can put their works on public display.An obvious, but interesting, metaphor for his own struggle with writing.He doesn't quite capture the same amazing imagery that he did in &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot;. But, for new, or old, fans of Brautigan it is a fine (and linear) novel."},{"Title":"The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966","review":"&quot;The Abortion&quot; stands as one of Brautigan's most personal novels, as well as one of his most creative. The book tells the story of a librarian for a library that stocks only books that have never been published, and will never be read. It gives the character satisfaction to stock these books by people who want their one chance to be a writer. Intertwined with this is the story of that same librarian's trip to Mexico for the procedure that is the book's title. In contrast to the humor of the first part of the book, this section is morose, and descriptive. It wraps you in the feelings of the protagonists.If there is criticism, then, it is that the writing speeds up and slows down periodically. Thus, several chapters may go by with little happening, and then all hell breaks loose. But this is a minor critique; and the reader can always know that the book WILL pick up pace. A definite must for Brautigan fans."},{"Title":"The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966","review":"The way Brautigan uses language is so beautiful. It is whimsical at times, and others it is personal and you can feel a tremendous sense of grief. This book talks about an unusual setting, a library where people bring books that they wrote, and drop them off. It feels real in so many ways. I have always wondered if... maybe it wasn't a real place. The book, however, isn't just a flight of fancy. It deals with serious issues, and while you may agree or disagree or whatever. The point is, it has you thinking about, and exploring an issue you might not have otherwise. It is a powerful, yet subtle book."},{"Title":"The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966","review":"The book is the story of a guy who works at a bizarre library where strange people who can't get their books published bring their books to be registered and stored forever. One night, a girl comes in with a book about how she hates the attention her gorgeous body brings her; she and the main character have sex, become boyfriend and girlfriend, and she gets pregnant. They decide to get an abortion, and arrange to go to Mexico to do so.The book, although casual in its treatment of abortion--including fetuses being flushed down toilets--does meditate a little bit on what was being lost, when somehow the couple's aborted baby, all grown up, shows up one night with a book full of blank pages, pages never written on, pages she never had a chance to write on. (Richard Brautigan's ambivalence on this subject is also reflected in his poem \\"The Pill Versus the Springhill Mining Disaster,\\" where he compares birth control and a fatal mine collapse, and says something like:\\"All those people...lost inside.\\")Richard Brautigan really is a funny guy, though. He's also very much a child of the 1960s, and both his humor and his sixties idealism come through strong in this book.The main girl has sex with someone she just met, gets an abortion, works at a topless place, and is perfectly happy.The main guy arranges the abortion, quits his job, lives off his girlfriend, and is perfectly happy.Politics aside, 1960s aside, this is an enjoyable read, though it ends on a somewhat disappointing note, and any suspense it maintains ends abruptly upon the couple's actual visit to the abortion doctor.I laughed uncomfortably several times while reading it, but would probably recommend \\"Trout Fishing in America\\" over this."},{"Title":"The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966","review":"I read this book when it was published. It is all right, but some of the ideas are quite dated (especially some of the ideas about women!). If you want to read something representative of Brautigan's best, I recommend &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot; or &quot;In Watermelon Sugar&quot;."},{"Title":"Spawn, Book 1","review":"spawn rules and thats that.

The very very beginning shows promise -- if the art is cleaned up a little and the coloring made less garish, then this could have become interesting. Needless to say it didn't. It breaks my heart to see people talking such great thing about Spawn like it's great literature. Go read A CONTRACT WITH GOD, WATCHMEN, BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, MAUS, DAVID BORING, JIMMY CORRIGAN THE SMARTEST KID ON EARTH, and most importantly UNDERSTANDING COMICS. Then get your money away from Todd McFarlane's new clothes and read some real comics literature."},{"Title":"Spawn, Book 1","review":"Todd McFarlane and Rob Liefeld and their merry band of inkers and scribblers moved on from the publishing slaughterhouse of Marvel Comics to form their own brand of magic in Image. Soon, along with Marvel and DC, they became legion. Too many years had passed with artists treated badly, raped of thier work and paid a pittance for their scemes and visions. So says Frank Miller in the foreward to this first glimpse of the Spawn comic phenomenon.Enter Image Comics. Enter Todd McFarlane. Enter Spawn.The Empire is made.Spawn starts off where most comics had not before this time in early '92. Al Simmons, an ex-paramilitary assassin, hired gun, mercenary, etc.... wakes up and finds that he had died and gone to hell and sold his soul to come back to earth to see his wife. Weird. Yeah. Only Al (Spawn) finds out that five years have passed since he died and that his wife Wanda has remaried his best friend and they now have a child together (something Simmons could never do). Ouch. Life sucks. The Devil (Malebolgia) has screwed him bigtime! Enter The Violator, an entity and emissary of Malebolgia's, hiding his truly hideous demonic form behind the guise of a short, fat, disguting clown. Really weird.Spawn works on levels that Marvel and DC couldn't or wouldn't touch at the time. More adult in its themes. More skin. More violence. More vulgarity (without outright profanity). Issues illustrated and discussed in Spawn were darker and more relevant than anything that was going on in the big publishers comic collections. Corruption and greed, murder, rape and despair....What McFarlane did in the creation of Image and Spawn was giving the artists and writers back their pride and their rights to make a profit on their own creations and move away from the tired characters that Marvel had been toting around for decades. What he did with Spawn was create a anti-hero/vigilante Hellspawn kick-ass comic legend. Sure it got tired as it drug on, but the begining was fresh. Dark. Deep.Dig it."},{"Title":"Spawn, Book 1","review":"This collection includes the first five issus from Spawn/Image. The design is good.

It is also the beginning of the graphic masterpiece that is Spawn. It slowly takes grasp of you, and wraps you in the plight of Al Simmons, a.k.a. Spawn. This is a great way for new fans to get the early issues (1-5), or even for us comic vets who want to have all five in one convenient package! Also recommended, Spawn books 2-6. Believe me, it will hook you!"},{"Title":"Spawn, Book 1","review":"Spawn isn't about being the typical super-hero to look up to. He is much more representative of a true person, and therefore much more realistic. We all have a darker side, and society teaches us to hide from it. Only if we pull it out into the light and examine it for what it is can we truely deal with it. That's what Spawn is. If we continue to hide our dark sides from everyone, including ourselves they will build up and take us over eventually. Super-heroes such as Superman make it seem like if you even have an impure thought, let alone commit an act that isn't the right thing to do, then you must be evil. Ppl then compare themselves to these characters. Some ppl feel guilty for not measuring up to these standards. I think that is also one of the major problems of many major religions."},{"Title":"Spawn, Book 1","review":"Beautiful coloring, wonderfully detailed artwork - enticing storyline - definitely a &quot;should have&quot;."},{"Title":"Spawn, Book 1","review":"Spawn got old, pretty quickly, but was ok at the start.

Limping across the finish line as an &quot;also ran&quot; Spawn fails to make a case for himself as a redeeming fallen hero. Hero's are role models we admire and respect. There is little to admire about a brooding vengeful assasin such as Al Simmons. The storyline is very thin as evidenced by the novice McFarlane turning over the writing chores in subsequent issues to breathe life into an already &quot;Dead&quot; character. The artwork has a &quot;cartoony&quot; style if you're into that kind of art but the coloring by Steve Oliff is quite top notch and is the most redeeming factor of the book and definitely ahead of his time back in &quot;92.&quot; Although the early chapters of Spawn showed promise current readers know how far off-line Spawn has gone. The artwork now is exceedingly gorey, grotesque and downright depressing. As an oddity, Spawn has its cronies but as a hero with the longevity, love and respect that the great superheroes command--Spawn doesn't stand a chance. Oh sure, McFarlane has the money and machinery in place to ram Spawn down our throats for decades to come. Spawn may well be a household word someday but when it crosses our lips will it be spoken in disgust?"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Creative Watercolor","review":"Offers strategies for CREATIVE WATERCOLOR and ALL MEDIA.

Rat, later known as Tim, latched on to Dean, the first person to show him any love after he was abandoned by his parents.Tim, now eight-years-old, is having problems fitting in. He doesn't have any friends and is often teased because he has no real parents. One day, Tim is sent to the principal's office for hitting a boy who made fun of Dean. When Dean shows up, he discovers that the new school principal is none other than the high school sweetheart he thought he'd never see again, Stella O'Connell. She left for college nearly fifteen years before after Dean told her that he never loved her. But now she's not sure she's over him. She finds living in the same town difficult, but is unaware that it's just as hard for Dean who, despite what he said, had always loved her.Tim, in the meantime, decides he needs a mother. Now that he's found his daddy (though the adoption is not yet official), Tim is on a mommy quest. He's searching for that special woman who will make his daddy happy, and be the mother he always wished for. He sets Dean up on all sorts of dates, to Dean's frustration, but when Tim discovers that his principal is his daddy's old girlfriend, he begins to act up so he can get sent to the principal's office on a daily basis. No one can figure out what Tim is up to, but they do know he has an agenda.\\" - Complete review found at BookLoons - M. LoftonI loved this last book in the Luchetti Brothers series.

He has his family around him, a young adopted son Tim, and the farm, but what he really needs is a wife. Or so Tim thinks anyhow, especially if it means he'll gain a new Mommy in the process. And Tim has the perfect woman picked out... his school principal, Stella O'Connell. Thus begins Tim's latest adventure, The Mommy Quest.Dean and Stella have history between them and he has never quite been able to recover from it. Now, they have a second chance at the love long denied them. But when that history starts to rear its ugly head again, can they overcome everything to find happiness with each other? And most importantly, keep from hurting Tim?Though traditionally, a romance novel is about the couple, The Mommy Quest is really about Tim. Even the title hints at the heart of the story. As much as I like Dean and Stella, I truly love Tim so it's only natural I focus on him first and foremost. Tim has had a rough life. Abandoned very young, he lived on the streets until fate brought him into the Luchetti fold and Dean's heart. (See The Daddy Quest.) Later diagnosed with ADD, some balance was able to be brought into his life. But what he truly longs for is his own Mom and Dad. He struggles to adapt to his new life but his own history unfortunately makes him the brunt of schoolyard snubs and abuse. Watching him grow and change will tug at your heartstrings like few characters do.Dean hides his unhappiness and loneliness under a gruff exterior, never letting anyone see his deepest secrets and feelings. With Tim, Dean has been able to slowly let down those shields. When Stella drifts back into his life, things change once more. It was an enjoyable experience to go the journey with Dean as he learns much about himself, and her as they rebuild their faith in each other to find the love they've so long denied.Stella has her own personal demons to face when she returns to town. Having come from her previous job in the LA school system, Stella experienced things no one should ever have to go through at a school, and those fears haunt her still. She has returned home to emotionally recover and is unprepared for the emotions that swamp her upon meeting Dean again. Not to mention se has never quite forgiven him for breaking her heart so many years ago. She has a long road to walk to get herself back. As her heart warms for Tim, she grows closer once more to Dean and finally has to let go of the past and let him into her new life. This makes her growth all the more rewarding and real.Of course no Luchetti Brothers story would be complete without seeing the whole brood so we find plenty of time to catch up with the rest of the family and what's been happening in their lives. Then there is the motley bunch of critters that make the Luchetti farm their home. These loveable animals provide plenty of lighter moments that are guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. After all, who can resist Wilbur, the pig who thinks he's a dog? And he is just one of many creatures I couldn't help but love.I must say, I've enjoyed this series from the very first book and I'm more than a little sad to see the final book on the shelf. I can only hope that someday we will be gifted with stories of the next generation of the Luchetti brood. Happily, there are many young ones to choose from so maybe one day we'll meet them again.Kelley A. Hartsell, March 2007.

Some of these cookbooks in this area simply exchange low-fat ingredients (e.g., non-fat cheese) for the original high fat ingredient, which usually sacrifices a great deal of flavor and leads to bland Mexican food. This book focuses instead on some of the more naturally light Mexican-style foods, such as those using chicken or vegetables. A wide variety of recipes are covered, including appetizers, salsas and dips, salads, soups, chili, main dishes, and desserts.Although the cookbook is in the Mexican food genre, the focus truly is on Southwestern cooking. For example, the \\"Corn & Green Chili Spoonbread,\\" although delicious, is hardly something typically prepared in Mexico. However, serve it alongside some grilled chicken, and you have a terrific, light Southwestern meal. I've thoroughly enjoyed the recipes I've made from this cookbook. They strike me as very refreshing, often incorporating lime juice and fresh vegetables. The \\"Chicken Lime Soup\\" is a great example - one of the brightest tasting recipes I've made in awhile, and with only 8 grams of fat.The recipes include nutritional information, but only fat grams and calories. Some call for canned ingredients (e.g., chicken broth, diced green chilies), so it would have been helpful to have sodium content listed in particular. However, this weakness is small compared to the overall quality of the cookbook. \\"The Ultimate Low-Fat Mexican Cookbook\\" was deservedly a nominee for the prestigious James Beard Awards - the cookbook equivalent of the Oscars. Although time has dulled the novelty of a low-fat Mexican cookbook, this one is still a winner."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Low-Fat Mexican Cookbook: All The Flavor Without All The Guilt","review":"I've used this cookbook for years and have never gone wrong with one of the recipes.

Her books tend to be a bit formulaic, but she did expand her range to include romances, murder mysteries, political dramas and war stories.Keyes' first book reads like one -- Austin literally goes from loathing to loving Sylvia overnight, and the plot has few twists except Edith's pregnancy. Her writing is a mix of 20th-century informality and 19-century slowness, although this one leans more on the 19th-century. The conventions are a bit old, as is the vision of an early-twentieth-century small town which is aghast at movies and dances.Keyes also does a passable job with her cast of characters, but few of them are ever fully fleshed out. Sylvia is a pretty solid heroine, given her past with an abusive husband and two dead babies, but Austin is almost a cliche of the brooding rough-cut man.

Rosenberger reveals the life of an only child born of a highborn German immigrant father and a lovely American woman. Living in a working class Kansas City neighborhood during the notorious Pendergast era, a mischievious child, he served as an altar boy in the Roman Catholic Church. Rosenberger continued his service at the Church while growing into a delinquent, nearly criminal youth. Struggling to find his way, he chose the priesthood and did what it took to achieve his goal. He found the Church heirarchy corrupt and dishonest and was sorely disappointed when they set up roadblocks to the enlightened movement set out by Vatican II. Separating himself from the Church, he left the priesthood and struggled to find his way in the world, becoming a husband, father, and successful businessman. In time he became one of those courageous enough to stand up to the Church's practice of hiding the sexual abuse by priests. Essential for individuals who are interested in life in the 1930's, the Pendergast era, regional history, the inside the Catholic Church's practices and beliefs, and the sexual abuse scandals of the Roman Catholic Church, this is a revealing autobiography about a courageous man."},{"Title":"X Priest: Protest with Purpose","review":"I was very interested in the subject from a priest's point of view.

In all the discussions about it's effect on other novels, social relevance, worrying comments on the human condition etc., the fact that this is actually still a very funny book seems to get lost.

The only voice of humanity is that of a intellectually crippled boy.

Verloc is exceptionally well characterized, and Conrad's attempts to politicize a relatively unimportant event (the attempted bombing of the Greenwich observatory by a little-known anarchist) succeed exceedingly well. A good rainy-day book."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Joseph Conrad penetrates bluntly question humanity and faith in God. Helpless idiot brother and his fragile protector struggle to carry burden of their destiny only to be murdered by two hatred-driven anarchist. Grand are souls who sacrifice the harmless for the altar of their worshipping greedy ideology. Miserable are innocents who wind up the killed. Conrad narrows down our uviversally common question:Does God play good or evil on us? An innocent idiot and her fragiles sister could not sustain their low-profile life despite their utmost, respectable perseverance. A piece of anarchist walked away with all the wealth of the victims. God's cruel demand on innocent blood from scapegoat and his reward for the unscruplous. No sense of justice is found. Just God's joke on human sense of morality."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent brought up many interesting topics for discussion. The group of motifs Conrad chose to weave into his 1907 novel is highly political in nature: Anarchist views, science, capitalism, socialism, idealization, private ownership, poverty, the police, and possibly even Muslim extremism. For a novel written when it was, in many places The Secret Agent seemed an almost prophetic tale of Mr. Verloc, a secret agent in London.Interestingly enough, its first prophetic topic is of great importance in today's terror-stricken world, the plot of the story centering mainly on an Anarchist terrorist plot to put one of their followers, Mr. Verloc, in charge of blowing up an observatory. His method of choice, the suicide bomber, is eerily familiar to today's reader. What makes this suicide bomber plot all the more interesting are the obscure details Conrad includes that led me to question whether Verloc and his family were, in fact, Muslim. In Sir Ethelred and the Assistant Commissioner's chapter ten discussion, the Assistance Commissioner's thoughts question the country's domestic policy and focus on his battle against the \\"paynim (heathen/Muslim) Cheeseman,\\" which is Verloc. Toward the end, Conrad describes Mrs. Verloc as walking around town covered in black except for her eyes. These two details combine to add a Muslim thread to this already visionary terrorist suicide bombing plot in London, curiously reminiscent of recent world events.Stevie's comments to Mrs. Verloc on the taxi were intriguing as well, receiving new life from the recent New Orleans natural disaster. Stevie's sympathy for the poor taxi driver and poor horse lead him to wonder why the police don't fight to stop injustice. Mrs. Verloc's response, \\"They are there so that them as have nothing shouldn't take anything away from them who have\\" is followed by Stevie's question of \\"What, not even if they were hungry?\\" The way the media portrayed and the police responded to the \\"looting\\" in New Orleans was the answer to Stevie's question: \\"Yes, that's the police's job even if the poor are hungry.\\"The Secret Agent, even though nearly a century old, brings to the forefront topics that seem to our world today fairly new. The details connect with the reader because of their strange relevance, spurring conversation about the various topics listed above.Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Wanting to re-read this modern classic after some decades, in the course of a second visit to Conrad's writing, I made the mistake to buy this Signet edition.Don't do that! It sucks. The print is compact and the letters too small. It has no explanatory notes, which would be important for this kind of book. It is a punishment to read this.Stay away from this edition and buy the Oxford World Classics pocket book instead.I will review that shortly."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"After reading \\"A Secret Agent,\\" read Tim Ryan's \\"Who Pushed Humpty Dumpty?\\" for a bit of light reading. I am convinced that the latter is a parody of the former."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Again Conrad shows his adroitness at developing a plot. Not only was Conrad a gifted storyteller but he is equally adept at both charcater develpoment and descriptiveness. The Secret Agent is the story of a double agent who becomes a pawn,not only of the government he supposedly represents but with the British officials who have turned him. Trying to impress his handlers, he decides to plant a bomb that ends in tragedy for his own family.Conrad's portyal of anarchists as a bumbling lot with their own self serving agenda is the important point that is characteristic of all of Conrad's woks.The Secret Agent is not a stylishly written as Nostromo and lord Jim and is a bit faster paced. It also contains a somewhat comedic tone which is unlike Conrad's other works. What i appreciate most about Conrad is that he writes with all the talent and descriptiveness of other great authors but he is also a greta storyteller."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"A hundred years ago, Joseph Conrad wrote this splendid novel about a terrorist. I think it's easy to forget that terrorists have bosses and families; their horrible work happens in a context. The book is often funny, although I wasn't really aware of that until I had finished it. And it's also sad. The bad guys in The Secret Agent, and probably most terrorists here and abroad, are a sorry lot. If Conrad were writing today, he surely would have used the word \\"losers\\" to describe them. Novels like this one are more informative than anything you'll see on the news."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The Secret Agent, the novel with more twists than a twisler.In Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent, there is lots of complex language. \\"The utter unexpectedness, improbability, and inconceivableness of such an event robbed this vague declaration of all its effects.\\" This is typically how the book is written. There are extreme amounts of description, and it has an extensive vocabulary within the pages of this novel. The language has a way to catch your eye and make you think. All the characters match well into their setting, and the plot twists them into each other. Although it is so hard to, this book is worth reading.Mr.Verloc, the protagonist, is a man who lives two lives. He is in one life a lazy husband who owns a pornography store and has to support a family. His other life, believe it or not, is even more twisted. In his other life he is a secret agent for the British CIA. There is lots of love, trust, unfaithfulness, and traitors. Mr. Verloc is double crossed and must fight for his life and to gain back his respect.The Secret Agent is a very complex book. It can change your perspective with just the turn of a page. Basically, the secret agent, Mr.Verloc fakes his death and has politics and enemies mixed with allies to deal with. Several problems arise for him in the book but he manages to work around them.Joseph Conrad writes very complex, has a limitless diction, and uses British terms while writing this book. For Example he says, \\"in brown trousers and a claw hammer coat.\\" Instead of saying straight cut coat. Claw hammer\\" is a originally facetious way of saying straight cut coat. This novel will make you think and will not simply tell you what happens. He also says, \\"Like a galley slave's bullet,\\" Instead of saying cannonball. This is a kind of book that will not tell you something but will infer it, and you have to interpret the words.Mr. Conrad does a good job describing his characters. He paints a great picture of each character. \\"His eyes were naturally heavy; he had an air of having wallowed fully dressed in an unmade bed,\\" is how he describes Mr. Verloc. Winnie Verloc was described as, \\"a young woman with a full bust, in a tight bodice, with broad hips. Her hair was very tidy. Steady eyed like her husband, she preserved an air of unfathomable indifference behind the rampant counter.\\" Within these few sentences he tells you her personality and her physical features and you feel as if you almost know her.Another thing he does well is relate each character's features to their surroundings. Mr. Verloc is pictured as almost dirty with wrinkly clothes and like he has many things he can fix about himself but he chooses not to. His house consequently is described as, \\"one of those grimy brick houses which existed in large quantities before the era of reconstruction dawned on London.\\" This fits Mr. Verloc's personality because he is a grimy man who exists in large quantities in London. He is the type of man who is lazy and unfortunately very regular in London.Joseph Conrad is a great author, though very hard to read. His books make you think with every turn of a page and his characters create the most unpredictable circumstances, and act strange when taken out of their own comfort area. This book is good as long as you've got lots of time to think and it is also a book you must read more than once."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"You know this isn't a political piece right on page one when Conrad nicely suggests (with tongue-in-cheek Victorian-era delicacy) that the key business of his seedy little \\"double agent\\" is really just selling diry postcards to pervy men in raincoats. Verloc is sucked into this bombing plot solely because it has been so long since he has gathered any useful information for the foreign embassy paying him off. Although Nabokov would have sneered at being compared to another writer, this novel (by another master prose stylist who came to English as a second language) surely anticipates Nabokov's ouevre with its mounting pattern of bitter ironies. The Secret Agent is a very funny book, and really Conrad's only work I admire unhesitatingly."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"I read this book recently, and I seriously enjoyed the whole experience of reading it. The book, set in London, and based around an attack on the Greenwich Observatory is a fantastic read for those of you who like espionage, moving, exasperating thrillers. The characters, though sometimes eccentric and perhaps, some may say, strange, are realistic to the problems of the early twentieth century, and although the elderly language seldom used today was sometimes hard to tackle, it was a great, magical read. It left me feeling angry with some characters, but also happy that a writer could use twists and turns, and suspense to make a good book a fantastic, gripping novel. If you haven't read it, have a go: you may not enjoy the first part as it mentions hard hitting, truthful, content, but sure enough the sheer thrill of such a book relly is a rollercoaster ride for a reader."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The beginning of The Secret Agent was a little disappointing to me, but that was mostly because of the style of writing. Although I do not feel this book was as good as Heart of Darkness, Conrad wrote an amazing finish. I felt myself thinking what might have happened, who the bomber may have been. Then when Conrad revealed my thoughts were correct, I felt shaken. Stevie's character had my pity and sympathy, and his end left me saddened. I felt Mrs. Verloc's only recourse would be to kill her husband, yet I was still surprised at her actions. I was almost surprised at how much she picked up from Mr. Verloc when she was in such a derranged state. But what Conrad does best in this novel is portray human emotions. He accurately described how many humans think, and how they react to traumatic situations. The last seventy pages of the novel more than make The Secret Agent worth reading."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"In this novel the bombing of the Greenwich Observatory is the event around which story and characters detonate. The Observatory bombers are not anarchists. The culprits are an agent provocateur who has infiltrated the anarchists' ranks and his half-witted brother-in-law. The mastermind of the plot isn't an anarchist either he's a Russian diplomat frustrated with the refusal of the London police to arrest the anarchists. In short, a goverment sponsors an act of terrorism in order to provoke a crackdown on terrorists. The setting for all this is a Victorian London that Conrad describes as \\"the enormous town slumbering monstrously on a carpet of mud under a veil of raw mist\\" The idea Conrad sets out to blow up in the novel is modernism's sin of thinking abstractly about moral and human affairs--abstractly, scientifically, impersonally, and instrumentally. The anarchists think this way; the police do, too; and so do the government officials. Conrad dismisses them all. One person who does not think this way is the secret agent's brother in law Stevie who seems to be the pauper version of Dostoevsky's Idiot Prince Myshkin. Verloc's wife, Stevie's sister, Winnie answer's her brother's question about the police with the simplicity and honesty Stevie's nature required \\"Don't you know what the police are for, Stevie? They are there so that them as have nothing shouldn't take anything away from them who have.\\" In a scene straight out of Nietzsche and Dostoevsky Stevie refuses to ride in a cab because of the horse being whipped to pull them. When the Cabman explains that he is trying to feed his poor children the empathy in Stevie's heart explodes like a bomb within him engendering feeling for the horse, cabman, and his children. \\"The monstrous nature of that declaration of paternity seemed to strike the world dumb. A silence reigned, during which the flanks of the old horse, the steed of apocalyptic misery, smoked upwards in the light of the charitable gas-lamp.\\" He verbalizes his feelings telling us \\"Bad world for poor people\\". In Stevie's mind and heart \\"To be taken into a bed of compassion was the supreme remedy\\" Verloc, the secret agent, manipulates Stevie's heart to involve him in his terror scheme which results in disaster. In the future whenever I am about to be less than compassionate I hope to remember Stevie."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Conrad's The Secret Agent (Don't get excited, I can't underline from my browser...) is the brilliantly written story of the life of an anarchist in England at the turn of the century. Mr. Verlock is an agent for the French embassy in London, yet, at the same time, an activist for an anarchist revolution. Verlock lives with his young wife Winnie and her slightly disabled kid brother Stevie, atop a store on a run down street in London. The plot takes place around 1895, a time when anarchists in England carried out terrorist acts for their cause. Around 1895, Britain considered Anarchists common terrorists. Though most believe that Conrad portrays Verlock as a terrible person, one finds that by following both Verlock, and the investigation into a failed plot to destroy a London observatory, Conrad really displays the ease with which one's beliefs can change into terrorist plots. Thus, Verlock is not really portrayed as such a bad person. This book, especially relevant in today's age of terrorism, a wonderful read, and full of symbolism, will make you think."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"This book makes me sick because it contains few actions but many, even too, too many descriptions on these too few actions although the author was able to use so many uncommon words to show his ability in describing something.Such endless descriptions are tortures for anyone who reads this 5-page action novel. I really wonder if I need to read other books by this author."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"As fan of both Joseph Conrad and the spy novel, my biggest complaint about The Secret Agent is that it was oversold as containing insights into 9/11 and the mechanics of terrorism. The Secret Agent is a good spy story (not great) and the writing is perhaps not quite as dense as vintage Conrad can be. This reader did not, however, perceive any particular insights into 9/11 (unless one thinks it really was an inside job).The story is set in London in 1907. The spy Verloc is double-agent for an unspecified country, presumably Russia, and a member of a small anarchist group. As might be guessed, the characters comprising the anarchists are idiosyncratic to the point of eccentricity. Some members are merely playing, others enjoy the sound of their own voice a bit too much, and one enjoys mixing chemicals to create explosives. At bottom, these anarchists are ineffectual - much talk and little action. Verloc's only income besides his pay as an agent provocateur comes from a sleazy little shop where he sells odds-and-ends - and pornography. Vladimir, who runs Verloc out of the unnamed embassy, threatens to cut Verloc off unless he carries out a magnificent operation.The story alternatively centers around Verloc's rather odd home life as much as his career as a spy. His wife has married him so that she and especially her developmentally disabled brother Stevie will have some security. When Verloc involves Stevie in the terrorist operation the tale begins its hectic and exhilarating run to the finish.Conrad weaves an interesting tale of political intrigue and psychological insight. To my eye, the book offers only some insight into the way governments deal with terrorist threats and very little of use in understanding the nature of current threats. Reviewers who rediscovered the book after 9/11 larded the book down with rather grandiose claims of prophetic visions. In the Secret Agent, Conrad gave us a good read (probably a very good read at the time of its writing) and one that belongs on the bookshelf with other notable spy literature (likeSmiley's People,Kim (Penguin Classics),Red Gold: A NovelandThe Human Factor by Graham Greeneto name only a few). That should be enough for anyone."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"... and wildly under-appreciated, judging by the other reviews here on amazon! This is so archetypical a spy novel that frankly no other spy novel needed ever to be written. Conrad has said it all. It's tightly plotted, completely plausible except perhaps for a few too-convenient chance meetings on the street, and profoundly insightful into the \\"politics\\" of terror. And it's freshly pertinent, even to the point of including an inadvertent suicide bomber. There are no \\"good guys,\\" it's true, and nobody of any alignment with impressive physical or mental abilities. Every single personage is physically, picturesquely grotesque, and every character considers himself cleverly invulnerable yet reveals himself to be irremediably foolish. The descriptions of these moral clowns and the deplorable world of mucky squalor and gilded corruption in which they move are the best writing, sentence by sentence, that Conrad ever did -- worthy of Dickens or Dostoyevsky. There's a sardonic, scornful humor in every scene, however grizzly. This is the darkest picture of human nature I've ever read. Even love and loyalty are degenerative psychoses. One expects a certain fatalistic pessimism from Conrad, sprawling across an ungainly plot, with complicated narrative overlays and ambiguous judgments. The Secret Agent is utterly different; it's as terse and unified as its subtitle claims; it's \\"a Simple Tale.\\"\\"Mr. Verloc, going out in the morning, left his shop nominally in charge of his brother-in-law. It could be done, because there was very little business at any time, and practically none at all before the evening. Mr. Verloc cared but little about his ostensible business. And, moreover, his wife was in charge of his brother-in-law.\\"That's the first paragraph; if you don't already feel in the presence of a master of subtle indirection just from that much, perhaps you'll be as unresponsive to this great novel as the hapless fools would be who populate its pages.Hitchcock made a film of it in the 1930s. I've never seen the film, but I can imagine that Hitchcock would have read the novel with sardonic glee and captured its humor. It's Hitchcock in prosody. Yo! Peeps, if I tell it's totally NOIR, will you give it a ride?"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"perhaps people don't like conrad because if his tendancy to vary the tone of his work. at turns bitterly funny, creepy, and rather sad, this very modern &quot;spy novel&quot; is a delight.conrad again takes us through a set of narrative sequence twists- the result of the bomb-plot is revealed a mere 80 pages in, and the fun is following his delightfully full characters as they unwrap what the hell is going on.london takes on a gloomy, nightmarish quality, in many ways as exotic and unfamiliar as the belgian congo. i'm still pondering his odd antipathy toward italian eating establishments."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Tired of the cookie-cutter characters and ridiculous dialogue in Grisham and Clancy? Bewildered by their almost complete ignorance of human psychology? This book is the elixir you need, pitting terrorists against state tyrants in turn-of-the-century London. It is suspense that slowly turns inward, from the impersonality of national ideological battles to the intimate horror of a woman slowly discovering her husband's second life. Enjoy, too, many of Conrad's great obsessions: the &quot;bombs&quot; that initiate a historical record; the dispersal of human agency; the wisdom of suspended contradiction."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Conrad still suffers today from the same pigeon-hole that his writing was pounded into during his own lifetime. He is still seen as harbinger of distant seas, of the exotic, the foreign. He is best known for Heart of Darkness, a book immortalized in pop culture by Francis Ford Coppola's retelling of this long, tormented short story as a Vietnam epic in Apocalypse Now.And yet, The Secret Agent is a book that rivals, if not matches or exceeds, that great horror of the English cannon. This is more than a novel about terrorism, this is a terrorist novel. It's a book about poverty and squalor, about the obfuscated struggles of humanity; it conspires to build our ideals into violent extremes, chipping at a suffering domesticity negotiated in silence, then lets them fall in the babble of gutted secrets. This violence is not thrusted upon us in a language that dazzles tired eyes with surreal distortions; Conrad's is a dark, brooding prose as tempered and inauspicious as blinding banalities of our daily lives, and it these complacencies that he uses to deliver an ultimate shock. Conrad aims here at the absolute vortex of the British Empire--really, of the entire West--at that crossroads between global politics and the most individual of covenants. The knowledge found there manifests a total psychological collapse, one that leaves the cruel mechanisms of reality horrifically untouched."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"This one is new for me, as I've been an avid reader only of Conrad's sea-related novels. Here, Conrad shifts the scene to London, where he can make a walk to the corner seem like an excursion into another &quot;blank spot on the map.&quot; I could not get the image of vines and jungles out of my head (even though we are in the slums of London), though the imagery, including the fog, slime, and mud, all add up to powerful effect, at times- at other times, it seems &quot;too much&quot;.I read this novel right after Henry James's &quot;Princess Casamassima,&quot; as both deal with the subject matter of terrorism. I preferred this novel, because Conrad seems to understand the shadowy underworld better than James. Yet, (though this may be Conrad's purpose) I never really cared about the characters that much. Mrs. Verloc was the most interesting, but at times her thoughts, rendered in Conrad's extensive interior monologue, often border on stereotype.All in all, a solid effort, but I'll be returning to the sea with Conrad before I visit London with him again."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The secret agent of the title is not a character you can root for but merely pity, as his rather bland vanity sets in motion not only a shocking tragedy but his own downfall as well. The disharmony right below the surface of his fragile, awkward family life finally explodes right about the time he sends his frail mother off to live by herself; the even bigger plot explosion to follow becomes a catalyst for the rest of the story's major events. Conrad's narrative style is often so dense you may lose track of what's going on, but you never lose track of the finely etched characters, whose motives here all cross paths over the same sad (and ultimately pointless) episode. Patient readers will be lulled into a heartbreaking tale whose story elements eerily parallel the terrorist schemes of today. But then again, terrorism isn't exactly a modern day nightmare. (It's been going on throughout history.) Overall, the heavy, thick writing magicially gives way to some very memorable and forlorn people, who never do get to realize their dreams. The clash of law and lawlessness, morality and indifference, and love and family loyalty, feature strongly on practically every page."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"This novel was confusing in the beginning. The characters take some time getting used to who is who. Mr. Verloc is one of the main characters in the beginning, but slowly drifts away from even being mentioned at all. Don't be confused , because in the end everything will come together and you'll see exactly why these things happened.It makes you think about what is going to happen through the whole thing! I have to say, the end left me spellbound."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The Secret Agent has a narrative form with richly described and very intriguing characters. For instance the very first few pages describe Mr. Verloc and his shop. Conrad uses well placed words to accurately paint images in the reader's mind of the indifferent Mr. Verloc, his lovely and buxom wife Winnie and her &quot;slow&quot; brother. Conrad also raises suspicion within the readers minds with his references to the men in the trench coats who walk in and out of the shop in the evenings when the shop door is suspiciously left ajar. Conrad's themes in this book were the alienation of the citizens from the city and the breakdown of communication between the charcters. Each theme was very well communicated and clearly stated. This book provides an interesting read for almost anyone who decides to pick it up."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Admittedly, the first half (dare I say, two thirds?) of this novel seemed to me rather plodding-- until one key event occurs and the plot starts to kick into full gear. The finale rivets the reader to the page, suddenly revealing multiple layers of character, plot, and theme. The effect is a blend of Hitchcock with a dash of Dostoevsky. I am now eager to go back and re-read the entire book again for its deceivingly subtle multi-dimensionality. I highly recommend the Signet version as the introduction (which should be read after the novel) points out several less-than-obvious motifs."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The funniest, strangest, or worst (depending on how you look at it) thing about Joseph Conrad's &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; is that it makes light of a situation -- terrorism -- that maybe was not a big deal at the time it was written but nearly a hundred years later has become a fearsome world problem. The terrorist activity described in this novel apparently is based loosely on a real incident, but Conrad avoids specifying any actual political motivations and instead makes his story as basic and general as possible.The &quot;terrorist&quot; is a most unassuming man named Mr. Verloc. He runs a stationery and news store in London where he lives with his wife Winnie, her mother, and her mildly retarded brother Stevie. For the past eleven years he has been drawing pay from an unspecified foreign Embassy for occasional information on the activities of an anarchist organization, the &quot;local chapter&quot; of which is comprised of a bunch of malcontent duffers whom he has managed to befriend. An official at the Embassy, Mr. Vladimir, thinks Verloc is not very bright and plans to use him as an agent provocateur to get the anarchist organization in trouble. He suggests to Verloc to blow up an unlikely but symbolic target, the Greenwich Observatory; as the source of the prime meridian or zero-degree longitude, it's like the seam of the world. Using a bomb made by another of society's outcasts, a creepy fellow known only as the Professor, Verloc enlists Stevie's help to carry out his scheme.Fast forward to immediately after the (unsuccessful) bomb blast: Police Chief Inspector Heat is investigating the incident, reconstructing the crime back to its source, and, interestingly enough, competing with his own superior officer. The post-blast events are where the novel really develops unexpectedly, in which we see what kind of tenuous relationship Verloc has with his wife, and the cruel treachery of one of his dishonest comrades. The structure of the novel is remarkable in the way it establishes the chronology of events, sets the pacing, and lets the scenes unfold as naturally as if they were being staged.I found this novel to be a lot of fun and, despite the serious subject matter and the fact that it was considered quite violent for its time, actually kind of funny. I see it as not an attempt at a spy story or &quot;thriller&quot; but rather an early example of black humor, in which the narrative is filled with wry wit and each character is given a certain comical edge as if Conrad were making subtle fun of the whole business. It is a book that defies expectations, discards formulas, and immerses itself in the tremendous possibilities of the creativity of great literature."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The Secret Agent was a major risk for Joseph Conrad, a London tale of international political intrigue far removed from the symbolic sea adventures he had previously written. That it is not only one of his greatest triumphs but also one of the best novels of its kind testifies to his greatness. The diversity it introduced to his canon is truly remarkable; very few writers have works so different in nearly every respect. It is thus essential not only for those who like his other work but also for those who do not.The immediate subjects are terrorism and anarchism, and I know of no work that uses them with more brilliance or verisimilitude. Conrad's Preface says that he thought it a high compliment when terrorists and anarchists praised its realism, and he indeed deserved it. He brings this truly underground world vividly to life, depicting everything from speech to customs to dress in believable detail. The vast majority of course want nothing to do with such a world, but the peek is undeniably fascinating. Conrad's psychological insight is particularly intriguing and valuable. All this brings up the important - some would say central - point of how Conrad views these characters. That terrorists and other unsavory personages have been sympathetic to it - particularly the Unabomber's obsession with it - seems to strongly suggest that Conrad leans toward them, but a close reading of the text or mere glance at his Preface shows otherwise. He clearly has nothing but contempt for them; this comes across forcefully in the narrator's ironic mockery and Conrad's noting that Winnie Verloc is the only true anarchist - a terrorist jab if ever one existed. In his view, they were pretentious, portentous, and above all, simply ineffectual with greatly exaggerated self-importance. Thus, though the book does a great service in peering into their dark world, it also arguably gives false comfort in showing them as ambiguously inept. The ominous last paragraph undercuts this somewhat, perhaps reflecting Conrad's uneasiness about the future. From an American perspective, the book of course has added interest in a post-9/11 world, but we must not let knee-jerk reactions blind us to its true worth and value.This brings up another important point - the novel has long had great relevance elsewhere. Though written in the early twentieth century and set in the late nineteenth, it in many ways encapsulates the uneasy political atmosphere that dominated much of Europe, Russia, Latin America, Asia, and elsewhere throughout the last century. Their citizens have become unwillingly familiar with people like the book's characters and especially their deeds, giving the novel near-prophetic prescience. Its strongly implied portrait of Russian political machinations - taken up directly a few years later in Under Western Eyes - is particularly notable in coming but a decade before the Bolshevik Revolution. Conrad clearly had his finger on the world's political pulse as few artists have. It is also easy to forget that his vision is not limited to extremes like terrorism and anarchism; he vividly dramatizes the political unrest and unjust social conditions that make such extremes possible as well as official responses. In short, he zeroes in on much of what is wrong with the Western world in the last century plus. Almost no one noticed initially, but it became ever clearer that the book darkly anticipated much of the twentieth century's direst events, making it in many ways even more valuable than when new.Yet it is also a historical novel in the best sense. The portrayal of late Victorian London is one of the most notable of any city in literature. We get a good idea of what it was like to live there, especially in its dark underbelly - and Conrad leaves no doubt that it was far from pretty. His descriptions are very visceral, emphasizing dirt, grime, and overall dreariness. There is widespread sentimental longing for many Victorian aspects, but Conrad does not let us forget the darker side. Again, this is not restricted to those outside the law; Conrad always had great sympathy for the poor and downtrodden and shows their plight here with stunning bluntness. This imparts more emotion than is usual in Conrad, chiefly pathos, and is also very thought-provoking. Conrad always excelled at this last, and The Secret is a preeminent example despite its shortness, giving food for thought on everything from sociopolitical issues to domesticity.Despite all this, the novel can also be enjoyed on a very basic level as a sort of detective story/spy adventure hybrid. Conrad after all belongs to the golden era of detective fiction and was skilled enough to work in elements without compromising his art. There is not much mystery in the usual sense, but he manipulates the narrative to provide a great deal of dramatic irony and suspense. The spy aspect was more original - indeed one of the first instances of its kind and enormously influential. All this means that those who dislike Conrad's usual settings and plots may well be pleasantly surprised.As ever with Conrad, there is no conventional hero or anything like one; nearly all characters are indeed thoroughly loathsome. Verloc, the protagonist, is somewhat ambiguous; though ostensibly dislikable as a petty traitor, some have seen him as at least slightly admirable or high-minded in trying to carry out his deed without loss of life and in his strong family support. Like many Conrad characters, he is notable above all for sheer incompetence. He is so hapless that condemning him seems not only superfluous but near-cruel; aside from whether or not we think his end deserved, he can easily arouse either pity or contempt depending on one's charitableness.His wife is one of the more nuanced depictions; some even see her as the hidden key or the real story beneath all the political trappings. Conrad's Preface indeed refers to the book as \\"the story of Winnie Verloc.\\" And so it is in some ways. Though Conrad is legitimately called essentially conservative, some have found feminist threads in his work, and this may be the best example. Winnie is a truly tragic figure, a perhaps extreme but in many ways representative example of what a woman can be reduced to in an overtly sexist society. She married for money rather than love and often wonders if she made the right decision; it is easy to say no in today's liberalized world, but such sweeping generalizations are unfair for the time. It was after all virtually impossible for women to get by without a husband's income. More importantly, Winnie is kind and caring, full of sympathy and empathy as almost no Conrad characters are and not without intelligence. How we should view her drastic act is a very open question, as she is arguably more sinned against than sinning and certainly pitiable, whatever her faults. Conrad is not one to lionize characters, but she is one of the few he does not outright condemn, which says much.With characteristic irony, Conrad makes the mentally enfeebled Stevie the most sympathetic and possibly the most likable character. However conventionally limited, his depth of feeling and empathy nears a human ideal, as may his unquestioning love and loyalty. His revelation on the coach is one of literature's greatest, most powerful, and most thought-provoking scenes, and his conclusions here and elsewhere are very possibly at least as legitimate as the most storied philosophers'. The contrasts between him and other characters, especially criminal ones, is the source of much irony.As all this suggests, the book is very much in line with Conrad's dark vision, however otherwise different from prior works. Aside from focusing on the criminal and lowly, its overall picture is near-misanthropic; the novel condemns terrorists and their ilk but also seems to say there is not much worth protecting from them. Human interaction is painted very bleakly; love, domesticity, family relations, and nearly every other interpersonal area seems doomed to fail. Communication itself is almost hopelessly futile. There is also a strong fatalistic streak; characters are drawn into terrible situations against their will and seem unable to escape or even comprehend them. The Secret shows humanity on the verge of great distress with little or no hope of avoiding it.Much of this comes from the unique narrative style and distinctive prose. Conrad is of course a noted stylist, and this is one of his most notable works in that way. His vocabulary is incredible, his descriptions are breathtaking, and he is eminently quotable, which is truly amazing considering that he was not a native English user. There are so many times when he expresses an idea so perfectly and articulately that many will think with a start that they have had such feelings but could never express them, much less so well. The Secret stands out from some prior works, especially the epic Nostromo, in being remarkably concise; Conrad says only what must be said, sculpting precisely. This is clearest in the dialogue, which is almost non-existent and very brief, not to mention distinctly clipped, when present; the characters are so hapless that they can apparently not even articulate their thoughts. The narration is a distinct contrast, teeming with Conrad's ever-brilliant and eccentric language. This implicitly mocks the characters even more, as does the ostensibly neutral narrator's frequent sniping sarcasm. Many have said that the narrator - and thus presumably Conrad - has an almost malevolent attitude. This makes the book simply too dark for some but also leads to significant black humor, almost the only humor Conrad allowed himself; for what it is worth, The Secret is thus his most humorous book, however far from humorous it generally seems.The story is also notable for being told in an essentially straight-forward way. As always with Conrad, the prose is somewhat dense, but it is substantially less so than elsewhere, and we do not have to work through multiple narrators as so often with him. The story is not linear but is far easier to follow than usual; the feeling of being lost and disoriented that turns off so many casuals is never present. Conrad subtitled the novel \\"A Simple Tale,\\" and it is indeed simple in this way, at least compared to his other stories, making this his most accessible major work and giving appeal beyond his usual base. However, it is far from simple in the ways that really matter - characterization, themes, philosophical and sociopolitical depth, etc. - and may in many ways be said to have the best of both proverbial worlds.All told, this is essential for anyone who likes Conrad and a good place for neophytes to start, while even those who think they dislike him may be in for (an admittedly dark) treat.As for this edition, it is ideal for most; it is not only inexpensive but has an excellent introduction and substantial notes. However, anyone who hates spoilers should perhaps avoid the latter, as they give away something not revealed until far later in the story."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The secret agent of the title is an agent provocateur, paid by a foreign power, who is supposed to animate anarchist terrorists in the London of the late 19th century towards violence. It seems that the story itself and its personnel are realistic depictions of a certain milieu.Conrad's sympathy for that milieu was perfectly non-existent. He wastes no time with serious discussions of their politics. All members of the anarcho-scene are described as utter idiots, unless they are promoted a little to the status of criminals. Of course the action that ensues in the course of the plot is utterly idiotic. And apparently based on a real case.The novel owes much to Dickens and his vision of London, but it transcends Dickens towards a more modern narrative concept. Conrad is the truest anarchist of this mini-universe, his approach to time is pure anarchy, leaping and jumping and leaving us with holes and gaps.And it is irony pure and simple -- to the extent of being called a simple story in its title subline as well as in its dedication to H.G.Wells. One wonders if that dedication was not itself a piece of irony, considering that Wells was an active socialist.The world view of the novel is pessimistic, but there are few funnier pessimists than Conrad. I used to think the man had no sense of humour. How wrong! He is hilarious, but he is never joking.Not only the bad guys are idiots, the 'good' guys are not much better, ie the cops and politicians get a lot of bad vibes here. Prime target of scorn is the wealthy mentor of political revolution, frequently female.Don't compare it to modern espionage novels, as the title may suggest. These are different worlds. This is something else."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"For all the talk of the supposed &quot;difficulty&quot; of this novel, I found it to be one of the best construed and told that I have read lately. It goes well beyond a simple thriller or spy novel; it is an intense human drama in which the characters have real personalities. Verloc is a loser. He has been living, for the last eleven or so years, off the payments of a foreign embassy which employs him to spy and report on the activities of a terrorist cell, also composed of frustrated, useless, all-talk-no-action losers. Other reviewers have aptly described these characters.Verloc lives also off the meager profits of a news store, which serves as cover up for his clandestine activities, ignored even by his family. This consists of his younger wife, Winny, her mother and her retarded brother Stevie, a sympathetic but hopeless young man.As the novel opens, Verloc is in deep trouble. The new officers at the embassy are displeased at the results Verloc's work has achieved, and so one of them brutally warns him that the pay will stop if he doesn't produce at least one major act of terrorism, say, blow up the Greenwich observatory, an icon of modern faith in science. Verloc gets obviously dismayed at this order, for he is no terrorist at all, just a scumbag of an idler. I won't spoil the rest of the story up to the attack, but the resulting situation will show how coward these terrorists are (we hope none of them were as bold as other terrorists we know are) and how fragile Verloc's family relations are, especially in view of the terribly stupid action he commits.This is a very dark tale. None of the characters are attractive, but they are exteremely well developed, and that's what counts. The humor used by Conrad is without concessions: for all its cruelty, I found the bombing scene a very funny one. Conrad makes hard fun of all these types who talk and talk about anarchy, the &quot;Revolution&quot;, ideology and their supposed love for humanity, a love conspicuously absent from their daily lives.How pertinent, in these times, to have a great and darkly funny novel to taka a look at, now that the types have, sadly, passed into action."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"This novel is truly both what Conrad subtitles \\"A Simple Story,\\" and quite a hard nut to crack. Not having read any of Conrad's other, more famous works, I have nothing to compare The Secret Agent to, but I would say that it proved in my own mind that the man is a master of revealing human emotions and motivations. There isn't a single character, however insignifigant they may seem to the story itself, who is not fully developed, from the Assistant Commissioner of Police to Toodles the Secretary to Winnie Verloc, to the intensly creepy \\"Professor.\\" Nor was this merely description tacked onto the plot; indeed, it took precendence over the plot and became my purpose for continuing to read the book. For the story is simple, and not overly meaninglful.I will say that Conrad's prose occasionally slowed me down. Once into the middle of a chapter or a conversation I had no problems, but the beginning of each chapter, especially the early ones, was extremely confusing, and had to be suffered through before the books strengths were revealed."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The prose in this book is not actually very difficult. I suspect that what people tend to find difficult is the singularly unpleasant nature of the characters taken together with a very different look at terrorism than is popular in literature and film today.\\"You anarchists should make it clear that you are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation. But how to get that appallingly absurd notion into the heads of the middle classes so that there should be no mistake?\\"The Secret Agent was one of the first novels to address issues of terrorism and espionage. The way that Conrad approaches it is brilliant-- these are not wild-eyed men, driven by passion. The main character in The Secret Agent, Verloc, is just doing his job-- in the end, he commits the central atrocity in the book out of fear of being sacked. There is virtually nobody likable in this book with the exception of Stephen, Verloc's gentle and retarded brother in law.The book is best seen as a dark comedy with an ensemble cast. The complacent British police who think it best to leave the anarchists alone, the motley crew of would-be terrorists-- each with their foibles and weaknesses. It feels at times like watching a clockwork unfolding-- one that you know will take its toll on the most innocent participants.This is one of Conrad's most important works, but not one of his most likable. I thought it was a very good read. I certainly think that it is a thought-provoking book, particularly considering the times. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The Secret Agent is generally considered to be one of the first books written in the political-espionage thriller category, and in my opinion one of the finest ever written for the genre. Conrad lets the depth and strength of the characters propel the story forward instead of the plot. I found characters such as Mr. and Mrs. Verloc, the Professor, and Comrade Ossipon to be far more compelling and interesting than the cookie cutter \\"Jack Ryans\\" that exist today.The actual act of political terrorism is tiny and insignificant physically but monstrously cruel on an ethical and personal level. The personal consequences of this \\"act of despair\\" are more stunning,and horrifying than anything Clancy or Higgins could dream up. I dare not write more for fear of ruining this magnificent book. It's an incredible read."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"I must admit to having a love-hate relationship with Conrad. His novels possess an undeniable power, and I have read each of his novels with the utmost fascination. Yet, I can't say that actually reading a Conrad novel is an enjoyable experience. His vision of the world is a tad too bleak, his confidence in human nature way too despairing, and the overall atmosphere way too gloomy for me to derive pleasure from reading Conrad.Although not set in one of the exotic locales which we associate with Conrad, THE SECRET AGENT is both one of his finest and one of his most typical novel, with one exception. In most of his books, the plot revolves around situations which inevitably lead to tragedy and disaster, but in which a central character is often able to somewhat redeem his life by an act or acts of personal heroism. The feel is usually quite similar to that of Norse mythology, in which Gods and men will struggle at the end of the world against the forces of evil, but will lose. The challenge is to oppose the evil heroically. But in THE SECRET AGENT, the central character is anything but heroic, and is in no truly important way opposed to the powers of evil.I have to admit to being perplexed by claims that Conrad was a great prose stylist. I will confess that I find that with his prose, the sum is greater than its parts. If you examine his sentences, he is without question, along with Theodore Dreiser, perhaps the worst constructor of sentences in the English language. Perhaps having learned English only after reaching adulthood is to blame. Many of his sentences are grammatically opaque. Frequently his sentences are incomplete or badly constructed. Almost never does Conrad seem to sense the rhythm of the language. Perhaps this lack of rhythm is what many mistake for a great prose style. I have spent a fair amount of time in the secondary literature on Conrad, and so far I have yet to find a single Conrad scholar who felt that he possessed a command of the English language. The consensus seems to be that he is a great writer despite his struggle with the English language, not because of any mastery he possesses over it.Overall, I hold this to be one of Conrad's most important novels, on a par with UNDER WESTERN EYES, HEART OF DARKNESS, VICTORY, and NOSTROMO.Ironically, Alfred Hitchcock filmed a version of THE SECRET AGENT, but it was not the movie with the same name. Hitchcock's THE SECRET AGENT was actually based on Maugham's Ashenden stories (which Maugham says were based upon his own experiences as a secret agent; he claims to have been one of the more inept agents in history). Hitchcock's version of the Conrad novel was SABOTAGE. Hitchcock changed many of the details, and his religious beliefs never allowed him to engage in the despair one finds in Conrad (Hitchcock was a devout Catholic). Although his version resembles Conrad, it isn't a very faithful adaptation either in plot or in spirit."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The Secret Agent will appeal to anyone who likes Dickens' satire of Victorian society and its members, and to those who like the revolutionaries scattered throughout the works of Dostoyevsky. Only that Conrad is far more biting in his portrait of Victorian England than Dickens ever was, and even his characterisation is comparable if not superior at points. No one could ever forget, for example, Sir Ethelred, who 'opened a wide mouth, like a cavern, into which the hooked nose seemed anxious to peer'. But Conrad's revolutionaries do not quite topple those of Dostoyevsky (an obvious influence on Conrad despite Conrad's apparent dislike of the Russian). The novel is (thus) primarily character driven; the central idea of the story (the bombing attempt) is so amazingly simple that one almost misses it. The prose is dense and I would not recommend it either as light reading or to Samuel Johnson's 'common reader'."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Mr Verloc is a \`closet' anarchist and a secret agent. Much of his work to date has been of the sedentary type, until the appearance of the smooth talking Mr Vladimir. Dissatisfied with the lack of action by Mr Verloc, he threatens to fire him if he doesn't do something dramatic soon. The suggestion is to blow up the Greenwich observatory in order to wake the slumbering middle classes.This causes Mr Verloc weeks of anguish as he tries to figure out how to go about this task. His anguish is so much like that of Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov. (The similarity is not accidental; Conrad was heavily influenced by Dostoevksy's style). He finally manages to find a way out of his predicament and it is here where the plot gets thicker. The final quarter of the book is where the real action is, and the twists and turns aren't as predictable as you first make it out to be.For those brought up on the quick, descriptive style of the modern novels, Conrad's roundabout way of saying things can get a bit irritating, but then that is what makes a classic right? Whatever your preference, I would recommend this book to those who like a good detective novel with a dose of non-conventional \`philosophy' thrown in."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"After 100 years, Conrad's distinctive novel of espionage and counter-espionage is still the apex of the genre, the indispensable masterpiece. It's bleak, mordant, suspenseful, and funny, and it's wildly under-appreciated judging by the other reviews here on amazon.This is so perfect a spy novel that frankly no other spy novel needed ever to be written. Conrad has said it all. It's tightly plotted, completely plausible except perhaps for a few too-convenient chance meetings on the street, and profoundly insightful into the \\"politics\\" of terror. And it's freshly pertinent, even to the point of including an inadvertent suicide bomber.There are no \\"good guys,\\" it's true, and nobody on any side of things with indomitable physical or mental abilities. Every single personage is picturesquely grotesque. Every character considers himself cleverly invulnerable yet reveals himself to be irremediably foolish. The descriptions of these moral clowns and the deplorable world of mucky squalor and gilded corruption in which they move are the best writing, sentence by sentence, that Conrad ever did -- worthy of Dickens or Dostoyevsky. There's a sardonic, scornful humor in every scene, however grizzly. This is the darkest picture of human nature I've ever read. Even love and loyalty are degenerative psychoses. One expects a certain fatalistic pessimism from Conrad, sprawling across an ungainly plot, with complicated narrative overlays and ambiguous judgments. The Secret Agent is utterly different; it's as terse and unified as its subtitle claims; it's \\"a Simple Tale.\\"\\"Mr. Verloc, going out in the morning, left his shop nominally in charge of his brother-in-law. It could be done, because there was very little business at any time, and practically none at all before the evening. Mr. Verloc cared but little about his ostensible business. And, moreover, his wife was in charge of his brother-in-law.\\"That's the first paragraph; if you don't already feel in the presence of a master of subtle indirection just from that much, perhaps you'll be as unresponsive to this great novel as the hapless fools would be who populate its pages.Hitchcock made a film of it in the 1930s. I've never seen the film, but I can imagine that Hitchcock would have read the novel with sardonic glee and captured its humor. It's Hitchcock in prosody.Yo! Peeps, if I tell it's totally NOIR, will you give it a ride?"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Surely one of the greatest books I've ever read, The Secret Agent is a horrifying, oppressively bleak, vastly entertainly masterpiece that sets out to explain the absurdity of any form of political fanaticism. No one is justified in this novel and the pathetic results of the high-minded ideals of every character in the book underlines the nature of both enforced order and violent anarchy.For all the horror and intense drama of this novel is reads to me as somehow hilariously funny. At the moment when the worst of all possible things happens (leading to the worst of all possible results for everyone) I actually laughed out loud not just in shock but in my own sense of applied justice (a disquieting reaction that made me realize I was actually no better than any of the depicted grotesques, at least as far as allowing my personal sense of morality to pre-judge the humanity (or lack thereof) of anyone.To give away some of the twists and turns of the plot (despite the Dostoyevskian tone of hopeless doom, this is truly a taut and absorbing spy novel) would be a disservice and so I shall leave off here with the highest of recommendations."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"I was taught not to judge a book that has been a top literature for the last century. There must be something everybody else find that I don't. But I read this book as a group for a literature class. The book was so descriptive, everything juss drags on and on.

You may, too, long before the anticlimactic end of \\"The Secret Agent.\\"Joseph Conrad's 1907 novel not only predicts the rise of terrorism as a global force (and analyzes its anarchistic roots with probing curiosity and pungent wit), it also more or less created the genre of the spy novel, both the high artsy type John le Carre produces and the popular sort dished out by Tom Clancy. It's an important book, at times quite a good read. At times...As when we meet the Professor, a sinister bomb-maker who fondles in his pants pocket the rubber-bulb detonator of the explosive he has strapped to his body as he walks the crowded streets of the city, to warn off any bobby who might try and mess with him. \\"They depend on life...a complex, organized fact open to attack at every point, whereas I depend on death, which knows no restraint and cannot be attacked,\\" he sneers. \\"My superiority is evident.\\"Or the mentally retarded Stevie, the man-child so sensitive to the pain of others, even a starving horse that drives his mother's cab. He wishes only for comfort and joy for all, like the kind he knows when his loving sister tucks him into bed. \\"To be taken into a bed of compassion was the supreme remedy, with the only one disadvantage of being difficult of application on a large scale.\\"There's some humor and much wisdom in Conrad's novel. Conrad was a great writer, capable of capturing in often-meandering sentences some very difficult concepts about the world we live in and the complex psychology of those around us. At his best, he's brilliant. But \\"The Secret Agent\\" is more than a little windy, with a rambling narrative that introduces a bevy of characters but doesn't do very much with them and one key moment of action that happens outside the unnecessarily shifting narrative.Some reviewers here have made mention of the fact those of us who don't appreciate Conrad here are guilty of being members of the MTV generation and so on. Yes, it's true, I have seen a music video, a Duran Duran one. I remember someone flipping a table... But the problem here isn't with modern readers' short-attention spans.When Conrad was being discursive in \\"Lord Jim,\\" it was for the sake of delving into the many layers of a conflicted central character, filling a broad canvas with the stuff of a vast world at sea which threatened to drown Jim's overarching sense of self-importance if he didn't keep escaping into something else. There was a point to its narrative time shifts and here-and-gone secondary characters. In \\"The Secret Agent,\\" one gets a sense of a slight yarn, no more than a short story really, being tricked up and lathered with unnecessary detail. The central character is a dull slug and a poser, his wife, the only mildly sympathetic character, is little better, a Stepford Wife without the nice house.Conrad's book starts off well, but then takes a sharp left turn after the central act of terror, petering out in a series of elliptical conversations, of little or no importance to the final resolution, where Conrad commentates on every unspoken thought and nuance of expression. The narrative becomes very slow and dull, to the point when we finally are given an act of on-screen violence, it's so lethargically rendered that the victim barely cries out before expiring. Some point about pointlessness is being made, for the 456th time.That Conrad created here a genre that has served us well is beyond question. But it's only an okay book, not the best by Conrad or the best spy fiction by a long chalk. It's not even the best story about an unprincipled man named Verloc who causes a London bombing, as Alfred Hitchcock reworked this book into his 1936 film \\"Sabatoge.\\" That's a classic work of art, something not to be missed. Conrad's novel is but a dry run in comparison, sometimes very dry."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"I love this book! I couldn't put it down at all.

However the book is a thriller and it is a book with many issues that are prevalent in today's corrupt society."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Based on a true incident, Conrad tells the story of Verloc, the secret agent provocateur who is given the task of blowing up the Royal Observatory in London as a way of heaping scorn on anarchists in England. He sends his mentally deficient brother-in-law Stevie with the bomb, which blows up before he can reach the observatory. Stevie is annihilated and when Verloc's wife (Winnie) finds out what happens to her brother, she stabs Verloc with a carving knife.Conrad insisted his novel was not a political work dealing with anarchy but was only a \\"work of the imagination.\\" But he captured the seediness and moral deficiencies of everyone involved, from Verloc to Chief Inspector Heat. The last chapter, where Verloc's now-widow is duped by anarchist Tom Ossipon, who steals all her money, is rank with irony. The best chapter, though, the one around which the high reputation of the book revolves, is chapter 11: from its \\"She [Winnie] knows everything now\\" to Verloc's stabbing at the end, it ranks as one of Conrad's most suspenseful and dramatic chapters in all his books. [Alfred Hitchcock made use of the incidents in this work for his movie \\"Sabotage,\\" though Hitch changed the ending and moved the time of the story up to the 1930s.]"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"....skip this one. Conrad takes perverse pleasure in his chapter-long descriptions and flowery phrases. The plot makes some guest appearances, but not many. Trust me, there's better use for your money elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Have you ever listened to a conversation and had no idea who or what the people are talking about? This is the feeling i got from this book. The complete frustration of not QUITE understanding who was who, or what was going on. Conrad's style of language really doens't help matters. Some classic books get better with time (Great Expectations, for example) but this just seems dated and from another, rather confusing period of history."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Conrad has an absolutely marvelous prose style (although sometimes dense) and his narrative skills are of the highest order. Technically this novel is brilliant; not a single line in it is muddled. Every character was sharply crafted and London has never been more vividly described. I have often heard Hemingway labeled as the century's first great prose stylist, but how could anyone forget Conrad? The only flaw with this book to me was the overuse of foreshadowing; too much was given away too early in the story only to be revealed much later when the reader's patience may have already been exhausted and leading to a winded effect; but the flaws are inconsequential considering Conrad's accomplishment. Many reviewers here claim this book was boring but I think they only need read Conrad's prose slowly, savor and visualize it, and realize it is one of the great works of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"In this masterpiece Conrad has engendered an entirely new genre. True, it has some affinities with Wilkie Collins, Dostoevsky, even with James's &quot;Princes Casamassima&quot;. But Conrad's famous &quot;irony&quot; (better, cynicism masking nihilist despair), a mordant eating out his &quot;characters&quot; (too strong a word for pre-Kafkan zombies-even Professor is an example of one-dimensional pathetic fanatic with zero potentiality for inner freedom) has given birth to Greene, LeCarre, Koestler and numerous lower-rank authors trekking the &quot;Conradland&quot; of shadowy terrorists, failed assassinations, betrayed spies and hidden manipulators.In my opinion, one trait is especially pungent in this work: the absence of humanity. From cover to cover, the novel is saturated with disgust: disgust towards fat people (Mr &amp; Mrs Verloc (the latter being a cruel joke on Conrad's own wife, Jessie)), stupid anarchists, pompous bureaucrats, &quot;efficient&quot; but servile inspectors.&quot;The Secret Agent&quot; is incredibly modern, penetrating (despite, or because of &quot;impenetrable mystery&quot;-see what this phrase stands for), detached and....icily cold."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Anarchism was a big thing in the late 19th century and early 20th century (you can compare it with the situation of Islamic terrorism today). Several kings, presidents and other politicians were killed by anarchists during that epoch (US president McKinley and Austrian Empress Sissi was among them). Conrad's book is one of the best novels about the anarchist world, dealing with an anarchist cell working in London during that time. The protagonist, Verloc, is the head of the cell and also an informer for the police and an agent for an unnamed foreign country (thus, he is a triple agent) and his attempt to blow up the Greenwich observatory ends tragically for an unwitting member of his family. Note: Conrad amusingly says in the prologue that he never personally met an anarchist himself, but the main story is based on real events he probably picked up from the press of the time."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"This is an excellent introduction to Conrad - a bit confusing and dense in places, but not nearly as much so as his better-known Heart of Darkness, and with a situation that most people can more easily fathom. The diversity of characterization and the clash of various fanatical ideals makes for a good storyline.That being said, it is a pity that the publishers of this edition decided to include an essay, bound at the front of the book, that totally gives away the only 'plot twist' worthy of the name in the entire story. This 'foreward' should have been placed after the text. Buy this book, but in a different edition."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"I happened to read this book about six months after reading Chesterton's 'The Man Called Thursday'. There are some similarities that spoiled the Conrad for me - especially because Conrad's treatment of the opening did not have the surreal and creative flair of Chesterton (the end wasn't as inventive either, but that's another story).Both of these books are about anarchists and yet anarchism as a philosophy is not justified at all - I suspect anarchism was the unjustifiable terror of the time just as communism was to become later. And yet this did disappoint me. About twenty years ago I read 'The Syndic' by CM Kornbluth and in this there is a great rationale for anarchism (not that I think Kornbluth was an anarchist). It got me reading some of the great anarchist writers - especially Emma Goldman and Peter Kropotkin. For me, one of the greatest benefits of reading is broadening one's point of view, entertaining new ideas. So Conrad and Chesterton both disappointed me in having characters I found it difficult to identify with because they espoused philosophies without in any way supoporting them for the reader. (Another more recent example for anarchism is Ursula le Guin's 'The Dispossessed.)Having said that, I found reading 'The Secret Agent' a labour, just as other reviewers reported. It is so unlike Conrad's other books (although some of his novels I have found difficult to read, but not for reasons of triviality as this one seems to show). But around page 100 things change. The remainder of the novel I wouldn't have missed for anything. It's the great luminous writing of 'Victory', 'Heart of Darkness', 'Lord Jim' and 'Almayer's Folly'. Quite suddenly the characters are engaging in a very personal way, and the events of the novel are surprising and revealing."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Its important to remember, that the novel is written at a time when democracy is not exactly well spread through Europe, and most of the continental countries are having a hard time trying to understand why the English shelter anarchists and Marxists and even allow them to publish their works.No doubt that Conrad met a few of them in literary or social circles and found them amusing in their contradictions. That is why the \\"criminal mastermind\\" Mr. Verloc is portrayed more as a very lazy bourgeois than someone whose mind is set upon creating the conditions to change society.On the other hand, Conrad is faithful to its belief on the perennial existence if not preeminence, of a dark side of the soul in everyone. So the atmosphere in which every character dwells is gloomy, sad and purposefully shows that no motivation is really beyond a person's self interest, even if you claim that you are doing it for God and country, to save the planet or your mother."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The plot of this story would be perhaps too sardonic, too morose, for today's mystery novel. This is not a running-full-of-action agent who gooses the reds and chases after or is chased by the bad guys. This is not Fleming, this is not Clancy, this is not today's secret agent. Instead, it delves into the introspection and seriously saddened life of the protagonist - Mr. Verloc, the secret agent.Verloc may be an agent - but he is not sauvoir d'affaire. He is laughed at by his peers, is thought of as harmless by the police, and is being used by both. When provoked to do something substantial, he sets about to blow up an observatory. It fails. Instead, his accomplice is blown to smithereens and that sets about the chase and his unreproachable demise.Eventually, we learn he has not only failed with explosives, but his failure has alienated him from the reds and the police. But, there is worse yet - his failure alienates him from his wife of 7 years and her family. This is a failure of mammoth proportions, as he not only ends up dying for his failures, but takes down his brother-in-law and wife with him.Conrad's writing style may be out of date. It is difficult for today's reader as his book was written 100 years ago. Conrad's use of the English language often entails his deliberate overuse so that you know that he knows more of it than you know. Polish born boy, and forced to speak Russian by the occupiers, he eventually moved to England to write in its language. He is a foreigner who writes in a foreign language -- a deficit he well overcame.In one passage he acknowledges foreigners' fluency when he writes, \\"Verloc . . . had come to the conclusion that some foreigners speak better English than the native.\\" But, Conrad's syrupy use of English can effectively ruin some of the dialogue - for instance when Verloc is interrogated by the police, a low officer laughs at Verloc, the alleged anarchist, for being married as the concept of marriage to anarchists is an \\"apostasy.\\" Apostasy? Name one of today's cops who uses the word! Name anyone!Reagrdless of the writing style being dated, this book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent, is one of my favorite books because it has a great plot, a fascinating ending, and skillful characterization. However, the vocabulary is advanced, which may make the plotline seem tangled and obscure. I would advise that you keep a dictionary by your side, both to understand all the details and subtleties of the story and to learn a lot of new words. That being said, a lot of people will find this novel too slow and boring. Unfortunately, many people today are too lazy to know their language to the full extent that Conrad did. And just think--English was his second language! But anyway, if you're up for a challenging but richly rewarding read, check out The Secret Agent. Unless you get bored by good writing, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Set in London sometime in the 1880, the story is about a &#8220;secret agent&#8221; Adolf Verloc, who works for a right wing secret organization that is determine to expose and exterminate the anarchists and terrorists beginning to populate the major metropolitan areas of Europe. Mr. Verloc operates a porn shop, is married, and is the appointed head of a terrorist cell in London. He is also an agent of the police.He is commissioned by his right wing masters to blow up Greenwich Observatory (a mindless act of pure terrorism) designed to inspire the police around the world to round up and imprison radicals. He carries out his act of espionage but unintentionally kills his witless brother in law. When his wife Winnie finds out that her brother is dead (killed by her husband) she stabs Adolf then commits suicide. Sounds like a typical Conrad novel.There is lots in this novel that will remind you of the cabal in the white house during 9/11."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Joseph Conrad's \\"The Secret Agent\\" is a very different type of novel from most everything else Conrad wrote. It's a spy novel and set in England, not at sea, like so many other Conrad works, or in a tropical climate. I have read that Conrad says the novel is about Winnie Verloc, the wife of the secret agent, Mr. Verloc. I have to agree. She's the most interesting character in the novel in my opinion and probably the only one that people can sympathize with, other than her brother Stevie. The story is interesting, but you have to be patient because it jumps around alot, and as with many other Conrad novels, there's so much description between the dialogue and action. Overall, it's a very good spy/action novel."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"At first I thought this was a serious book about Anarchist revolutionaries, and Verloc's duties as a secret agent. Then it all goes wrong and you realize that the whole book, about 200 pages of reading was all kind of a big joke on Mr.Verloc, and anarchists in general. Its worth a read."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"I must admit to having a love-hate relationship with Conrad. His novels possess an undeniable power, and I have read each of his novels with the utmost fascination. Yet, I can't say that actually reading a Conrad novel is an enjoyable experience. His vision of the world is a tad too bleak, his confidence in human nature way too despairing, and the overall atmosphere way too gloomy for me to derive pleasure from reading Conrad.Although not set in one of the exotic locales which we associate with Conrad, THE SECRET AGENT is both one of his finest and one of his most typical novel, with one exception. In most of his books, the plot revolves around situations which inevitably lead to tragedy and disaster, but in which a central character is often able to somewhat redeem his life by an act or acts of personal heroism. The feel is usually quite similar to that of Norse mythology, in which Gods and men will struggle at the end of the world against the forces of evil, but will lose. The challenge is to oppose the evil heroically. But in THE SECRET AGENT, the central character is anything but heroic, and is in no truly important way opposed to the powers of evil.I have to admit to being perplexed by claims that Conrad was a great prose stylist. I will confess that I find that with his prose, the sum is greater than its parts. If you examine his sentences, he is without question, along with Theodore Dreiser, perhaps the worst constructor of sentences in the English language. Perhaps having learned English only after reaching adulthood is to blame. Many of his sentences are grammatically opaque. Frequently his sentences are incomplete or badly constructed. Almost never does Conrad seem to sense the rhythm of the language. Perhaps this lack of rhythm is what many mistake for a great prose style. I have spent a fair amount of time in the secondary literature on Conrad, and so far I have yet to find a single Conrad scholar who felt that he possessed a command of the English language. The consensus seems to be that he is a great writer despite his struggle with the English language, not because of any mastery he possesses over it.Overall, I hold this to be one of Conrad's most important novels, on a par with UNDER WESTERN EYES, HEART OF DARKNESS, VICTORY, and NOSTROMO.Ironically, Alfred Hitchcock filmed a version of THE SECRET AGENT, but it was not the movie with the same name. Hitchcock's THE SECRET AGENT was actually based on Maugham's Ashenden stories (which Maugham says were based upon his own experiences as a secret agent; he claims to have been one of the more inept agents in history). Hitchcock's version of the Conrad novel was SABOTAGE. Hitchcock changed many of the details, and his religious beliefs never allowed him to engage in the despair one finds in Conrad (Hitchcock was a devout Catholic). Although his version resembles Conrad, it isn't a very faithful adaptation either in plot or in spirit."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Perhaps \\"Verloc\\" wasn't even his name, perhaps he wasn't English or French either. He didn't stand out, he didn't attract attention. In Conrad's day, the phrase, \\"banality of evil\\" had not been invented, but the novel he wrote illustrates it brilliantly. A vague man of no strong personality or convictions, but of lazy temperament, winds up as a German agent in London, dealing with all the anarchist/radical leftist groups that existed there in the 1880s. This man works as an informer for the British police as well. He runs a pornography shop as a cover and lives with a pretty, but unexceptional woman of lumpen background who finds him a secure, reliable partner. She has a weak, mentally-retarded brother. Verloc's German \`handler' demands a particular outrage to force the British government, by dint of subsequent public opinion, to crack down on terrorist/anarchist groups and individuals that found Britain a convenient refuge from severe repression on the Continent. After great strain, Verloc manages an effort at the required \\"outrage\\", but with dire consequences for the family. Nobody gets out of this alive. The British police, in the persons of two officers of very differing backgrounds and mentalities, soon piece together what has happened.As in other of Conrad's novels like \\"The Heart of Darkness\\", \\"The Secret Sharer\\", and \\"Almayer's Folly\\", the main beauty of THE SECRET AGENT is its psychological sophistication. Each character, even minor ones, is drawn in brilliantly accurate strokes, so that the reader understands the inevitability of the actions of each.....the plodding, scheming Verloc, the unquestioning wife, the lost, pathetic brother-in-law, the sharp man of action (Chief Inspector), and the more thoughtful, careful Assistant Commissioner, not to mention a society lady, and an assortment of crazy, lecherous terrorists who can't organize their way out of a paper bag. Conrad is no doubt one of the greatest writers in English. This novel of the seedy side of Victorian London---not by dint of fast moving action...is one of his best. This is not a beach read. It is a classic of world literature."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The Secret Agent by Joseph Conrad is an extremely well written book. He masters the English language brilliantly, even though he grew up in Poland and not in an English speaking country. It is a difficult book to read, but once you get into it, there is no problem. The author's way of describing several situations at the same time, is done very well. Conrad's way of describing the characters makes them come alive."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"It is amazing how well this terribly story fits into nowadays reality. Terrorism, with all its hideous irrationality and contradictions is masterly depicted by Conrad. And so is human nature. Every single character is treated here as the center of his/her own universe, which results in wonderful psychological creations. From the very Mr Verloc -the secret agent- to an apparently insignificant cabman, all of them are given here the opportunity of redemption, since they are so humanly feeble. The author reaches this goal by arriving at numerous standstills where action seems to be suspended in the air while characters are sunk in deep reflection -or else are aided by Conrad's voice on account of their difficulties to express themselves.The whole story is encircled in a gloomy atmosphere that turns to be very difficult to escape from. It starts with Mr Verloc's visit to \\"the embassy\\" where he is assigned a mission to \\"justify\\" his work as secret agent. Being scornfully treated, he finds himself involved in a plot that leads him to take actions he would have never think of...wouldn't he...? Thus, his initial attempt to blow up the Greenwich observatory ends up in a dreadful tragedy whose unspeakable consequences had not been meant by his author.Although not easy to follow for the non-native reader, which is my case, this appalling and great story is really worthwhile. I am glad I have made the effort."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Rarely does a book build on itself as well as Secret Agent. The book starts modestly, but builds in structure, language and plot to a dramatic and heart rending climax. A gem."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"This novel was confusing in the beginning. The characters take some time getting used to who is who. Mr. Verloc is one of the main characters in the beginning, but slowly drifts away from even being mentioned at all. Don't be confused , because in the end everything will come together and you'll see exactly why these things happened.It makes you think about what is going to happen through the whole thing! I have to say, the end left me spellbound."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"It strikes me as absurd that anyone could find this novel as anything less than brilliant. Conrad gives us at least seven wonderfully drawn, human characters drawn together in a plot that seethes with moral contradictions in a book that is less than 250 pages long. There are many praised novelists that blather on twice as long and say far less (like Ayn Rand, for instance).The other criticism voiced here is that his language is tangled and he describes too much. Yes, his language takes some getting used to, but remember he was writing for an age without TV. Moreover, his descriptions are more precise than people give him credit for. That precision is part of what makes his characters so human.This book was on the Modern Library's 100 best novels of the 20th century and deserved so. Give it a chance, read it carefully and you'll find a wonderful book about the human condition."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"For the most part, I think the &quot;classics&quot; are held in high regard for good reason. However, I must disagree with those reviewers who seem to think that anyone who found this book unsatisfying must be a dullard who is too used to watching TV to enjoy a well-written, subtle book.As a 40-year-old who considers himself fairly well-read and enjoys everything from Dickens to Shakespeare to Ayn Rand, I think I am completely within my rights to classify &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; as boring. The plot is NOT complex as some have written and I enjoy nothing more than long, well-written descriptions. In fact, I thought Conrad did a beautiful job of describing London and the people who inhabited it. But the fact remains that very little happens in this book and a great deal of it you can see coming from a mile away (perhaps due to Conrad's fine use of foreshadow). Owing to the theme of isolation and lack of communication betweens the denizens of &quot;modern society&quot; there is very little dialogue. Conrad uses heavy irony and sarcasm when describing the thoughts of certain characters, especially Mr. Verloc. However, I wouldn't call this &quot;funny&quot; and I didn't see as much &quot;humor&quot; in the book as some other reviewers found.When Conrad comes to the thoughts and sayings of the real anarchists in the book, it reminded me a little of Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;, which was a great book and story, marred by the socialist diatribe that covers the last 50 pages or so. Reading these (thankfully) brief conversations between the Professor and Ossipon, I felt as bored as when reading some political tract.There are very few sympathetic characters in the book. So many are obese, as though they are insulated (isolated) from others by their layers of fat. Others are grotesque (the cab driver, Karl Yundt). But the fact that they are unsympathetic or unappealing is not the problem with the book. To me, they were uninteresting.It all boils down to what I say about some forms of music: I find Reggae boring, because it all sounds kind of the same to me; but I love Blues. Well, a lot of the Blues may sound the same, but it so happens that I like the sound. Maybe I just don't like the way Conrad writes. With a nod to the other reviewers who think that the MTV generation isn't capable of liking this book, I know I would have found it even more boring had I read it in high school"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"This novel can be read as a psychological character study, as a political critique, or as a thriller. Each way it is thoroughly satisfying. Although it was written in 1904, its political premise closely parallels the situation the United States has been in since September 11, 2001. The ethically dubious \\"anti-terrorist\\" tactics of the foreign embassy that protagonist Verloc works for are essentially the \\"anti-terrorist\\" tactics of a certain 21st-century un-elected American president.This novel has twice been adapted into film, by the bye. There is a bowdlerized, squeamish, and ineffectual 1937 Alfred Hitchcock version, and there is a faithful and brilliant 1996 version starring Bob Hoskins, Patricia Arquette, Gerard Depardieu, and Robin Williams with music by Philip Glass.Re: \\"If you examine his sentences, he [Joseph Conrad] is without question, along with Theodore Dreiser, perhaps the worst constructor of sentences in the English language.\\"Presumably, the author of this remark is not familiar with the works of pulp science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, for example, and has perhaps read no other newspaper but the New York Times for the past decade. In any case, I found \\"The Secret Agent\\" particularly well written, evocative, and easy to read. There were only three sentences in the entire novel that struck me as awkward, confusing, or unidiomatic. The one I remember is a line of dialogue: \\"Have you been waiting long here?\\" A 21st-century American would say, \\"Have you been waiting here long?\\". Possibly I've caught Conrad thinking in his native Polish here (or in his here native Polish), but for aught I know a Englishman in 1904 would have put it as Conrad has his character put it. In any case, the solecism, if solecism it be, is easily forgiven."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Joseph Conrad's 1907 novel, \\"The Secret Agent,\\" is a difficult little book. It's story is difficult and its characters are largely unpleasant. By difficult and unpleasant, I don't mean to say the novel isn't any good. Far from it. These terms I mean to denote the impenetrability of motive, of sense. The story of a group of anarchists, police, and a family caught in the middle in late Victorian England, \\"The Secret Agent\\" is far from Conrad's subtitle, \\"A Simple Tale\\". The novel, for me, is about hatred, mistrust, and breakdowns in communication.\\"The Secret Agent\\" begins early one morning in 1886. Mr. Verloc, a secret agent for a foreign embassy, who lives in a small apartment with his wife Winnie, her mentally ill brother, Stevie, and their mother. Keeping an eye on a particularly ineffectual anarchist community in London, Verloc pretends to be an anarchist revolutionary himself. As the novel opens, Verloc is called in by his new employer Mr. Vladimir. Vladimir, discontented with the apparent lack of production out of his secret agent, and even further with the lackadaisical English police, wants Verloc to act as an agent provocateur, and arrange for a bomb to spur the English government to crack down on the legal system. As religion and royalty are, according to Vladimir, no longer strong enough emotional ties to the people, an attack must be made upon \\"Science,\\" and he selects the Greenwich Observatory as the appropriate site for action.The novel introduces us to a range of wholly unsympathetic characters. The anarchist collective roughly consists of \\"Doctor\\" Ossipan, who lives off his romantic attachments to women barely able to take care of themselves; \\"The Professor,\\" explosives expert, who is so insecure, he is perpetually wired with a detonator in case he is threatened by police capture; and Michaelis, the corpulent writer, engaged upon his autobiography after a mitigated sentence in prison. Conrad's portrayal of this cabal is wholly ludicrous - a band of anarchists that are better at talking than doing anything to achieve their undeveloped goals. No better than these are their nemeses, the London police, here represented by Inspector Heat, who identifies so much with the common criminal element, you'd think he was one himself; and the Assistant Commissioner, who is so dissatisfied with his desk job, that he would do anything to get out on the streets - but not so ambitious as to upset his nagging wife and her social circle.At the diffuse center, if it has one, of Conrad's novel, is the Verloc family, held together by ties no less tenuous and flimsy than any other community in the work. Verloc and his wife communicate and interact by monosyllables and the broken bell of their front door. Winnie Verloc knows nothing of her husband's secret life, and tries desperately to prevent him from taking offence at having to support her infirmed mother and practically useless brother by forming a society of admiration amongst them for her \\"good\\" husband. Lack of real communication and sympathy amongst the Verloc household is at the heart of Conrad's satire against late Victorian England.As the Greenwich Bomb Outrage is an early, but central moment in the novel, it would not be spoiling anything to tell you that this is where Conrad really earns his paycheck. His mode of bringing all the disparate characters and subplots of the novel together throughout the rest of the book is both reminiscent of and radically undercutting the influence of Charles Dickens in Conrad's social critique. \\"The Secret Agent\\" is a clever novel, but exceptionally bleak. Thinking about other early 1900's British novels like Samuel Butler's \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" or Virginia Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" Conrad's \\"The Secret Agent\\" is another of these works where a British writer tries to assess the state of the Empire in the aftermath of Victoria's demise - examining past follies to be overcome, and peering without optimism at what lies ahead."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"The major event of the plot is an anarchist conspiracy to blow up the Greenwich Observatory. An &quot;agent provocateur&quot;, Verloc, is the man caught in the middle, a pawn in a game played by a high-ranking Russian diplomat, a leading police inspector and, on the other side, the sometimes clumsy and ineffectual anarchists. One example of the characterisation immediately sticks in the mind of the reader, long after completing the novel. It is the character of the mysterious Professor, a misanthrope and angel of destruction, who supplies Verloc with the explosives needed to carry out the plot and who embodies nihilism at its most extreme. Joseph Conrad is known for his dense and sometimes contorted prose, and the style of &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; is no exception. Though no great storyteller, he nevertheless demonstrates that he is a psychologist of the first order, in his searching analyses of character and motive. The novel is partly a domestic tragedy, a highly innovative and experimental early Modernist work, a darkly humorous tale with lashings of &quot;schadenfreude&quot; and an esponage thriller that anticipates, in many ways, the best and most recent examples of the genre."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"At the end of the novel Comrade Ossipon says, \\"An impenetrable mystery...this act of madness or despair.\\" He is thinking about what Winnie has done. He cannot fathom it. The novel is unfathomable too; dense, twisting, sordid, ironic. There are some great scenes in this book. At the end, Verloc thinks Winnie truly loves him when in fact she doesn't, and never has; she had always loved the butcher. The horse scene where Stevie pets the old mistreated horse also comes to mind.The only character Conrad has sympathy for is Stevie, and he gets blown to bits. Stevie is the only one who can truly show love. Ironically, he's mentally retarded. Everyone else is manipulative and calculating.The book was published in 1906, some 50 or so years after Das Capital, The Communist Manifesto, etc. were published. Europe was swarming with \\"revolutionists\\" and \\"anarchists.\\" Journalists were writing about \\"the people\\" and \\"the masses\\" and \\"social justice.\\" Conrad was no dummy. He analyzed what was going on around him in England, France, Germany, etc., then he wrote this book as an \\"answer\\" to the socialists, anarchists. This is probably one of the most supremely ironical novels ever written. Stevie's demise is meaningless; there is absolutely no sense or purpose to it. The anarchist world in the novel is meaningless, peopled by sordid, parasitic rabble-rousers and journalists. Even Heat, the Assistant Commissioner, Sir Ethelred, the Assistant Commissioner's wife, the lady patroness, the \\"good side\\"--none of them without guilt. They too are schemers, calculating their social advancement. Like a coin, they are just the flip side of the socialits'. The whole society is corrupt, socialist and police alike. In repugnance, Conrad just blows up the whole damn mess. And how ironically does he do it! He blows up the only redeeming thing in that society, a retarded boy who loves without calculation, who goes into emotional fits when witnessing any gratuitous cruelty--cruelty even shown to animals. Dark novel. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Joseph Conrad's novel, \\"The Secret Agent\\" is based on a real-life incident that occurred in Greenwich in 1894. Conrad's novel is built around the known facts of that case and concerns an agent who works for the Russian embassy. The agent, the anarchist Verloc, was well respected when he worked for Baron Stott-Wartenheim, but times have changed. When Verloc is summoned to the embassy, he receives a cold reception from his new superior, Vladimir. Vladimir tells Verloc that he's going to have to start producing or he'll lose the wages he receives. A humiliated Verloc is shocked when he receives orders to blow up Greenwich Observatory. Verloc has been living a double game for some time, and he also provides information to the British police. He married Winnie, the daughter of his landlady after Winnie's relationship with another man collapsed. Verloc and Winnie now run a small shop together, and Winnie is completely ignorant of Verloc's political activities. She's quite aware that several shady characters come and go, but she doesn't ask questions.Winnie's emotionally damaged brother, Stevie also lives with the Verlocs. While Verloc imagines that Winnie loves him for himself, the truth is that Winnie married him for stability. By marrying Verloc, Winnie thinks she's assuring a safe home for Stevie, and so for her the marriage is a silent, unspoken pact. Verloc provides a home, and she, in return, is a good, uncomplaining wife.When tragedy strikes in the most unexpected way, the Verloc household is thrown into turmoil. Conrad's novel explores the theme of the individual vs. political beliefs through the tragedy of his characters. Most of the characters within the novel are unpleasant--for Verloc, the 'cause' is secondary to his own skin, but he's willing to sacrifice another to maintain the status quo. Verloc's fellow conspirators are shown to be dismissive of the human race, and careless of any damage caused to the individual (except themselves). Everyone uses each other, and there's a hierarchy even in the police force that promotes use of individuals as long as they provide information. The two 'nicest' characters in the novel are also those who possess no political ideals whatsoever--Winnie and her brother, Stevie. These siblings are bound by the memory of an abusive childhood--Winnie's main desire in life is to protect Stevie, and he can't stand violence or cruelty in any form. These two innocents meet a horrible fate as the result of the 'high' political ideals of others.The novel is not an easy read. I found the story a little difficult to get into until the drama picked up--this was largely due to Conrad's writing style that is often quite stilted by its excessive verbosity. However, that said, once the drama unfolded, I was unable to put the book down until I finished the final page. The characterizations of Verloc and Winnie are fascinating, dark and bleak. Married for years, the events of one day show how little they understand one another. Conrad considers the fate of humankind by setting a human tragedy in the heart of a political ideal, and he suggests that \\"the sound of exploding bombs\\" becomes lost next to a tragedy involving a handful of insignificant people. But the fate of individuals \\"as numerous as the sands of the seashore\\" fades into obscurity within a few short years. Is a cause ever worth sacrificing lives for?--displacedhuman"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"This is a grim, gritty, cynical tale set in the world of the anarchists and secret agents around the start of the 20th century. There are no blind romantics, no overwhelming causes, and no anarchistic politics. As is often the case with Conrad, this is a story about people, people in an exotic world.The setting is London, the crime an attempt to blow up the Greenwich Observatory. The motives are far from pure: money, careerism, hack value, a peaceful mind. Mrs. Verloc, an anarchist's wife, is at the center of the tale. As Conrad tells us, and shows us repeatedly, she is not a woman to look beneath the surface of things, but she is a woman of some depth.The story is sad. It is a tragedy, and the ending seems inevitable given the players Conrad has set in motion. This is probably appropriate given the subject matter.The writing is excellent. The tale is well told. I would have given it a full five stars save for the sheer grimness of the tale. If you are a reader who gives extra points to depressing stories, you should consider this ranking a five."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Joseph Conrad's novel \\"The Secret Agent\\" is referred to in many places as the prototype of today's political and espionage thrillers. Except that it's not really much of a political thriller at all. The agent of the title, Mr. Verloc, has grown complacent in his role as an informant to a foreign embassy in London and is pressured by his superiors into pulling off a shocking act of terrorism in order to prove his worth to his colleagues. The novel is mostly about the domestic repercussions that occur when things go badly wrong.This novel effectively toys with the reader's expectations, but it does so in a somewhat dubious way. Conrad introduces several characters and sets the stage for what appears to be a thriller with political overtones: several people have a vested interest (personally or politically) in the outcome of Mr. Verloc's actions. However, none of these characters ends up being of any importance, and nearly all of them drop out of the narrative altogether. The novel ends up being much more about Mrs. Verloc than it does about anyone else (including Mr. Verloc). This effectively pulls the rug out from under the reader's feet, but I would have received more satisfaction if Conrad had been able to keep suspense alive while still juggling a larger cast of characters. Maybe I should have been ready for this narrative sleight of hand, given the novel's subtitle, \\"A Simple Tale,\\" but as it was the novel didn't take focus until it was 3/4 over and by that time too late for me to shift my sympathies.What the novel does well, however, is to give its reader a deliciously tangible sense of the seedy underworld at play in late 19th-century London. Conrad personifies the mist, funk and squalor of London until the city itself nearly becomes a character in the action. Also, for anyone who maybe knows Conrad for being an obtuse, thick writer (especially if your previous knowledge of him comes from reading \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and \\"Lord Jim\\"), \\"The Secret Agent\\" is refreshingly straight forward."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"I don't want to in any way be condescending, either to those who will read this review, or to those marvelous writers who have gone before, but I do think modern readers do not always approach older writing in the proper frame of mind. We need to remember that the only mass entertainment they had was novels, and the pace, because that's all there was in those days, is understandably slower. What modern writers would dismiss in a line or two might take a page or more for people like Conrad and Dickens. But, oh my, the places you can go, if you just consent to be seated in one of those old-time carriages!THE SECRET AGENT is certainly a case in point. Like all Conrad--for my tastes, at least--he was a bit difficult to read in places. Conrad really loaded up a sentence. But when he's on his form, he writes some of the best sentences ever crafted in English Literature.Other reviewers have given many of the plot points, so I won't repeat them here. Let me just say that I just finished reading the novel last night, and many of those images are still with me--epecially those in the last section of the novel.It was tough sledding in the beginning. Quite frankly, I found myself wondering why some consider this novel to be one of Conrad's finest, but there were enough of Conrad's marvelous sentences to keep me in the book. Then I got to the part where Winnie learned of her brother Stevie's fate, and Mr. Verloc's role in it, Verloc being Winnie's husband. From then to the end of the book it was a ride in a rocket! Conrad's depiction of Winnie's feelings, culminating in her own ghastly actions, must surely rank among the very finest scenes in literature. It was just astounding, especially when one considers that Conrad wrote at a time when women's thoughts and feelings were considered trivial, if they were thought of at all. But those passages that revolved around Winnie's reaction to Stevie's death could have been written yesterday, in the sense of getting down to how a woman in her place would feel. As for the sentences... well, only the masters wrote at that level, and Joseph Conrad is certainly one of these.If you're one of those avid readers who takes the time to read reviews like this, read THE SECRET AGENT. You won't be sorry you did."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"As I read through the &quot;critical&quot; comments of high school and college students who are assigned to read the works of Joseph Conrad then fuss and fume at the very idea of it, I find myself deeply disappointed by their lack of appreciation for the subtleties of great literature. They have little time or patience to devote to an author who provides his readers with so much vivid description, building toward a stunning and inevitable climax. In the &quot;Secret Agent,&quot; Conrad points to the frailties of the human condition, the large forces of nature at work that conspire against the simple and downtrodden man trapped by his own cunning devices. Mr. Verloc is a simple, plodding peasant; and just why he embraces the anarchistic cause is never made clear to the reader, but no matter. He is trapped in a sterile nightmarish world where the idealists and the self-proclaimed revolutionaries are as morally bankrupt and empty of human emotion as the system they purport to overthrow. Conrad's characterizations are brilliant. His use of dialog and description, a hallmark of the early twentieth century realists, and the grim ending to this novel is a masterpiece of understatement. It is too bad that fine old classics of literature like this one and the more famous Conrad novella &quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; must be subjected to the vapidity and sophomoric opinions of a generation of students weaned on MTV, the Simpsons, and thirty-second TV soundbytes."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"In _The Secret Agent_, Conrad takes an incisive look at post-Victorian England.Even as it emerged from the Industrial Revolution as Mistress of the World - the last and the greatest of the old, geographically-powerful empires, and one on which the sun never set - Conrad reveals the British culture to be at a cross-roads with itself. Morally and ideologically bankrupt, struggling to come to grips with its deep-seated past even as it looked despairingly into the future, this England is a mix of characters straight from a Dickens novel living in a world of drudgery and despair worthy of Kafka.The story focuses on Verloc, a secret agent who has outlived his time. Included in the narrative, as well, is the circle of naive and outdated visionaries and utopians with whom he comes into contact. The plot follows Verloc's stated task - the planting of a bomb at the Greenwich Observatory, a metaphor relating to the struggle of science versus ideology that cannot be missed. The end result bespeaks not the superiority of science over ideals, or vice versa, so much as it testifies to human weakness and fickleness.Above all, Conrad has written a psychological novel - a broad narrative that examines human motive and methodology against the backdrop of a city that hangs stubbornly on to the mores of the late Victorian Age. More poignant still, its citizens seek to find the meaning of their existence beyond the impersonal, mechanical demands of their place in society - and failing that, they seek to inject their own meaning and sense of purpose into the world around them. Accordingly, Conrad's analysis of the masks people wear is masterful and gripping.Seemingly rather pointless as far as plot development is concerned, _The Secret Agent_ was never meant to be a thriller and should not be read as such. Instead, it is a brilliantly ironic and incisive look at human nature and the lengths we will go to to preserve our perceived purpose in life. Read it and you will come away with a new sense of perception not only of yourself and those around you but also of the reality you live in.- Benjamin Gene Gardner"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"It is amazing how well this terribly story fits into nowadays reality. Terrorism, with all its hideous irrationality and contradictions is masterly depicted by Conrad. And so is human nature. Every single character is treated here as the center of his/her own universe, which results in wonderful psychological creations. From the very Mr Verloc -the secret agent- to an apparently insignificant cabman, all of them are given here the opportunity of redemption, since they are so humanly feeble. The author reaches this goal by arriving at numerous standstills where action seems to be suspended in the air while characters are sunk in deep reflection -or else are aided by Conrad's voice on account of their difficulties to express themselves.The whole story is encircled in a gloomy atmosphere that turns to be very difficult to escape from. It starts with Mr Verloc's visit to \\"the embassy\\" where he is assigned a mission to \\"justify\\" his work as secret agent. Being scornfully treated, he finds himself involved in a plot that leads him to take actions he would have never think of...wouldn't he...? Thus, his initial attempt to blow up the Greenwich observatory ends up in a dreadful tragedy whose unspeakable consequences had not been meant by his author.Although not easy to follow for the non-native reader, which is my case, this appalling and great story is really worthwhile. I am glad I have made the effort."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Terrorism is not new. Conrad shows us the mind of a terrorist and the planning behind attacks with a horrifying clarity."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"As a die-hard Conrad fan, I was disappointed by The Secret Agent, which seemed to try too hard to be ironic. Conrad is best in character studies, such as Lord Jim, and this plunge into political satire does not suit him. I love to make fun of socialists and anarchists as much as the next person (since, you know, they believe the same things when their ideologies are contradictory), and Conrad really wants us to feel contempt for the characters. Mostly, however, I felt indifference. There are some witticisms in here, and I enjoyed Stevie, the &quot;slow&quot; brother of Mrs. Verloc. Overall, however, Conrad was best at sea. Everyone should read Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim, and if you appreciate those, try Chance and Victory. But don't look to this book for an accurate or flattering representation of Conrad."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"I have read most of the previous reviews and, as always, they are generally wide-ranging. This often occurs with authors whose style requires a concerted effort to follow, and Conrad certainly fills that bill here. He is a brilliant writer, but anyone used to Grisham et al. will likely not find this an enjoyable read.I did not mind re-reading a paragraph here and there to make sure I had the gist of the passage. I greatly admired the depth and fullness of his characters, and his messages were clear and well-received. My only problem was that the plot line (which when written may have had a shocking impact) is diminished significantly in our era of nearly everyday terrorism. That is no fault of Conrad's to be sure, but timelessness is one of the marks of truly great literature. It is an element obviously missing in this case."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Based on an actual plot to blow up the Greenwich Observatory, this is one of the first novels to deal with terrorism. A hapless group of anarchists is prodded into the bombing, which destroys them, rather than their intended target.Conrad has created a memorable cast of characters &amp; deftly demonstrates the senseless nature of political violence. But this is a novel whose impact has been dulled by the events of our bloody century. Where once the bombing of Greenwich Observatory would have been a shocking crime, after the assassination attempts on Prime Ministers and other IRA attacks, it seems almost comical.GRADE: B"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"This book is so descriptive that you would fall asleep reading. Everything drags on and on. As a high school student, I wouldn't recommend it. Even though my teacher taught me not to judge a book that has been admired by people for more than a century, Im gonna say it; It's so boring!!!"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Many classics of literature seem destined to be either loved or hated by modern readers, as the many of the surrounding reviews attest. Personally, I fall somewhere in the middle on this one, while I can appreciate the book's satirical qualities and commentary on the ugliness of humanity and a morally bankrupt world, I found it choppy, at times tedious, and only occasionally funny. Conrad helped start the thriller genre (and apparently inspired Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski) with this tale of a small group of ineffectual anarchists and revolutionaries, their pseudo-leader Verlock and his family, and the attempt to destroy the Greenwich Observatory in London. Verlock is a small time pornography dealer who enjoys his uneventful family life as well as his personae as secret agent for a foreign power. His existence is thrown into turmoil when a new Russian control officer orders him to take some action or lose his status (and paycheck) as agent. Unable to convince any of his circle to take action, he rather predictably enlists his mildly retarded brother-in-law to carry a bomb to Greenwich. Conrad based the outlines of his plot on a real-life unsuccessful attempt to blow up the Observatory by a French anarchist, who apparently duped his dimwitted brother-in-law into carrying the bomb, which then exploded prematurely.The story was first published as a serial in the New York weekly Ridgeway's during 1906-07 and did not appear in book form until 1907. Its origin as a serial perhaps accounts for some of the choppiness in pacing, although some of the descriptive sequences are quite nice. The tone throughout is one of despair and bleakness (in this area one can see the seeds of noir style), as Verlock's wife is ensconced in a loveless marriage designed to provide her retarded brother and elderly mother with a stable and secure life. When the bombing goes awry, Conrad's cynical family unit implodes, as betrayals lead to murder and then suicide, the innocents are swept away in a tide of injustice. The story seems self-consciously melodramatic at the end and it's hard to feel any true sense of tragedy."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"Who would have thought the author of Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim could write such a weak novel?

This book, written with the intention of shocking early 20th century Britain, has no charm whatsoever. It does not make up for it in relevence either. In fact I do not believe this story has ever held any relevence to anyone, anywhere.It is a short, clumsy attempt of a story about anarchists and their attempts to upset the establishment. The bomb attack goes wrong and everyone thinks twice about the use of force. Nothing else really happens.It is simply terrible. Thank God it is little more than a short story."},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"don't read it..ok"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","review":"This novel is confusing, melodramatic and contains too many improbable developments.Its main character, Verloc, considers himself as an anarchist, although his role is 'the protection of the social mechanism', because 'protection is the first necessity of opulence and luxury'.As an 'agent provocateur' for a foreign country, he is forced (otherwise he looses his job) to organize a terrorist attack, which should 'waken up the middle classes' against 'unhygienic labour' in Great-Britain.He is also a spy on revolutionary activities of a small club of leftists fanatics (a combination of marxists and anarchists).Conrad's superlative style is everything except subtle: 'the shallow enviousness of unhygienic labour' and 'the poor, pathetically mendacious, miserably authenticated by the horrible breath of cheap rum and soap-suds', seem to contradict a 'bad world for poor people'.The writing is sloppy. One time, an organization is called the Central Red Committee, another time, the International Red Committee. A 'Central' Committee seems rather bizarre for anarchists ('I depend on death, which knows no restraint and cannot be attacked. My superiority is evident.')A dialogue between a police chief and a pure anarchist ('looking for the blow to open the first crack in the great edifice of legal conceptions sheltering the atrocious injustice of society') seems improbable, as well as the short love story between Verloc's wife and another anarchist, at the end.However, certain aspects of the novel are very actual, like the use of 'a weak-minded creature with carefully indoctrinated loyalty and blind docility and devotion', to carry out the fatal terrorist attack. Also actual is the following sentence: 'the existence of secret agents should not be tolerated, as tending to augment the positive dangers of evil'.This book has not the same high standard as Conrad's masterpieces like 'Hearth of Darkness' and 'Lord Jim'.Only for Conrad fans."},{"Title":"Sonnets of David, Book I: A Poetic Paraphrase of Psalms 1-41","review":"Hellam provides an inspiring and insightful re-visit to a familiar text.

The section on jump conditions is a good addition which is not found in many similar books. The last chapter on constitutive relations is really good. Just that chapter is worth the price.There are two things that I did not like from this book. The first one is the author glosses over the Cauchy theorem (traction = stress tensor*normal vec.) by just giving a reference to another book. Come on!!! This is a very important component of stress analysis. He should have derived it in the book. In the later editions he puts it in the appendix and doesn't say anything about that in the main text.

Chadwick covers general continuum mechanics, and takes brief detours into both the solid side and the fluid side, so everyone will get something out of the book. Take note, all you engineers like me: Chadwick lets the physics fall out of the math, as opposed to using math to describe the physics, and in that regard, I find the book very cumbersome.I think this book is best used as a supplement to a course and/or another mechanics book, or a \\"quick reference\\" kind of thing. The discussions are too brief to be of use to the initial student of mechanics. Because the apparent emphasis is on conciseness, you need to read very carefully...and flip back and forth to results in other parts of the book.

The only substantial difference is that, in this version, a separate chapter was given to ennumerating Stalin's victims. In the new edition, Conquest eliminates that chapter and subsumes it into another. Thus where the statistical information on Stalin's victims was once easily accessisible, it's now burried in the text. Why, exactly, Conquest chose to do this is beyond me.he should have stuck with making the few corrections, almost always minor, that the opening of the archives revealed. But publishers like repackaging \\"old\\" books: the money's already invested in the it, thus with no new advance to the author, repackaging a 30 or 40 year old book is very profitable. No wonder the publisher wanted some word to imply an \\"improved\\" book rather than a simple reprint noting the largely cosmetic changes in the text.So, if you can, try to grab a copy of this version.

The studies are heavily laden with intricate formulas that called for far more effort than I could bring myself to expend so as to comprehend them. To get to text that provided a reasonable return for the time and energy it takes to read it required frequent skimming.Probably because I am most interested in what I perceive to be within my own locus of control, Part I entitled \\"Savings Motives\\" (and to a lesser degree Part IV called \\"Empirical Studies of Saving\\") held the most interest for me. Parts II and III included papers on savings that I believe would be of more interest to policymakers and those seeking a macro-economic perspective. Part II is labeled \\"Fiscal Policy and Savings,\\" while Part III is entitled \\"Social Security, Demographics, and Savings.\\"With each study covering a different aspect of how savings are affected by selected variables, the value of this volume to any given reader is not dissimilar to that of a cookbook. Some may find that one or more studies are worth the value of obtaining the book, whereas others may not.

Of special interest is supplemental material assisted by Kate Bennett, a gerontological psychologist who presents and discusses new research with a group of women in Leicester, England. &quot;Alas, Poor Ghost!&quot; concludes with Bennett placing her work in historical context through a discussion of case studies in the history of supernatural belief. &quot;Alas, Poor Ghost!&quot; will prove fascinating, informative, original reading for students of folklore, occultism, metaphysics, cultural traditions and beliefs."},{"Title":"Talking to Your Kids About Sex: A Go Parents! Guide","review":"Written by two authors with no apparent training in this genre specifically, this work overly exaggerates family situations, delivering negative messaging in its examples. It reinforces gender stereotypes, assumes parents are quite prudish at times, and is heterosexist in places. It does have some strengths, however. The work provides sample Q&A, definitions, and suggested activities. It is also good at outlining where a child is at developmentally regarding issues that can come up."},{"Title":"Talking to Your Kids About Sex: A Go Parents!

Easy to read and to reference when the time is right."},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"Just snapped this book up recently at a specialty bookstore &amp; highly recommend it for anyone who is a Marx Brothers fan. Or an Algonquin Round table fan. Or an &quot;Old Hollywood&quot; fan. Anecdotes abound. But woven into the story is that of a diehard Groucho Marx buff who inhabits the tight, peculiar, often sad world of his last few years. Stoliar comes off as a decent guy with his heart in the right place, a relief since Groucho was surrounded by more than a couple of people with selfish ulterior motives towards him in the end. Erin Fleming, Groucho's companion in his last years, is intriguingly revealed as a complex, disturbing madwoman. Painfully sad read, but with the saving graces of humor &amp; insight. Much of this was actually covered in Arthur Marx's book, but check out the different slant! I'm glad I read &amp; own this book. I'll be back at it again."},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"When Steve called and told me that he was finally writing a book about his years with Groucho, I wished him luck and helped with dates and places. I even let him borrow his old letters to me during our college years for specifics. Even though I remember my years with Steve as clearly as if they were yesterday, I must say that the book is riveting -- I just couldn't put it down until I turned the last page. Steve put his heart and soul into this book and I highly recommend it for Marx Brothers fans -- or for anyone who ever had an impossible dream."},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"For Steve Stoliar, life as an insider at the home of Groucho Marx must have seemed like a dream. But unfortunately, it may have just as often have seemed like a nightmare.Stoliar has provided Marx fans with a very rare point of view of what Groucho's last years were like. True, there are other written accounts but few that provide the honesty and sincerity that Stoliar does.I have read this book twice simply because I enjoyed it so much. Stoliar is a very enthusiastic Groucho fan. I got the very real sense that he wants his readers to enjoy the experience of being around the great comic as much as he did. Stoliar's descriptions are so vivid that you can almost picture yourself seated at Groucho's lunch table, listening to his many stories of life in show business.And of course, the final dark days of Groucho's life are also told with great detail. Stoliar was there and witnessed it for himself. I personally admire his honesty in telling the reader of everything that happened.Raised Eyebrows is an interesting and fun read. I would recommend it very highly to any Marx fan. I am proud to have an autographed copy in my home library."},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"&quot;One morning I shot an elephant in my pyjamas. How he got in my pyjamas I don't know&quot;. (Groucho Marx).&quot;Raised Eyebrows&quot; is a fascinating account of life inside the home of Groucho Marx. There are many fine books available about Groucho Marx but this one is different as it deals with Groucho's later years and is written by Steve Stoliar who was a big Marx Brothers fan and by an extraordinary set of circumstances was lucky enough to land a job working for Groucho as his personal secretary and archivist. Even more remarkable was that Stoliar ended up actually living inside Groucho's Beverly Hills home. His main task was to deal with Groucho's fan mail and organise his memorabilia. This gave him the opportunity to study Groucho at close quarters and be present at all the parties, dinners, and other events at the house. He met many of Groucho's celebrity friends including Bob Hope, George Burns, Jack Lemmon, Milton Berle, Mae West, Red Buttons etc. He writes how most of them accepted him and were quite friendly (some might even have thought he was Groucho's grandson!) but just occasionally he was completely ignored by the celebrity guest (read the book to find out more!).&quot;If I hold you any closer I'll be in back of you!&quot;. (Groucho Marx).How Stoliar came to have the job at Groucho's house makes very fascinating reading. He was just a 19 year old college student at UCLA and a big fan of the Marx Brothers when he had the idea to start a campaign to get their 1930 movie &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; re-released. This came to the attention of Groucho's companion and secretary Erin Fleming who phoned Stoliar for more information. A local showing of the film was arranged in Westwood with Groucho in attendance. Fleming kept in touch with Stoliar and eventually the movie was re-released nationwide with enormous success and created renewed interest in the Marx Brothers. Due to his efforts on the campaign and because of his knowledge and enthusiasm for Marx Brothers movies Fleming contacted Stoliar to offer him a job dealing with Groucho's fan mail and correspondence. He immediately accepted but expected to be working in some office building and was overwhelmed when he discovered he would be right there in Groucho's Beverly Hills home. He eventually lived in staying there for over three years.&quot;I never forget a face but in your case I'll make an exception!&quot;. (Groucho Marx).One of the most interesting sections in the book for me was when Stoliar outlined the sometimes stormy relationship between Groucho and Erin Fleming which Stoliar was able to witness first hand. Fleming did a lot for Groucho but was not liked by the family (apart from Zeppo) and she was involved in a long drawn out court battle with Groucho's son Arthur Marx as to who should be declared Groucho's conservator to oversee his money matters. (This was before Groucho's death but when he was very fragile and confined to a wheelchair). The newspapers got onto the story and the headlines came fast and furious with many of Groucho's friends being called to the court to give evidence in favour of Arthur. However, Erin had her supporters too including Groucho's brother Zeppo who testified in court for her. He said that if Erin was taken away from Groucho &quot;it would kill him&quot; and that Erin was &quot;the finest woman in the world&quot;. He had nothing but glowing things to say about Erin and her relationship with Groucho. He thought that Erin was good for Groucho and had prolonged his life. However, another side of the story came to light when a parade of former employees from Groucho's house took the stand. Evidence was given that Erin had treated Groucho badly, had screamed at him using filthy language and had even threatened him physically. Eventually, a compromise was reached with a new conservator being appointed.&quot;Will you marry me? Did he leave you any money? Answer the second question first&quot;. (Groucho Marx).A very entertaining book about an insider's personal look at a Hollywood comedy legend. It is rare to find a book such as this where the author is in such close contact with his subject. It is really quite amazing that an ordinary fan like Steve Stoliar whose only ambition was to meet Groucho Marx and perhaps shake his hand and have a photo taken should spend over three years working and living in Groucho's Beverly Hills home. It certainly gives Stoliar credibility that he was present &quot;on the inside&quot; and therefore able to build up valuable and useful information over a long period of time which has now come to fruition with this book."},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"'Raised Eyebrows' is an excellent overview of the last three years of the life of one of America's cleverest comedians, Groucho Marx. Author, Steve Stoliar, crafts an excellent tale, that reads almost as a novel of fiction, weaving in complex individuals as a person with borderline personality disorder; her employer, an aging individual who realizes his life is slipping; the family and friends and the legal battle that ensues.This is a book to read and learn more of the elderly, for one. I work with a lot of folks who are aging and see so much true in what Stoliar writes. The baby boom generation, I think, needs to be in tune with what awaits them in the future and this is great guidance. Despite was Dennis Hopper might say in a financial commercial, you don't dictate your aging. Coming to terms with aging is a far healthier track to take.Also, this is a very good unintentional study of someone with borderline personality disorder, Groucho's assistant Erin Fleming. These stories are hard to find. Mostly because the people are hard to monitor and those that have such a person around them typically become co-dependent. I was unfortunate to have the experience with my ex-wife and feel bad that anyone has to experience such a warped life. Fleming made the mistake of having independent observers who could see the problem. Yet we are fortunate that Stoliar stepped forward and wrote about the experience."},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"The best insider account of a celebrity I've ever read, told with true affection."},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"I just re-read this book again recently and it is always compelling, amusing, disturbing, and fascinating. You get to know other aspects of not only Groucho, but Zeppo, Gummo, and various members of Groucho's inner circle, especially the controversial Erin Fleming. Even friends of the author become interesting characters. One of my favorite books about a show business figure, and written with style, wit, clarity, and honesty. I would passionately recommend this to any Marx Brothers fan, especially those of us who recall their resurgence in the late sixties and early seventies, and who celebrated when Steve Stoliar managed to convince Universal to release the elusive Animal Crackers. An absolute must!"},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"I loved this book! I am a fan , but not fanatic, of the Marx Bros. More so I am a fan of &quot;classic&quot; Hollywood and comedians in particular. I remember very well seeing old Groucho on a few talk shows in the mid 70's and was greatly saddend by his death in 1977. I was cognicent of what went on in the media before and after his demise, but was unaware of what was really going on within that household. This book lovingly and accuratly details what Groucho's world was like in his waning years. It is sometimes hard to take, but, as in life, there are so many wonderful moments that Steve Stoliar was able to put down on paper. I recommend this book to all who are interested in comediens, The Marx Bros., Groucho or just old Hollywood. You won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"I was not a Marx Bros. fan, but the tale is so beautifully written and the plot twists so compelling, I would probably have enjoyed the telling if it were about Karl!"},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"Thank God, I am only one-third through this book and have double that left to read. This is the most authoritative look at the Marx Brothers I've read, other than \\"Growing Up with Chico\\" and the infamous Anobile \\"Scrapbook\\". Everybody wonders what their hero is really like and Stollier's view is 20/20. He never drifts to the outlandish opinion and is level with everything delivered, including his own possible myopia. What I love the most about this book is how well written it is. It flows. It delivers content on every page. We even get to look at Gummo and Zeppo, and for the first time, get confirmation of what others have both written and implied. Gummo was a gentle delight. Zeppo was a funny man, but a razor to live around. People to love and admire are George Burns and Jack Lemmon. Then we meet Erin Fleming, a deteriorating mediocrity, who was a better manager than actress, and whose vicious, schizoid, personality caused her to crash and burn. Erin tried so hard to ride a legend's coat tales into fame, but lost the respect of everyone she tried to cultivate. People who you know you wouldn't want to meet include Barbara Streisand, and perhaps a burned out Elliot Gould.So is Stolliers telling the truth? Apparently Dick Cavett thinks so. Furthermore, a party where Jack Lemmon plays piano all night with Billy Marx, Harpo's son, is re-counted through the author's eyes,and verified in Bill's Marx's book, \\"Son of Harpo Speaks\\". Groucho is both a mannered, loving, appreciative, employer and friend, just as he can live up to his \\"grouch-o\\" title. He obviously loved Steve's companionship as well as Steve's love of Groucho's tutelage in things literary, historic, and musical. They become deeply appreciative of each other. Steve lived it for the rest of us, and is altruistic in his sharing.So have I said enough? Buy it, read it, study it, shelve it amongst you Marx Brothers books and take it out once more. For me, all five Marx Brothers live on forever. It would seem that is true for Steve Stollier as well. Thanks, Steve."},{"Title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"This book was a great look into Groucho's later life and his life with Erin Fleming.

Like many Marx Brothers fans I absorbed all the books I could on the subject of the Marx's and their showbiz exploits. As a hobby I learned a great deal about them and the days of Old Hollywood. Mr. Stoliar's \\"Raised Eyebrows\\" finally finished the story for me.I'm grateful that Raised Eyebrows told the story of Groucho's last years. He was a great entertainer who possessed one of comedy's quickest wits. It very unfortunate that his death in 1977 was overshadowed by the death of Elvis Presley. So Mr. Stoliar, thanks for sharing your experience. Thanks for being instrumental in getting Animal Crackers re-released.

It was one of the last books about Groucho I read because I have an inherit distrust of former employees \\"tell-all\\" books. I was just very pleasantly surprised, because this was a labor of love by Steve Soliar. He is an excellent writer, giving you the feeling you are having a conversation with a friend. It is so refreshing to find someone who is part of the Hollywood \\"Paradise with a Labotomy\\" who is clearly a very down to earth fellow and treats even the worst of those he encountered with respect and decency.

The reason I am writing a review is that I can't believe all eleven reviews prior to this one are good. Something is fishy"},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"This author certainly came with an axe to grind and a choice of dubious sources fills the chapters. I wanted a book about the 1939 war but after reading this cannot shake the feeling that it's a propaganda rag, as if the war were still on. Political negotiations that went on between the two countries were left out, the Soviet intentions only scibbled about, and Poland's relations with its neighbouring countries since WW1 not dealt with. As for the atrocities, his inspiration must have been old TV shows and miniseries. Military matters must be taken in their context, so the reader cannot be shocked of plans for reprisals. If this were to be a book about Poland, then why so much yapping about the Germans? Shouldn't the author talked about Poland's war plan? The Polish gov't really thought that they would be marching on Berlin once war started, and welcomed the start of formal hostilities. If a reader wishes an actual history book worth keeping on the shelf, pass this up, and keep looking. Once you've found it, let me know too."},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"Rossino believes that the Wehrmacht committed numerous atrocities against civilians and POWs during the German invasion of Poland. Rossino disagrees with Bartov's thesis that the war crimes committed by the Wehrmacht was due to the stresses of combat on the Eastern Front instead Rossino states that even before they saw significant combat either in Poland or later Russia, the German army executed large numbers of civilians in Poland. Rossino states that the climate of brutality of the German army can be traced backed to the German officer corps taking Clausewitz's people's war theory to an extreme by massacaring the enemey's civilian population as seen in their actions in Southeastern Africa in the late nineteenth century and Belgum during the opening phases of the First World War. Also the ideological indoctrination of German soldiers greatly added to their hositilty to Slavs and Jews.Rossino mentions that oppostiion by some German generals to the activities by the SS and the Wehrmacht in Poland had to due with worries about keeping discipline in the army and not any great concern with innocent civilians. I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in the roots of the Holocaust and the massacre of millions of Slavs by the Wehrmacht during the Second World War."},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"If you read the title you will see that this book is NOT a military history of the Polish Campaign. That in-depth history has yet to be written. Therefore let me warn any future readers looking for a detailed description of the campaigns and the sweep of the panzers, the gallant fighting of the Poles replete with maps, you shall have to look elsewhere.The books central thesis could be summarised thus: historical interpretations of the Polish campaign have focused on it as the opening phase of a world war, where the harsh realities of battle on the Eastern Front and ideology of terror imbibed within Naziism did not give full vent. In fact as Rossino recounts, all the elements of Nazi Terror found expression from the first day of the war in Nazi occupied Poland.- SS Order Police were fully integrated behind the line and were detailed to pick up political and Jewish leaders and members of the polish \\"intelligensia\\"- Nazi ideology served as a well-spring to preciptate attrocities and aggravate encounters that turned into ferocious expressions of violence towards men, women and children --- without ideology some of these soldiers would have been controlled by their officers, or restrained by other men in their unit.- the tendency to view Poles and Jews as inferior to Germans, and German Culture, gave full expression by the wanton and unprecipated killing of Polish civilians for no reason other than personal pleasure.- in addition to SS and other terror elements, the Wehrmacht was equally responsible for the killing of civilians and POWs for no reason other than to terrorise the population or to \\"cleanse\\" it. And when reasons were lacking Poles were killed merely because they were viewed as members of a lesser race. Common sympathy were negated by ideology.All of the above happened from Sept 01st. Although the mass factory killings are absent, it is clear that that is only a matter of time. The fact remains that Poland was the first test case of a terrific expression of volience of the average German Soldier towards civilians and POWs.Besides the general attrocities commited in this book particular to Poland, I think that Rossino hits upon a grander issue. That is the issue of the corrosive influence of ideology on the mind of soldiers. In some cases commanders tried to stop the killings or discipline German troops or the SS. In most cases it was not because of a common human sympathy for the plight of Poles or Jews, it was merely for maintaining order in the rear and discipline within the army ranks. These few people found it immpossible to go through regular military authorities to discipline German soldiers guilty of attrocities. The system, conditioned by ideology thwarted them. In addition the German soldier also knew that he could kill with impugnity, and without compassion, as long as he was killing those of \\"lesser races.\\"This should serve as a chilling reminder or the importance of order in the ranks or any army during military operations, and the importance of dealing with any element that would think of the enemy as less than human. The German road to aggression in Poland is not a straight one to Auschwitz .... it is however, the start of the journey."},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is a serious history book but easy to read. I read this book to better understand how people can come to do such evil things. I have a personal interest in this as I am of Polish descent and my wife is partially of German descent. The book mentions atrocities committed by both Germans and Poles prior to the Nazi invasion of 1939. In fact a relative (German) of my wife was murdered by members of the Polish Army (or at least wearing the uniform of the Polish Army).The book gives a thorough picture of the brutal methods used by the SS and condoned by the German Army. It also explains the social conditions and attitudes that made these actions seem acceptable to Germans.What I found most disturbing is that I have family members who are advocating using the same brutal methods used by the Nazis against the warlords in Afghanistan in order to find Bin Laden. Reading this book and seeing how good people today can go down that same path is disturbing.This is a book everyone should read because it is a history lesson everyone should understand. If we do not learn the lessons of history, we will be forced to repeat them. This is, indeed, one of those lessons that should be learned from history not from experience."},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"Rossino's book, Hitler Strike's Poland, strikes a key note in understanding Germany political, military, and ideological objectives during the Second World War. For too long, histories of the war have tended to separate these three pillars of Hitler's national socialism, as if each were a distinctive \\"war\\" waged by separate armies. Students of Operation Barbarossa (The German attack on the Soviet Union) realize that this isn't the case, but for those who concentrate on the \\"clean\\" wars in the west and in the Mediterranean, the Wehrmacht carries a different reputation than it ought to.Rossino's meticulous research brings the reader to the conclusion that ideological and racial considerations influenced German military operations and strategic aims. For example, German army units (not SS or secret police) deliberately encroached on the Soviet zone in order to evict Jews and prevent their entry into German occupied territory. Also, it is striking how many valuable resources -- transportation, manpower, fuel, and ammunition -- of which the Germans did not have an overabundance, the Germans committed to their extermination and suppression campaigns against Poland's non-Jewish civilians. From a strictly military standpoint, it was overkill, but from Hitler's perspective, military force was simply another, albeit more final, method to achieve political control over eastern Europe.What I would have liked to have seen to make this a \\"five-star\\" book: A chapter on Polish resistance. The author only alludes to this facet of the campaign, which according to his German sources, played into Nazi propaganda and long-standing German animosity towards the Poles. It is unfortunate that the Poles, just as the Germans would have wished to view them, are \\"shadowy\\" characters in this tragic story. Second, some military terminology and concepts are either misrepresented or wrongly applied. For example, Poland was no \\"blitzkrieg,\\" as we use the term. True, the Germans had tanks, but this campaign was won by hard marching and fighting infantry, artillery, and some aircraft. Tanks provided mobility, and they made some impressive gains, but of themselves were not decisive to the outcome (however, the 1st Panzer Division does have a more unsavory side to it in this campaign). Also, a \\"strategy of annihilation\\" as described by Karl v. Clausewitz was not a forerunner, doctrinal basis, or prescription for the \\"war of annihilation\\" as practiced by the Third Reich. The former refers to the destruction in battle or capture of an enemy's means to resist (his armies and navies); the latter seeks the eradication of racial and ideological enemies. Lastly, as reflected in the title of this review, I feel that it is more appropriate to emphasize that the wanton destruction inflicted on Poland's civilians, Jew and Gentile alike, was not the work of Hitler alone. In fact, Hitler was not much involved in the formation and employment of Einsatzgruppen or German army units. Other individuals -- Heydrich, Himmler, Halder, Brachitsch, and a host of other Generals and police functionaries -- had far more practical influence. Hitler certainly gave breath to anti-Polish and anti-Semetic attitudes, but he had other do the dirty work.This book ought to become a classic in World War II literature. It shows that from the very start, German political and military objectives and means were thoroughly infused with racial, biological, and ideological motivations. It should prompt a reexamination of German army operations in the Balkans, Scandinavia, and western Europe."},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"In a crowded field of study on World War II, Rossino has done an incredible job of finding new and important material about this topic. His research sheds new light on Nazi Policy in Poland during and after the invasion on 1 September 1939. He clearly shows that the \\"Final Solution\\" was not a systematic plan from the beginning of the war. Although the Nazis carried out operations of murder and oppression, they did not exclusively focus on Jewish citizens of that nation, but rather on all Poles in general. Anyone who is a student of World War II must have this book in order to understand the war in Poland and how Hitler began his conquest of Europe."},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"Rossino recognizes the fact that German plans to destroy Poland went far beyond the \\"injustices\\" of Versailles, and had long preceded Hitler's rise to power (p. 6, 221-226). He also touches on Pilsudski's 1933 suggestion for a preventive Polish-French war against the infant Nazi state (p. 2).The German invaders of 1939 saw the crushing poverty of Polish farmers as one that kept them 200 years culturally behind the poorest German farmer, and attributed this state of affairs to Jewish economic dominance (pp. 209-212). Ironic to the modern portrayal of Poles as eager anti-Semites, certain Germans chided Poles for their \\"stupidity\\" for letting the Jews cheat them and keep them in such poverty! (p. 210)Rossino sees the 1939 German conquest of Poland as one exhibiting a level of viciousness unprecedented in European warfare up to that time, and not to be matched until Operation Barbarossa (p. 1). There was no love lost between the Pole and the Hun and, although atrocities occurred on both sides, German atrocities against Poles greatly dwarfed the reverse. Wehrmacht officers commonly opposed SS atrocities--not from ethical motives, but out of fear of adverse effects on military discipline (p. 115, 232). Still, the Wehrmacht was responsible for the massacres of 16,000-27,000 Polish civilians (p. 263). In addition, German forces murdered Polish POWs at hundreds of locations (p. 185). The SS alone murdered 43,000 Poles and 7,000 Jews through December 1939 (p. 234, 300). This is, of course, in addition to the colossal level of death and destruction resulting from German military operations.Rossino elaborates on \\"Bloody Sunday\\" at Bydgoszcz (Bromberg). Some 1,000 Volksdeutsche were killed during their fifth-column actions against armed Poles prior to the Wehrmacht's entry (p. 62). This German propaganda embellished into a Polish massacre of 5,400 (p. 62) and then 50,000 (p. 258) implicitly-innocuous and defenseless German civilians. (I knew an eyewitness, Mr. Stefan Marcinkowski, who reported that there was no wholesale killing of unarmed German civilians by Poles at Bydgoszcz).Rossino recognizes the fact that German atrocities continued even after Polish civilian resistance decreased (p. 153) and often had no relationship to the latter at all (p. 160, 178). He also recognizes the fact that the Nazis saw both Poles and Jews as enemies in a collective, racial sense: \\"According to the SS, the soldier was first and foremost a National Socialist Kampfer (fighter) who saw enemies in practical as well as in racial terms. SS personnel thus defined Polish soldiers and the civilian population (Jewish and non-Jewish) alike as legitimate targets of aggression.\\" (p. 115).Despite the foregoing, Rossino appears to be fixated on German anti-Polish actions as ends in themselves (crushing resistance), and fails to put them into proper genocidal context. In time, 3 million Polish gentiles were murdered by the Germans (p. 298). But, as pointed out by Raphael Lemkin (the Polish Jew who coined the term genocide), the killing off of the Polish intelligentsia (along with such things as the reduction of Poles' fertility, destruction of Polish cultural objects, etc.) was actually part of a multi-faceted, long-term plan to exterminate the Polish people.Nowadays, Christianity is sometimes blamed for the Jewish Holocaust--never mind the fact that Nazism had been a secularist ideology. Furthermore, many leading Einsatzgruppe and Gestapo officials, later involved in the rape of Poland, are specifically identified by Rossino as having repudiated Christianity. These include: Bruno Streckenbach (p. 32), Bruno Mueller (p. 33), Karl-Heinz Rux (p. 40), Wilhelm Scharpwinkel (p. 42), Fritz Liphardt (p. 42), Lothar Beutel (p. 44), and Otto Hellwig (p. 51). (So, of course, did Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler, Frank, Kaltenbrunner, and other top Nazis.)."},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"I was looking for a book about the polish campaign, in particular from the military point of view. I knew that talking about it means talking about Einsatzgruppen, SS and Wehrmacht atrocity against Jews and Polish 'Intelligentsia'.In fact, the Rossino's study focuses only on these Killing Mobile Units, telling about the campaign main course only to place the testimonies of atrocities in a cronological context.Beware, if you are searching a military point of view this is not the book for you. If you want an Einsatzgruppen story and a great study about Wehrmacht and SS collaboration (you'll discover that sometimes the Wehrmacht hindered the former tasks) for the Untermensch destruction, buy it. If you proudly display a WWII library, buy it anyway. But buy also Browning's Ordinary Men.The 3 stars comes out not from the above statements but from the book boring attitude. The work is well researched and Mr. Rossino is a competent scholar. The goal was not to entertain us, but to teach a piece of history and he accomplished the task. The problem is that he didn't even try to make the reading more pleasant.A study about an olocaust should not entertain you, but could possibly stimulate your attention.Too much plain stats can drive you mad. I finished it only because I finish every book. I made it in two months and in the meantime I read 6 other books.If you, too, will finish it, you'll get a deep comprehension of the matter. Then you'll proudly put it on the shelves and never take it again.I'm an Assistant of a Law University Professor and I know that no subject is necessarily boring. The first and fundamental challenge is to teach well. The second is to maintain an high level of interest of the listeners (and readers).Unfortunately, Mr. Rossino did not take care of the latter goal."},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"This book goes into great detail of how Germany invaded Poland by employing its &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; tactics and the atrocities that accompanied the invasion. Some of the horrors inflicted on the Polish, particularly Polish Jews, are unthinkable. I really liked how Rossini describes the various factions within the SS and the major players involved throughout the entire process to create &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space) for the German peoples. I also find it quite ironic that the Polish are described by many of the SS barbarians as &quot;violent.&quot; My only complaint was that the author could have described the military tactics from the Polish perspective a bit more. In other words, why was the German army able to steamroll the Polish military so easily. A few accounts from Polish officers would have helped, though we did get quite a few accounts from Polish civilians."},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"I found the book extremely disappointing and insulting to the Poles. The author states that Polish civilians might have brought the German retaliation on themselves because they essentially tried to fight back. What a ridiculous conclusion! Thanks to their British and French allies who did not honor their comments to assist, the Poles had to fight back any way they could. Hitler made no secret of his desire to wipe out the Poles. The Poles had no intention of rolling over and capitulating to the Germans (as the French subsequently did). The author's portrayal of ethnic Germans in Poland also leaves a lot to be desired. Their treatment of their Polish nieghbors was also horrific. Better accounts can be found in Lucas' \\"Forgotten Holocaust\\" and Piotrowski's \\"Poland's Holocaust\\"."},{"Title":"Hitler Strikes Poland: Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity (Modern War Studies)","review":"When German armies poured into Poland in 1939, the destruction was so swift, so complete, and so foreshadowing of similar such invasions, that there is a tendency to measure the rout of the Polish military in terms of chronology. So many days for the breach to be made, so many for the encirclement of key Polish targets, and so many for the destruction of those targets. Truly, the German invasion was one of the few times in military history that a massive assault not only met its temporal objectives but exceeded them. Students of the Polish campaign, like Alexander B Rossino in his HITLER STRIKES POLAND, tend to view the entire five week campaign in terms of Rossino's subtitle: \\"Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity.\\" There is little doubt that the combined Wehrmacht and SS whirlwind heralded a new type of warfare. Hitler's panzer armies were striking not only at a demoralized and outnumbered Polish military but also at a race of Slavs that for years had been demonized as subhuman. Rossino lists numerous examples of massacres of Polish civilians and behind the lines Polish army regulars who continued to fight even when it was clear that such isolated encounters could have no effect on the entire campaign. Rossino's main thrusts cover areas that the erudite reader has read before, but here he focuses on the entire spectrum of a battle that need not have turned out as catastrophic as it did. In an alternate universe, the Polish government might have suspected that an attack was coming, especially given the many warnings that Hitler provided: his stated intentions to destroy Poland in MEIN KAMPF and his movement of troops to the Polsh border that could not have been a secret. The destruction of the four Polish armies whose function was to protect Poland is well documented. The value of Rossino's book is that he explains clearly how and why Poland was put to the quick torch. Still, I would have appreciated how--given things might have been--Poland could have avoided collapse long enough to keep the Germans at bay for just a few months more. It is not well known that the quick German victory was fortuitous for Hitler in that he expected a quick victory. His supply columns for his Panzers and mechanized trucks were quite limited. He had to win via a quick ko or risk getting bogged down against a Polish military that fought valiantly and would have given a better acount of themselves if their leaders had had a little more foresight. The unspoken premise of HITLER STRIKES POLAND is that much of Hitler's spectacular successes between 1939 and 1942 were based more on his opponents' ineptitude than on his own sense of a misguided ideological and genocidal vision."},{"Title":"Zemlia bez radosti: Kniga Eltary i Argnista (Letopisi Khervarda / Nik Perumov) (Russian Edition)","review":"The third book in the series, Land Without Happiness is not a direct sequel to either, however. Sure you'll meet some of the same heroes, but the situations and even the heroes themselves will change, as they should. Another masterpiece by Nick, ZBR retains much of the feel from the &quot;Doom of the Gods&quot;, unlike Warrior of the Great Darkness or some of his later releases. ZBR is also an improvement for Nick, in style if not in content. There you will see some view points, that he'd not used in the first two chronicles of Hjorward and you will not find some of the ones you did see there. Bottom line: It's a must.

For starters - it just uses the bread machine as a mixer - it is not anywhere near as easy as using your bread machine to make bread. So the title can be misleading. And as another reviewer said - it isn't for dogs with allergies. That was the whole point of me baking my own - to provide my dog with treats that he can't have otherwise because of his allergies. And the book is just too scatchy on the details. It doesn't tell you for each recipe how dark the treats should be when done - so you don't know if they are raw or burnt. I will return to the internet to search for some recipes for my dog that he can have despite the allergies and which I can make without guesswork."},{"Title":"Gourmet Dog Biscuits: From Your Bread Machine","review":"I got this book as a gift, and have just started facing some allergy problems with my dog. I haven't made any of these recipes yet, because every one of them calls for cornmeal and wheat flour, which are the most common things for dogs to be allergic to. There is also a whole chapter devoted to beef flavored recipes, which many long haired breeds are allergic to. It turns out that my dog probably is allergic to corn, so if I can find a substitute for cornmeal, I will try some of these recipes.I was very disappointed that the author did not have a chapter devoted to allergen free recipes. To me, one of the biggest reasons to bake rather than buy treats, is to provide something that the stores don't provide. This book definitely does not do that. It gives you the opportunity to experiment with different flavors with your dog, but if your dog has a sensitive stomach, you probably don't like to do that anyway.This is definitely more of a &quot;fun, whimsical play with your dog&quot; kind of book than it is a &quot;provide the right nutrition for your dog&quot; kind of book."},{"Title":"Gourmet Dog Biscuits: From Your Bread Machine","review":"I bought this book in a fit of self-indulgence... I am 40 pounds overweight and I love to cook all sorts of ethnic and gourmet meals. I was facing the prospect of trying to diet, and I was feeling very sorry for myself, not only for the fact that I'd have to eat much more sparingly, but because that also meant I would have to COOK much more sparingly. I don't like to be obligated to cook, but I sure do like it as a hobby, and I've failed many a diet before by convincing myself that food isn't fattening if it's homemade.When I saw this book, I realized I had a key ingredient to my OWN successful diet. I could spend time in the kitchen, but I could spend it baking for my DOG. I've made dog cookies before, and while I enjoyed it once, the whole dough-blending process is laborious, and not something I wanted to repeat too often. And I own a bread machine, which I love to use, but which lies around gathering dust because when I bake bread, I eat bread, and I get fatter.This book is just great. Each recipe is sort of a variation on a theme, and even though the recipes have a zillion ingredients, I have found them to be very tolerant of reasonable substitutions, once you figure out which ingredients are sort of interchangeable. And yet, the huge variety of recipes, complete with their cute little margin stories, make each round of baking a little adventure. I've made four recipes so far, some of which my dog has grudgingly shared with her various doggie friends and cousins. The reviews have been great across the board.My recommendations if you buy this book: Do check the dough, as advised, 15 minutes after blending starts, because it's not uncommon to need a little more oil or water. Buy a nice size jar of yeast and a nice size jar of brewer's yeast and stick 'em in the fridge; have a shopping spree on a bunch of weird kinds of flour and brans and such, put them all in tupperwares so it'll all last, and then just bake, bake, bake.

I always use my bread machine for mixing even when I bake bread so using it to mix the dog biscuits is very easy. The recipes are very creative.

It has sci-fi, fantasy, and occult elements. It offers some adventure, some romance, and some mystery. What is most striking, however, is that the plot is about a spiritual quest--the kind everyone feels the need to begin, sooner or later, when the world's answers no longer satisfy one's questions.Marie Corelli's nameless narrator represents the seeking soul in all of us. Yet, at the beginning of the story, she appears to have given up the search. Unlike those who have never bothered to search and do not mind being in the dark, she is wasting away in mind, body and spirit. Then she meets a mysterious painter who asks to do her portrait. It is in his studio that she has her first supernatural experience, which rejuvenates her body and rekindles her need to find the answers.Her first teacher is another mysterious figure, a Chaldean named Heliobas. (It is hinted in some chapters that he may be one of the identities of the Avatar known as the Comte de St. Germaine. I'm keeping an open mind.) Naturally, most of the world sees him as eccentric and frightening: his strange experiments with electricity and his radical takes on everything (including the books of the bible) make him a fascinating teacher to those who have \\"eyes to see and ears to hear,\\" but a threat to society to those who remain in the dark.Here is how Corelli's writing can be so off-putting. Nobody likes thinking that he or she is in the dark about anything; yet Corelli stoutly implies that this must be so for those who do not believe in her blatantly occult themes. Then she goes on to combine occult and Christian elements, creating a bizarre form of esoteric Christianity that she presents as TRUTH.Yet let's not quibble over terminology. So what if Corelli believes that the soul is literally electric and that Heaven is a great electric circle? Other writers have made similar guesses about the soul and about Heaven, using safe words like \\"love\\" or \\"light.\\" When we read that Jesus' body was electrically charged, which was why he could heal through touch, we can at least be impressed by the spunk it took to say such a thing in Victorian England.Ultimately, everyone gets to write the story of his or her soul's search for God and to discover that the many different stories are just retellings of the same one. This retelling is particularly lovely, due to Corelli's descriptive and reverent style. It is with great passion that the heroine declares: \\"I desire to know why this world, this universe exists; and I also wish to prove, if possible, the truth and necessity of religion. And I think I would give my life, if it were worth anything, to be certain of the truth of Christianity.\\"I don't want to reveal the reason why the novel's title is \\"Romance of Two Worlds\\", because behind it is a fascinating twist that I think all readers should discover on their own. Don't worry that the book is all dialogue and teaching, however, as the plot takes many unexpected turns.Other books in what has been called the \\"Heliobas triology\\" are \\"Ardath\\" and \\"The Soul of Lilith\\". However, it is \\"The Life Everlasting\\" that is the proper continuation of \\"Romance of Two Worlds\\", as it leads our heroine to a romance of her very own."},{"Title":"A romance of two worlds: A novel,","review":"You have probably already read all about how wonderfully Madame Corelli writes, and thus, I shall not elaborate on that. All that I can say is that this heavenly-sent book has changed my life. I had always been turned off from Christianity because of all the things that I knew of the church, and of the bleak end that awaited all who didn't belive in the church. But Marie opened up my eyes and my heart. I came across this book by &quot;chance&quot; and am now sure that it was all ordained by God. Thanks to this book opening up my senses, I now have found my twin soul and we are eternally grateful to God for the gifts he has given us. I highly recommend this book to both those who feel that they have already begun upon thier own spiritual journey, and those who feel alienated from God. &quot;The Life Everlasting&quot;, a later book by also written by this earthly angel is another book that I belive we all need to read. Just give it 30 pages and you will most certainly agree with me. Thank you ! and God be with you!"},{"Title":"A romance of two worlds: A novel,","review":"I was compelled to read from cover to cover and the left the Romance inspired with renewed hope....renewed spirit. You might also like ANGELES IN HARSH WORLD, by Don Bradley. Another wonderful, mystical adventure."},{"Title":"A romance of two worlds: A novel,","review":"_A Romance of Two Worlds_ by Victorian novelist Marie Corelli is a majestic tale full at once of mystery, intrigue, romance, and the occult revealing the inner meaning of Christianity in beautiful prose. Marie Corelli was an English novelist of the Victorian era who was much criticized in her day for her scathing criticism of the materialism, positivism, and scientism popular in the late Nineteenth century as revealed in her novels. This novel expounds an occult theory of Christianity based on electricity. At the same time however, the author decries the excesses of spiritism that had made their way to fill in the gap left by materialist philosophy. The author does not espouse any particular creed of Christianity, though this novel focuses upon Catholicism; however, her theory of the occult essence in electricity is unique. This is what makes up her \\"Electric Creed of Christianity\\". The book includes an introduction and preface written by the author as well as an appendix containing letters testifying to the uniqueness of Marie Corelli's spiritualism. Corelli was obviously influenced by Swedenborgianism and Theosophy as well which can be seen in the novel in several places.This novel tells the tale of the author, a pianist, who has become ill with a physical depression due to overwork. At the request of her doctor, who has run out of cures, she is advised to leave London and head for warmer climes. She travels with two friends, an American colonel and his wife. She arrives in Cannes where she meets the artist, Raffaelo Cellini, who has acquired an amazing system of color and who offers to paint her portrait. Although she is ill, she decides to allow him to do so. While Cellini is painting her portrait he offers her a magic elixer which provides her with three visions of a mysterious individual known as Heliobas. She is to find out that Heliobas is the artist's master and that he had saved Cellini from a similar depression. She is given a book to examine which reveals the hidden spiritual meaning in music and she also meets Heliobas' incredible Newfoundland dog Leo who travels back and forth from Paris where Heliobas resides bringing messages. Cellini agrees to have her meet Heliobas who will be able to cure her through his wonderful electrical powers. The author travels to Paris where she meets Heliobas and is given special potions which enable her to make a full recovery. She also meets Heliobas' sister Zara, a sculptress impressive in her own right, and their friend Prince Ivan. Heliobas is a mysterious Chaldean who has mastered the art of electricity. He allows the author to experience entirely new realms, including interplanetary travel in which she sees for herself the glories of God, the angelic being Azul (Heliobas' \\"twin soul\\"), her own guardian angel, and the mysteries of Christianity. All of this is accomplished through what Marie Corelli calls \\"electricity\\". Zara herself is possessed of special electrical powers and wears a special stone which serves to channel her electrical charge. The book encompasses at once mystery, romance, tragedy, and yet it offers hope through Christian belief against the materialism and atheism of the age. Throughout Corelli notes how many have scoffed at traditional belief in Christ and that few will understand her novel or its inner meaning. The novel also offers philosophical proof for the existence of God and the truth of God incarnate as Christ. The writing is beautiful and majestic, truly appealing to the inner soul. This novel remains a unique experience among Victorian writers and represents the first attempt of Marie Corelli at writing novels."},{"Title":"A romance of two worlds: A novel,","review":"Perhaps if I had Marie Corellie's command of the English language I could begin to articulate the praise &quot;A Romance of Two Worlds&quot; is due. Clearly this gifted woman had the mind of a philosopher, the heart of a poet, and the soul of a prophetess. She has a wonderful way of opening one's mind and and stimulating one's imagination. From the onset of the book I became enraptured by the eloquence with which this story is told and the humility and sincerity that emenate from it. I recently borrowed an original edition of the book, well over 100 years old. The delicacy of the physical book only added to the rich story contained therein. I am still in the process of reading the book, but I highly recommend this marvelous piece for any spiritually minded person. As a person that spends much time reading and studying religious, philosophical, and mystical texts, it has truly been a delightful change of pace reading this novel, which deals with those same issues, but does so via a truly wonderful and beautifully told story. I thank God for this fascinating work of art."},{"Title":"A romance of two worlds: A novel,","review":"Though wildly popular in their time, (1890's-1910's), Marie Corelli's Mystical-Romantic novels are almost unknown now, as is the entire genre. A Romance of Two Worlds was her first novel, written in 1886, and one of her best. A strange mix of Victorian romanticism, science, spirituality, and feminism, the book details a turning point in the life of a female piano improviser (!) as she discovers occult knowledge from a Chaldean mystic and his beautiful, innocent sister. Though the book is thoroughly dated by now, it gains rather than looses charm from the cultural distance it evokes. This book may have also been an inspiration for the legendary Jazz artist, Sun Ra, who named a composition &quot;Romance of Two Planets&quot;, and who would have found much to like about Corelli."},{"Title":"A romance of two worlds: A novel,","review":"This novel is Corelli's premiere in the world of fiction. It features dream-magic, mesmerism, with many and varied opium-induced occult powers complete with a world-weary & emotionally crumbling heroine on a quest for the meaning of life - resulting in a cosmic journey by means of astral projection with an angelic guide, embodying a trip to utopian Saturn, to technologically bizarre Jupiter and to the center of the universe, the place of creation, where God dwells in electrical form. Corelli combines weird science and spiritualism. It is a wild and strange trip to dip into Corelli's world but worth the ride.

I thought the language was beautiful and, alas, majestic. Marie Corelli possessed a brilliant mind, she spoke so cleverly about everything. Every logician would agree that The Romance of two Worlds is a convincing long argument in which Marie Corelli tries to convince the public of her beliefs. However, the problem with her argument is that it contains every one of The Major Informal Fallacies. Especially the appeal to force (argument ad baculum), for example: believe in God, or forever be condemned. Indeed, this is what makes the novel (or argument) faulty; at the prologue of the novel she disputes the fallacies of different theorists, and yet makes fallacies of her own throughout the book! This book is very creative and descriptive - a very beautiful picture of England during an age of universal inquiry and universal skepticism - but utterly unbelievable. The reader, unless ignorant, won't believe a word Corelli says - and shouldn't."},{"Title":"Basketballs, goldfish, and world championships","review":"Patsy Neal was three-time AAU All-American and Captain of the 1964 United States team in the World Basketball Tournament.

The 100 Greatest Disasters of All Time","review":"Nice looking book, but I was disappointed that only 2 or 3 pages were given to each disaster. While I recognize the task of covering 100 disasters obviously means large number of pages can't be written for each event, I did want to read more than just 2 pages. This fact was not mentioned in the sales description of the book. There is only one photo (printed, not a photo plate, which are clearer) per event, which was also a big disappointment. I paged through the book when I received it and decided to return it because of these things. Covering disasters from BC to current day also may not appeal to everyone."},{"Title":"Catastrophe! The 100 Greatest Disasters of All Time","review":"Very interesting book. Some entries begin with a portrayal from a fictional character that was involved in the disaster being discussed. However the author managed to make multiple mistakes throughout the book. He claimed the great Okeechobee hurricane had winds of 500 mph (which is, errrr, impossible) and many times mixes up the terms tsunami and storm surge (these are not the same thing!) among others. If your looking for just a quick guide on some famous disasters then this is fine, but if you know a bit about the subject it's not recommended."},{"Title":"Catastrophe! The 100 Greatest Disasters of All Time","review":"Any writer describing a large number of disasters (or anything else for that matter) needs to avoid merely pouring out facts and figures and listings. Talented authors present their books in unique ways, bringing an old subject across as if it were brand new. Spignesi has found his signature style here with Catastrophe. Ranking disasters by magnitude, he does a fine job of conveying just what makes each so interesting and terrible, all in just a few pages. Many begin from the perspective of a real or imagined victim. Then some of the most fascinating features of the tragedy are explained, so while each disaster gets a page or two, its inclusion seems justified. I also liked the author's frequent citation of other great disaster books such as Darkest Hours. Great books build on the work of earlier ones.Listing disasters by magnitude does have its disadvantages. Unlike a chronology or alphabetical order, the same causes bunch together, as epidemics, earthquakes and fires tend to create similar death tolls. Spignesi is also a bit biased against man-made calamity because the death counts tend to be much lower. True, plane crashes and ship wrecks can't compete in this category with the largest natural forces, but then again they are fascinating for the loss of control they demonstrate. Quality over quantity here.So while the coverage is light here it is still very good, even if other works give more detail on the subject."},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"At first I was a little skeptical as to the soundness of the technique in the telling of the story because it took me by surprise to have an ancient Jewish story told in the modern vernacular. But Ms. Austin pulled it off, and I was intrigued. Her method of storytelling was an inspiration to go back and re-read the various books of the Old Testament.To be honest I did read all 5 of Lynn's books. I was engrossed with the first one and it was free. Amazon's marketing technique is a wonderful thing!"},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"I loved this book. For me, it is a 5-star rating. Why is that? This novel earned my elusive 5-star rating because of the self-examination it stirred within my soul. When I find myself thinking about my own life and evaluating my faith and my convictions long after finishing a book, the author gets the rating. In addition, it sparked some pretty good conversations with my teenage son.Was the writing perfect? No. However, the author is bringing the Old Testament to life. She doesn't avoid the hard topics, and she handles them well. The Assyrians are involved so this story does involve rape, torture, and death. I felt that she wrote enough to demonstrate how evil they were, but didn't cross the road into glamorization.Honestly, I have always had a difficult time with Isaiah. I have found him a bit difficult to understand. However, within the context of this story, I have begun to gain a much greater appreciation of him. The author does not use the King James Version, so I find myself rewording certain passages with the text I know. For the first time, they are not merely words on paper.As others have mentioned, this is a modernized story. I do not find that to be a distraction. Rather, I find that it gives me a greater desire to search out the true historical context."},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"Received the book in good condition and in a timely manner. Song of Redemption is awsome and Lynn Austin is a fantastic author. Plean to read all her novels."},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"I enjoyed the second book in the series even more than the first. Even though the book was a fictional account, I had a better idea of how and why the Jewish people turned away from God. The author suggestion was a series of subtle compromises that eventually led God's people away, things that made perfect sense to man. I was reminded of the awesomeness of Yaweh, and our need to commune with him through prayer, and our need of forgiveness still today.

I'm on the 5th book now and I have immensely enjoyed reading all of the books in the series so far. I will be very sad to finish the series because I just love how the author makes you feel as if you are right there with the ancient Kings who served God so diligently and were greatly rewarded and those who opposed God and lost everything.

In this book I came to know King Hezekiah in a way I never would have been able to by just reading the scriptures. For example, even though his father, King Ahaz, worshipped foreign gods (and sacrificed his own son in Book 1 of the series), Hezekiah became a king who followed the ways of the Lord. Why? Because he'd learned about the true God from his grandfather, and also through the prophet Isaiah who was living at that time. Reading this book along with the Bible is enlightening and exciting. The author makes the details of the characters' lives so real you feel as if you know them personally. If you want to understand the people and times of the Old Testament, as well as enjoy a good story, I highly recommend you read this book."},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"This book is the second in the series, a great book that helps understand the history and gain insight into the biblical message"},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"I love stories that flesh out Bible characters!

A must read with a wonderful story line and amazing characters. I will definately be trying some of her other titles."},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"Ms. Austin's second book in her Chronicles of the Kings series is just as good as her previous title. This story pick up where \\"God and Kings\\" leaves off and again brings tales of the Old Testament to life once again.King Hezekiah wants to rule under God's law. His path won't be easy and he will have choices that he will have to make that will not be popular or easy. Once such choice will be to rebel against the Assyrian leaders to the North of his country. Once this decision is made tasks are taken to protect the city and the water supply. The closer his enemy comes to the city the more Hezekiah's advisors suggest that he make peace with the Assyrian's. This is not an option to the strong leader who has made a decision and will stand by it...no matter what. There is a second part to this story and it's about his choice of wife. Will he stay true to his wife Hephzibah or will he look for another to stand by his side?Hephzibah is strong and loves her husband King Hezekiah. She is heart broken when he turns to his concubines for company and support. Than miracle of miracles he turns to her. Together they fight the enemy and become a united front. King Hezekiah finds support where he least expected to find it. Will his love for Hephzibah also bring him a small amount of peace?Again this was a very good and descriptive read. Ms. Austin has brought this time period to life and fans of historic fiction will have their appetite sated for sure. For those that are not familiar with the bibles teachings this will be a good read for them. Ms. Austin has again brought the Old Testament to life in a way that will transport the reader back to this very turbulent time. I highly recommend Ms. Austin and her Chronicles of the Kings series.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"Following the blasphemy of his father, Hezekiah sits on David's throne. He wants to do the right thing for his people starting with a renewed belief in Yahweh and a cleansing of the Temple. However, adhering to the laws of Yahweh is complex and dangerous. The young monarch has enemies who make demands on him.Making matters worse the Assyrians are demanding tribute that his country can ill afford though prosperity has begun to return. More critical to Hezekiah, he believes God will protect the Jews though his closest advisors counsel him to pray. When he meets Jerusha, a Jew who fled from Assyrian captivity; he knows he has found his queen. As the Assyrians march closer to Jerusalem, pressure on Hezekiah to abandon the Lord grows, but though he has doubts shared by his frightened spouse, he stays the course.SONG OF REDEMPTION continues the fascinating biographical fictionalized account of King Hezekiah (see GOD AND KINGS) trying to return his people to the one God while struggling with his council recommending bowing to the Assyrians instead of Yahweh. Readers will feel they have been transplanted to biblical times as Lynn Austin brings to life Hezekiah trying to stay what he believes is the proper course that Yahweh would expect him to lead his people down. This is an insightful well written biblical biographical fiction that readers will treasure.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"These were so good. There are five in book series, a must read. Each one was a page turner for sure. You are so back in time, hearing the sounds, smelling the dust, feeling the winds that blow a lot in that area..So real...I read all five books get them."},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"The second book of the series was better than the first one. The author used more suspense that kept me turning those pages. The situations felt real through vivid descriptions. You can feel the writer's powerful talent to make a reader a part of the story. I felt like an insider of the story walking paths with all of the people in this made up tale. The writer has a great sensibility to describe human nature and each feeling. The book is about the freedom and great faith. Faith gives you freedom and does not confine you to things that you can feel with your hands. It should be felt within your heart.The writer added to the story a theme of a beautiful young love that grows. You anticipate the relationship along the way.In this book, little birdie is a metaphor for freedom. Did the bird find its home or come back to the cage? The writer stirs your emotions and creates a remarkable journey.The book is written in an easy going language."},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"This series is a wonderful expansion of the story from the Bible.

Thank you so much for writing this, and it's fair to say I'm officially hooked on this series!"},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"After surviving a tumultuous childhood, when Hezekiah is at last crowned king of Judah he determines to purge his country of idolatry and return to the worship of Yahweh. But years of idol worship are not set aside so easily by all of his subjects, and his sweeping religious reforms meet with stiff opposition. When the Temple is rededicated and the celebratory feasts are re-established, Hezekiah sees the beginning of God's answer to his heart's cry -- his people are turning back to God, and prosperity is returning to his ravaged land. Longing to shake free of the last vestiges of Ahaz's rule, Hezekiah decides to forego the annual tribute payment to Assyria, a risky move as the dreaded Assyrians outmatch the Judeans in strength and funds. Faced with the most terrifying army in the world, Hezekiah confronts his greatest challenge yet -- to bow to what the eye can see, to fear, or gamble everything on faith in an unseen and unshakeable God's promises.Song of Redemption is a novel saturated in biblical history and the faith of the ancients that still has the power to speak to us today. Taking the accounts in 2 Kings 17-18 and 2 Chronicles 29-32 as her basis, Austin brings ancient Judah to life at the crossroads of idolatry and religious revival. Hezekiah and his contemporaries leap living and breathing from the page, very relatable human beings faced with one of mankind's oldest conflicts -- the choice between faith and fear. I absolutely loved seeing worship come alive through Austin's prose. Her well-researched, biblically grounded storyline breathes fresh life into the Old Testament texts, giving the reader a relatable example in Hezekiah as to what the Temple, what the revival of this time meant to the Jewish people. Austin's representation of Hezekiah's character is a sterling example of what I love about biblical fiction -- it can be a powerful reminder that the people immortalized within the pages of the Bible were not superhuman giants of the faith, but very much fallible human beings, assailed by the same struggles we face today -- the pitfalls of pride, fear, and doubt.The first third of Song is a bit slow-going, but by the second third, when Judah is faced with annihilation by the Assyrians, the novel becomes unput-downable. This history absolutely fascinates me. Faced with the promise of an Assyrian siege, Hezekiah took steps to reinforce Jerusalem's walls and to secure the city's water supply from the Gihon Spring. The engineering of Hezekiah's tunnel is nothing short of miraculous, a fascinating slice of history Austin deftly brings to life. While I love Hezekiah's character, I think I most relate to the storyline Austin introduces involving Jerusha, an escaped Assyrian captive, and Eliakim, the chief engineer charged with improving Judah's defenses. Jerusha's faith and self-worth have been shattered by the atrocities she endured, while Eliakim places his faith in himself and what he can see, the work of his hands. They are powerful reminders of mankind's never-ending tendency to make any given problem bigger than the God we claim to serve and believe in. His capacity for redemption and His power to save know no bounds, and Eliakim and Jerusha's story is a challenge to live lives with faith unleashed.While I was a bit struck by the dialogue, which at times seemed entirely too modern, that is a minor qualm. Song of Redemption is biblical fiction at its best, a story that brings the forefathers of the faith to vibrant life and will inspire you to look at the source material with fresh eyes, to live your faith out loud."},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"This was an excellent read. I was involved from the first chapter and never stopped being excited to get time to continue reading.

It was extremely well written and the content was so revealing. You will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"A riveting book in a historical fiction series that brings the Old Testament Kings to life."},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"I picked up this with great anticipation because I loved \\"Gods and Kings\\". There was always a slight pain stabbing me deep within, because in short, I've been there. I haven't trusted, and I have certainly been bitter. So while this is about King Hezekiah, rest assured that it goes a little bit (OK, a LOT deeper) then simply that.King Hezekiah wants and needs to become his own man. That point is obvious in and of itself. He doesn't want to be like Ahaz, and for good reason. Yet people who were under Ahaz can't fathom why Hezekiah wouldn't want change, including his own advisor, Shebna. Yet he stands firm in his faith! Doubt stares him in the face from all angles possible. His own wife doubts that Yahweh will provide an heir, and she is tempted to turn to Asherah for help. So while I related to Hezekiah, I really felt as if I'd walked in the shoes of Eliakim. Despite what his precious father believes, he doesn't WANT to believe, because it just doesn't seem possible. More than that, Eliakim wants answers, and they can't come in a timely manner for him. Yet we find Elaikim in the end surprised, and a man who knows he needs the one true God. I can personally praise God that I've improved vastly over the years, and my trust in God has expanded greatly! It has given me bold ambition at times, and I can only give God the glory for that.The story of Jerusha is one that compares pretty vividly to the story of Francine Rivers' \\"Redeeming Love\\". She, like Eliakim, feels there is no hope for her. Yet she knows the tricks and cruelties of the Assyrian nation, and she can help Judah prepare (if it is possible against Assyria) for an attack. Now, to be quite blunt, I didn't feel that Lynn Austin would come within ear-shot of describing Assyrian culture. I figured she might be too kind and water it down so the reader wouldn't be offended. Austin holds NOTHING back, and it enhances the story beyond measure! Way to go!!The theme I lived in this was an unshakable faith, and a staggering patience, although patience is something I still struggle with at times. Don't we all, amen? I guess reliving certain things in my own life made this a longer read. It also made it all the more appropriate. Sometimes we all need a wake up call, and this did the trick for me! Thank you, Lynn Austin!"},{"Title":"Song of Redemption (Chronicles of the Kings #2)","review":"I would like these books if I was able to download the first one, God and Kings, also.

It tells a story of a person that had died inside, but still continues to exist in the world of the living.He desperately tries to love in order to live again, but fails, because he is ill. His illness has a name, it is called - &quot;The Malady of Death&quot;. I assure you, this is not just another french book. This book is written by Marguerite Duras.If you have ever read anything of hers, you would know what I mean. She writes with thoughts instead of sentences, and that alone captivates reader's imagination. This particular creation will inevitably leave a trace in your memory, because her work is not only unforgetable, it is at times disturbing.She knows the other, unknown side to the human soul, and she carries her message across skillfully. If you are one of the people that questions and desires to understand - this is a book for you. Every word has it's place, every sentence has it's mission. Indulge."},{"Title":"The Malady of Death","review":"I picked up \\"Malady of Death\\" in a bargain bin at Waldenbooks many years ago. Having heard a great deal about \\"The Lover,\\" also by Duras, I decided that at a mere 60+ pages and at a ridiculously low price, there was little to lose. I found myself reading it and re-reading it. There isn't much to the story, nor is it much of one. However, this is not so much a case of what is written as much as how it is written. Duras language is extremely poetic with an ever present sense of longing and sorrow. The lyrical quality in her writing is absolutely magical. The simple story of someone paying for companionship, intimacy and, ultimately, sex because of his inability to love is hardly a groundbreaking premise, but, again, its worth and beauty lie in how it is communicated and the sensation you experience in its wake. Very beautiful, indeed."},{"Title":"The Malady of Death","review":"I thought that \\"The Malady of Death\\" was better that \\"Blue Eyes, Black Hair\\" in that it was shorter and more to the point, but if you want to read a more in-depth look at the same basic story line, then \\"Blue Eyes, Black Hair\\" brings insight into yet another atypical Duras romance even though it tends to drag on. If you like Duras, but want a book that flows easier, I recommend \\"10:30 on a Summer Night.\\""},{"Title":"The Malady of Death","review":"Hmmm. One could write a review longer than the book, it seems; I wonder if that would miss the point. I suppose one could impose a number of interpretations upon this very brief novel, but I though of it as a rather literal story. A very lonely and probably shy man pays a woman to spend several nights with him to see if he can ever love or be loved. Sadly, the answer is no. And then she is gone. His effort to exert and enforce control proves to be impotent. Even though he won't even allow her to voice her pleasure - why? - she seems to feelo only a reserved pity for him; not anger, hatred, resentment, fear, or any other emotion I would expect a woman in her position to feel. Such is his own powerlessness, his malady of death. This is an excellent book which, yes, can be read in the book store without spending any money. Shame on you for doing that, and not supporting such inquisitive literature, and giving yourself the opportunity to re-read and study the text."},{"Title":"The Malady of Death","review":"I read this book when i was on a \\"French thing\\" in my reading, i had read Camus, Satre and Gide before reading this book. I don't think Duras is in quite the same league as those great French writers but she is definately worth reading and based on this book i would like to read more of her work.The malady of death tells the story of a man who has already died inside but continues to live on. He hires a woman for a few days to see if he can learn to feel love and it is she who diagnosis his condition. He cannot love or be loved and this is his tragedy.I enjoyed this book very much but i would minus one star because of its brevity."},{"Title":"The Malady of Death","review":"This book is great to read again and again and still find new meanings and personal understandings each time. It is deceptively light - and the rich meanings underneath the words could easily be missed because of the style in delivery.

It is so short you can read the entire book in a bookstore and save yourself some money! When I purchased this book, I was hoping to read a novel but was disappointed to find that it is nothing short of a really long poem dragged out in size 16 font over 60 pages of reading. Which I read in about 15-20 minutes. Although I found the story quite intriguing it was not what I'd hoped for; it lacked the type of stream of consciousness writing Marguerite Duras is known for which is autobiographical in nature and very real. The malady of death is a poem. So if you are looking for a novel to read, this is not it. I recommend, &quot;The Lover&quot; it is by far her best work."},{"Title":"Criminal procedure","review":"The cases were written in an understandable English language and the CD-ROM was helpful in simplifing the chapters but they were too bare.

The textbook read great however, the supreme court rulings were difficult to follow. At times I thought I thought I was reading one legal outcome only to find out that I had the wrong interpretation of the law as described.

I wanted to find out more about the actual world of the geisha and thought this book was excellent. It was wonderful to read about the life of one of the very best geishas. I only wanted to read more! A great read!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Mineko Iwasaki has told her story in a simple and straightforward way, like a conversation with a trusted friend. She is witty and intelligent and loyal and her account is filled with fascinating details of the Geisha's training and way of life. I no longer read for enjoyment, but once I picked up this book and began reading, I was captured until I had read the whole thing."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I read this because I had been doing research on geisha and truly enjoyed it. I expected it to be more like Memoirs of a Geisha at first, but this is written in a much more Japanese style, almost in the way a geisha would talk. There are streamlined anecdotes that are connected fluidly, though as a whole, it is meant more as a passage in her history and not focused on anything directly like a novel would be. The book is neither better nor worse than Memoirs, because they are two different categories.Iwasaki tries to prove how Arthur Golden had distorted the life of a geisha, but her arguments are never listed. One would imagine she objects mostly to how there is a mizuage, right to take the apprentice's virginty, auctioned off, but Golden's novel took place in an era where this was more acceptable. Iwasaki also tries to explain throughout the novel how she became fed up with the archaic and doomed system of the geisha world, though she does a poor job at explaining its flaws.The book is fascinating as a whole, but she doesn't fully explain her two main points of inspiration on writing this book: what's wrong with Golden's Memoirs and what needs to be done with the geisha system."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I saw a woman reading this book on a flight from Chicago to Boston, and was intrigued. I looked it up as soon as I returned home, hoping it might be a real-life work which would serve as counterpoint to the overrated Memoirs of a Geisha,.To my delight, it has been just that. If you're looking for more costumed cat-fighting then this book isn't for you. If you're looking to read about one real woman's experiences, and get a first-hand glimpse into this part of Japanese culture, then look no further. I found Iwasaki's writing style to be very genuine; indeed, reading Iwasaki describe events was like listening to my sensei tell me stories after class.My only complaint is with the editing of the book -- I've found a couple of spelling/grammatical errors that surprised me. Still, it deserves 5 stars, and a more fair look than fans of Golden's frivolous book are giving it."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"A wonderful story! I couldn't wait to read this book when I found out about it, because I was anxious to read this story through the eyes of a Native Japanese woman and geisha. Being extremely interested in Japanese culture and society of course influenced my reading the book, but I would recommend this book to anyone who would be interested in learning about these extraordinary women.Ms. Iwasaki likens the geisha movement to operatic divas in the west. I found this quite an interesting analogy. I was also impressed by how she handled the common western idea that geisha are simply high-end prostitutes. Effectively, she noted that there was indeed a difference between courteseans and geisha, and that it was common for romantic or sexual relationships to exist between a geisha and her clientele, but that the geisha were never meant to be and neither are they now \\"call-girls\\".Rande Brown is adept at the translation and makes good use of the language differences.All in all, this book is educational, enjoyable, humorous and tear-jerking. Anyone who thinks they are getting an \\"education\\" from reading Arthur Golden's book 'Memoirs of a Geisha' is kidding themselves. It is fiction, not a biography (as Ms. Iwasaki's book).I recommend it!!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I have to admit I only bought this book because I loved &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; by Golden and heard of the controversy surrounding both authors. I really was suprised that Mineko (who was thanked by Golden)was unhappy with his novel and with identifying her as his inspiration. And that she had issues with accuracy even though it is a work of fiction. It becomes very apparent that Mineko argues these accuracy points from the beginning; detailing differences between courtesan (high end prostitutes)and geisha, customs and rituals, even pointing out stories where Golden may have taken too much liberty (for example Mineko describes her friend's history from fishing village to geisha house which seems more the basis of Memoir's character Sayuri than Mineko herself). Overall, great account of her particular life, much more like a journal than an actual biography. I liked learning what a Maiko and Geiko are.The only issues I had were that it was difficult reading, don't know if that is the style, interpretation, editing, but it didn't flow as well as Memoirs. But to compare is apples to oranges. I also felt Mineko was over justifying a lot of her circumstances and decisions. I wasn't put off too much by her arrogance as other reviewers as I understand her purpose of writing this book (trying to clear up misconceptions). Still, was not as &quot;fun&quot; to read. Informative but not as enjoyable.Anyway, read both books together. &quot;Memoirs&quot; for entertainment, &quot;Geisha A Life&quot; for information"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I enjoyed the story all right, but the many, many grammatical and word usage errors were so distracting that I was forcing myself to keep reading after only the first two chapters. As a Japanese translator and meticulous editor myself, I was deeply disappointed by the quality of this book; as a rabid reader, I don't think I'd ever seen such shoddy workmanship make its way to press.I'm not sure a better translation or edit would fix the problems other reviewers mentioned, but it would have helped keep me focused on the story, rather than on its poor presentation. Shame on Ms. Brown and Ms. Bestler for not doing a better job."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This woman acts and thinks like a child. Understandably, her upbringing was not &quot;normal&quot; in the everyday sense, but being of Japanese ancestry, I was annoyed by her large ego and her cease-less bragging about herself."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This autobiography gives us not only an insight into the education, the working conditions and the social status of a geisha, but also into the Japanese society as a whole.To give a few examples: selling children for sex slavery became forbidden only in the year 1959, or, the existing extreme differences of wealth (some people could pay nearly every day extremely expensive geisha parties, while poor people were forces to abandon their children).Besides more personal intimate confidences, the author sketches a good picture of the hardship (sometimes only one hour of sleep per night) of the education and the working conditions, the extreme jealousy and fierce competition inside the geisha guild, the sexual morals (allowance of extramarital relationships) and the colossal sums involved in the geisha business.Not to be missed by the Japan aficionados.I should also recommend the works of Ian Buruma, Lisa Louis and Nicholas Bornoff for a broader perspective on the Japanese entertainment culture."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I loved Memoirs of a Geisha, but this book goes beyond the actual &quot;fairytale story&quot; and becomes it's own classic. Mineko and the translator worked so well to paint a detailed, heartfelt, and honest account of this geisha's remarkable life. I commend them both and count this book as one of my two favorites!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This book is not as good as memoirs for one reason: Memoirs of a Geisha is FICTION!!!!! That means that the author can take liberties in his writing! In this story, mine-Chan is the main geiko (AKA geisha) and she tells her story as if the reader were there to see it. I never got tired of reading it. I loved Memoirs of a Geisha, and this story teaches those who want a more in depth version of memoirs. This story explains everything one can think of. I learned a lot from this book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"You get a lot of her life, that's for sure. But a little too much of I walked down the street, I petted the dog, I bought a ruler. Was hoping for more insight into the Japanese culture and how the Geisha, Geiko, Maiko culture developed. Plus, she blew the whole thing off and became a civilian. But, still readable and interesting."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I bought it used and it is perfect. No defects whatsoever. I thoroughly enjoyed Memoirs of A Geisha (movie and book) but was broken hearted after finding out that it was a tale of fiction. So I got online and searched for books relating to the secretive geisha life and found Miss Mineko Iwasaki. If you've ever read Memoirs you'll see many similarities in the two because Mineko was helpful in Arthur Golden's story however in Mineko's Geisha: A Life it is her true tale of life in Gion Kobu as a Geisha. Mineko Iwasaki was a brilliant geisha and her book is a must have for geisha enthusiasts. She includes pictures but the 300+ pages are mainly text describing her experience. Just beware...I bought 2 different books: one titled Geisha: A Life, the other titled Geisha of Gion, both authored by Mineko however they are the exact same books. Different titles and covers, exact same text and pictures. But I paid about $11 total for both books and plan to give one as a gift so I'm not terribly upset :)"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Enjoyable and interesting, this book is far better than the fictionalized MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and puts to rest the false notion that geisha are high-class call girls. (They're not.) Anyone with an interest in Japan, Japanese culture, geisha, or the arts would appreciate this work. Ms. Iwasaki was privileged to live an extraordinary (if demanding) life, meeting the likes of Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth among other dignitaries (whom she fails to honor, however) and she tells her story with good explanations throughout. One gets the feeling that she never quite understands how privileged she was; especially when, at the height of her popularity, she closes the okiya that was put into her care. Nevertheless, it's a detailed account of her experiences, especially the demanding nature of the profession, and on that account is a valuable contribution to \\"geisha-related\\" literature. My copy included pictures, some in color, which are very enlightening."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I am a big fan of Arthur Golden's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" and Liza Dalby's work as a cultural anthropologist, especially with her book \\"Geisha\\". Thanks to \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", I have been completely fascinated with the concept of geishas. They are definitely misunderstood by western culture as well as the Japanese. Geishas are definitely not prostitutes. Unfortunately they have always been confused with prostitutes for hundreds of years. After reading Arthur's fictional tale of love and deceit and Liza's experience as a geisha, I was hoping to read a book from a professional Japanese geisha's point of view. With the bruhaha over \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", one of the most famous and celebrated geishas in the past century Mineko Iwasaki satisfied my insatiable appetite on the subject by writing her autobiography. I simply loved the book from start to finish. Unlike some reviewers, I had no qualms over the fact that the author talked about herself. I was expecting that she would. Since this is book is an autobiography, I expect the author to have talked about herself and her experiences as a geisha. As I read the book, I couldn't help but notice the similarities between Mineko and Sayuri (from \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\"), and Yaeko (Mineko's oldest sister) and Hatsumomo (the deliciously wicked older 'sister' from \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\"). It is pretty obvious to see the similiarities between Mineko and Sayuri's lives as geishas. The inclusion of pictures was a nice added touch. I wish there was more but they did allow me to see what the people in Mineko's life looked like. I found the book overall compelling and fascinating to read.... it was nice to read a book from a (former) professional geisha's point of view."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I will probably be one of the few that have read the book and not liked it that much. There are things that I loved about this book but those things were difficult to see through all of Mineko's bragging and pretending like some things happened accidently. I think Mineko was probably very skilled at reading people that she wanted to impress and knowing what to do and say to get the right reactions from them. For example; I think she knew exactly what reaction she would get from the people at her first banquet when she went over to the dolls as though she were in awe. Or when she played hard to get with Tosio, etc etc etc. The fact that she was manipulative and knew what to do or say to get those reactions isn't the part that put me off because that was her job. What put me off was her PRETENDING as though it was all an accident or coincidence that everyone found her so appealing. She was so annoying in places in the book that I had to sympathize with the other geikos and maikos who disliked her so much that they played evil tricks on her. (I probably would have been the one putting pins in the bottom of her kimono!)She also contradicts herself throughout the book; first she has friends, then everyone hates her; she wants to please everyone then she hates people. Oy! Just too many times to say.However, I did love learning about how the geisha world is run and everything that it takes to be one. I loved the pictures too. It was nice to see what the people in the book actually looked like. And wasn't Mineko just gorgeous? Okay, I've been catty enough....almost enough to have been a geiko during the60's! ;-)"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Although flaunted as a novel connected to Memoirs of a Geisha it proved to be a sorely disappointing read. Geisha, A Life was neither as interesting or as intelligent as \\"Memoirs\\". While the fictional Sayuri captured my interest and heart in Memoirs, Mineko the nonfictional character did nothing for me. Instead she came off as self-important and somewhat unbelievable. Certainly the only emotion that I felt for this woman was pity to have put her name on such an emotionally immature piece of work. It seems that if she were such a great geisha of her time she could have conveyed that through better narration rather than beat the reader over the head with it tirelessly.If you are truly interested in some good information about the life of a real geisha there are MANY other good books out there (ie, by Liza Dalby and others). Most other books out there tend to go into better detail without all the nonsense. Forget this arrogant woman who tells overly sensational stories and explains her life as a mere laundry list of expensive kimono and famous people."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"To be blunt, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Originally having discovered it on a popular geisha oriented website, I was intrigued to read it after finding out that Mineko Iwasaki advised Arthur Golden for his book, Memoirs of a Geisha. Knowing that Golden's book was merely a fairy tale, I wanted a true to life depiction of what a geisha's, or in this case, geiko's (the meaning of which is explained in the text) life was like and what I found in this book was a true, yet privileged telling of just that.Iwasaki begins the book when she was just a little girl, no older than three. It was enjoyable reading about her childhood experiences and I found them quite interesting in how they influenced her opinions later in life. She moves on to tell about how she met the lady who owns the okiya, or geisha house, where she would one day work, and also about all of the people that lived there. She continues by telling about how she came to live in the okiya and soon she was officially recognized as its effective heiress.Iwasaki's story continues by describing her day to day life from her time as an apprentice maiko all the way through to its end including the later adventures she went on while still working as a geiko with her friends and patrons. She also continues past the end of her career to tell how her life was going around the time the book was written.Overall I found the book to be honest, witty, informative and very enjoyable. That being said, it must be recognized that due to Iwasaki's hard work and obsession to be the best, the life she lead as a geiko was a very privileged one. The story of her life would definitely be different from another geisha's, but that is one of the reasons her life was so unique. I believe that anyone interested in the iconic symbol of Japan, the geisha, should definitely read this book. It was very entertaining and informative from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I felt that this book was very honest, but at the same time sensitive and in some ways surprisingly relate-able. The author talks about the glamorous side of being a Geisha as well as the downside. You feel that you have a real sense of what it's like to step into her shoes. A large part of the book focuses on exploring the unusual family she was born into which is in itself very interesting. I recommend this book to any one who is interested in the Geisha world.Jennifer K.

What a life to have had."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"While true, this book is at a distinct disadvantage if you've come to it by way of reading Memoirs of a Geisha (as I had), in of itself it is a still a poorly written book by an author who is so completed enamored with herself that it makes for a pretty nauseating read. The warning lights went off when she describes her environment in great detail when she is simply a toddler. From that point forward, she paints herself in the best light possible, while taking cheap shots at most members of her family. If this woman could think of more ways to say \\"I'm wonderful, incredibly talented, insightful and amazing\\", I'm sure she would have. She must have very long arms to continually pat herself on the back as much as she does. Save yourself the time. This book did not offer the insights into the world of maiko and geisha as promised. Frankly, after a few pages into it, I simply didn't believe a great deal of what she wrote. It felt like contrived propoganda from a former diva."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Geisha a Life, is a second of a series of books that I have read about Geishas.In Iwasaki San's book, the life of her as a Geisha is very much influenced by her relationship with the Imperial House.From that moment on the arrogance,and suttle way of writing makes you really wonder, what is the truth.I have been in the Japanese culture for over 30 years, and have met people of all standards of life. Believe me when I say suttle arrogance,is an understament.I would read it with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I waited so long to read this book, and hated it after the first page. It's more of a pretentious glorification of herself than a biography."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"It's official - this geisha is the most arrogant person, fictional or non-fictional, I've ever heard of. The best geisha. Always wronged. Extremely soulful. Stunningly beautiful. Hard-working. An excellent dancer. Sincere and trusting. I doubt anyone can say all this about him/herself truthfully, or that they would if they could, and I bet you have no idea how painful it is to hear this from herself every single page of the whole book. At times she seems to have been a raving lunatic, attacking a man with a knife for unintentionally humiliating her, but even this is justified by her elevated sense of honour. She CAN'T have been a good geisha with this attitude.In addition to her very pretentious self, this is not even a good autobiography. She concentrates on insignificant details all the time (five pages on an error she commited dancing!). About half of the book is about her childhood, before she had even started training to be a geisha.Also, I assume most people read this book to learn more about geishas, not this particular person. Despite the title and the blurb, the story is without doubt about HER and her - mostly petty - feelings, not about geishas in general.All in all, this is a painful book. Not recommended at all, especially for those who hope to get something as wonderfully readable and educational as Golden's \\"Memories of a Geisha\\"."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"My interest in \\"Geisha: A Life\\" was due to the fact that the author was the basis of the fictional character for \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\" I was interested to find out why she was upset about \\"Memoirs\\" and what differences she would point out. I was disappointed from the very first. A three-year-old who can psychoanalyze her parents is more than a little unbelievable. From there I felt like she was twisting the truth of other peoples' thoughts and actions in order to justify her own. My other complaints come from the writing style, which I found flat due to the lack of dialogue and interaction, and the history-lesson aspect. The history would be okay if it wasn't presented as a lecture and tainted with her personal opinions. I have not done any other research on geisha, but after reading this book and \\"Memoirs\\" I don't believe Ms. Iwasaki when she denies that sex ever happened for money. She was a little too adamant on the subject, and then her own sexual experiences lead me to believe that sex wasn't exactly taboo for geisha."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Take a subject that fascinates western people, focus on the meaningless and insignificant details of it, put aside all the psychological depth of the characters evolving in this mysterious society, here is the recipe of a gigantic waste.Geisha is poorly written, with cheap literary tricks at the end of each chapter, and a final feeling of not learning anything."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"After reading \\"Memiors of a Geisha\\" and loving every minute of it, I was very excited to read \\"Geisha a Life\\" to get more of the truth behind what it is like to be a Geisha. Well sadly, I was very dissapointed. It was a very easy read but so boring that it ccould not hold my attention. I actaully read a few books inbetween. As far as writing styles goes, it felt like it was written by a child. Although she was an adult at the time of writing this book ,it still seems to be told through thte eyes of a 5 year old. All in all , I would not recomend this book to anyone. If you are under the age of 12 you may enjoy it. i think I will take the fictious verion over this one any day!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"To be honest, I was expecting more of this book. When I first picked it up at the library, it was out of curiosity (as I noticed that it had been connected to both Arthur Golden's fictional book as well as Liza Dalby's book).Overall...this book is dry and quite, quite horrible. The story telling is lacking, Mineko's portrayal of herself is bad and unbelievable, and she refutes certain things that several other authors, who researched more than one geisha life, had cited as true. It all but admits to exaggeration, bias, and inaccuracy.Then again, it is a biography, and nobody should expect it to be as accurate throughout as researched, historical material."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"When I bought this book, I had already read Memoirs of a Geisha, which of course a fictional account of geisha. I'm sorry to say, this book, to a certain extent mirrors Memoirs, with one major difference. Mineko Iwasaki is an extremely unlikable person, and it shows in her book.The highest earning (and most popular, she claims) geisha of her time, Mineko comes across as rude, arrogant, and narcissistic. Her one and only wish was to be a dancer, she says. She didn't care about being a geisha, and in fact quit at what would have been the height of her career. For instance, she claims to have been so furious that Prince Charles signed one of her fans, that she returned it to him explaining she didn't want it anymore, essentially because his signature had spoiled it. She then claims to have thrown it away.She was the most beautiful, the most popular, the highest earning geisha of all time. The other geisha were mean to her, humiliated her, picked on her, etc. She had no female friends because they were all jealous of her. Typical self absorbed person, who perhaps was treated this way, but had probably deserved it for her nastiness.Then there are the times that she physically attacked some of her customers for insulting her. I'm sorry, but if these incidents, of which there were many, were the true way she behaved, I suspect she wouldn't have had many customers. I find her writing more than just a little stretched. I truly can't imagine a woman who acted this way to have been in any way popular. Which leads me to one of two conclusions...One, that she wasn't rude or violent like she claims, which pretty much makes her a liar, or Two, she wasn't terribly popular.If you want a good read about geisha, Memoirs still wins out. Arthur Golden obviously did his homework, since his information as to the lifestyle, behavior, etc. is mostly confirmed here, and at least the story is fast moving, fun, and the main character is not so repugnant."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I ordered this book, but I did not notice that the shipping and handeling was $35.99. I sent them a cancellation e-mail BEFORE it shipped (about 2 days before it shipped) hoping that they would cancel it. So two days passed, and they finally replied WHEN IT SHIPPED indicating that it could not be cancelled due to the fact that it shipped, it's like they wated until it shipped to reply to me. Expecting the letters on the pages to be gold, due to how expensive the book was, I was dissapointed to observe the front cover RIPPED. Bad service, bad product, it's a shame I can't give you 0 stars in review."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I love this book, so much so I wish the author would write another!Historical fiction & non fiction is my favorite genre and this really fit the bill. I bought another one for my daughter too!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"After having read Memoirs of a Geisha, it was wonderful to find another story of a geisha. While not everything in Mr. Golden's book was accurate, I still enjoyed it as a good story. If you are to read both Golden's book and Ms. Iwasaki's book, you cannot compare the two. Golden's book is a novel and reads as a romance story. Iwasaki's book is her life story and cannot be read as a piece of fiction. Many people compare them and are more taken in with Golden's style of writing, which is very poetic and again, romantic, but Iwasaki's is straight forward and does not try to cater to anyone's ideal.The two stories are very similar because Golden used Iwasaki's story and transformed it enough to be his own, though it was not his story to tell, so even though they have many things in common, they still should not be compared on that basis. Golden's tale is a work of fiction while Iwasaki's tale is all her own. I would highly recommend this book, although it may appeal more to people who like historical books, as it is an autobiography. As in all I found that Iwasaki's tale was fascinating and engaging. While some may believe parts of it are too much to be true, I point out that we cannot begin to claim to understand all the inner workings of the Flower and Willow world. Iwasaki Mineko is a true, former geiko (Kyoto geisha), and she lived a very amazing, hard life. I believe that she has a right to be heard and let her story be known."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I didn't know what to expect when reading this book. All I knew is I wanted to know more about what it is truly like to live the life as a Geisha. I felt the story line was a bit boring a times. I didn't think that much detail needed to be portrayed in the dress and hairstyles. I felt as though I was reading to take a test on the definition of a hairpiece or hairstyles etc. However I did like the feel of the book and it did give me good knowledge on what its like to be a geisha. I suppose I expected the details of the storyline to be more exciting. Instead the details of her clothes, dress, and tea ceremonies were the main them of the book. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested on the history of Geisha clothes, dance, and hair."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I like to read about Japanese and Chinese culture, so this book was appealing to me for that reason alone. Iwasaki provides an authoritative look at the business end of being a geisha--and reveals just how much the geisha culture drove a certain part of Japan's economy, providing jobs for many people involved in making the elaborate obi and kimono worn by geisha, for instructors in the fine arts practiced by geisha, owners of tea shops, dressers, and many others. I did feel when reading the book that the author wanted to portray herself in a relatively favorable light; this is no contemporary, Western-style, tell-all confessional. There is a feeling of distance between author and reader. Among the most interesting revelations were the chapters describing the author's adoption as a young child by the geisha family, and the lengthy separation process from her birth family. Iwasaki had several sisters, some of whom also were adopted into the geisha family, though only the author had great success. It seemed to me there were more stories to be told here, but that was not the author's purpose in writing the book. I enjoyed the book and recommend it for anyone who might be interested in reading on this topic."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"One of the reasons Mineko \\"came out\\" and decided to write this book was to set the misrepresentation of Geisha culture by Arthur Golden, whom she sued for the publishing of Memoirs of A Geisha (and settled out of court).The biggest items in contest were the facts that the concept of the Mizuage as a fee for a deflowering ceremony of a girl only applies to the oiran and tayu (prostitutes), not Geishas (where the word stands for the amount of money made by appearances over a period of time) and the notion that Geishas don't provide sex, only company. These were two items that was misrepresented by Golden.If by definition, an autobiography is to be a revealing self-portrait, then Geisha, A Life succeeds brilliantly. As readers, it is human nature, I think, to seek common ground and find people we can identify with when we pick up a book, especially a biography. However, if one can accept that the act of reading can also serve as an insight to individuals whom he or she will never cross paths with, then the absence of common ground no longer becomes an issue.Like many others here, I found this book through the controversial source for Golden's Memoirs of A Geisha. I was hoping to read about the witty conversations Geishas are reknown for. Certainly, Iwakasi- who never lets up from constantly reminding us, until the very final page- portraying herself as the greatest legend in the Geisha culture in the last hundred years, would be positively emanating with wit in every page.There was none.Instead, we are treated to a 300-page reiteration of a narrator who continues to win in almost every situation. She is No.1, inspiring jealousy in her colleagues; she excels in her dance, she instills mass hysteria and adoration from her numerous fan clubs; she is highly in demand in the Gion kobu; people sneak photos and out-takes of her into posters, commercials, and annual events, she makes so much money that she owned over three hundred kimonos worth tens of thousands of dollars, she comes from an aristocratic family (and yet, curiously, she had to \\"chose\\" a hard life of work at the age of five, separating from her family which she points out, was the only time she was truly happy in life).Even when she was at the point of retiring, not only does a good-looking younger man ask for her hand in marriage, but she keeps all her appointments, have an affair with a married superstar, and manages to make the Queen of England jealous enough to send the Duke of Edinburgh to the doghouse for paying too much attention to our heroine.She openly admits she doesn't like people. She is impetulant and spoiled from a young age. There is a unfortunate dearth of any humane voice in her narration. At the same time, she overworks herself because she wants to be liked by everyone.If all of this doesn't seem to add up, it's because the root of the story lies in one line, imparted to Mineko by her father at the beginning and the end of his life. \\"The samurai betrays no weakness even when starving. Pride above all.\\"Given this filter, you begin to realize that you have to read this autobiography as if it was selectively recounted with a heavily prejudiced pen, often in the writer's favor.The only big dramatic moment occurs on Page 159, when our author pays a visit to her Onesan (the mentoring older sister to a maiko at the Okiya) who also turns out to be her real sister. She finds their mother hunched over like a maid, cleaning something. The older sister enters and screams \\"This is the [...] who sold us and killed Masayuki.\\" Our author cries and runs out of the house.So the reader first thinks \\"whatever happened to making her own decision at five years old to lead a superstar life of a Geisha? I guess I'll find out in the next chapter.\\"We never do.It immediately jumps back to the busy schedule of our triumphant heroine. All we have to go by is the closing chapter line \\"I never went back. Some proprieties were just not worth it.\\"There is never a Geisha that equals Mineko in the narration. We are told there is a graceful beauty who was an exquisite dancer in the Gion district. Her name is Satoharu, but she is only alluded to in passing. Why? We get a glimpse of the reason on pg 232, as Mineko pleads with her Okiya mother Masako to dress down when they go meet Mineko's love interest. Here is a 21 year old superstar Geisha at the top of her game, with men falling all over her, and she is begging a 47 year old woman to go in everyday clothes because she couldn't bear being outdone?A person who doesn't like competition can tell a story only one way.One of the inherent problems of a non-fiction account of Japanese culture is that the subject is known to be extremely insulated as a community. Even if they beg to differ, or they are put off by a gross misrepresentation of the facts, we, as non-Japanese people, will never know. I think this sets the stage for a free-for-all, with the prize going to the person who choses to speak.And that's how I made it through the last hundred pages. It became more of game for me as a reader, to see how the narrator could continue to cram yet another example of self-glorification into her story.In this, she did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I thought this book was amazing. I love almost everything about the japanese culture and geisha seem to stand out to me the most. I have a few books on the subject, including this one. I thought the way Mineko told her story was very captivating and I personally could not put the book down. I liked hearing the discriptions of the kimono and seeing the pictures of her as a maiko and a geisha. She is a gorgeous women and her beauty as a geisha stands out among the rest. If you love anything about geisha, read this book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Mineko Iwasaki tells the story of her life as one of the most renowned geisha in recent history. She was inspired to tell her story because she found offensive the common misconceptions about geisha that many people hold. She felt the only way to clear up the false ideas and impressions was to open the doors on the world of geisha and shine a light on her story, through her experience and her thoughts.Her story begins with her requesting to leave home at an early age to begin training with a Geisha at the age of five. The training is at best difficult and demanding both mentally and physically, but the emotional toll seems extremely severe. She perseveres through it all and her success is unprecedented. Her reflections on the demanding style of life lead her to a decision to retire at the age of 29 and to begin what she perceives to be a normal life.The cultural differences are immense and at times difficult to comprehend. Mineko Iwasaki is not a sympathetic character and yet her story is a compelling memoir of an open and honest nature."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Allright, so this book may not be presenting much historical facts on the generations of geisha, but focuses more on self-glorification and the glamour of her own successes.. with a touch of arrogance on the side, as well as a sense of pride... but cmon, admit it.. she displayed great work of being a geiko and surely earned her way to the top. For some of you to ask \\"WHO CARES\\" simply doesn't justify your interest in geisha life. Geisha life is a question of outer surface and glamour presented every single minute... not the inner-personalities inside.Her arrogance is well justified to the point where her honesty on the cruelty of other geiko as well as hers are balanced. It's the way that geiko societies work; perhaps I could not have found a more \\"survival of the fittest\\" athmosphere than this.Over all, this book is beautiful, the story, the plot.. the characters are not only interesting but quite surprising to the usual American mind who would stupidly mistake it for simple \\"Arrogant, Spoiled Brat\\"... that's foolishness.Read this book with the intent of seeing it from a Geiko's perspective, not an average conscientious individual.I most loved the situation with how she resents Prince Charle's autographing her folding fan... and how she resents the rude \\"i'm-not-eating-foreign-food\\" by the queen.. leading to a conversation witht he Duke of Edinburge and arouses jealousy between the two royal couples. Intense!True.. it should not have ended so quickly, I'm sure there were many more details. but hey... it's satisfactory enough for a thorough read of 2 days.and her principle was most inspiring.. \\"the samurai betrays NO weakness... even when starving.. Pride above all\\".... well!! doesnt the so-called \\"spoiled arrogant brat\\" admit it! Well done!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I read this book and found that it was very interesting. I learned some things and the book was very good at dispeling some of the myth of geisha. However, I found that it was not written very well. Somehow the tone did not seem genuine but this may be a problem of the English translation rather than from the author herself. I also did not think that the book went into the level of detail that I was expecting, especially since this was a book written by a former great Geisha.All in all, I was somewhat disappointed."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This book was not as fluent as \\"memoirs of a geisha\\"...but I enjoyed it very much. The 1st hand experience of someone that had lived the Geisha life style. I really appreciateded it. I would read it again!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This is a beautiful story about a little girl who became one of the most famous geisha in Japan. Mineko, which is her adopted geisha name not her birth name, moved into the Iwasaki geisha house when she was only five years old. She started her artistic training when she was merely six. At a time when most five and six year olds in America are starting kindergarden, playing video games and sports, Mineko was already \\"working.\\" Her passion and greatest devotion became the dance.This biography came out in 2002 which may or may not have been around the time Memoirs of a Geisha published as well. Both novels are strikingly similar I noticed, especially when it dealt with World War II. But this novel, as opposed to Memoirs, is an actual biography.The Japanese terminology is so fascinating to learn and explained very well. I learned that geisha in training were called maiko, or \\"women of dance,\\" and geisha or geiko actually means \\"women of art.\\" For a period of twenty five years (from age five until twenty-nine), Mineko practiced all the traditional and ancient customs including dance forms, music, and tea ceremonies (ochaya). Maiko is simply amazing. Despite learning traditional customs she is also an incredibly skilled business woman. She worked 7 days a week, 365 days a year, from the time she was fifteen until she was twenty-one. In the Iwasaki okiya she was the hardest working and most devoted geisha.Her experience with love was also very humorous. Because she worked so intently she viewed most men as business transactions and nothing more. One man, by the name of Toshio, eventually changed her views. After visiting her multiple times he finally expressed his love for her, which she just scolded him as a young child (despite him being twice as old) and he was also married! Toshio explained they were both in a loveless marriage, but Maiko didn't want to hear of it; she refused him completely. Finally she told him, after his countless advances, if he came to the Gion Kobu every day for three years then maybe she would consider it. She pretty much figured that was that.He came every single day for three years. But despite this their romance became rocky and unstable. He never left his wife. She later met a young painter, Jin, that won her over.When Mineko decided to retire at the \\"old age\\" of twenty-nine, she was sent thousands of letters from her adoring fans. She met kings and queens, royalty, presidents, diplomats, politicians, and celebrities from everywhere in the world. Her assets were in the millions. She opened up her own club, then later sold it. She decided to get her art license and became an art dealer.The beauty of this novel is how truthful and painful it was for her to grow up. I didn't really feel that she ever had a childhood, she always worked and trained every day. Her training did pay off because she was so incredibly popular, but there was still a hint of sadness in my opinion."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"As the previous reviewer has pointed out, this is merely an account by one geisha. It is Mineko's version of her own life as a geisha and should not be seen as a representative account of geisha in general.I find it troubling that in discussion of a foreign culture, there is a tendency to generalize. The geisha community is quite an exclusive group and holds on to its own customs and stringent etiquettes. Nevertheless, it is not a homogenous community in that the personality, background, aptitude, and fortune of geishas differ greatly. Mineko was fortunate to have the support and care of so many people. I am sure there have also been geishas like Arthur Golden's Sayuri; perhaps there are others who are more unfortunate and has to resort to selling their body for money.Mineko's account of her life is engaging and thoroughly enjoyable, even though it often comes across as self-aggrandizing. Unlike \\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" which I find stiff and uninspiring, this book has a good flow to it and keeps you going.I would really like to read a book about geisha written not by geishas, but by someone who has close contanct with them, such as their hairdresser, maid, or their patrons. Such a book would help bring a new perspective into this now anachronistic group that still fascinates many."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I picked up this autobiography because I thought it would be interesting and informative, shedding light even more truthfully and accurately than the excellent fiction Memoirs of a Geisha. I was mostly disappointed. Mineko Iwasaki might have been one of the most famous geiko of her generation, but she lets us know that over and over again, and, really, who cares? Even more appalling was her selfishness from early childhood on. Mineko (nee Masako) was coddled and pampered her entire life. She was spotted as a mere toddler by the head of the Iwasaki geisha organization and marked as the family's successor. She was treated to the finest in everything; every important moment of her life was marked with celebration and fame, and the best of everything. She was spoiled and indulged, all in the hopes of continuing the excellence of the Iwasaki tradition after its then-current matriarch passed on. What did she do? Dismantled the entire enterprise! Her adopted grandmother and mentor must have been rolling over in her grave watching her last great hope, her final oeuvre, turning the place into a beauty salon or whatever and letting go all the geiko who had placed their futures into the Iwasaki hands. The book is uninteresting, self-important, rambling, and maddening. Mineko Iwasaki makes a barely transparent attempt to justify her selfish behavior, while berating others (such as her oldest sister) for themselves going against revered traditions. Stick to Memoirs of a Geisha for a far better read."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Excellent! At the age of five, Mineko Iwasaki was sent by her parent's to an okiya, a geisha house, as the house's atatori, that is, the intended successor. She studied dance, and became very well-known. This is a very interesting description of the life and training of geiko, as the Kyoto geisha are known.At the age of twenty-nine, having inherited, she shut down the Iwasaki okiya. This was a rather disturbing action to me. The author describes her dissatisfaction with the way the \\"flower and willow world\\" was run, and her decision to close the house was intended to jolt the system. Of course, it did nothing of the kind. She does not say anything about what happened, following her action, to the people who were dependent on the house for their livelihood, and I found that omission disturbing.Having also read Arthur Golden's extremely popular Memoirs of a Geisha, I was intrigued by the differences between the two descriptions. But I don't know whether the differences are attributable to the different eras about which the two were writing (Iwasaki was born in 1949, Golden's book covers the period from just before to just after WWII), or if Golden was exercising \\"artistic license\\"."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"After first reading Memoirs of a Geisha, by Authur Golden, I wanted to find out how accurate it was. After reading Geisha, A life, I felt that the author Mineko Iwasaki truly represented herself. From her book you can tell that the she is an authentic Geisha wanting to dispel inaccuracies that Memoirs of a Geisha created. It is disappointing to know that society is so willing to accept inaccuracies regarding women and their accomplishments."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Like most of the readers out here, I too read \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" and was enthralled with it. Although technically fictional, the book still contains broad and specific strokes of information that allow us entry into the \\"floating world\\" therefore giving it credence and credibility. Mineko Iwasaki's book also allows us a view into the life of geiko but, as with most autobiographies, the story is told from the most advantageous point of the living author. In Ms. Iwasaki's case, her story is interesting but also questionable.To begin, she has recollections of conversations between people where she wasn't even present which adds that element of embellishment. Additionally, though people accuse her of not understanding her position as atotori, I believe she fully understood what this meant but the real question is why was she supposedly chosen at such a young age. The concept of Madame Oima meeting Mineko, then aged three, and having a sudden feeling that she'd just met her atotori and therefore needing Mineko at all costs smacks of something more necessitating than honorific. I suspect highly that Mineko's family ancestry was just the required lineage of titles Madame Oima needed since Mineko tells us directly that the Iwasaki okiya was in financial trouble. She glosses over that point rather quickly.Mineko does an excellent job in pointing out the artistry and value of the kimono. What she doesn't indicate is that the kimono is not the property of the geiko but that of the house. Only those in highest ranking positions are allowed to \\"own\\" a kimono outright and she was one of those who was allowed this ownership.Where the story falls flat is in it's telling all around. It moves from subject to subject without real flow and much of it centers around repetitious information. Mineko wants us to understand Japanese culture but she herself appears to have been very closed about understanding other cultures. Her disgust with Prince Charles' faux pas over signing her fan without her consent indicates her inability to make allowances for the ignorance of someone else but she makes no such excuses for her own ignorance. She's vain, arrogant and ambitious making her perfectly human and therefore exactly the point of her book. Geisha is a fantasy world.I recommend this book for a few reasons. One, it allows for an alternate perspective even if questionable. Secondly, it gives insight into the workings of the mind of someone from another culture and shows just how vast differences in perspective can be. Finally, it reveals that beneath the calm and always polite veneer of Japanese society, there exists true human nature....a thing we all possess regardless of culture."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This book is an easy read, and the subject matter - a geisha's life in her own words - is not only extremely fascinating but is also unavailable anywhere else; Mineko Iwasaki is the first geisha to tell her own story.However, despite the enrapturing subject matter, this book is deeply flawed. To begin with, Iwasaki's writing is simplistic and not closely copy-edited - there are minor grammatical errors starting in the second chapter.In addition to these annoying errors, the author's attitude is blatantly self-serving, self-righteous, and (in my opinion) the factual details of the story are highly unlikely.For instance, Iwasaki details crystal clear memories begining before age three and credits her infant self with complex thought patterns that would be unusual in an adolescent, much less a toddler. At every possible opportunity, the author ascribes emotions to others without supporting evidence in order to make herself appear better and to blacken others, including her own sisters.While I do not expect much more from autobiography, the sledgehammer bluntness of this self-serving process is offensive as it unfolds. Many of the conclusions she draws insult the intelligence of the reader with their obviousness and it just goes on and on and on.My advice would be to read this book only if you are a big fan of Arthur Golden's &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; (Golden based his book loosely on Iwasaki's life and picking up on the similar points and the changes he made is enlighting for fans of the novel) or you just can't read enough about Japanese culture. But wait for it to come out in paperback - it's not worth the cash and not engrossing enough to reread. And take the &quot;facts&quot; of the story with a grain of salt.If you haven't read &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha,&quot; do so instead of reading this book, then decide. And if you are looking for something a bit more realistic and gritty, I would reccomend &quot;Sandakan Brothel No. 8,&quot; by Yamazaki Tomako. It's an excellent memoir of one of the karayuki-san - poor rural Japanese women sold into overseas prostitution between the 1860s and the 1930s."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"When I bought the book I wanted to learn more of the Geisha tradition and by that of Japanese culture in general.I never had believed that such a restricted life is still possible today. Mineko Iwasaki was taken away from her family when she was a small child. With much discipline she learnt traditional dancing, singing, playing instruments and roles in theatre, always being observed by elderly ladies, who wanted to educate her, eg by humiliation via wrong accusations. The meaning of such is explained clearly, as all the other details of the life of a geisha.A very interesting recommendatory book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This book was incredible. This book is a true story about the life of a Geisha. It has cleared up so many of my misconceptions. I always thought from other books I had read that these women were basically well trained prostitutes. This is not so. The Gion Kobu is a city of true art and traditional japanese culture. These women go through more training in dance and music and other art forms than I ever would have imagined. In addition it also gives you insight into the japanese world during a time of war and during times of peace. You can really learn a lot from this book. How their makeup was done, how to open a door, what they wore from head to toe and even the importance of tea! So, if you are interested in a book about sex scandals and viscious plots look elsewhere, but if you want an amazingly true story of the most recognized symbol of a fascinating culture, this book is for you. ^_^"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Mineko is probably best known in the Western world as the geisha who sued Arthur Golden who wrote the bestseller &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, in which there are many inaccuracies which help to further the misconceptions long held in the western world that geisha are nothing more than ladies of the night. As a result of this Mineko decided to publish a book about her own life, it certainly is not going to provide you with all the technical information some might wish to read about geisha - but what it does provide to us is real feelings, real thoughts and a real person, and a first-hand account of the training and artistic skills taught that are required to become a geiko (geisha). Mineko's story is certainly quite fascinating to read and delivers to us a real and personal journey through the life of one of the most famous geiko to emerge from Gion. She talks about right from the beginning, when she chose to become an atotori (a heir of the house) of the Iwasaki okiya right through to her sudden and surprising retirement at the young age of 29. If you want to learn of the real lives of these \`women of dance and music' read this book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Even after I read a review that the person was not happy with the book, that the author showed no emotion, I still ordered the book and am glad that I did. If one is interested in the life of Geisha, then they would love this book. It is not a love story to be read with emotion but a factual book which I read in a \\"narrative\\" way or how Memoirs of a Geisha was narrated in the movie. I have found it very interesting and I think the author, Mineko, did an excellent job. The book was very informative and hope to find more books like this on the subject of Geisha."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"That might be the only way to describe it. I felt as if Iwasaki-san was speaking right to me, telling her life's story. It was touching and a really good book overall. If you've read Memoirs of a Geisha, read this. It explains about &quot;mizuage&quot;... Mr. Golden was kind of off on that one. Mineko-san is a better main character than Sayuri in my opinion."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Were do I start... I've been fasinated by the Japanese culture for many years and when I saw this book in Hastings I immeditatly begged my mother to buy it for me.

But then Christmas morning I opened up my fourth box and was reintoduced into the wonderful erotic world of the Geisha.This book is truly a treasure for anyone who has a thrist for true culture. It reaches a depth that most novels barly scrape and tells of the REAL expiriances of the Geisha. Not some other world where they are nothing but concubines! You see the world of one of the greatest Geisha's who ever performed. Through the drama of leaving her parents, training as an apprentice, and falling in love you tag right along feeling every pulse of her life.However Minko-san's life is not just strutting around in a kimono and lighting men's cigatetes... she also has a mind, a sense of humor, and a sense of intergrity. There is this one scene in the book were a man comes up to her and grabs her chest... she in turn glares at him, walks gracfully over to a shrine, picks up a brick, and chaces him around the house until she finnely gets him!This book is marvolus! Anyone can enjoy it. If not for the culture and expiriance, buy it for the pictures!! The book has wonderful photographs of Minako-san, her family, and her costumes. ;)"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This book is excellent. Straight forward and entertaining, you can really see things from the inside of the Geisha craft, and learn a lot. Arthur Golden's book is a novelized version of her story. Both are excellent, one being real, the other fictional. I did not care for Liza Dalby's book, if you don't read the aforementioned 2 books first, Dalby's book does not make sense.NOTA: este libro esta traducido al castellano."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Yes I am yet another who first read Memoirs of a Geisha, heard Mineko helped Golden with the novel and thus wanted to read her biography. I wish I hadn't though for the most part.Why? It's choppy for one and just dry. The beginning was interesting, but also a little funny. I guess this is the most accurate book on Geisha, but I could not believe that at- what?- age 4 Mineko already was wanted as the one who manages the okiya. I mean how could they even tell Mineko was going to be famous when she grew up? They didn't even know her and right away it was decided she would be heir? It's no wonder she's got a high opinion of herself, I think anyone would have been if already assumed such an honored position at her age.And that was another problem. Mineko is not exactly likeable. In some parts of the books she acts so spoiled and foul- tempered. I cannot really blame her though since from a young age she was totally allowed to be spoiled. And even though she speaks of working so terribly hard to be \\"number one\\" the truth is she didn't live quite a hard life as others had to. She always was spoken highly of, always thought of with such great optimism, etc. by everyone. She just had it a lot easier than other Geisha had to and so I was tired of her complaining how hard she had it. She wonders why so many were jealous of her when it's pretty obvious why.Yet I am glad to hear she got her fame for the most part because of her working hard, and that she wanted to prove to everyone she could work hard and deserve the praise given to her. And there were parts in the novel that were interesting, but for the most part Minkeo does unfortunately comes off as uninteresting and not entirely too pleasant to be around. I am glad she did clear up a few details that supposedly Golden was wrong about in Memoirs of a Geisha, but overall Memoirs and Sayuri herself in the story are much more entertaining to read about than Mineko and her life. But hey that's fiction- it's meant to be geared towards entertaining.I wouldn't recommend this though. It's not really worth the time unless you really just want to know the woman behind the popular novel of Memoirs of a Geisha. 3/5"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I read this book on a whim but was astonished to see such a powerful and independent woman in a role that I had previously equated with sex slave. Minako's grace and poise tempered with her strong convictions and love of dance propelled her to the top of her field. The intricate details of the Geisha life and customs make this is a must read."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I read this book out of sheer curiosity about the life of a geisha and finished it by picking up tidbits of the rich culture of the Japanese.This is the first book on this topic that I have ever read so I can't compare it to anything else but I will say that I learned a lot and it sparked an interest to read more about this in the future.I was blown away by the incredible memory of Mineko. She remembered the smallest of details of life with her parents (whom she resided with only until the age of 5) and she was able to retain so much information in her early childhood during her training. That determination fostered a workaholic approach to her career when she became a maiko, where she set out to become Number One.One thing that stood out for me was when Mineko pointed out that no two kimonos are alike and that the patterns on them indicates what stage a woman is in in her career.I also learned about the turning of the collar and the differences between a red and white collar (red symbolizing a child, white an adult). At the age of 21, a woman becomes a full-fledged geiko.There was an antagonist in the book, Yaeko. Someone needed to teach this woman (and, apparently, her sister) something called manners. This woman dumped all over Mineko, making life miserable for her during her training and deliberately embarassing her in front of customers. (Nice to see her get it in the end proving that &quot;what goes around comes around.&quot;)Towards the end of the book, Mineko details how much the performers give to the profession but how the profession does not give back to the people who breathe life into it (not her words). She also sadly points out that the world of the geisha is dying out.And despite her gripes with &quot;the system&quot; that she tried for so long to change and couldn't, she is truly sad about its bleak future."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"When she was only five years old, Mineko Iwasaki decided to be a geisha. She began training in the arts of dance and etiquette since then. In this book she tells her life story. She described her upbrining life at the Iwasaki okiya. I enjoy reading this book because there is no geishas in the history of Japan has the courage to come forward in public to tell her story! However I feel angry with her parents because they allowed her to be a geisha when she was only five years old. She was too young to make such decision on her own. In order to be adopted by Iwasaki okiya, she went to the court at the age of 10 and 12 to declare that she was no longer the daughter of Tanaka, her own parents. She also terminated her junior high education just because she needed to concentrate on her professional career. I feel terribly sorry for her when I read those incidents in her life. I agreed with her sister, Yaeko that her parents somewhat sold her to Iwasaki okiya for money. This book not only unveils Mineko's life but also help explain what it is really like to be a geisha. It is a wonderful book about the geisha culture."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Although an interesting read, the autobiography lacks any real flow. The author jumps so often from one time period or story to another that you always wonder where you are in the time line.Also the author seems in such a rush to put down any suggestion of sexual undertones in the society, that it becomes over done. On the other hand she admits to an affair with a married man as normal.All through the author uses a snobbish tone and that is rather off putting. Also I think that claiming to remember in perfact clairity events from the age of two and three a bit crazy.I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Needed the book for my world lit class...speedy service, cheap price, and book was in Excellent condition! would NEVER think twice about doing business with them again!!!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I loved Memoirs of a Geisha, both the movie and the book. So when I found out that the Geisha on whom the book was based on or rather inspired from has written an autobiography, I was thrilled. Apparently, Ms Mineko Iwasaki was very upset over the way Geisha's were portrayed by Arthur Golden and that he breached an understanding that her name was not to be mentioned anywhere, but he did, in the book as well as in interviews. She also got death threats from people who thought she had defaced Japanese culture. So she decided to write a book of her own.Iwasaki's parents were distraught when she decided to become a Geisha when she was just 5 years old. How a girl so young could make such a decision and how could the parents agree to it is something beyond me, even though she has tried to explain it. She goes to stay in an Okiya (a geisha house) and she is initiated into the trainings and numerous classes when she turns six.A woman who is training to become a Geisha has a very disciplined life. There is traditional dancing, singing, playing instruments and also studying. Would-be Geisha's are allowed to study until Junior High, in fact it's kind of a rule.Iwasaki excels in dancing and she is introduced as a maiko when she is 15 years old. After a few years of working as a maiko she becomes a geiko at age 21, which are the same names for a Geisha, just different hierarchies. She soon becomes one of the top geisha's in Gion. In fact, today she almost has a legendary status.What surprised me most was how systematic and well organized the world of a Geisha is. There is a list of all the girls that are going to come out as maiko's. There is a Kimono Dealers association. There is a very strict hierarchy which if broken can result in serious consequences. The earnings of all the geisha's are reported to the Geisha Committee (I think that's whats it is), so everyone knows who the highest earning geisha for a particular year is.The Geisha world itself is so complicated or may be I felt that way because I had not heard a lot about it. There is a rule of what kind of and what design a Kimono can have depending on seasons. Same goes for hairstyles and ornaments. It was exhausting just reading about it.It is very clear that Ms Iwasaki loved and respected what she did and she has tried to dispel all the myth's regarding geisha's. She often sounds a bit egoistic and someone that could do no wrong. But we also need to understand the world she lived in, a world when no one, including one's sister cannot be trusted. She lived by the motto: The Samurai betrays no weakness, even when starving. Pride above all. I can understand how easily pride can be mistaken for ego in the geisha world.There are lots of minute details on a lot of things like the music school, the dance school, the different kinds of geisha's, the customs and traditions. There are also descriptions on Kimono designs, hair ornaments and the kind. For e.g take this:My Kimono was made out of figured satin in variegated turquoise. The heavy hem of the train was dyed in shades of burnt orange, against which floated a drift of pine needles, maple leaves, cherry blossoms and chrysanthemum petals. My obi was made of black damask decorated with swallowtail butterflies. I wore a matching obi clasp of a swallowtail butterfly fashioned out of silver.There are many passages like these which some people may find dry and boring. But I loved them, it helped me immerse myself in the book more. In fact 2 days after finishing this book I struggled with picking up another that was as engrossing as this one.If I have to compare this book with Memoirs of a Geisha, I would say both are very different from each other. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we get a young, naive and endearing Sayuri, where as here we get a strong willed, dedicated Mineko. Arthur Golden seems to have picked the main storyline from one of the minor characters and mixed it with Iwasaki's story to make it more dramatic. If you are looking for a \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" kind of book, you will be disappointed. But both are brilliant in their own way, one as page turning fiction and one as a real look into the Japanese culture. The simple fact that Geisha, A Life is a true story gives it a different feel altogether."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Like many others, I came upon \\"Geisha: A Life\\" when doing some research after reading Arthur Golden's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\". The two are radically different. Both are good in their own way, but you can't pick up Mineko Iwasaki's autobiography expecting the same thing. \\"Memoirs\\" is a typical Hollywood-type story: the main character comes from the lowest of lows and faces many trials before working her way to the top. Iwasaki's story, on the other hand, is that of a spoiled girl who was brought up to be the best and nothing less, and somehow can't seem to understand why other people don't like her.First, let me say what Iwasaki does well. She paints a beautiful picture of the Gion Kobu and the life of the geisha there. She draws you in from the beginning with her photographic memory of her entire life, including the patterns on each and every kimono she wore.Now on to the not-so-good... the biggest flaw I found was that the reader can feel absolutely no sympathy toward Iwasaki. She was not sold into the life of a geisha, she made the choice freely, and she was raised to be heir to the geisha house from the time she was 6 years old. She was spoiled and privileged from day 1. Iwasaki even goes on to explain later in the book how she attempted to keep her own apartment, but she knew nothing whatsoever about living by herself. She didn't know the concept of money, and in fact, she rarely even SAW money. While this does paint an interesting portrait about the priveleged life of some geisha, it certainly doesn't make the reader empathize toward Iwasaki. She also strives to be \\"Number 1\\", with no regards to friends or relationships, but then seems upset when the other geisha don't exactly warm up to her. And although Iwasaki is straightforward, honest, and doesn't gussy anything up for the reader, her writing seems to lack passion.I'm not telling you not to read this book. If you are a lover of the geisha culture, or simply want an inside look at a geisha's life, it's worth a read. However, I think that nearly anyone who reads it will have a hard time getting through the entire thing without scoffing once or twice (or many times) at Iwasaki's lack of passion, compassion, and relate-ability."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"A few years ago I read Memoirs of a Geisha and loved it. Although the book was supposed to be based on Mineko Iwasaki's life, after reading Geisha: A Life, it's clear the Memoirs author took great liberties.Where Memoirs contained a juicy fictionalization, this title is much more straight forward and explanatory about the life of a Geisha. It clearly details the schooling and discipline necessary to become Japan's top Geisha. It would have been nice to know less about the classroom and more about the inner workings of the Okiya.While this book is not as beautifully written as Memoirs, true Geisha enthusiasts will want to read this version. Consider it an historic account of a nearly bygone era."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I found this book to be extremely intriguing and informative. Quite possibly fabricated in some aspects, but when your trying to learn about a culture that has so much secrecy behind it you read into whatever you can find. The secrecy is probably what makes it so fascinating to begin with!In attempts to preserve something thats so important to a culture the author may or may not have been entirely truthful with things. A case of \\"what should be\\" or what is expected of the geisha vs. what actually exists. The depiction over the years of the geisha has resulted in a bit of a smeared reputation, I think her desire to preserve the name may have overwhelmed the actual fact.Regardless I enjoyed this book very much."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This is the ultimate book you should consider when trying to get a first hand account the details of a life of a Geisha.Mineko Iwasaki is highly respected and is referred as one of the best Geisha to ever come along in her generation.This book was interesting and exciting to read.If you have read Memiors of a Geisha, you will know that Mineko's story greatly contributed to Golden's novel. Now see what it is really like to be a Geisha by reading Mineko's book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"In the beginning, this book appeared promising. I had never understood the geisha concept and was eager to find out more. Even after reading the entire book, I'm not sure that I am any further enlightened. Also, Mineko, the geisha, was and is shallow and selfish and self-aggrandizing. Her &quot;character&quot; (in a book that is touted as non-fiction) rang quite false. I had the sense that the story was crafted by a poor fiction writer. I rated the book 2 stars (instead of one) because I was able to tolerate it until the end, but my advise to you is DON'T BOTHER!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Okay, so I'm going to be very blunt and honest in this review and probably in the rest of my future reviews. I'm always honest, but sometimes I hold my opinions back a little bit for fear of offending someone. I just can't do it anymore. And when it comes to this review, I have some very strong opinions.First of all, I would venture to say that anyone that reads/read this book has already read Memoirs of a Geisha. This memoir is supposedly the real story of the geisha that Memoirs was based upon. It was written by Mineko Iwasaki herself with the help of an English translator. Now I can say that I have read both books, and Memoirs of a Geisha beats the pants off of this very informative, but slightly dry attempt at the same.Listen. I know parts of Memoirs of a Geisha are fictional. But some of the things that Mineko said about the book I find slightly offensive. She has said that Memoirs of a Geisha made the Geisha appear to be a high-classed prostitute. I never had that opinion after reading it. At all. In fact, quite often the author made the distinction between traditional courtesan and Geisha.Also, I want to talk about the Mizuage tradition. Mineko has stated that it was never a ceremony where a maiko's virginity was auctioned off to the highest bidder. As gross as this is, Mineko is being very misleading and she is/was not speaking the truth. During the time that Mineko was a Geiko, the practice had been outlawed, but before the 60's, it was commonplace. It was officially outlawed in 1959, but carried on for awhile after that.Now notice for a second the setting for Memoirs of a Geisha. Most of the book was set before World War 2. The whole virginity aspect was still very much a part of Geiko culture then. So like I said, Mineko was being very misleading in her book. I could go on and on about the disagreements I have with the things Mineko has said, but I think by now you get the point.I didn't dislike reading it, I found it to be very informative. But I also found it kind of dry and written with an air of condescension. Mineko thinks very highly of herself.I'm not saying that she shouldn't be, but I felt I was being talked down to for a good portion of the story.I gave it four stars, because it was a well-written piece of non-fiction, and I happen to be very interested in Asian culture, especially the Gaiko/Maiko culture. There is not a lot of information out there, and I will read whatever I can get my hands on. That being said though, I will probably never re-read this, but I will re-read Memoirs of a Geisha. There's actually a story there and quite a few facts. I would recommend reading this if you are interested in Japan or Geisha culture. Otherwise, it could go either way."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I liked this book. It was a great look into the geisha world through the eyes of one of its most succesfull woman. Mineko Iwasaki, arthur goldens informant into the life of a geisha, which he used to make his book memoirs of a geisha, scorned not only her career but the entire geisha world. I believe this book is an attempt to bring back some dignity to the profession, as well as the auther heself, but I think that comes off a bit too cleary in her book. I do think golden was wrong, but i think Mineko needs to just let this pain fade and move on. If she didnt want anyone to know what she did she should have..for one..never trusted an american man who wants to sell books because of course if everyone knew he got his information from a real succesful geisha living the life that he has depicted in his novel, it will boost sales. And she should have just never opened her mouth, and let him learn the hard way...by reading other books."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I first read Memoirs of a Geisha, which I loved. I knew that Memoirs of a Geisha is a work of fiction and that Geisha, a Life would probably be a bit different. Trying not to see it in the context of an American woman, I just let go and followed along with Mineko's story. If we compare it to reference our culture to their's, there will be things that we consider strange, but in that culture are totally acceptable.Memoirs of a Geisha got me curious about the mysterious lives of geisha, and I really enjoyed reading this book as well. I now plan to read more about these mysterious women, who in the Western culture, have been portrayed as prostitutes, which they are most surely not."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I picked up this book after reading Memoirs of a Geisha. I found it a little dull at times but otherwise enjoyable.This book is not for someone who cares nothing about the situations of real life geisha and would rather sink into the fictional ocean that is Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I loved her story and felt inclined to put my thoughts out here because of those who gave the book negative reviews.These are HER accounts of HER life; yet there are many people here who rate negatively because she did not give them the typical story of a geiko. Yes, her story is atypical because she was brought into the Iwasaki household with the intentions of being heir to their line but that doesn't make her life any less real than the other autobiographies/biographies/studies available. Most geiko aren't given that privilege so her upbringing was obvious different than the majority out there.Ironically enough, the majority of our country idolizes the lives of the rich and famous while caring little about the lives of your everyday man or woman."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I LOVED this book. If you are interested in Geisha's you must read this one. It details everything about a Geisha's life. Plus tells you what is truth and what is fiction. The way the author express things is just lovely. I really recommend this book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I first read Memoirs of a Geisha in high school and fell deeply in love with the aesthethic and mysteries of Japanese culture. When I heard it was based from Mineko Iwasaki's life story (she states this herself), I very much wanted to read her version of the story. I finished the book in about 2 days and found it cut short. Iwasaki-san is very good at giving us detail and providing reason for customs but her storytelling falls short. I tried to parallel the two stories (Memoirs & Geisha) and found them to be significantly different. Yes, they both portray a successful dancing Geisha, but events and ending are not the same. I sometimes think Iwasaki-san is holding back or censoring certain information and events for the sake of maintaining her relations with the people connected to the Geisha practice. (Since she was already shunned for revealing too much for Arthur Golden's book.) It's a good quick read if you're looking for something light and short."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Having tread the common fiction Memoirs of a Geisha to Liza Dalby's quasi-ethnography Geisha, I had hoped to find a happy medium in this book: something that provides an accurate and deep exploration of contemporary geisha (for that time period) through the eyes of one artist with a bit of narrative. Geisha, a Life delivers this, but the author is very obviously reconstructing and justifying her past choices. Whereas an excellent memoir reflects on and admits poor decisions in addition to celebrating triumphs, this reads as a rather cleaned up and ego-boosting narrative. While no doubt she worked very, very hard to stay at the top of her profession and become a truly accomplished artist, her lack of comfort with the follies of the past reduce her to two dimensions. It's still interesting and informative, but the Iwasaki does herself no favors in trying to self-aggrandize; it's utterly transparent and a bit off-putting."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"A very interesting account of the life of a Geisha in Japan in the late 1900's . Very interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. My son read it for his English class memoir project. For me, it was an example of a poorly written book \\"lost in translation.\\" There were lots of details that bogged down the flow of the story. I sometimes wondered if she made up some of the story because it seemed so far fetched or the facts didn't seem to snyc with other things she said.She talks about having no concept of money, and her troubles with adjusting to living on her own. That part I can believe. Yet, for someone so far removed from money, she seemed to have an acute understanding of how much kimonos cost, how much she made on annual basis etc. Did she mean how much money she brought in? I don't know - the facts were so jumbled and messy, and poorly presented. Another time she talks about how many kimonos she owned over the course of her career and here again the numbers don't make sense. She said she owned somewhere over 300. Okay, that makes sense. But then she says she never wore the same kimono more than 4-5 times and if she worked 15 years or so, the numbers just don't add up. (her first five years as an apprentice she worked pretty much nonstop.)As I said, some of the facts seem made up. How did she have such an acute memory of her childhood, by the way? I can't remember all the little details of when I was 4 years old, let alone 8 years old.But the last part where she decided to retire and what drove her decision was interesting. In fact, that was the only time I began to like her character. Up until that point she seemed too self centered and out of touch.Only read this book if you're interested in comparing it with Memoirs of a Geisha. It is perhaps more authentic, but it was poorly written, therefore somewhat boring."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I picked up this book after rereading \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" and wondering how realistic it was. This book, \\"Geisha, A Life\\" is written by Mineko Iwasaki, a world-renowned Japanese Geisha during the 60's and 70's. Born into a privileged family, she chooses to train in Kyoto's Gion Kobu district. Favored from the beginning, she was groomed to be the heir of her Geisha house. She worked obsessively to perfect her dancing skills and maintain her status as the foremost Geisha of Kyoto.The book is written with a certain detachment that prevents the reader from becoming fully engaged in Mineko's story. Perhaps because of Japanese culture and the taboo about Geisha revealing their secrets, the book comes off as dry and less than genuine."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"If you read Memoirs of a Geisha, this is the woman the story is based on. However, her real life was much different than the fictional Sayuri. Geisha, A Life is the diary of Mineko Iwasaki, the most successful geisha of her time. She is hailed as a legend and had very special circumstances when compared to typical geisha. Contrary to other reviewers' opinions, I found this book to be neither self important nor boring. For example, buying a ruler is not a mundane detail but a great example of how little she understood about money and other things going on around her as a child.Unlike Sayuri, Mineko's life is relatively scandal-less. This however does not make the book any less exciting. Instead she faces other conflicts such as having to choose between her biological parents and her love for dancing and having to deal with hostile attacks by her older sister Yaeko whose place she takes as the heir to the Iwasaki okiya.If you treat this book as the diary of one woman, and not a chronicle of the life of typical geisha, you won't be disappointed. I read this book in one afternoon and was moved both to laughter and tears."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"If you are looking for a book to find out more about the life of a typical Geisha, find another book. This book is the life story of the most successful Geisha of her time. Contrary to other reviewers' opinions, I neither found this book neither self important nor boring. Mineko's circumstances were anything but typical for a Geisha, so in her priviledged life she was oblivious to many of the things going on around her. For example, buying a ruler is actually an important event rather than a mundane detail - showing her complete lack of understanding of money as a child.If you read Memoirs of a Geisha and loved the scandals and intrigue, you may be disappointed with this book, as there are no made up sexual encounters. Even though Memoirs of a Geisha was based on the same woman, she spends a lot of the book correcting the common misconceptions people have of Geisha. However, this made the book no less interesting for me. There are other conflicts such as having to choose between her biological parents and her love for dancing, or having to fend off the hostile attacks by her older sister Yaeko whose place Mineko took over in the okiya. I read this book in one afternoon and was moved to both laughter and tears. Treat this book as it was meant, a diary of a special Geisha, and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This book makes a wonderful counterpoint to Memoirs of a Geisha. Although the author was the main source for that book here she tells her own story which, rather than being a girl from a poor area, sold to a geisha house and forced to prove she was worth the money spent, she is a girl that the house begged for, requesting for years that her family let her come and become the heir to the house and the adopted daughter of the owner. This is not the story of a geisha that was having businesmen bid for her virginity but one who's house was so wealthy that having sex play a part in the business made no sense. In a quote from the book she estimates that in the 1960's just from attending parties as a chaming guest she was bringing in over $500,000 per year to her house and states \\"Why would geisha resort to sex for money when you had that type of earing power?\\" You get the idea that in certain parts of the book she is correcting some of the artistic liscence taking in \\"Memoirs\\" but rather than being a distraction it just makes for more interesting reading. The childhood training, her drive to be perfect, her disputes with the traditions and the surprising descisions she makes at the end bring to life that small secluded part of the world that is fast dissappearing."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Weeellllll, the reason I read this book was because of the book Memoirs of a Geisha, which I adored. Arthur Golden, the writer for Memoirs of a Geisha, gave credit to Mineko Iwasaki as inspiration of his novel. Well, this is nowhere near Memoirs. It wasn't terrible, but not what I expected."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I hope and pray that it's a simple misinterpretation from Japanese to English (or a number of them...per page) that make this woman appear so amazingly awful. I mean just...awful. Warning: you won't like this woman very much. Additional warning: as opposed to, say, Darth Vader or Satan, there isn't even anything interesting in her awfulness to hold you to the page. This book took me three hours to read and that's only because I couldn't stop putting it down. Its simplicity should have called for 90 casual-speed minutes at best.Somewhere in the middle of all the name-dropping and self-petting, you come to realize that there's no way that in a profession where personality really is everything, this woman could have been number one considering the things she said and did to, for example, English royalty (oh, please)...which means, ironically, that she's lying about herself and not in a good way. Getting the Queen of England jealous? Oh good heavenly days, deliver us.I wish she had at least been deliciously, rather than pathetically, nasty so that the book could have been an interesting read.Two stars for the humor of hearing what passes for everyday English (calling older people \\"Gramps,\\" for example) since at least *that* was entertaining. I'm very disappointed, though -- I expected at least something juicy, but amid all the self-genuflecting about how people gave her $3,000 tips and never expected to even cop a feel without being chased around with a kitchen knife, there was just really nothing interesting...except, notably, a story or two about the history of others as told to her. Now those were worth reading.Thank God I picked this up from the library rather than paying for it."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"One of your readers mentioned that Mineko's father &quot;sold&quot; 3 of his 4 daughters. Actually, it was 5 of his 7 daughters... Mineko clearly does not hold it against him, refreshing in this age of reproaching one's parents for everything one is or is not. I found her account fascinating and very informative.Certainly she is pleased with herself, and, I think, has a right to be, given her success. She had daily dancing lessons from the age of 5 and seems to have truly loved that art. She had instruction also in music and countless other items, read up on foreign customers' interests, etc.I think it took a lot of work and dedication to accomplish what she did, and she does not forget to give thanks to and praise those who helped her. She also points out many of her own faults.I enjoyed the insight into that peculiar life. The cost of the costumes give one pause! I had read &quot;Life of a Geisha&quot;, and thought this book much more interesting.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Japanese ways."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha was one of my favorite books of all time; So when I learned that Mineko Iwasaki wrote an autobiography of her life as a geiko I went out immediately and bought the book. I was thoroughly disappointed.Not only is the book hard to read with all the Japanese terminology but Mineko drones on and on about the most unimportant details. For example, she spends half a page describing the proper way to open a door and enter a room including which hand to use and where to put it on the door. She focuses on the mundane while skipping over her personal relationships, funny anecdotes, and nightly experiences. Very little is mentioned about her starting her own nightclub or what went on each night as she worked without a day off for 5 years.Mineko's main focus as a geiko was dancing. She did everything in her power to become the best dancer in Gion. She eventually succeeded in doing so but ostracized her peers, her friends, and even her biological family.Her arrogance and ignorance can also be quite appalling and annoying to read about. Mineko openly gave away envelopes of money as tips without ever checking to see how much money they contained. She was oblivious to the world and people around her. Her sole concern was herself and becoming the best geiko and didn't care how many toes she stepped on along the way. Mineko is not particularly beautiful, can be quite rude and vindictive at times, and openly admits in the book that she was not very good at entertaining customers. Consequently, I have yet to figure out why this woman was such a legend. I personally would not have paid thousands of dollars to spend a few precious minutes in her presence.If you are interested in learning about Japanese culture or about the lives that geisha lead, I highly recommend finding another book to read. This book was a waste of time, money, and was overall incredibly boring."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"OK, I had a couple of problems with Memoirs. But it couldn't compare to the problems I had with Geisha, A life. While the book was a fairly quick read (I finished it in less that 48 hours), it didn't quite captivate me like Memoirs did. Why?My main problem was with Mineko. I never felt she suffered, or really felt at all. I never understood why she was so popular. Just because she worked a lot? To me, she seemed to be very sensitive and snapped at customers and onesan alike. So for the life of me, I could't understand why people would pay the 10s of 1000s of yen a night for her company.Another problem I had was the inconsistency about the mizuage (spelled right?) and the danas. In Memoirs, the mizuage is a deflowering ceremony that goes to the highest bidder...for almost every geisha. In Geisha, that was reserved for prostitutes. In Memoirs, every successful geisha needs a dana to gain her financial independence. In Geisha...never mentioned.Another gripe I had was with the style. Memoirs made everything come alive. The characters, the culture, and the tea house parties. In Geisha, we were never really given a glimpse into the sort of things a geisha must do. We were told they were supposed to be witty, but I never once saw any wit. We were told they were supposed to be poised and charming, but the one party situation that we were allowed a glimpse into, Mineko held a knife up to the throat of a customer. Hardly poised and charming.Would my opinion have changed if I read Geisha before Memoirs? Quite possibly. Without anything to compare it too, it may not have seemed as empty. But I still think I would have felt Geisha was missing something.Overall, a decent book to read if you are hooked on Japanese culture, but it is nothing that will change your life, or even your perception of things."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I had little or no idea of the life of a geisha other than the common rumor that they are sex slaves at times so this book was very informative. I was very impressed by the hard work, adherance to tradition and respect the author has for time bound traditions of her great country. I did however feel, like many reviewers that she was narrating it purely from her own viewpoint with little regard for others including her own elder sister. Her memories of childhood from age 3 seem completely unrealistic - she was obviously older during the time those things happened or she just invented them. Her sister was sold at a very young age by her parents and she has little regard for the anger her sister might have felt, even goes to the extent of accusing her of deserving Alzheimers. Her parents sell 4 children into geisha hood and yet she has 'great regard' for who they were and what they did. She has a huge affair with a married man before she is married herself and yet does not show any concern for his wife.I don't know much about the geisha system, but I do believe there is something to the fact that it involves bestowing sexual favors on customers. She unwittingly admits customers have to be pleased at all cost and it is totally unrealistic to believe customers from all over the world starting from american movie producers to chinese businessmen seek out geishas to appreciate their art. In other words she does not mention what is on the other side of the art outside of hard work and genuine 'customers'. But a good introduction, regardless."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Not even in the same league as 'Memoirs of a Geisha'. In fact I was shocked that she was a source of information for 'Memoirs'. This book was mechanical, uninteresting. It did not hold my attention. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I found this book hard to believe. She remembers everthing when she was 3 yrs. old? Give me a break! She sounds like she's stuck on herself and acts holier than thou. At 18 she still thought kissing could get you pregnant?? I made it through this book but found it hard to digest with a straight face. A hundred grand a night for dancing for some guys? I dont think so. Next time, try being honest Mineko, you might have sold some more books! Or if your going to skimp on the truth, make it somewhat believable!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Mineko Iwasaki paints herself an old soul even as a mere toddler.As a tot she was witty and wise and insightful and sensitive... almost ethereal... need I go on? (She does!)But Mineko also felt the need to constantly retreat to the closet.Something just doesn't ring true.I found her story very hard to believe. She remembers more about her life at age three than I remember about last week.As she ages she comes across as narcissistic and shallow.This reminds me of those Tiger-Beat type biographies written in the 70's and 80's about famous teen idols.The book just doesn't ring true."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Ugh! This book is only worthwhile if you worship Ms. Iwasaki as much as she does. The woman is so taken with herself that she becomes angered when Prince Charles dares to deface (her word) her fan with his autograph.Much of her portrayal of daily life seems hardly believable in its fairy tale like contrasts between the good Ms. Iwasaki and the evil geiko who apparently couldn't tolerate her perfection."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Geisha, A Life was just an ok book. I received it as a gift and read it because I felt obligated to. Otherwise I probably would have stopped. Not because it was a bad book, but it just wasn't good.I didn't feel attached to Mineko at all. I guess her mission could have been to just inform about geiko life, but I don't really that informed in the end anyway. The way Mineko described herself seemed very self-centered and made me seem like she was someone I wouldn't really want to be friends with let alone know. She has a wonderful memory from her years before she was 5 years old, which makes me question the validity of those \\"memories\\". She seems pretty antisocial and disagreeable in general.There was a lot of Japanese terminology that was defined once but difficult to remember throughout the book, which got a little old. Also, Mineko spent pages on details that were not necessarily that interesting. Endless descriptions of kimono and somewhat small pointless ideas wore on me and made me want to skip through them. Those things may have been extremely important to geisha, but I was more interested in her life choices. She spent literally half a page talking about closing the okiaya - a century+ old family institution. They adopted her into this family to continue the line and she closed the issue in less than a page. Very surprising...Anyway, just not that interesting of a book. I know Memoirs of a Geisha is exaggerated fiction, but a least it was interesting. I would read something other than Geisha, A Life."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I found myself annoyed with Mineko about a quarter way through her book and my aggravation with her only increased as I continued to hear more and more from her. This book is an accurate account of what geisha life was like in the 60's for Mineko, but Mineko's resounding ignorance of geisha life in prior times made me feel sorely tempted to fling the book across the room on multiple occasions.I'm far from an expert of geisha history or customs, however I think I have done enough reading on the subject to say that I personally found Mineko to be the most unpleasant figure I have come across. Her alternating ignorance and then conceited assertion of being \\"in the know\\" were often baffling. When she relates her decision to retire as geisha in the hopes of pressuring the Kabukai into changing their traditional ways, I was practically trembling with frustration at her behavior.She spends a large part of her book whining about how a geiko are trapped and incapable of becoming financially independent (although money is apparently no barrier when she begins drawing up plans to have her okiya torn down and a five story building with a club, restaurant, beauty salon, and apartment put in its place). She blames everything on the Kabukai, who she found terribly behind in the times. In particular she complains about how they didn't provide any lessons to geiko but dancing and music, even when she admits that she was perfectly free to go and study other subjects on her own. Her naivety coupled with her ignorance of her own proffession's history would have been laughable if they were not so irritating.If Mineko were at all familiar with the history of her own profession she would know that it used to be a requirement for all geisha to attend classes and learn another profession such as spinning, weaving, accounting, dancing, and singing. This was done due to the assertion that geisha were only geisha because they did not have other skills that they could use, and that they were trapped and incapable of becoming finanacially independent. However, the classes proved so very unpopular that as soon as the government adjusted the laws to make the classes optional rather than compulsory the geisha promptly quit all of them but dancing and singing.She asserts that mizuage in the geisha world is purely a graduation from maiko to geiko and has nothing to do with sex, clearly unaware that it most certainly did involve sex until 1958 when the prostitution laws came into place. She would have been nine at that time and the change of geisha ceremony may have escaped her notice, particularly considering how much time she apparently liked spending inside of closets.However, the thing that both amused and baffled me most was actually due to an interview I watched, in which Mineko claimed that Memoirs of a Geisha was actually a sensationalized version of her own life. The assertion is laughable. Sayuri is likable, Mineko is not. Mineko would probably have been wiser not to disillusion us all.In conclusion, Mineko's account of her life as a geiko is worth perusing if you are seriously interested in geisha during the post-1958 period and if you only want one woman's account. However, any historical information she tries to provide should be taken with a large pinch of salt; her personal memories are good but history was clearly not a subject she studied following retirement. My conclusion after reading a wide variety of different books on geisha is that their history and experiences have as much variety as any other profession, there is no cookie cutter experience. That said, Liza Dalby or Lesley Downer's works would be a far better use of your time."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"It's funny and sad how many reviewers are comparing this book to Golden's trite example, claiming it to be less beautifully written and not as exciting. I hate to break it to you, but Golden is a middle-aged man from New England writing about a teenaged Geisha during WWII. The only thing he's got going for him is his flowery language seeing as his accounts of the Geisha are completely INNACCURATE! His fluffy book offended me. &quot;Geisha: A Life&quot; is at least a first hand account, and it is not necessary to pump it up due to historical accuracy. These books are in two completely different categories. To compare them would be like measuring Danielle Steele against Stephen Hawking.&quot;Geisha: A Life&quot; is appropriate retribution for the damage that Golden did with his mid-century soap opera trash. I enjoyed this book because the author tells it like it is, and apologizes for nothing. Now that is courage."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"The introduction chapters about her ancestors were a little confusing becasue there were too many names with long spelling. The chapters sharing her memories with her parents were sweet, but yet a little too short and not so informative. Later chapters when she shared memories of her times as a Geisha was interesting. The life of a Geisha, the clothings, the music, the dance and Geisha were well described. Short and simple. Mineko is an interesting person. Not antisocial or self center, but hard head. I enjoy reading how she defended her pride, and how she remained respectful to her oldest sister in public. Between the line, Mineko explained the meaning of family and respect. I enjoy mostly the fact that no one can injure her pride nor destroy her dignity."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Geisha of Gion/Geisha, A Life (they're both the same book, don't get confused) is a wonderful story. Though Memoirs was more ...dramatic, these real life accounts of a real geisha is better. Mineko is a thoughtful, wonderful writer and her story draws you in. You might find yourself reading facts that discredit Memoirs and it's a shame but you'll feel better for knowing the true ways a geisha really lives.I would recommed this to anyone intrigued by the world of Geisha."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This book gives a full picture of a geisha's life from the beginning of a career until the end and shows the ups and downs. Mineko Iwasaki tells an interesting story of an exotic life, one that is commonly misconstrued in the west. Sometimes its difficult to keep track of all the Japanese names, because they all sound and look the same to me! Otherwise, a nice book! Enjoy."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I've been interested in finding something that could give insight to geisha life. I had heard from some sources that Memoirs of a Geisha was not too accurate in its portrayal of geisha life. Thus the idea of reading something similar, but hopefully more accurate, compelled me to skim through Geisha, a Life. Ultimately I went back and bought it.To an unattentive reader, the author may come off as pretentious and self-glorifying. However, if you consider that, for all intents and purposes, she was practically an &quot;Olympian&quot; in her field, her comments do have merit. And what is wrong with saying the truth if it is the truth? If Olympic gold winner track star Michael Johnson says in a book, &quot;I have talent&quot; who is to disagree? Why is it any different with Iwasaki? Because she has no gold medal to show for her acomplishments? Consider that, unless you lived in Japan at the time, you probably do not fully grasp her star status, as I am sure I do not either.Finally, she raises several examples from her life that show she is not some arrogant woman, who regards herself with godly esteem. In fact, some of these examples come on the very next page of &quot;self-glory&quot;, where she clearly shows her past mistakes and naivete.I recommend that the reader treat this book more as a personal diary, rather than some sort of historical document. It can be a very delightful and fun book. Personally, it helped clear up some misgivings I had towards geisha, due to Western misunderstanding and obfuscation. Ironically, I kept on wanting to skip all the historical data of geisha life that I had been searching for and jump back into her life stories."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I loved the book! I devoured it in half an afternoon (that good!). I think this is the only book I've ever read by a real geisha.This book seems to me, an honest depiction of what Mineko Iwasaki's life was like. Not what all geishas' lives were like, but hers. She was in a special situation, as she was the heir to the geisha house. It gave me insight as to how a person in her situation with her background might think...and how different it is and is not from me and mine.It's not a sensational story of sex and scandals. I liked it the more because it wasn't. It was about a little girl who had to pet the dog, get a flower and trade it for a treat for her Auntie every day after class. It was about a girl who wanted people to like her, not envy her. It was about a woman who found her destiny in true love. (I learned a lot of new vocabulary in this book, too, but I see it as more of a biography than a \\"book about geisha.\\")I wish there were more pictures. The pictures in the book were all plain photos in two 8 page sections; real photos. Most of them were not glossy, primped, perfectly posed pictures, but regular pictures by regular people. I do wish the pictures had better captions, but it may be some names are omitted for privacy?Why a 4 and not a 5? It ended too soon! It was too good, and I had waited for it for weeks, and then it was all read in an afternoon. I will read it again."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I have an interest in Japanese related things and I had already read Memoirs of a Geisha before this one. I found this to be a great read and entertaining. I'm not very picky about my reading so I had no trouble with the order or structure of the book. It was fine to me. It seemed like a regular autobiography with very helpful information into the life of Geisha...or a Geiko. The most surprising difference I found between this and the other geisha book I mentioned (yes, I realize the Memoirs is fiction) is the deifnition of the \\"mizuage.\\" In Memoirs it is about paying for sex, but in this biography, there is no sex whatsoever. I trust the biography. Both books were very entertaining."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I personally liked Memoirs of a Geisha better even though this is a biography and that was fiction.

Especially the little tidbits of information about personal life. Perhaps not the best book I ever read, but I did enjoy the read."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"From the age of five till when she retired at the age of twenty-nine Mineko Iwasaki was hard at work being the best maiko and geisha she could be. Her love of dance helped her live through demanding fans, rivals, pain and fears. The book is very honest on telling about all the problems and joys of her life. But there is also a touch of humor. For example, her love of manga and the fact she once played basketball.The book was a delight to read and very light. You could easily finish it over the weekend."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"\\"I want you to know what is really like to live the life of geisha, a life filled with extraordinary professional demands and richly glorious rewards.

And one that I ultimately had to leave.\\"The story of Mineko Iwasaki captures the glorification of the rich, aristocratic and burden behind all the fame and admiration. Reading this book has helped clears the myths and assumptions of what being a geisha is all about it. It's eloquently emphasizes that geishas are a work of art and the whole business is the exploitation of art and not bodies. Personally, I'm highly recommended this book for people who are interested in the Japanese lifestyle, culture and values. Though it also has a universal theme where one has to give up other's hopes dreams no matter how hard they work for and to live and pursue their own dreams and reclaim back their life from the people. Overall, I really couldn't put this book down, and was completely fascinated by the beautiful details of the different elements needed for a rising geisha, and a maturing woman."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"This is a great bit of light reading for it describes in the most straightforward manner the geisha society and Japanese culture. I liked the fact that this book feeds and feeds you information on those aspects and it keeps intriguing you with every new bit of information. It is not too abstract, for it doesn't have to be. After what seemed like a lifetime of being asked to analyze \\"critically\\" everything you read in school, to dig miles deep to conjecture what the author might possibly mean by saying something ambivalent, \\"Geisha, A Life\\" struck me as a refreshing breeze. You don't have to write something that no one understands to sound smart, and Mineko Iwasaki has done just that."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"The only reason I'm here reviewing this book is because Rande Brown is a relative of mine. That's how I know about the book in the first place. However, I promise my review will not be biased.Let me start by saying that this is not as &quot;interesting&quot; a read as &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, but that is a consequence of the truth being told. Nothing was made up here to make the story more interesting, but if you're interested in knowledge and facts as much as drama, you'll enjoy reading the book. As fascinating as Golden's interpretation of a geisha was, the real truth about what a geisha is is just as enthralling. If you read and enjoyed &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, then this is a must-read. Enjoy that book for being what it was- historical fiction. This is simply a biography, but a very good one. Not captivating in any way but truly fascinating."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Mineko Iwasaki is one of the most famous modern geisha. She has met with famous people from Prince Charles to world famous film director Elia Kazan. Her life was neither simple nor without mistakes and this book tells it all. From her days as a little child to her retirement. When she was young she lived in a rather large family that had already sent away a few of their daughters to train to become geisha (or geiko). But when the leader of a geisha house sees Mineko she knows that Mineko was made to be a geisha. Over the next few years of her life she trains in dance and other arts of the geisha. Mineko seems to be taking a big risk in writing this book. Not only was the book Memoirs of a Geisha, loosely based on her life, she is so far the only geisha to ever publish her biography. You can tell from reading her book that not only is she a brave and a hard worker but she is also very proud, which can be a good thing and a bad thing. I'd recommend this book to people who want to know about what life is like as a Geisha. It clears up many of the mistakes that Arthur Golden has made in his writing about geisha.If you're looking for an honest biography about geisha life, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I was so disappointed after reading only the first few chapters. Iwasaki spends much of her time justifying selfish behavior rather than explaining geisha life. Moreover, her stories seem rather inflated.After studying and living in Japan for a number of years, I do not believe that this is a definitive guide to geisha. Rather it seems to be more of a tell all book from someone once famed and glamourized. Perhaps she was rightly famed for her talents, but her perspectives are merely that... her own perspectives. This book does not offer a scholarly insight into the geisha profession or history.While Iwasaki does make some valid points about societal structure, education, etc. there is something truly lacking. Perhaps it is her lack of sincerity and believability. It seems that she has no trouble exposing others' inadequacies, but shamelessly protects her own face.As other reviewers have noted there is good intellectual material available for those that are really interested in this topic. Even art history books concerning Edo period \\"ukiyoe\\" (woodblock prints) would reveal more interesting and exciting stories than this book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"My brother purchased this for me after I had started reading The Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden. I decided to read it directly after I finished the fictional novel to compare how realistic Golden's work was. It is safe to say that although Memoirs of a Geisha is quite well-known, it is far from the world Mineko describes. It is true that she lived a life with certain privileges because she was a successful geisha, but at the same time, she is sincere and straightforward in her account. I found that I enjoyed learning about the culture behind the closed society of geisha, and the clarifications she gives to correct the rumors and falsehoods that spread about. Overall, I was enraptured by the small window she gave to me, and continued reading because I was curious about her story."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I was intrigued by this after reading Arthur Golden' s Memoirs of a Geisha, and although I'm still very fond of it, I found Mineko' s attitude immensely enjoyable and was urged to read through the pages (I snuck reading in when ever I could in class). Not only is it insightful on another country's perspective on beauty, but it gives a realistic honesty about this glamorous lifestyle that I found more believable than Golden's take (mind you, that is comparing fiction to non-fiction).I definitely plan on re-reading this.Ps. Loved the photographs!"},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Very interesting book. Enjoyed the story and how author did the timeline. Made u feel you were there with her."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I first got interested in geisha reading Arthur Golden's MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, then decided to go hunting for more information on geisha to see how accurate his account was. I started with Liza Dalby's GEISHA, and then came to read this.Mineko delivers an absorbing account of her life and training as a very top geisha in Gion, the most exclusive of Kyoto's geisha districts. For those who are comparing her tale to Golden's, keep in mind that Golden is writing fiction, in fact, almost fairy-tale-esque fiction (complete with wicked stepsister, wicked stepmother, fairy god-mother, handsome prince, etc.) Mineko's tale is true, and archly told; Mineko herself comes across as a very strong, in some places almost domineering personality, as one would expect given her position in the family she was adopted into and her family's high-status position in Gion. The strength of her personality makes reading this book a wonderful pleasure.However, Mineko's position within the geisha hierarchy was very atypical. She was at the very top of the heap, with all sorts of perks and privileges due to her station that many other geisha did not have (atotori so everyone respects her from day one; she gets personal access to the Big Mistress, tremendous financial and professional support in launching her career from her very-high-status okiya etc.), and it's not clear in the book that she understood this at the time, or indeed understands this now. For example, when talking about sexual matters (such as mizuage and whether a geisha's patron was entitled to sexual favors--Dalby and Golden say yes, Mineko says no), Mineko talks about her earnings, which were at the time she was working somewhere on the order of hundreds of thousands of yen a night in goshugi alone, and says something to the effect of \\"This is another reason why the idea of geisha selling sexual favors is so ridiculous. Given that geisha earn so much just by performing, why would they?\\" Well....most geisha, especially those who didn't have access to Mineko's advantages, probably *didn't* earn that much. Not that they necessarily sold sexual favors, you understand, it's just that Mineko doesn't seem to realize that her earning status was quite extraordinary and that there were probably a *great* many geisha who were a lot less fortunate.(It may be worth pointing out here that Liza Dalby worked in Pontocho, a slightly-lower-status geisha district of Kyoto than Gion, where Mineko was located. Of course, Dalby also suggests that a great amount of the \\"sex\\" aspect of the concept of geisha may have come from the conflation of many different types of geisha and female entertainers.)All in all, this is an entertaining book, well-written and highly readable, by turns sad and funny, as well as a great look inside the world of very-high-status geisha. In a way, this book is a tragedy as well, as by the end of it Mineko gives up her career and closes the okiya that had been entrusted to her by her adoptive family (an act that would have made Mineko look a lot less sympathetic if we hadn't seen just how hard she had been pushed as a child, even though her family cared for her.) Those reading it for information, however, should keep in mind that Mineko's account of geisha life is, while wonderfully detailed, also quite narrow in scope and that it may not be representative of all or even most geisha. For a look at a very different kind of geisha experience, I suggest AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A GEISHA, by Sayo Masuda, who was a hot-springs geisha around 1940 or so."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Most people outside of Japan do not realize just how exclusive and secret the world of the Geishas is. Connections and wealth buy a seat in an Ochaya, and on the streets of Gion in Kyoto catching a glimpse of a Geiko (Geisha in the Kyoto dialect) is as rare as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. Geiko move fast down the streets and alleyways, and a sighting is something to tell your friends about.With \\"Geisha : A Life,\\" Mineko Iwasaki lifts some of the veils of this fantasy world and shows that, underneath the make-up and fancy hairstyles, Geiko are just women, with the same thoughts and feelings and pride and emotion as everyone else. In some ways, this destroys the fantasy, being able to see \\"behind-the-scenes.\\" The life of a Geiko is very difficult and somewhat...boring. Like a dedicated ballet dancer, the bulk of their life is training and practice, trying to achieve a near-impossible idea of body and movement.\\"Geisha: A Life\\" is not compellingly written, nor as fascinating as the sexualized and fictional account \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\" It is not as academically insightful and full of details as Liza Dalby's \\"Geisha.\\" But it is honest and real. Mineko's account of her life is straightforward, without much decoration. After reading it, you will know what it is like to be a Geiko.Woven into this account, perhaps unintentionally, is the loss of Japan's disappearing past. Mineko doesn't bat an eye when telling the story of how she leveled their 100-year old Geisha residence, in order to build a modern night club and hair salon because she thought it would make more money. She talks with hope of her artist husband someday becoming one of Japan's legendary Living Treasures, but doesn't see how she should belong in the same category. She feels loss for the fading world of the traditional Japanese arts, but keeps destroying them along with everyone else."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"It's unfair to compare this book to \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\" Yes, Mineko Iwasaki was interviewed by Arthur Golden when he was working on his best-selling book, but \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is a work of fiction. It's a fantastic book in its own right, but many of its depictions of life as a geisha are said to be very inaccurate. That's one of the reasons Iwasaki decided to write \\"Geisha: A Life.\\" She wanted to set the record straight.\\"Geisha: A Life\\" is the true story of Iwasaki's illustrious career as Japan's number one geiko. At the age of five, Iwasaki began training at an okiya in the Gion district of Kyoto. She was later adopted by the okiya's owner and named as its eventual successor. Iwasaki worked tirelessly to perfect her craft and went through a lot of difficult times. She eventually grew frustrated by the limitations of her career and retired at the age of 29 so that she could raise a family and follow her own dreams.This book is full of many details regarding the everyday life of geishas. I can see why some fans of \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" are disappointed because this book is a lot more straightforward and technical than Gordon's novel. However, Iwasaki's story does not lack emotion or passion. Iwasaki is open and honest about many unpleasant experiences in her life: being separated from her parents, surviving an attempted rape by her nephew, etc. I guess those things don't even begin to compare to what the character of Sayuri endures in \\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" but once again, Sayuri is a FICTIONAL CHARACTER! I don't understand how people can compare her and Iwasaki. Sayuri isn't real! End of story.I've always been fascinated by the geisha tradition, and I loved this book because it sheds so much more insight into this mysterious and often misrepresented way of life. Iwasaki's story is amazing, and I'm glad she chose to share it with the world."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"&quot;Geisha, A Life&quot; Mineko Iwaski's autobiography is not scandalous nor is it particularly revealing. Perhaps there is a cultural chasm or translational difficulty, but bluntly, Mineko does not come off as particularly truthful, likable, or appealing. The aspects she chooses to display show her great love of dressing up, dancing, and her almost frenetic energy.The most interesting part of the book is her early childhood that was in a semi-rural part of Japan and was idyllic. The reader has to swallow that Mineko had an almost photographic memory from age three plus great insight into people's characters. She was an odd little girl who preferred to be alone, spent most of her time (by choice) in closets, and did not like to talk to people. She nursed (or tried to nurse) until she was almost 10 years old, long after she had left her mother. Maybe this is a Japanese custom. She left her family for good by the time she was six-years old to live permanently in the Iwasaki okiya (geisha house). She insists throughout the book that her father, an aristocrat in reduced circumstances, was not, as accused, a baby-seller; yet he did just that with three of his four daughters. His eldest never forgave him and ran away to get married before the debt to the geisha house was paid. Mineko heaps scorn upon this eldest sister throughout the book because she &quot;dishonored&quot; the family and caused her father grief.Mineko was not typical because she was heiress-apparent of the house, and was always treated with a great deal of honor. To most American readers, it might seem this &quot;honor&quot; turned her into a spoiled, arrogant brat. She complains the other girls did not like her and were jealous of her attainments and superiority. It was likely they had more genuine reasons for their dislike. There is no doubt that Mineko worked hard and earned her number one status. Her schedule is almost unbelievable (she says she only slept a few hours a night). It is interesting the amount of celebrity she occasioned as the top geisha (geiko) in Kyoto. Crowds gathered round, autograph hunters were everywhere; she had commercial endorsements. To us, she had the life of a rock star. She retired at the height of her fame at age 29. Since that time, she has been successful in business (why does this not surprise me?), married and has one daughter.&quot;Geisha, A Life&quot; is interesting and the author is very good at giving us small vignettes of her experiences with her peers. Her descriptions of her beautiful attire and the backbreaking work of making up, hairdressing, and donning the various garments to ready herself for public appearances are fascinating. I really wished I could have liked her more."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I'm half Japanese and grew up in Japan. In order to appreciate this book, you must have an understanding of the Japanese culture. It's not fair to compare this book to \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" which is completely fiction and written by an American. In the Japanese culture, a Geisha's life has always remained under a cloud of mystery and secrecy. For a Geisha to reveal any part of her life is strictly forbidden and considered taboo. Many Japanese still do not know much about a Geisha's life even though the tradtion has been around for centuries. What we know is based on assumptions or what our grandmothers have whispered to us. When Mineko Iwasaki wrote this, it became controversal in Japan and had many Kyoto Geisha houses angry with her. When the Japanese media contacted Geisha houses for interviews or comments, they were met with a wall of silence.If you decide to read this book, look at it like you're peeking into another country's culture. Remember the Geisha has been around for hundreds and hundreds of years, since the samurai days. For a tradtion to survive this long must say something about how tradtions are kept for other generations to see and not just read about in a history book.I don't want to give out much about the book, but if you want a better understanding of a tradtion that has been kept alive for centuries and if you want a glimpse into the Japanese culture, give this book a read. The book flows and the author has a way of writing that draws the reader into her life."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I found this a fascinating book, filled with glimses into the culture and customs of Japan. I knew little of Japan before I read it, but Mineko filled in many gaps and clarified many misconceptions.She was the most successful geisha (actually &quot;geiko&quot;) of her time--beautiful, graceful and determined. And yet, she grew tired of the life, and retired at the very early age of twenty-nine, ending the ancient Iwasaki line.She begins her book with her early childhood and her reasons for becoming a geiko. She takes the reader through training and all it's rigours through to her enormous success. She alludes to her disillusionment with the geiko life, and to her attempts to reform the educational traditions, but does not specify any of these. I was disappointed in that, for, having watched her mature in this book, I would like to have known more about her reform attempts, to have seen her in that role.Geisha, A Life is not the most well-written of books, which could be due to either author or translator. But then, that doesn't really matter. Let's face it. . . no one reads an autobiography for literary merit. Autobiographies are read in an attempt to KNOW the writer, and in that aspect, Mineko succeeded--I felt like I was ending a conversation with a good friend when I closed this book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Like many of the readers, I read Memoirs of A Geisha before reading this book. I was expecting a book that was a bit of a rebuttal to Arthur Golden's novel. Instead, I got a very nicely written autobiography.What a lot of people fail to realize is that this is less about the life of Ms. Iwasaki and more about the life of \\"The Geisha\\" role that she played. She never really talks much about herself- and that is a point of difference between the Japanese and Westerners. When we think of an expose, we think of something that is completely revealing and juicy, with a lot of sad stories. For the most part, other than the Geisha aspect of her life, Mineko's life was pretty uneventful.IN NO WAY IS THIS BOOK TO BE COMPARED TO MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA! One is the FICTIONAL view of a Westerner, who romanticises the culture to the point of OVERKILL. However, you have a more frank portrait of a Geisha here, and it sucks to find out that the life of a Geisha is not extremely eventful in a way that we would find it to be. Other than preparing for ceremonies and going out with clients, the Geisha don't do very much.My only problem with this novel is that she doesn't talk more about herself, but again, this is more about \\"Geisha Mineko\\" and less about \\"Average Mineko.\\" Readers and Reviewers should NOT get it twisted."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I read this book after reading Memoirs of a Geisha and found this one to be much more interesting and satisfying. But that's because I find real stories of real people more interesting than fiction. And I can see why Iwasaki is angry at Golden if indeed his premise that geisha auction off their virginity isn't true as she claims. Golden's work is a good read but for a fascinating look at a real life, read Geisha: A Life. I left off one star because I feel that Iwasaki could have given us even more detail and anecdotes. However I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"Geisha have always been fascinating, mostly I believe, because they are so mysterious to us Westerners. Prepare to be demystified. Golden's 'Memoirs' was like another reviewer wrote, an excellent book, but still a fairytale - a bittersweet Japanese Cinderella. This book, by contrast, was written by an actual Geisha living her own real life rags to riches story. Though we might envy her glamorous lifestyle and beautiful clothes, we sympathize with her heartbreak, rejoice in her victories, and otherwise come to care about Mineko. She is simultaneously innocent and worldly, childlike and alluring. She was the top Geiko of her era and extremely privileged. While not as dramatic as Memoirs, I enjoyed this book much more - mainly because I felt it was more accuracy and less artistic license."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"As many people seem to have done, I found this book after reading Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden (which I loved, by the way.) I was hoping for an interesting, true look inside the world of the Kyoto geishas and got exactly that. Iwasaki provides a great deal of insight onto certain traditions as well as personal commentary and thoughts about the way the society works. She also includes many entertaining anecdotes, made all the better by virtue of being true. This is really a fabulous book, and one of the best autobiographies I've had the pleasure of reading in a long time.I noticed someone else mentioned some surprisingly blatant editing errors, and I saw them too. They seem to be mistakes made in translation that were overlooked in the editing process. I wouldn't let them stop me from reading though."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I read this book a few months ago and was very disappointed. I had read \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" several years ago, while living in Japan and really enjoyed it - I thought this book might be similar. Not only is it very poorly written, the author comes across as arrogant and ignorant at the same time. Arrogance isn't a compelling characteristic in any culture, but it's particularly undesirable in Japanese culture. I kept reading though, expecting the book to get better - it didn't."},{"Title":"Geisha: A Life","review":"I read Memoirs of a Geisha like so many reviewers here and wanted to know more about Geihsa.

And though my first impressions remained hopeful, it soon became clear that this book has a very defined audience indeed.I must admit I find much of what Les Hatton says about the C language and its application in high integrity very interesting but perhaps its relevancy today isn't what it once was. Don't get me wrong, there is some good information in this book and you may even have an epiphany about the C language while you read it. But Les's lack of lucidity makes the book very dry to read, and unless you are an avid fan of standards and rigid processes or can find some humor in what he says, you might find getting through any of the chapters somewhat of a challenge.Moreover the reader is constantly and implicitly reminded while reading this book of the author's staunch support for the C language. And though this takes many different forms throughout the book, it became clear to me at least, that here may be a case where someone has gone through a great deal of work in the defense of a programming language instead of propounding the use of a more appropriate one. That is not to say there may not be situations where the C language is necessary in mission critical or high integrity software; I just don't think the author has given ample justification in these cases for considering other more strongly typed languages than C for them.However, there are some sections and chapters of the book that are worth some note. I found the following of interest because of it potential applicability to what all software engineers need to be aware of, particularly in Tivoli.Chapter 2. This entire chapter is useful to those individuals who really want to teflon coat their C code. The author skillfully wades through all the potentially caveats and misbehaviors that can haunt someone writing in this language. Along with his obvious vast experience with standards it becomes painfully clear that he has fallen victim to some of them.Sections 5.1.2 and 5.3. The former section has a good synopsis on test coverage and for those who do any development or testing with C may find what he has to say here of some use. The latter section contains some good information on automation and tools, and though you will definitely find yourself skipping through it (especially the parts on standards and ISO), much of what he has to say has some value to what we do in Tivoli.This book does not belong on everyone's shelves and is clearly not meant for the novice or uninitiated programmer or engineer. It is useful however in those handful of cases where one absolutely needs to understand what the limits of C are, and then to take the necessary design, development or verification action to meet those potential challenges. I find it a useful though a decidedly optional appendix to any Kernighan and Ritchie..."},{"Title":"Safer C (McGraw-Hill International Series in Software Engineering)","review":"This book was recommended to me by a collegue. Looking at the title, I don't think I would have picked it up myself. My interests tend towards the practical. But this was a surprising delight to read. Hatton is sharp, well-informed and very funny. And I was surprised at how similar the challenges that Hatton addresses are to the ones faced by the development groups I've worked with.Hatton's primary motivation is to defend C as a language for use in safety critical systems. And that's an argument that I don't have much interest in. But he defends it by identifying unreliable features and usages of C and showing how these can be automatically detected and avoided. This is the interesting part. His analysis is deep and entertaining. He obviously has spent many many hours reading draft standards and commentary. The task has nearly turned his brain to jelly. Yet he pressed on and has identified and categorized long lists of issues that the standards leave open to interpretation.The second basis for his argument are empirical studies he has made of occurances of faults in software. These are also very interesting. He also has made studies correllating complexity metrics to these fault metrics and thereby comes to well-defined complexity criteria. But having defined some metrics, he also has good ideas about how to make use of them.Hatton doesn't have much faith in process standards (such as the CMM, or ISO 9000). He feels that if you have to have rules, they need to have automated enforcement mechanisms. Indeed, one of the purposes of this book is to plug tools that do just this that he has developed. But he also describes competing and complementing tools with fairness. Indeed, his descriptions of the different static and dynamic code analysis tools is the best one I've seen. I learned several useful things from this section alone. He also realizes that you can't have arbitrary limits. So he often suggests that a grey zone be defined where formal written justifications can allow code to exceed the lower limits. It is clear to me that if we are going to continue to call ourselves software engineers, we will need to be spending more time defining, following and justifying the engineering practices we use. Hatton's analysis is a useful model, because it shows how this can be done without hopping on to one of the latest management buzzword models.His background as a geologist shapes his expectations for computer languages and software. He doesn't have much sympathy for ambiguous specifications and standards. He expects a lot, but he also knows that we have the knowledge and ability to meet these expectations -- expectations that anyone else who wants to be called an engineer accepts."},{"Title":"Headbands: How to work them","review":"There's a reason it's considered the standard text for endbands. Clearly written and well organized, it's not a book for someone without a little bookbinding background. If you've got a grasp of the basics though, working a headband from scratch is a great way to set your work apart or add a personal touch to a pre-made text block.The strengths: Scope. All the major (and a few minor) styles are covered in depth and detail. Step by step instructions are clear and well illustrated. The drawings are reasonably clear most of the time (there are a few that could be improved).The weaknesses: The inclusion of photos, even a black and white gallery at the end, would be a welcome addition. The brief description of the materials it the front could be expanded (I'm sure there's another whole volume that could be written on thread, but a little more detail about the types of silk thread and how to select it would be a great help).Those are minor quibbles. The book delivers what the title promises, and the work is both fun and challenging (be prepared to cut off a few failures and start over a couple of times)."},{"Title":"Headbands: How to work them","review":"I am a bookbinding student and this book is our bible for learning how to sew handmade headbands for our books.

I was led to this particular book through reading the author's daily webcolumn.Some martial arts books have a lot of rambling or clicheed \\"filler\\" in them. On the contrary, these essays are generally very clear and focused, and betray the author's wealth of knowledge and experience. For example, it is very fashionable to speak about zen in martial arts texts, and throw around terms like \\"mushin\\". But unlike most of those texts, this book is actually written by someone who is expert in both zen and budo. As a result, the comparisons he makes are far more lucid, interesting, and (in my experience) applicable.I encourage you to read this book.

Reading more like a compilation of reflections from a life devoted to martial and spiritual study, KODO is unique and a challenge to categorize.My background from childhood was a little Karate and Gung-Fu, but when I was seventeen I saw an Aikido demonstration and felt a strong gravitation toward such training, which lead to KODO. Though the author, Rev. Kensho Furuya, teaches Aikido and Iaido, I think his writings are very applicable regardless of the martial study you pursue.At just over 220 pages, KODO is a moderately sized book - but packed with so many anecdotes, images, and stories that it seems like there's always a little more to find. I particularly like many of the side-notes present throughout the book, \\"Unrealized potential is like no potential at all\\". As a chronic procrastinator, simple statements like that have made a real impact on my outlook.KODO is in part a memoir and in part a lesson or guide book for those trying to find their way to a simpler path in an increasingly busy and complex world.

People distorting the meaning of the old teachings, training to win competitions, watching kung fu movies. He doesn't necessarily like that but accepts that this is the way things are. Nevertheless, he chooses not to succumb to the fast-food mentality, and to honor his teachers who patiently taught him, by \\"keeping it real\\".In 1988, Martial Arts Training Magazine asks Kensho Furuya to write a monthly column about his reflections on martial arts matters. The name of the column is Ancient Ways and it is Mr. Furuya's attempt to preserve the spirit of Eastern martial arts in the Western world.This book is an anthology of 41 of these articles, written between 1988 and 1995. They are leaning towards the spiritual-Zen side, so don't expect to find techniques or anything like that. The essays combine personal stories, stories about his teachers and other old masters, along with the author's reflections, interpretations, philosophical viewpoints and insights.The author tries to manifest the spirit of the martial arts and how they help you to improve your character and enhance your life, but only if approached in the right way. He speaks about the correct mindset one should have during training and talks of the importance of qualities such as patience, perseverance, humbleness, sincerity, selflessness, generosity, courage and compassion. His writings are very inspirational and provide plenty food for thought.Furuya's voice is a subtle one, a voice that respects the reader's individuality and doesn't attempt to impose its views on him. This is a very strong point for Mr. Furuya. To me, this humble, tender tone clearly reveals a master.In my opinion, if you approach your martial arts training as a way of life and not just something you have to do to learn how to fight, then you should consider reading this book. In today's world where real masters are an endangered species, works like that are real gems in a sea of stones."},{"Title":"KODO: Ancient Ways: Lessons in the Spiritual Life of the Warrior/Martial Artist (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"This is a compilation of the author's magazine columns; I particularly liked it because I found it almost universally applicable - if you are a traditional martial artist, whether aikido, karateka, or even non-japanese styles, it gives you a great deal of insight into the philosophical underpinnings that influence your art. If you are a non-traditional martial artist, it helps you understand how the traditionalists think (and may even serve as a manual for conversion ;) ). Finally, if you are a non-martial artist, as many of our spouses/friends/significant others are, it helps you understand why the arts are more than just kicking, punching, throwing or weaponry, and thus why they have kept many of us captivated for so long. I find the text very engaging, as it is written in a very easy to read and flowing style, and also in relatively short chapters (not surprising given its former state as magazine columns) meaning that it makes for good bedtime reading when you may have only a few minutes. All in all, I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"KODO: Ancient Ways: Lessons in the Spiritual Life of the Warrior/Martial Artist (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"As all true warriors know, there are two aspects of human combat. The body, which must be forged into hardened steel with intense training, and the mind, which must be fed the proper philosophical food to grow intellectually and spirtually in order win and survive. Unfortunately, many martial artists focus only on the physical aspects of being a warrior. This great book will provide the vital philosophical tools needed to be a complete warrior, so that the mind, spirit and body are in harmony. I was a little amused by some of the criticism of this book and the author. I admit to agreeing with a few of the comments made, but overall, this book will provide the essential nutrients for the mind. The lessons taught in this text are both educational and enlightening.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J.

Furuya's &quot;KODO&quot; is a remarkable collection of essays exploring the meaning of training and attitude. The primary audience for this work is martial artitsts. However, anyone with a serious interest in Eastern arts - and their connections with the subjective philosophical, spiritual, and cultural attitudes that engendered them - will find these essays to be of value. Indeed, Rev. Furuya has a broad range of knowledge about Japanese arts, including Zen, the tea ceremony, Noh drama, sculpture, painting, poetry, and calligraphy. The essays abound with historical and mythical anecdotes that are used effectively to illustrate the meaning and consequences of spiritual commitment to one's teachers and to one's art. Rev. Furuya has provided a first-hand account, necessarily personal and subjective, of the spiritual life of a martial artist.The content of the book is not matched by the quality of the publication. There are a number of pictures, sketches, and other reproductions in the book that could be improved with higher production standards. Given the price of the publication, this is not surprising. Still, many of the remarkable items portrayed in &quot;KODO&quot; deserve a better exposition.In summary, this is a unique and important book which can help today's martial artists touch and nurture the spiritual heritage from which their arts have grown. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"KODO: Ancient Ways: Lessons in the Spiritual Life of the Warrior/Martial Artist (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"Each chapter/article is only a few pages but a lot is contained in each. There are many pictures and illustrations to help convey the current topic. Another feature I like are the quotes in the margin to highlight key aspects of the current topic.I bought this book in 2002 and among my shelves of martial arts books, it is by far the one I come back to the most often. This book is on how to be the best martial artist and person you can be. The chapters are short but they will spur a lot of contemplation. This book is not meant to be skimmed over. It should be read in small increments and reflected upon. Each time you come back to the book and reread a chapter you will discover new meaning and application to your own training.Here are a few chapters and quotes:Learning Is Only the Second StepThe very first step to learning is to become a completely blank slate.Hard or easy is just in your particular frame of mind. Many people with a lot less than you will accomplish much more than you in their lifetimes. Do not be defeated by a small mind or poor attitude.You Never Get Good in the Martial ArtsWe satisfy ourselves because we settle for less - even when we think we are getting more. Never be satisfied.Make Mistakes CorrectlyRespond to your mistakes correctly. A mistake is only another form of learningTrue Learning is IncompleteWe seek knowledge, but when we convince ourselves that we understand that knowledge, the process of learning, training and being sensitive to everything around us ceases.Cultivate Inner StrengthPlease keep in mind that inner strength is not a matter of skill or strength. ... Inner strength is someone trying hard to make a good life for himself and those around him as best as he can.I hope these few quotes will get you to reflect on your path as a martial artist.

I will always be grateful for Kodo and for Furuya Sensei's continued teaching."},{"Title":"KODO: Ancient Ways: Lessons in the Spiritual Life of the Warrior/Martial Artist (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"I must say that it is wonderful to see various opinions on this book and how there is a means by which people can express their opinions. However, I must address the negative comments by some of the reviewers;Gary L. Grose (Louisville, KY) states, \\"This is modern society and when you stoop to accept money from a student, then you are in business.\\" I would only say that no matter the trade or field, men always try to make a living or a profit. EVERY person is guilty of that. I'm sure Mr. Grose doesn't give all of his time & talents away for free, otherwise how could he eat. I would leave with one final quote, \\"The field of martial arts is particularly rife with flamboyant showmanship, with commercial popularization and profiteering on the part of both those who teach the science and those who study it.\\" Miyamoto Musashi (The Book of Five Rings, 1643) It may not be 300 years ago, but people haven't changed. Just because someone sells or buys on eBay does not make them less or more of a monk/teacher/doctor/lawyer/truck driver etc.Pavel Rott (Rochester, NY) states, \\"Aparently his dojo is filled with lazy people who are not too well versed in Zen lore and norms of behaviour expected from monastery acolyte. So, Mr. Furuya loses no time complaining about their insolent behaviour and their total failure to live up to his expectations.\\" I agree with Sensei Furuya, many martial arts students are just looking for the next greatest trick, gimic or technique. They are lazy, greedy and lack mindfulness, but hopefully if they stick around in martial arts long enough then they will become something better. Let's not be mistaken, the job of a martial arts teacher is to push you to become better, and not just at the physical level either. Let's not forget, martial arts is not like attending a tea party.....If you enter a dojo, you might just get your ego bruised, but hopefully it gets broken instead.For those considering this book;Those who have trained in martial arts less than 5 years, may not get as much out of this book as someone who has trained 10+ years (with the proper attitude of course).I feel this book is a must have for any serious martial artist."},{"Title":"KODO: Ancient Ways: Lessons in the Spiritual Life of the Warrior/Martial Artist (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"Kensho Furuya's book Kodo is not only an attempt to uncover some of the 'mysteries' of martial arts and make them tangible to the everyday student, but it is a commentary that reaches beyond the dojo.In today's high paced, your way right away world, Furuya brings the reader into a dialogue that has been past over for a Tae Bo fix. He explains how today's students are not the students of ancient days, although it may seem obvious, this statement leads us down a slippery slope of self-discovery. Most students of all disciplines are wanting more for less. Wanting to become experts in 2-4 years and quitting if they do not achieve this status and blaming it on the instruction rather than on their own failure to endure.As a martial arts teacher I cannot learn without good students, but as a student of the Martial Path, I could not have achieved my rank without a good teacher. A good student in any discipline is to take in the whole picture that his/her teacher presents, not to pick and choose as if we were in a cafeteria. Furuya makes this point repeatedly in many ways, because it is a point that is hard to drive through the hard-headed mentality of today's student.Students today have an expectation and an outline of what they want to learn without ever setting foot into a class. Students tell the teacher what they want before asking what the teacher has to offer. Students are not students when these things occur.If you are a student, listen to what Furuya has to say and take this as a sign that you can be a better student. If you are a teacher take solace that you are not the only teacher having this difficulty with your students.The martial path is one of self-mastery and is a two way process. You cannot allow yourself to become passive as a student and expect your teacher to give you all the tools so that you may become masterful. You too must put in an equal amount of work if not more in order to embody the masterful teachings of the ancient ways."},{"Title":"KODO: Ancient Ways: Lessons in the Spiritual Life of the Warrior/Martial Artist (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"This book is a wonderful volume full of the traditional wisdom that gave the practice of the martial arts (and other spiritual practices) real meaning.

This is caused by leaning too much on very few sources, mainly Aikido and some sect of Zen buddhism.I am not putting these styles/sects down nor this book - as I said, it is quite good.

To get America's attention, Toyota must first re-invent itself. It must make itself more handsome (through better styling), improve its physique (be faster, stronger and need less maintenance) and prove its financial management skill (by selling great cars for less). Because time is fleeting and the buyer has many other suitors (Mercedes Benz, Jaguar, Nissan, Volvo), Toyota must work fast before its intended lover makes an irrevocable decision and buys someone else's car. Like some other love stories, this is repetitive and suffers from some plain old sloppy editing. But it makes you want to test-drive a Lexus to see what causes such a sensation.

However, if you have ever lost tons of money using typical ad-agency &quot;get your name in front of the public&quot; techniques -- or if you don't know if you have or you haven't (hint: if you don't know, then, you have!) -- this book will clear the smoke away and give you a simple, workable, step-by-step blueprint to return to profitable advertising.My own field of expertise is direct-response advertising -- the kind that makes people who are ready to buy, or likely to be incited to buy right away, respond -- and buy. Ayling clearly understands that discipline and is probably a master of it himself.But in this book, he takes it one step further. He shows you HOW TO CREATE AN AUTOMATIC DIRECT-RESPONSE MECHANISM INSIDE THE MIND OF THE CUSTOMER so that when that person finally is ready to buy, the name of your company or your product &quot;pops up&quot; internally, and there's really no other choice for that person but to buy from you.Don't believe me? I don't blame you. But you can't afford NOT to find out if I'm right or I'm wrong. Everyone I've recommended this book to has gone nuts over it, and that includes one of the world's best known authorities on marketing, and my own personal favorite expert on small service business marketing.Get this book.

Even some of the greats of the industry, such as \`Mr Madison Avenue' David Ogilvy pondered the secrets to this science.Ogilvy once stated that half of advertising was effective, but the trick was knowing which half.Having read Geoff Ayling's \`Rapid Response Advertising', one could be forgiven for thinking the secret is finally out about designing and implementing an effective advertising campaign.Ayling, an ad veteran from Australia, cites many examples of good advertising in this warm, insightful and comprehensive manual. This is the first thing that strikes the reader. This is not another tome on the art of advertising written by theorists. It is a comprehensive road map for success in advertising, from the initial stages of strategy, planning and concept development to media selection, budget and execution.The book has been simply written so that it is understandable by both ad executives, CEOs and writers. It gives readers both the big picture and an up-close-and-personal view of a wide range of elements.The premise for \`Rapid Response Advertising' is a new marketing technique that is exciting, responsive and measurable - and best of all - it can be applied to virtually any budget and any business.The technique is known as \`meme'. Once a scientific term, Ayling has redefined it as a new form of marketing symbology which, when used effectively, can deliver instant consumer recognition and almost an instant return on advertising. This, according to Ayling, is the missing piece to the advertising puzzle and it is the centerpiece of his book.The author says that memes are \`emotional button-pushes'. He lists a wide variety of meme types in use, ranging from dream, greed and achievement memes to fun, responsibility and health memes. Ayling explains in great detail the inner workings of memes and how they can be applied to elicit specific responses.\`Rapid Response Advertising' covers a lot of territory including:* The Price Myth* Unique Selling Proposition (USP)* Customer Buying Advantage (CBA)* Media selection* Budgeting* Know your customers* The psychology of the marketplace* Perception thinkingThe book also provides step-by-step details on:* Developing a rapid response system* Developing a competitive advantage* How to create a CBA\`Rapid Response Advertising' is fully documented with excellent real life examples of good advertising at work. While many of the case studies are from Ayling's home country of Australia, they are universal in their message and application.This book goes several steps further than many other titles on the market. It also goes several steps further than most copywriters would care to venture, but that's what makes this an even more valuable resource and it should allow any writer to add value to any business communication, from a simple direct mail letter to a multi-stage advertising campaign.-- Michael Meanwell, author of the critically-acclaimed 'The Enterprising Writer' and 'Writers on Writing'.

However, I have found the book to be filled with great examples and illustrations that I use in undergraduate and graduate agronomy instruction. It has been a good investment."},{"Title":"Crop Ecology: Productivity and Management in Agricultural Systems","review":"I came across this book as part of a class on quantitative ecology (whatever that may mean). Basically, this text strives to do too much, with little or no emphasis on quality or presentation. Granted, the authors present all the fundamental concepts, defining them succinctly as they are introduced, but in their attempt to show breadth, no particular topic is covered in depth.For instance, Chapter 10, which covers photosynthesis, could have been separated into three smaller, more focused chapters. The same thing could have been said about Chapter 9, which dealt with water relations. Chapter 9 was especially annoying, because the authors, in an attempt to appear quantitatively rigorous (via the superfluous use of equations), used the same symbols to connote two or three variables, and it was not long before the Professor and the students in the class got confused and gave up on the text.Then there is Chapter 6, which deals with the aerial environment. The authors repeatedly confused power and energy terms and units. Chapter One was about as bad, but here they repeatedly omitted discussions of the basis and context of their numbers, calculations and equations. I found their decision not to discuss the limitations of the concept of carrying capacity especially disturbing.Furthermore, the authors tend to be quite derisive in places, especially with regard to Third World cropping strategies (Chapter 5) and organic and bio-intensive agriculture (Chapters 15 and 18). Although I can understand their legitimate scientific criticisms of organic agriculture (and there are quite a few) and bio-intensive cultivation techniques (reliance on human power), their rich country bias shows when they deplore the low level of technological sophistication in the Third World. Apparently, the authors do not seem to realize that not everyone has access to credit and ag extension services, and that assuming that modern farming techniques in America and Australia can be extended to anyone, anywhere. The poor in the Third World do what they can with what they have, and the authors should appreciate this sad state of affairs, even if they don't respect it.Honestly, the book would have benefitted by some sort of comprehensive editting, as well as a list of symbols and notations at the beginning of each chapter. That way, the reader would not have to flip back and forth to figure out what they meant by this abbreviation or that symbol or equation.Still, the book did have some good points, those being the final chapter (Chapter 18- Towards an Uncertain Future), a list for further reading at the end of each chapter, and a large and comprehensive bibliography. The discussion on energetic inputs to agriculture in Chapter 15 was decent, but I found their penchant to quote numbers- estimates, projections and statistics, for which there was not a single reference to be off-putting. Finally, the authors do introduce all of the major fundamental scientific concepts underpinning modern economic cropping, so they can not be faulted for this, but the context is extremely limited- mostly the US and Australia, with one or two locations here and there thrown in the mix.In sum, this is not a good book for study of the various quantitave aspects of ecology, but it might serve as a reference of limited utility. A better book in the same category is W Larcher's Physiological Plant Ecology, which covers pretty much all of the same topics, albeit with much better organization and more focus."},{"Title":"Principles of Microeconomics (Study Guide)","review":"This book is almost as good as the textbook, which is really saying something because I think Prof Mankiw's corresponding textbook on Microeconomics is the best. Both the textbook and this study guide focuses on the fundamentals of Microeconomics and requires no higher level mathematical knowledge (although they will surely help) such as Calculus.This study guide provides a very good summary of each chapters. Each chapter has T/F, Multiple Choice, and Word Problems. Much of the questions, however, cannot be answered without carefully reading the textbook. So I do not recommend this book on its own unless one already has solid understanding of basic Microeconomics and want a refresher.My only issue with both the textbook and this study guide is that it takes a few chapters before heading into the core of Microeconomics such as MC=MR. Prof Greg Mankiw dedicates equal amount of text to each Microeconomic concept when some Microeconomics concepts are clearly more important than others. I thought there were too many chapters, for example, on government spending and taxation.I highly recommend this book as a companion to the textbook."},{"Title":"Principles of Microeconomics (Study Guide)","review":"This study guide is very, very helpful in truly understanding microeconomics.

I like this author and though this isn't my favorite of her books, it's a good read."},{"Title":"Somewhere Off the Coast of Maine: A Novel","review":"This book has a lot of interesting characters that it tells about in short bursts of vignettes. The story focuses on three female college students in the 1960s: Suzanne, who rebels against her prim and proper upbringing by running off with a poor poet; Elizabeth, who rebels by choosing to live a responsible life true to her ideals of peace, vegetarianism and ecology; and Claudia, who's just wild and rebellious, period. Unfortunately, each of these women suffers a tragedy. Suzanne's relationship breaks up when she refuses to have an abortion and, cut off from her family support, she becomes a struggling single mom with a daughter who doesn't understand her. Claudia loses a child and loses some of her sanity as a result. Elizabeth gets cancer and also has a daughter, Rebekah, who rejects her ideals and is embarrassed by her \\"hippie\\" parents.Hood's prose is spare, yet descriptive and is very pleasant to read, yet if you stop to think deeply about what you're reading you begin to wonder about it. For example, the descriptions of Suzanne working hard all day to be the top performer in a business management position, then picking up her baby daughter from day care and going home to work on restoring an old house all evening, simply doesn't ring true. No woman could keep up that superhuman effort on all fronts for as long as Suzanne apparently does to become a success. I also wondered why her daughter didn't seem to have any sense of how hard Suzanne had had to work to look after her - could a kid really be that un-aware? The story would have made more sense if Suzanne had cast herself back on her disapproving parents' doorstep. Elizabeth also manages to make her \\"ideals\\" look pretty unattractive and viewed through the eyes of a young teenager one ends up sympathizing a lot with Rebekah. An overarching question is why Hood would choose to so severely punish each of these girls for the choices they made when young. Surely one of them could have had a relatively happy life; as such, the book, with the exception of Rebekah's hopeful story, ends up being a pretty big downer."},{"Title":"Somewhere Off the Coast of Maine: A Novel","review":"This is the story of three women who were college friends during the 1960's. The novel is about how their lives meshed and separated and how memories both sustain and stifle independence.

I'd call it a thinking person's page-turner."},{"Title":"Somewhere Off the Coast of Maine: A Novel","review":"Give this boring and predictable novel a miss.

Three womens' lives have become intertwined through family and fate. Long gone are the sixties of their rebellious youth, but they still keep their memories close to their hearts as a loved one keeps a snippet of hair in a locket. We learn the values of these memorable characters through their children; family plays an important role in this novel. Sad at times, funny at other times, the novel is one to breeze through quickly and effortlessly, yet the reader is still left with a sense that they have read a classic novel of the human condition.

I wish that Ms. Hood had written in depth about her characters ~~ instead, I got a fuzzy image of each one of them, which is disappointing because she could write more about Claudia, Elizabeth, Suzanne, Sparrow and Rebekah. They are the kind of women that I'd be interested in knowing a little better than the sketch that I was given in this book.Claudia, Elizabeth and Suzanne were friends in college during the 1960s. Then one summer, each of them fell in love and got pregnant for the first time. Claudia and Elizabeth remained friends, while Suzanne moved to Boston to raise her daughter Sparrow alone. Claudia and Elizabeth married their respective lovers and raised families on a gorgeous farm ~~ with crabapple trees and daisies on that farm. Suzanne left her lover Abel because she refused to have an abortion ~~ and in turn became a hard, brittle woman whose daughter could never understand. Elizabeth also had a daughter Rebekah ~~ that she tried to understand but it wasn't till she was diagnosed with cancer that she was able to finally reach out to her daughter.There is a thin story line here ~~ and that alone is disappointing. Ms. Hood could have written more about Elizabeth and Rebekah, Suzanne and Sparrow, and Claudia's inability to let go of her son who drowned. The ending leaves a lot of questions unanswered.If you're looking for a quick read and something light, then I would recommend this book. It is well-written, but there isn't enough substance there to hold your imagination like a good author tries to do. It quite doesn't match up to my expectations of what a good book should do.

The themes explored here (the sixties, lost idealism, familial relations, the complexity of romantic relations) are frequent themes in her novels. so much so, that they become fairly redundant after awhile. this, however, is her best outing. Rather than probing deeply into the pysches of her characters, Hood instead takes the reader on an entertaining skim of thier surafaces, which are interesting enough to make the read a pleasant one. this book is kind of like a well made tv movie: insubstantial but entertaining, impossible to turn away from once you're hooked. an earlier reviewer compared the style to those of Ann Tyler or Alice Hoffman.

From a more reflective perspective than a nostalgic one, Hood portrays the evolving lives of three women, each reflected in their growing children's attitudes. Reveling in the heady political and social potential of a seminal decade, these women, twenty years later, deal with the fall out, the inevitable consequences of choices and lifestyles. Their parent's often impulsive decisions have influenced these young people, who both respect and resent their parent's extravagant excesses, the ramifications far more personal than political.Sparrow, successful businesswoman Suzanne's daughter, resists her mother's embrace of future vs. past, yearning for a connection with the father she has never known, the blonde- haired, handsome Abel she has romanticized in her imagination. Meanwhile, Suzanne has announced her impending marriage to Ron, a poor substitute for a glamorous, iconic sixties poet. Resenting Suzanne's desire to move on, Sparrow displays the taciturn, near-rudeness of a teen in turmoil, caught in a universal mother-daughter struggle of love and independence. Elizabeth and Howard, on the other hand, have continued their principled lifestyle, their pottery business easily sustaining a commitment to honoring the bounty of the natural world, causing teen-aged Rebekah considerable angst, the girl awkward with her peer group, anguished by her inability to make friends other than the slightly-older Henry Rebekah has known since childhood. Then unexpected tragedy strikes their lives as well.Henry's mother, Claudia, is the most tragic of the three college friends, unhinged years ago by the drowning of her first-born son, Simon. Married to a farmer, Claudia has enjoyed a simple existence with her husband and three sons on the farm, the open-ended possibilities of her world shattered by Simon's death. Unable to overcome this terrible loss, Claudia drifts between past and present, increasingly unable to cope with the demands of her family, even Henry's loving care. Beyond the usual travails that bedevil generations, a pervasive sadness accompanies the fortunes of these three women, an indication of Hood's penchant for writing of human frailties and the tentative connections we make to heal the burdens women face as wives and mothers. Although the 60s flashbacks are embarrassingly nave, the later years reflect more maturity in Hood's characters. Not surprisingly, the children of these rebellious hippies cherish their own dreams, the love of home and family a treasured, sometimes troubling legacy as they reach toward the future.

Most of the other books are generally haphazard and confusing (see my reviews of Hanover, West Orange and Livingston). Also, those others seemed geared for the locals, not for a wide audience. This book on Millburn (a quaint little town) is the exception to the rule, so far. The photos are logically arranged, and the surrounding text is relevant to what is depicted. That is something I can't say for the others. I've enjoyed this one, and I hope that the others I have picked up are equally impressive."},{"Title":"Millburn Short Hills (NJ) (Images of America) (Images of America (Arcadia Publishing))","review":"I received a great Christmas present this year. For me, \\"Images of America: Millburn, Short Hills\\" is a treasure. Having lived in Millburn during the '40s and '50s, I found many pictures that might have appeared in a family photo album. The photographs from earlier and later years provide bookends to the period. That pig farms and the country's largest billiard ball factory were located where my grade school later stood was news to me. Picking out my house in an aerial view was pleasing, as was seeing places that my friends and I explored unbeknownst to our parents (e.g., the abandoned quarry and the Whittingham mansion. Are kids allowed to do that any more?). It was distressing to see the fire that destroyed the Sweet Shop, where a Hershey Bar was a nickel and a comic book was a dime.The monochrome prints lend an aura of quiet nostalgia, of a reality that is not quite real in an era of hi-def, 3D, color TV, staccato assaults to the eye, and blaring advertising sound bites. The plot line introduced by the book's figure captions is smooth, just enough to complement the graphical history.

Yet, inexplicably, David isn't satisfied with these blessings and becomes increasingly addicted to a life of deceit. On his fateful course, he finds himself drawn to higher and higher levels of deception to feel challenged and fulfilled. While some of us are content to take a trip or find a new hobby if life feels flat and dull, not so for this guy. Instead, he raises the stakes all the time, weaving more and more intricate lies as he goes.Deciding he was too special to be a mere bachelor OR just a married man, he decides he deserves to be both. This leads to his marrying Dorothy, and convincing his wife that he is an undercover agent to explain his extended absences from home. His ruse allows him to take cruises and enjoy every svelte young lady who meets his fancy, then rush home to Dorothy's arms after his \\"mission\\" is over. Had it stopped there, he may have been able to pull off the deception indefinitely, but his escalating need for risk drives him to unethical business practices, bigamy, and the expenses of a dual lifestyle with two different families, ultimately ending in a tragic murder of wife Jayne.As hard as it is to believe that the entire twisted tale is true, court documents and trial transcripts support that in this case, fact is far and away more compelling than fiction. And sadly for Dorothy, only too real in the way it ruined her world, and even worse, deprived Jayne of her very life."},{"Title":"Deadly Pretender","review":"Very true and shocking story of David Miller, who leads a life of greed and deception.

How could this man believe he could get away with this ruse of leading a double life? It seems that David Miller believed from the time he was a youngun that he was \\"special\\" and amazingly he became a very successful lobbyist, surrounded by elite politicians and beatiful, available women; He falls in love with Dorothy but not for one minute does he entertain the thought of being faithful to her; he sort of puts her in a compartment and weaves a tale that he is in the CIA and must travel all over the world, to expalin why he isn't home much. With that situation pretty much under control he carries on with his lobbying activities and maintaining his elite status. Not satisfied with his life, and believing he deserves so much more, he marries again, this time to Jayne. This act was the beginning of the end for him and unbeknownst to poor Jayne, the day she said said hello to him on an airplane, her death warrant was signed, sealed and delivered. As he attempted to juggle two wives, his life spins out of control and as he tries desperately to get control of the situation fear becomes the predominant feeling; the fear that he will be discovered and lose everything. This comes to pass when Jayne finds out about his deception and threatens to tell the world about who he really is; she announces to him her intentions of doing just that; she tells him to meet her at a storage unit, where she intends to put his stuff at the curb. David the sociopath, who is now going to be found out, decides that he will stop Jayne and in fact he shoots her to death in front of strangers at the storage unit facility.

There is no better prison story than \\"Green River Rising\\". It blows stories like \\"The Green Mile\\" and \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" out of the water.Willocks has taken a hiatus, of sorts, from his fiction writing and we are all suffering as a consequence.

Perhaps, it's this seemingly odd juxtaposition of musings on the mysteries of existence and the meaning of life and the frenetic action the major players are forced to engage in by the dark, primal forces that drive them that explains the book's attraction.

I was a little dismayed to find that this novel is a kind of follow up to Bad City Blues but it still works on its own.Basically the story was really good and I like novels that give some pretty gritty narrative and tough characters. However, this novel is not short and after a while I began to find the fact that every single character is completely devoid of redeeming qualities a bit tedious. Willocks creates a difficult blend of sympathy for his protagonist and cynical disgust at the darker side of him. Willocks is certainly a fantastic writer and Clarence Jefferson is one of the finest villians since Frank Booth.I also thought that Willocks kind of fizzled out at the end and after a very promising build up, things just kind of stopped.

This course is for students looking for a text that presents latin in a progressive and understandable format, which focuses on immersion in reading latin rather than consumption of immense volumes of grammatical information. The grammar is introduced slowly as it is needed (The grammar excercises in the second half of the book need to be done concurrantly with the chapter). The editors obviously are attempting to make learning latin easier by building vocabulary functionally and simply. This is essential for anyone that doesn't have the time to spend memorizing endless charts, or who struggles to understand grammar when it is abstracted from practical use in reading the language. It is much more useful to gain a working knowledge of vocabulary and grammar and then to memorize all the principle parts, conjugations, declensions, etc. I recommend using the oxford course first then moving to wheelock's for mastery of latin grammar.In the end, this course is excellent for students because it is presented in a way that allows for a simple, progressive, and functional introduction to Latin. They lack answers ( though I haven't seen the teacher's text) but taking the time to check your work using the vocabulary lists and glossary is good review. The comics are terribly drawn and somewhat annoying, but are trivial. If the editors forgot some principles, any student that will miss them will study more advanced courses anyway. These books are the answer for anyone like me who found it impossible to learn the language from endless and voluminous sections on grammar, and I was one of the top students in my college course (I didn't have the time to take anything beyond the introduction and have had to teach my self since)."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"This book is rather bipolar in its usefullness. It is nice (though often annoying) that it does make things easy on the user by using easy stories. &quot;Quintus goes to the pub&quot; will allow you to concentrate on the language and not the complex meaning of the story. Furthermore, it allows for a sort of &quot;catch up&quot; phase in that every four chapters or so there is a chapter in which nothing new is introduced. A time to really concentrate on what you are suppose to have learned. These are its good points.This will sound trivial but still bothers me a year after having finished this book...the art is wretched. Who drew these pictures? People often are drawn without arms or legs and switch shades of colors between images that are directly beside on another. And never (NEVER) look into the background. Whoever did draw these books not only had little skill in art, but had no knowledge of Roman life. Secondly, the book has this &quot;tell you later&quot; aspect. They allow little things to pop up here and ther and then explain them in the next chapter. Sure, some will say that this is a good way to slowly move into the grammer, but it does you no good to see a word and have no idea whatsoever to do with it. Beyond this, often when they do explain things they do so in a small context. &quot;A&quot; is used for 1. And you shall go on like that for some time before they tell you &quot;A&quot; is used also for 2 &amp; 4, which up until this point we have been using &quot;B.&quot; Later, we learn that &quot;B&quot; is the exact same but they cared not to let us in on that little fact. Of course, maybe they don't want to push too much on us, which is a fair argument. But, then, they should put annotations to further chapters so that if we want to we may look further ahead to gain, no understanding, but context. The book also, has its fair share of mistakes, which you will may not realize and which then may really hinder your learning.So, the book has its good and bad points. Overall I think it is a good book to learn with, but it definately could be revised and some of these problems fixed."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"I would have to agree that reviews written by students and autodidacts are pretty much, sorry, useless.

Either the student can learn Indirect Statement from 10 sample sentences, or the teacher would have to spend time writing 50 for them. Well, I like its stories and arrangement, but all their merits are fully nullified by the mere fact that complementary materials virtually do not exist. The same editors did a fantastic job in its Greek counterpart -- Athenaze, which employs the same friendly narrative/reading immersion method, but comes with abundant exercises and a workbook. It puzzles me why the same editors decided to sell Latin short.The Oxford Series also makes a sorry attempt at 'balancing' the traditional (grammar) approach and the new (living language) approach; the result is it fails miserably at both. If you prefer the traditional, use Jenney. If you prefer the extreme of the new, use Cambridge. If you prefer one that does the best job at both, I personally recommend Ecce Romani. It uses the same friendly narrative/reading immersion method, but comes with clear explanation of grammar, abundant practice material, student activity book and a teacher's test book.Somebody was wondering who drew all the terrible pictures: the editor's wife, who obviously has no talent, did. I'd chalk that one up to one of Oxford's good points, though. Your students will love making fun of the cactus-shaped and -sized fingers."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"I have now completed the three books of this course over three semesters at the university level. First of all, there are several things the books do well. As long as students practice translating all the text in a given chapter, and work through the exercises, they should have a solid grasp of Latin vocabulary. The passages are fairly interesting; they are a combination of fiction and biography of the great poet Q. Horatius Flaccus. There is also a good deal of historical and cultural material introduced with each chapter. Students will get a basic understanding of what life in Roman times was like and what the main historical events were in the first century B.C.The main problem I have with these books is that they attempt to &quot;hide&quot; grammar from the student. Grammar introduced in the chapter is put in a separate section in the back of the book, which is very inconvenient. Grammatical explanations tend to be very short; someone trying to learn Latin from these books alone would have a good deal of trouble, particularly when things get a little more complicated (e.g. with the subjunctive mood).I may be a bit old-fashioned when it comes to learning languages. I think this course has more than a little bit of the whole language philosophy to it. Students are encouraged to learn by reading, and, unless the instructer is careful, &quot;minor&quot; errors in translation can easily occur, especially in passages where the student is encouraged to read for comprehension, not to produce a literal translation.Having gone through courses in Greek using a more traditional grammar-oriented approach, I have to say I prefer the latter. Although it is more challenging for the student at first, I believe they will get a deeper understanding in the long run. As an added benefit, people who carefully study the grammar of a foreign language often find that their understanding of their native tongue improves. This is certainly the case with Latin.If you are in a Latin course where this text is used, don't despair, especially if you have a good teacher. This series is perfectly serviceable. For teachers trying to decide which text to use, however, I would recommend a more grammar-oriented textbook like Wheelock or Moreland and Fleischer."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"I worked my way through parts I and II of this Oxford Latin before stumbling upon Henle's latin course. I did honestly enjoy the Oxford course, but it's certainly no way to really acquire lingua latinae-- at least not in any great depth. The Oxford course also focuses strictly on classical latin, without any reference to ecclesiastical latin-- a major, major drawback, IMO.I wasted over $40 on parts I and II of this Oxford course, good money for mere superficial pamphlets! If your goal is to really learn latin, go with the four volume Henle course (each volume is around 400 pages!-- 300% more pages and 30% cheaper than Oxford! ). There is also an additional _Latin Grammar_ volume that is to be used in conjunction with the four volumes. Henle is a Jesuit philosopher and latinist, and his presentation is solid. And unlike the Oxford course, you will learn both classical and ecclesiastical-- the latter being VERY important in academic research/scholarship."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"Having read some very critical reviews of this series, I wanted to say I have found it engaging and pretty well done. For my students, perhaps an overwhelming reason to choose it was the price, which compares very favorably with the $60 to $80 many conventional Latin texts cost.I agree with some critics it would be better if there were more supplementary materials and, for many teachers who were educated more traditionally, not introducing all the principal parts of verbs at once is an adjustment. However, I do feel there are many things to commend this series, including the heavy emphasis on reading for comprehension instead of just rote learning. It certainly introduces a lot of vocabulary in a short time and gives a context for it.All in all, my home school students have done well with this text."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"I have this book, and it helped me realize that I enjoy Latin. However, the grammar is not explained very well, and I find that I cannot learn a new chapter without guidance from a teacher. Since I live in an area without many Latin teachers, I had difficulty utilizing this book with independent study. However, with a teacher to explain the grammar, this book would be all right. Another problem is that the cartoons at the beginning of each chapter are poorly drawn. Even though this might seem trivial to some, it really does bother me. Personally, I would look for a better text, but this one is OK if you have a teacher."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"As a high school student in a Latin course using this text, I can say that it is of excellent quality. It starts out simply, with the very basics, then gradually moves into the more complex areas of the language. The book provides plenty of passages to apply the knowledge gained in each chapter, which are a great help in mastering the material. A possible drawback for some may lie in the fact that the concepts of tense and voice are not touched upon until well into the second volume."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"At first I thought this book was for children with only like 100pages thin. Couldn;t believe this was a college textbook for a quarter. (UCD is in quarter system.) But this childish looking book can be challenging if you don;t keep up the pace.Anyway, about this book... This book separates the reading passages from grammar sections that can be found at the back of the book. Stories are interesting and it does give you rich vocabularies in each chapter. The grammar sections are clear and are easy to understand.What is bad about this book? I agree with previous reviewers that the cartoon that (probably author's wife or sister or someone) drew pictures horribly. Couldn't tell which was a girl or guy and also the expressions of people in the cartoons were very weird or may not go along with the context.Another problem of this book is that the latin vocabulary in the index does not have all the words from each chapter. So you might want to buy Latin dictionary for some words.And finally, I wished that odd answers were found at the back but there aren't any. So this means that you will have hard time to self-study. You need a professor for this book to correct your homework and give you some feedback.These are only minor issues that makes the book not perfect.Other than that, I think this book okay overall. Book teaches you less boring way, I think, because my Latin professor told us in class that they learned pretty boring and hard traditional way that she did not like Latin at first. That probably implies the reason why almost everyone hated Latin a few decades ago.So if you got a prof, everything should be fine. My last advice: Just don't procrastinate memorizing vocabs Latin, or you will find yourself pretty miserable in class.My actual rating for this book: 4.3~4.5"},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"This is one of the best courses for the self-taught Latin learner that I have ever found. Easy to follow, it uses the &quot;learn by doing&quot; method of reading and learning from context, rather than bogging the reader down in intimidating Latin grammar. Grammar is introduced based on readings, and is broken up into short lessons so that it isn't too much to absorb at once. Plus, there's a real sense of accomplishment from reading Roman myths and about the wanderings of Aeneas in Latin! I recommend this course!"},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"I used the Oxford Latin Course for 3 years beginning as a 14 year old, and took a further 2 years of Latin at university. This gave me excellent preparation and I was extremely well equipped going into college. I now tutor Latin and I use the Oxford series whenever I can.To address a couple of the concerns expressed by more negative reviews:One reviewer noted that the \\"series as a whole\\" doesn't address several important uses of grammar. They then continue, to say that they only looked at the first two books. It's true that the Oxford Latin series ignores many of the more complex grammar until late in the second volume and the third volume. Please don't let this bother you - that is simply the teaching methodology of this particular series. It is very easy for English speakers to be overwhelmed by the grammar rules of Latin. The gradual approach of Oxford is wise, but it does assume that you continue to the next volumes of the series if you want to read primary texts.Other reviewers have complained about the lack of emphasis on ecclesiastical Latin. I don't understand this, even though I'm very active in the Catholic Church and use ecclesiastical Latin almost daily. If you know classical Latin, ecclesiastical Latin is a breeze. The reverse is not true. If you really want to learn the Latin language, then please, learn classical and read the greats such as Caesar and Cicero and Ovid (selections from whom are supplied in the Oxford Latin Reader, which I still go back to when I need to refresh).

I'm writing it because I don't see any reviews from teachers - they all seem to be from students or self-learners (bless their hearts). To be fair, I haven't actually used this series in class yet, but am about to because it is what the school has been using and I thought I would give it a try. I just spent the afternoon looking through it and I am a little worried (and embarrassed, having studied at Oxford). The other user complaints about the presentation (Grammar at the back, etc.) and artwork seem to me to pale in comparison to the fact that many non-trivial aspects of Latin grammar seem to be entirely missing (a couple, in fact, are actually incorrect). Also, since the perfect system for verbs (active and passive) aren't introduced until very late, students seem to learn many verbs beforehand, and then never learn the third and fourth principal parts. (Where is fero's &quot;latus&quot; given, for example? Have I missed it?) Some examples of grammar not included (based on a quick comparison with Moreland and Fleischer) seem to be:Causal and concessive uses of participlesSubstantive use of adjectivesRelative clauses of characteristicSubjunctive subordinate clauses in indirect discourseNegative clauses of fearing with &quot;ut&quot;Use of the passive periphrastic as a future passive participleThe Supine (although it's promised for Vol. III in Vol. II)Many uses of various cases: dative of the possesor(!); double dative; ablative of agent (!); ablative of cause; genitive of description; genitive of characteristic; partitive genitive; objective and subjective genitives (the authors appear to have a dislike of the genitive); Greek accusative; adverbial accusativeThe plural forms of &quot;vis&quot;Clauses of provisoClauses of doubtingHistorical infinitiveAnyway, that's my first impression, for what it's worth."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"As a teacher, I have found this book to be the best for educating the students who disagree with current suggestive rote learning methods. Instead of memorization routines and excessive lists, this book utilizes a &quot;remember by example&quot; method which allows many of my students to easily pick up latin words. If some words are listed, they are listed logicaly (by grammatical refence insted of just alphabetical order), which also provides a easier way to remember grammar by grouping similar words together. To use this book effectively, one must use the excercies in the back of the book concordantly with the chapter itself.Some reviews above suggest that the editors are lazy, but I can not see why a teacher would use such a &quot;canned&quot; teaching method. Students are not a single group, every person is an invdividual, and tests, worksheets, and other supplemental material should be tailored by the teacher, not the editors."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"I used the first edition for a Latin course I taught 8+ years ago.

We've made it through 7 Lessons and although they are challenged to keep it all straight (declensions, conjugations, case, gender, number, agreement, ...) , they are succeeding. If they were older I'd probably use Wheelock where you get real Latin jewels in the \\"sententiae antinquae\\".I'm a little disappointed in the 2nd Edition format. The grammar/exercises have been removed from the mainline content (reading passages, historical highlights) and placed in the back of the book. And there is no indication which execises should be given prior to content. So, if you are doing this on your own, you may want to first read the \\"cartoon\\" at the start of each chapter/lesson and then do all the grammar/exercises followed by the mainline content.

They many not be the easiest, by any means, but they are far and away one of the best and most rewarding. While on one level it is definitely a \\"reading course\\" (i.e., it has you reading extended narrative prose from the very beginning) it really does combine the best of the modern and traditional approaches. The course develops reading skills as much as any \\"inductive\\" textbook (even one at the end of the spectrum like Cambridge Latin Course), and yet it teaches grammar explicitly and from the very beginning. Furthermore the grammar is presented in manageable amounts (though not in dribs and drabs), and authors tend to present things in a more sensible sequence than a strictly traditional textbook. Thus someone who finishes this course will have very strong reading skills and yet will have as solid an understanding of grammar and syntax as someone who has used an old-fashioned grammar-translation textbook like Wheelock.The premise of the course, which follows the life of the Roman poet Horace, is absolutely brilliant. We know a fair amount about the personal life of Horace through his Satires and Odes, and Horace lived through (and was even an active participant in) some of the most interesting events in Roman history. Hence, the entire course breaths Roman history. Also, the Latin of the narrative passages -- almost from the very beginning -- feels like real Latin (much more so than almost any beginning Latin book), and at times can be quite lovely. Book III (the last third of course that presents basic Latin grammar and syntax) introduces extended excerpts from the poetry of Horace and Vergil. This is a bit of a stretch for the beginner, but it's well worth the effort. Someone who has completed this course, unlike most other textbook, will have had some significant contact with the grandeur of Roman literature.The Reader (the fourth book in the series) is a bit of a stretch for beginning students. There are no long marks (though an argument can be made that this is a good time to dispense with them), and the selection of authors, on whole, is a bit tough (Caesar being by far the easiest). An easier author like Eutropius or Nepos might have been a good addition to this reader (of course, it could be supplemented withWar with Hannibal: Authentic Latin Prose for the Beginning StudentorCornelius Nepos: Three Lives -- Alcibiades, Dion, Atticus, or the like). On the other hand, perhaps the students' exposure to Horace and Vergil in Book III prepares them for the tougher literature.There is also a very good teacher's manual that gives both historical background to each chapter (remember this course is absolutely saturated with Roman history!) as well as a full answer key to the exercises and reading passages. This would make the course very user-friendly for the independent learner."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part I","review":"I have several different Latin language courses, and this one and Hans Orberg'sLingua Latina: Pars I: Familia Romana (Pt. 1) (Latin Edition)are the best.The Cambridge courseCambridge Latin Course Unit 1 Student's Text North American edition (North American Cambridge Latin Course)is nice, too, but didn't catch my interest as much, and I can best describe WheelockWheelock's Latin (Wheelock's Latin)as the \\"throw grammar at you first method\\", and if you survive that, maybe you'll get to read something.

The first, provacatively titled The Missionary Position examines Mother Teresa's faith and practice. Written by Christopher Hitchens, the book received a fair amount of recognition and formed the basis for a television documentary. The book is quite short and contains very little in the way of footnotes and documentation.The other critical biography is entitled Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict and is written by Aroup Chatterjee. This title is several hundred pages longer than Hitchens' book and contains extensive documentation. Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict claims to reveal \\"the REAL Teresa (from the back cover).\\" Like Hitchens, Chatterjee is an atheist and his dislike of Mother Teresa has little to do with a religious bias. Like Hitchens, he has found that the reality of the woman and her work is a far cry from the legend. However, unlike Hitchens, he is a native of Calcutta, the city where Mother Teresa did her work, and the very city which will forever be linked to her.Before I summarize the book, allow me to make one general statement. The book is long - probably too long. As I have already mentioned, Chatterjee provides extensive documentation and often provides multitudes of examples where only two or three may have sufficed. He sometimes repeats information in subsequent chapters, using the same information to prove two points. This, of course, is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does call into question the book's organization. In short, the book has some of the problems typical of those that have not been professionally edited. Due to the nature of the book's subject matter, professional publishing was not a possibility, so Chatterjee had to make do largely on his own.A terse summary of Chatterjee's primary concerns with Mother Teresa appear in the final chapter where he quotes his \\"Deposition Before the Committee for Beatification/Canonisation of Mother Teresa.\\" Among Chatterjee's concerns are:* Mother Teresa often said that she picked people up from the streets of Calcutta, but she and her order of nuns did not do this. People requesting such service were told curtly to ring 102 (similar to 911).* While the order owns several ambulances, these are used primarily to transport nuns to and from places of prayer.* Mother Teresa said that her order fed 4000, 5000, 7000 or 9000 Caltuttans every day (the number varied). The two or three soup kitchens in Calcutta feed a maximum of only 300 people per day. The kitchens will provide food only to people with \\"food cards\\" that are distrubuted predominantly to the Catholic poor.* While Mother Teresa's order has some presence in many countries throughout the world, the majority of these are for training monks or nuns, not for aiding the poor.* Mother Teresa's shelters will usually only help children if the parents sign a form of renunciation which signs the rights to the children to her organization.* Mother Teresa often insists that her natural family clinics prevent unwanted pregnancies, but this number is without any basis in truth.* Mother Teresa insisted that suffering was beautiful as it evoked Christ's suffering, but when ill she visited exclusive, expensive hospitals.* The hospice in Calcutta through which Mother Teresa gained such wide recognition is very small (80 beds) and provides little medical care. Needles are reused, all patients are forced to have their heads shaven, visitors are forbidden and painkillers are rarely if ever used. The nurses do not speak the language of the people and are not usually involved in the care of the patients. This duty is assumed by volunteers.* Mother Teresa often accepted money from suspicious sources, the most notable of which is Charles Keating, America's most notorious thief.Through his research and involvment in the deposition, Chatterjee came to the realization that canonization is not bestowed on the basis of morality, but on the basis of strict and committed adherence to the tenets of Catholicism. As an atheist, this was exasperating to him.Chatterjee quotes Mother Teresa as saying, \\"We are not nurses, we are not doctors, we are not teachers, we are not social workers. We are religious, we are religious, we are religious.\\" Yet Mother Teresa is known as a humanitarian and one who gave her life to the poor. The reality seems far different.What do we learn from a book like this? We learn that as Christians we must have a consistent witness in our words and our deeds. We also learn the importance of choosing our heroes with the utmost of care. And we learn that many heroes are manufactured - that the legend far exceeds the reality."},{"Title":"Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict","review":"Dr. Aroup Chatterjee has presented meticulously researched uimpeachable evidence (photograph, videograph, recorded telephone conversations, etc.) exposing the enormous lie behind the Mother Teresa myth (soon to be declared saint by the Vatican!). MT was more interested in missionary (religious) activity than in charity, and played a big role in promoting the myth that sorrounded her. Amidst the unquestioned acceptance of this &quot;mother of all myths&quot; at least one person has stood up and exposed the lie. The book also illustrates how the media can create extraordinary myths (and equally well shatter lives) leaving truth far behind."},{"Title":"Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict","review":"Mother Teresa made a name for herself as a selfless angel of the poor. At least in the Western world. Aroup Chatterjee, a native Calcuttan, in his meticulously researched book, dares to offer a different viewpoint. With all of the money that Mother Teresa received, evidently very little of it actually went to the poor of Calcutta. Most of the money was used in the upkeep of Nuns and Brothers and the training of priests around the world. First and foremost, Mother Teresa's mission was to spread Catholicism and her strong anti-abortion beliefs. When an author wanted to write a book on her, she told him:\\"We are not nurses, we are not doctors, we are not teachers, we are not social workers. We are religious, we are religious, we are religious.\\" That pretty much sums it up.Beyond the story of Mother Teresa, there are insights into everyday life in Calcutta. The author is quick to point out that the image of Calcutta that Mother Teresa presented to the world is not an accurate portrayal of that city.A fascinating read."},{"Title":"Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict","review":"This is an impressive book, conceived out of deep regard for Calcutta and its inhabitants, and an overwhelming sadness that, in the eyes of the world, the author Aroup Chatterjee's vibrant home city and its culture \\"have become synonymous with the worst of human suffering and degradation\\". This dishonest stereotype was perpetuated in the service of the extraordinarily stubborn mythology of Mother Teresa, and created by Malcolm Muggeridge, a man who famously hated Calcutta. The author has amassed much oral and recorded audio and visual evidence, to support this indictment of Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.Some readers will feel the book might have been better edited; Khushwant Singh has written that a date is incorrect, and so concludes that all other evidence, however well documented, is automatically suspect; some readers object to the occasional use of hearsay evidence; some simply choose to ignore all his evidence on the grounds that his conclusions disagree with their preconceived ideas. Some critics assert that Dr. Chatterjee's atheism negates his testimony (his Roman Catholic wife would disagree: brought up \\"in Ireland on Teresa mythology, [she] felt angry and cheated when she went to Calcutta and saw how the reality compared with the fairy tale\\"). I'd argue that it's actually impossible to reconcile most of Teresa's philosophy and practice with the Church's teaching; the only thing they seem to agree on is birth control.I've seen no criticism substantial enough to refute the case, well made by the author, that a grave injustice has been perpetrated on the poor of Calcutta, and of the other cities around the world where the order has made itself at home, and (not to put too fine a point on it) blagged its sisters and brothers a living (albeit a living which tends to injure the personalities of many of those sisters). His case is corroborated by other authoritative sources.Many millions, if not billions, of dollars have been collected in Mother Teresa's name over the years, ostensibly for the relief of the poor; such vast sums could have fed and rehoused hundreds of thousands, or built hospitals and schools throughout the Indian subcontinent. There has been little to show for this cash other than a few hundred (at most, per facility) hard-won bowls of soup a day, and the most basic of shelter and care for a comparatively small number of sick and orphaned. This is a betrayal, not only of the disadvantaged whose needs were not met, but also of the good faith of well-intentioned donors.Those donors apparently didn't realise that the money was largely used to fund Teresa's constant crusade against contraception and abortion, in clinics, parliaments and courthouses around the world, this despite the fact that one proven remedy for poverty is the empowerment of women, and their emancipation from perpetual childbearing and its consequences; even her admirer Khushwant Singh has admitted that her \\"views on artificial contraception and crusade against abortion made little sense in a country where the population has crossed permissible limits\\", and that \\"Teresa's admirers, chiefly journalists and film-makers, vastly exaggerated the poverty and squalor of Calcutta in order to glorify her image as the saint of the gutters\\". And the juxtaposition of misfortune and saintliness, in entertainment and news, is a media money-spinner. Win-win!This book is not an 'ad hominem' attack; its purpose is not to prove some minor imperfections in Mother Teresa's character, but to document how so many of the assumed acts of charity for which she accepted donations, and for which she continues to be celebrated, simply did not happen. This continues since her death; the so-called \\"miracle\\" for which the Catholic Church had her beatified, ie the healing of Monica Besra's \\"cancerous tumour\\" through the agency of a picture of Teresa, cannot have happened, since Ms. Besra never had anything more than a benign tubercular cyst, cured through conventional treatment; her physician, Dr. Ranjan Mustafi, and her own father, would willingly testify to this, if the Vatican were willing to interview them. The Church has strict rules on how one qualifies for sainthood; should it not stick religiously to those rules? Dr. Chatterjee has been accused of attempting to prevent the Church from recognising her as a saint; in fact, his declared view is that \\"She subscribed to a religious point of view and it is up to the clergy of that religion to decide what to do with her. I myself am not against her becoming a saint.\\"I knew a deeply religious Catholic woman who volunteered to work with the order in the early 80s, and was horrified to see how so little help was given to the needy, and how funds, medicines and goods donated for that purpose were sold, used for the sisters' benefit, discarded, or left to gather dust in cupboards and corners, forgotten and unused (not deliberately stored; storing things showed \\"lack of trust in Divine Providence\\"). I worked in a London hospital where sisters from her order occasionally received treatment (Teresa preferred American clinics when she was sick herself), while the unfortunates in their care, in Calcutta as in other cities throughout the world, received little more than the odd paracetamol (acetaminophen) and a bed (sometimes shared) to die in. Dr. Chatterjee's book provides much more evidence of the hypocrisy evident in the order's practices.In 1994, Lancet editor Robert Fox visited their facility for the dying, and was shocked to find maladministration in diagnosis and treatment practices, a failure to isolate TB patients, and refusal to use strong analgesics for intractable pain. Many volunteers have told how syringes were washed in luke-warm water before being used again; medicines and mosquito nets lay unused in cupboards; diagnostic tests were not performed; patients died needlessly from septicaemia as a direct result of the sisters' poor hygiene, and of readily curable infections for want of a short course of antibiotics (which in some instances the sisters already had in their possession); patients requiring life-saving surgery were refused transfer to hospital. Ambulances donated for the collection of the sick were used as taxis for the sisters; the sick were told to use Corporation ambulances.Parents were forced to formally renounce their children before the order would accept them; dying Hindus and Muslims were \\"baptised\\" without their knowledge or consent.Susan Shields, who was a member of the order from 1980-89, wrote in the Free Enquirer [...] that the \\"sisters reused needles until they became blunt. Seeing the pain caused by the blunt needles, some of the volunteers offered to procure more needles, but the sisters refused.\\"Ms. Shields explains Teresa's teachings, which are fundamental to her religious congregation, and \\"strangle efforts to alleviate misery\\": \\"[1] that the Holy Spirit was guiding Mother... as long as a sister obeys she is doing God's will... [2] that the sisters have leverage over God by choosing to suffer... He then dispenses more graces to humanity... [3] that any attachment to human beings, even the poor being served, supposedly interferes with love of God and must be vigilantly avoided or immediately uprooted. The efforts to prevent any attachments cause continual chaos and confusion... Once a sister has accepted these fallacies she will do almost anything. She can allow her health to be destroyed, neglect those she vowed to serve, and switch off her feelings and independent thought. She can turn a blind eye to suffering, inform on her fellow sisters, tell lies with ease, and ignore public laws and regulations.\\" With the sisters' capacity for self-love reduced to tatters, \\"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\\" takes on a sinister meaning. In 2005, Donal MacIntyre worked for a week at their flagship home for disabled children, and provided film footage of care which was sometimes loving, but invariably inept, unprofessional and unhygienic, and in some cases rough and dangerous.Archbishop Zimowski specifically addressed the use of painkillers in end-of-life care in a speech he gave last year, placing it first in the context of the gift of suffering: \\"The suffering according to Christian teaching... especially during the last moments of life, has a special place in God's saving plan; it is in fact a sharing in Christ's passion... Therefore, one must not be surprised if some Christians prefer to moderate their use of painkillers, in order to... associate themselves in a conscious way with the sufferings of Christ crucified. Nevertheless it would be imprudent to impose a heroic way of acting as a general rule. On the contrary, human and Christian prudence suggest for the majority of sick people the use of medicines capable of alleviating or suppressing pain, even though these may cause as a secondary effect semi- consciousness and reduced lucidity. As for those who are not in a state to express themselves, one can reasonably presume that they wish to take these painkillers, and have them administered according to the doctor's advice.\\"As for witholding life-saving treatments, he went on: \\"By euthanasia, therefore, is understood an action or an omission which of itself or by intention causes death, in order that all suffering may in this way be eliminated... [it] constitutes a murder gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God, his Creator.\\"That's all pretty unambiguous. The order's actions fell far short of this standard of care; nor could Teresa's apologists reasonably argue that the Archbishop's is a new position; it's absolutely consistent with that of Pius XII in 1957, which she should have been familiar with, given that end-of-life care was her chosen field. So how the Catholic Church reconciles its veneration of Teresa with the practices at her house for the dying, God only knows.As for rehousing the homeless: requests that the order contribute to such schemes were steadfastly ignored or rejected, and yet Teresa was happy to attend press events at the completion of such projects (press attention frequently being hard to come by without her presence), and content to receive the publicity arising from the mistaken belief that her order had contributed. Ironically, many buildings have been donated to the order over the years, in many cities worldwide, or sold to it for negligable sums ($1 apiece for two in New York city!); often Teresa had \\"worked on\\" the owner, for as long as need be, according to her associate and biographer (and spokesperson for her order) Sunita Kumar.Ms. Kumar also told how \\"Mother Teresa saw it as her God-given right never to have to pay anyone for anything. Once she bought food for her nuns in London for 500. When she was told she'd have to pay at the till, [she] shouted, \`This is for the work of God!' She raged so loud and so long that eventually a businessman waiting in the queue paid up on her behalf.\\" Small wonder, then, that so many millions of dollars, donated to her order, lay unused in Church bank accounts even at her death, contradicting those \\"thousands of letters to donors, telling them that their entire gift would be used to bring God's loving compassion to the poorest of the poor\\" (Susan Shields).Teresa and her sisters explicitly held that to spend money to care for the poor, to address the root causes of poverty and disease, or to use diagnostic procedures and medicines the order could well afford, would \\"tend towards materialism\\" and so contravene their vow of poverty. Yet the people in their care had taken no such vow, the money and goods had been given expressly for their earthly welfare, and the fear of materialism evidently didn't apply when Teresa and her sisters needed medical attention! If only N.T. Wright had been around, to give her a nudge: \\"God is rescuing us from the shipwreck of the world, not so that we can sit back and put our feet up in his company, but so that we can be part of his plan to remake the world. We are in orbit around God and his purposes, not the other way around.\\"Witnesses to the order's practices have found precious little audience for their evidence. As Christopher Hitchens has observed: \\"Ever since [Muggeridge's film] Something Beautiful for God, the critic of Mother Teresa in small things, as well as great ones, has had to operate against an enormous weight of received opinion, a weight made no easier to shift by the fact that it is made up quite literally of illusion.\\" Those of us who have been duped into handing over money, or granting her positive publicity, have a vested interest in maintaining the myth; where donating money is the full extent of our contribution, we need to feel our offerings were not in vain, and that our nominated agents of charity are conscientiously performing acts of charity on our behalf. \\"In the gradual manufacture of an illusion, the conjuror is only the instrument of the audience.\\"Teresa could not refute, though she occasionally tried to deflect, such criticisms; for the most part she refused to acknowledge them, although she occasionally changed her itineraries as a result. This was not a case of \\"turning the other cheek\\", for she was notably litigious where she felt she had a case. Her order has maintained that same tradition since her death.Mother Teresa may have loved the poor, but she loved poverty more. She professed that \\"I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people.\\" In a filmed interview she spoke of how she had told a patient suffering unbearable pain from terminal cancer: \\"You are suffering like Christ on the cross. So Jesus must be kissing you.\\" She related his reply: \\"Then please tell him to stop kissing me.\\" According to Paul (Romans 4) \\"The words '[Abraham's faith] was credited to him [as righteousness]' were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness--for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.\\" By what authority, then, did Teresa require that the poor also suffer, even as they pleaded for their suffering to cease?Such offensive, and doctrinally ignorant, philosophies as that of hers, which makes a virtue of the poor's avoidable suffering, have been promoted for far too long, to justify and perpetuate inequality, and to salve the consciences of the more fortunate amongst us. She accepted money from dictators and thieves (the Duvaliers, Enver Hoxha, Charles Keating), and heaped praise on them for their charity. As Hitchens observed, \\"This returns us to the medieval corruption of the church, which sold indulgences to the rich while preaching hellfire and continence to the poor.\\" Luke 18:14 quotes Jesus: \\"everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.\\"Humbling oneself is a matter of free will; we don't recommend ourselves to God by humbling or maltreating others, in open defiance to all charity or loving kindness (however we construe 'ag&aacute;pe'). \\"God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty\\" (1 Corinthians 1:27), not to let the mighty off the hook!Teresa and her sisters have, in part, fulfilled their vow of poverty vicariously, through the privations of their unfortunate charges, remaining staunchly passive, offering only pious aphorisms and professions of love, where a little action on their part could have saved much anguish and many lives; the powerful, and those of us who enjoy a measure of financial security, purchase a veneer of righteousness at the expense of the sufferings of the poor, since our donations would have done more good in the hands of agencies which tackle the root causes of poverty; it's as if the Council of Trent had never happened.Teresa herself gave the lie to the common view of her as one who worked tirelessly for the poor; it was not from modesty that she declared: \\"We are misunderstood, we are misrepresented, we are misreported. We are not nurses, we are not doctors, we are not teachers, we are not social workers. We are religious, we are religious, we are religious.\\"As a religious person, she would hold that faith is prerequisite to salvation; but if she knew her Scripture, and her Catholic Doctrine, she should more truthfully have borne witness to the Doctrine, confirmed by Trent, that we are not justified by faith alone: \\"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\\" (Ephesians 2:10) By reason of the gift of grace, we are absolutely commanded by God to do good works, so far as it lies within our power to do so; and with all those millions (or, indeed, billions) of dollars at her command, she was empowered to do a great deal more than she did. Empowered by undeniable charisma, great wealth and worldly influence to offer healing to the sick, and accommodation to the homeless, she omitted to do so: she offered professions of love, yet refused to perform the works of love. Nobody need doubt her faith, nor that of her sisters, but it's incorrect to assume that the existence of faith proves the existence of good works, or that good works need only tend to the soul, while ignoring the body.Had Teresa never read James 2:14-26? because, lest anyone misinterpret Paul, James gets very specific: \\"What good is it... if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, \\"Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,\\" but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead... Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds... You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder... a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone... faith without deeds is dead.\\"She died too soon to read the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (1999), signed by the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran World Federation, which states: \\"We confess together that good works... follow justification and are its fruits. When the justified live in Christ and act in the grace they receive, they bring forth, in biblical terms, good fruit. Since Christians struggle against sin their entire lives, this consequence of justification is also for them an obligation they must fulfill. Thus both Jesus and the apostolic Scriptures admonish Christians to bring forth the works of love.\\" Works for which the Holy Spirit deserves sole credit, since they were worked in his power.As Paul reminded the Corinthians, loving kindness (charity) is the greatest of the gifts of grace. George Whitefield preached on 1 Corinthians: \\"As sanctification is a progressive work, beware of thinking you have already attained... Nothing is more valuable and commendable, and yet, not one duty is less practiced, than that of charity. We often pretend concern and pity for the misery and distress of our fellow-creatures, but yet we seldom commiserate their condition so much as to relieve them according to our abilities; but unless we assist them with what they may stand in need of, for the body, as well as for the soul, all our wishes are no more than words of no value or regard.\\""},{"Title":"Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict","review":"Dr. Chaterjee, a Calcutta native, has gone to great lengths to expose Mother Teresa for what she was: a faithful servant of the Catholic Church whose work to help the poor in Calcutta was hugely exaggerated by herself and by the Western media. This substantial book is fairly well-documented, often painstakingly by himself, in videotapes, voice recordings, and photographs. As the Mother freely admitted herself, her primary goals were religious, not humanitarian in nature. I think there can be little doubt but that she was a scheming woman who intentionally misled the world press and public in order to obtain funds, which were used primarily to build religious orders, promote an anti-birth-control agenda, and go mysteriously to the Vatican Bank, and use only a tiny fraction for show to help Calcutta's poor. She shamelessly defended anyone who sent her large enough sums of cash: the Duvaliers, Charles Keating, and so on. Yet these gifts went mostly to help support her nunneries/religious institutions and Catholic families, and even minor expenditures towards the comforts of her residents were denied (such as inexpensive pain medications). Even the corporate gift of ambulances were used almost exclusively to shuttle the nuns around town.While this book has enough documentation to prove the essential truth of its message, I would be remiss in presenting this as a perfectly-written or documented book. For example, on some occasions his documentation consists of phrases such as \\"it's widely known,\\" or \\"anyone will tell you.\\" On page 106, he writes \\"I have seen shiploads of [towels, underwear, aluminium mugs, gifts] arriving at Calcutta port as donations to the Missionaries of Charity\\".....\\"These are sold off to the local shops. Also a vast amount of clothes destined for the poor find their way to the Calcutta street markets--any street trader will tell you.\\" At other times he impugns thoughts into Mother Teresa's head. For example, when he describes her speech to President Reagan in which she said \\"Because of your suffering and pain, you will now understand the suffering and pain of the world.\\" He then states \\"By 'suffering and pain,' she meant abortion, not the suffering of poverty and disease.\\" While perhaps quite true, it would have been more appropriate to state \\"she PROBABLY meant...\\".It's unfortunate that Dr. Chaterjee is one of the few people to truly investigate the facts behind Mother Teresa. Even an ardent fan of hers cannot honestly praise her unless he's read this book and reconciled the facts it contains. Despite its imperfections, this is probably the only book which objectively examines the truth behind Mother Teresa's facade. I would go so far as to say one cannot have any meaningful understanding of her work without reading this book. One can praise Mother Teresa for her faithless devotion to the Catholic Church if one likes, but not for her honesty, her caring attitude towards Calcutta's poor, or her lack of hypocrisy."},{"Title":"Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict","review":"I titled my review consciously - the common meaning applies to the book.

How would you like to be confined to a narrow cot, forbidden to get up and take a few steps, facing the rest of your life without a single look at the sky?If you were a responsible medical professional, what would you think of a home for the dying where patients contagious from TB were kept an easy sneeze and cough away from debilitated patients ripe for TB infection? Could you stand by and watch hypodermic needles being washed in non-sterile water for re-use? How would you feel about observing a cancer patient writhing in agony, denied easily available pain-killers for the sake of a religion absolutely alien to him?Dr. Aroup Chatterjee lifts the lid off the public relation triumph which is \\"Mother\\" Teresa of Calcutta. A native of Calcutta, he is understandably also disgusted at the hatchet job done on his home city's reputation in order to elevate a European missionary worldwide. He explains the racism behind the myth: a European woman must take care of dark-skinned Asians, who are uncivilized and incapable of humane works themselves. Chatterjee also gives the lie to all of the assumptions which feed into the \\"Mother\\" Teresa myth, noting the local Hindu charities which do heroic work for the people of Calcutta and his city's long and exceedingly rich cultural and literary history.This book should be a best-seller. It exposes the lies surrounding \\"Mother\\" Teresa while bending over backwards to be fair to her and her supporters."},{"Title":"Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict","review":"This is a meticulously researched book which, along with Christopher Hitchen's far slender book on the same subject, opened my eyes into the manufactured mythology of the Mother Teresa mystique. Growing up in India, I had swallowed the story that was uncritically broadcast in the Indian media even though there had to have been many journalists who knew for a fact that parts of it were blatantly false. It took a medical doctor to ferret out the inconsistencies in the myth that any trained journalist could have uncovered in a matter of weeks; which speaks deafeningly to the dismal and shoddy quality of investigative journalism in India, and in Calcutta in particular. Sadly, despite Dr. Chatterjee's deeply-felt crusade to shine the light of truth on the myth of Mother Teresa, it has taken on its own life and even the posthumous revelations of Ms. Teresa's doubts over her faith will not derail this runaway train into which the Church has vested enormously.It would also make a superb case study for how myths are manufactured, and in particular the motivations of all the parties involved; especially the curious role of Indians who have willingly helped to perpetuate a story that by all objective analysis casts them in very poor light. In this regard I must personally admit to a small sense of schadenfreude at how Calcutta, the intellectual capital of Bengali arch-snobbery, was so badly besmirched (admittedly unfairly as Dr. Chatterjee's central thesis for his heartfelt book demonstrates) by one of the city's most (world-)famous resident. Calcutta today is synonymous with abject poverty and some of the worst excesses of human depravity thanks to Mother Teresa and her film-making acolytes; a portrayal that was largely fictional and fabricated to tap into billions of dollars of charity from gullible laypersons and governments alike. While Dr. Chatterjee obviously rebelled against this unfair characterization of his beloved city and has expended a great deal of energy and effort to set the record straight, the majority of his Bengali brethren (and for that matter most Indians) appear to have preferentially embraced the flip-side of this sordid script; the Western attention, the association with glamorous dilettantes who made Calcutta a necessary pilgrimage stop for do-good celebrity-hood, and the reflected glory of the Mother Teresa myth however insidiously harmful it actually was.Even Dr. Chatterjee, a confirmed atheist, evidences considerable disdain for Hinduism in his book even as he meticulously tabulates the unsung and unheralded charity quietly practiced by millions of Hindus (in stark contrast to Mother Teresa's hypocritical and parasitic photo-op visitations to sites of disaster in India). However, this doesn't detract much from this important contribution to modern India's social history, and I wish that large numbers of my country wo/men will buy and read this book in order to have their eyes opened, as mine were from reading Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict."},{"Title":"Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict","review":"I have read this, and it was very well researched.

We have a working class detective named Joe who is ruled by a moral compass that few people in his department have. When Joe Keough finds the body of a young high school student, brutally raped with a rose inserted inside of her, he has a feeling that the death was committed by a copycat of a notorious serial killer named \\"The Lover.\\" Others within the department, however, do not share his theory and are quick to lump the killing with the others.This, however, does not sit well with the actual serial killer, who goes out of his way to absolve himself from the blame. Joe, goes against his superiors, The Lover Task Force, and the copycat killer himself, to reveal to the public that there are in fact two serial killers.But when a friend of Joe's is brutally stabbed to death in his own home, the finger points to a boss within the NYPD. It is then that Joe realizes that he has made enemies both within the department AND outside in the mean streets of New York. The interesting part of the story is when one of Keough's few supporters in his investigation is The Lover himself!If you are a fan of police procedurals, this is a good one. It has a solid (but thinly veiled) mystery, very appealing characters, and a pacing that keeps you reading from the prologue to the epilogue.I did think the characters were quite clche, but it only added to the realism of the voice that Randisi creates. I previously knew Randisi by the anthologies that he put together, finding his tastes in the crime/noir literature to be quite phenomenal, however, I was impressed by his writing style.I thought the story was very realistic.

In the first trial he gets beaten really bad but he analyzes his faults and learn from them. He also gets beaten in his second, third, fourth and fifth trial, every time making different mistakes which the enemy does not forgive. Finally, when he has a sixth chance to re-fight the battle he puts up a splendid performance making his opponent to pay dearly and holding the drift until friendly reinforcements arrive. It is a very enjoyable little book and although it was written a hundred years ago it is still very useful for anyone who wants to learn about the core of tactical prowess in infantry battle."},{"Title":"The Defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"Swinton is a military professional with experience in the Boer War who wrote this famous short book based on a series of thoughts he had on how a infantry unit with only 50 men could defend a river crossing. A young Lieutenant has the role but you are given his perspective, the terrain features, the political situation, conflict with civilians and limits on your own military support. There is a brief history of the war with the \\"Dutch\\" and then your Lieutenant receives his assignment. With the use of maps, there are six scenarios of the Lieutenants approach to defending the crossing (drift). Each scenario is acted out and with each of the first five scenarios there are several lessons learned such as the effect of enfilading fire, the limitations of a simple trench, the use of the military crest versus being located on top of the hill, the effect the local sympathetic population may have on aiding guerrilla fighters, the effect of surprise, disguising your defense from view, proper posting of sentries and responsibilities, how to combat artillery, dealing with multiple directions of attack, using the terrain to advantage and on. As the Lieutenant in each scenario learns from his mistakes, he alters the outcome to his advantage but only incrementally. Only at the end and sixth scenario does he get it right but with realistic loss. The same map is introduced in each scenario with defense features matching the new defensive tactics. Fascinating book for all interested in basic infantry tactics, which has been used as a training manual for militaries world wide. This is a very readable book that can be read in less than 2 hours time. Applicable to any war but this book would be interesting to read with an account of Rappahannock Station, which was a spearhead position held by Confederates in advance of Lee's line on November 7, 1863 where Meade's forces overwhelmed the defenders and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Duffer's Drift would be very applicable here."},{"Title":"The Defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"While undoubtedly a must read for ground troops, you don't have to wear combat boots to enjoy The Defence of Duffer's Drift. If you enjoy problem solving, visualizing varied scenarios, and anticipating the next move, this book may be for you. It's well written in fluid, almost interactive, and easily understood language; you don't have to be a General or a military buff to immediately be enveloped by the dilemma at hand. You can finish the book in one sitting or ponder each chapter as if it were a game of chess. This is a rare type of book that can, and perhaps should, be enjoyed by almost everyone."},{"Title":"The Defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"This free edition does not have the maps which make the situation much more understandable.

Read this and then come back and re-read it.Update: The review above refers to the version by Avery Publishing. In 2010, I wanted to give a copy as a gift. Luckily, I skimmed it before wrapping it. This new version by Dodo Press is missing several of the most useful sections of the original book. It omits the historical notes that put the Boer War in context, is missing most of the maps and even omits Swinton's own preface. It is far less useful as a primer than the earlier version.Amazon apparently doesn't allow separate ratings for different editions of a book. If I could, I would leave the original version with 5 stars but downgrade the Dodo Press version to 3 stars or less.

As a matter of fact, the lessons LT Forethought learns compare remarkably to the nine Priniciples of War and five Fundamentals of Defensive Operations contained in US Army doctrine.

In typical British fashion they muddled through and eventually learned how to deal with this unfamiliar military environment.This little book, one part fiction, one part lessons learned, shows the evolution of their tactics against Brother Boer. It is told as a series of dreams in which the hero, a young officer, repeatedly lives the same scenario of trying to defend an isolated outpost. In the first dream he gets his head handed to him in the best British fashion. But in each succeeding dream he learns more and eventually triumphs completely.This is really a series of lessons on small unit infantry tactics at the beginning of the 20th Century. It was enormously popular in its day and still holds the reader's interest. A lot of the lessons are so basic they still can teach us things, especially in low-intensity warfare like Iraq and Afghanistan.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"Swinton, through a series of six dreams, presents readers with several solutions to (what in military parlance is) a \\"field problem\\" - how to defend a position from superior numbers. Each dream shows basic tactical errors, one building off the lessons learned from the mistakes of the preceeding dream until the \\"correct\\" principles are applied. While the problem is specifc to the Boer War in South Africa, the broader principles remain a part of teaching sound military strategy:1) begin measures of defense immeadiately2) maintain noise and light discipline3) be suspicious of the locals4) spread out your resources into interlocking fields of fire5) in creating defensive lines, be mindful of cover and concealment, exposure to enfilading fire, and rising ground that provides the enemy cover6) choose firing positions with the eye of those who will eventually use them7) ensure communication with good coverThe real strength of this slim book are the maps and they way in which these practices are used in conjunction with the geography. While it is a quick read (it is under 60 pages), it clearly and succinctly demonstrates the hard lessons of not following these simple principles - high and unnecessary casaualties, the position being overrun, the drift falling into enemy hands or capture. Recommended for staff NCOs or company grade officers, or those interested in small unit tactics."},{"Title":"The Defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"Small Unit Tactics Primer!\\"The Defence of Duffer's Drift\\" by Major General Swinton, a noted English soldier and author, wrote this marvelous tactical primer as a captain shortly after he served in the Boer War. In six dreams, Swinton offers various tactical solutions to Lieutenant Backright Forethought, who is defending an imaginary piece of ground during the Boer War. Originally published in Infantry Journal (now Army) in April 1905 and now available as a reprint from the Combat Studies Institute, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, this book is great for junior officers to read and discuss the finer points of counter-insurgency and small unit tactics."},{"Title":"The Defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"I first read this book back in 1994 at the Engineer Offiver Basic Course. As a newly minted Second Lieutenant, the fundamentals taught by Swinton were fresh and necessary. As an Engineer Officer, where our responsibility was mobility, countermobility and survivability, the lesons were especially relevant. First published in 1907, this classic tale of Subaltern Backsight Forethought and his detachment tasked to defend Duffer's Drift during the Boer War, is a lesson in basic small unit tactics. From the very first lesson of ensuring that the defenses are perpared before resting to the last lesson of expert use of terrain, cover and concealment, the easy reading book reinforces the lessons of terrain analysis, solid tactics and common sense.On a deeper level, the book remains relevant to the business person in a way that is similar to a Sun Tzu or Machiavelli. Understand the fundamentals, do not trust the enemy, understand the landscape you will fight on, see yourself from the enemies point of view, use available resources, continue to learn from your mistakes and continuously improve.Still relevant for the modern soldier because of the focus on fundamentals, the non-soldier has much to gain by reading the book as well."},{"Title":"The Defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"An unusual and interesting book, very entertaining and recommended for even the more casual military reader. Swinton's book is a classic for good reasons. Rather than instructing cadets with a dry textbook approach, the dreams of the main character demonstrate the different ways a young officer attempts to defend a river crossing, making the lessons more interesting and informative. And certainly more interesting to read than a textbook!"},{"Title":"The Defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"Marine officers are often required to read this book during The Basic School (the six month infantry-focused training all lieutenants undergo after OCS or the Naval Academy). I have read that some Army schools also list it as required reading. Swinton takes a simple issue, the defense of a small swatch of land during entrusted to a young officer, and uses dream sequences to illustrate shortcomings of various tactical approaches to the problem. The officer realizes via hindsight the solutions to each problem and the reader becomes engaged in a sort of Monday-morning quarterbacking of his methods. Just when you think you have the answer, Swinton tears your theory to pieces with the next report of failure. After reading all of the scenarios, one realizes that the answer was so simple and some basic but careful analysis would yield the answer. That is the heart and core of tactics. Making a quick decision with limited information but moderate knowledge in order to come up with a 90% solution. Not only is this book a must-read, it yields new lessons every time I go back to it. It's one of those books you buy and come back to every few years. Highly recommended for the military historian, NCO or junior officer."},{"Title":"Vladimir Nabokov : Novels and Memoirs 1941-1951 : The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, Bend Sinister, Speak, Memory (Library of America)","review":"It's a sad fact that Vladimir Nabokov is still thought primarily as the guy who wrote a book about a middle-aged man's crush on a preteen girl. What that fails to note is that Nabokov, a Russian expatriate who spent many years in America, also wrote many other novels that were often even more groundbreaking than \\"Lolita.\\"Three of them were compiled into \\"Novels and Memoirs 1941-1951\\": the horrifying political satire \\"Bend Sinister,\\" the entertainingly offbeat \\"Real Life of Sebastian Knight,\\" and the unique memoir \\"Speak Memory.\\" These three each demonstrate why Vladimir Nabokov was one of the best writers of the 20th century.\\"Bend Sinister\\" is the most obviously political of all the novels Nabokov wrote.It tells the story of Krug, a philosopher in the land of Padukgrad, who is dealing with the death of his wife, and having to raise his young son alone. To make things worse, an inept inventor's son named Paduk, has become the dictator. Worse, Krug is somehow in Paduk's way -- and Paduk will do anything to get Krug to endorse him. Literally, anything.\\"The Real Life of Sebastian Knight\\" has a lighter tone than \\"Bend Sinister,\\" with an unnamed narrator searching for clues about the true persona of his brother, Sebastian Knight, a famed writer. It ends up becoming a superb satire/detective story, looking at the faint traces that biographers snatch at, but which can only give a tiny look at the whole.\\"Speak Memory\\" is an entirely different kind of book -- it's all about Nabokov himself. He reexamines his colorful life, but not so much through basic experiences and facts. Instead, he looks at how he made sense of the world, whether as a privileged child, a man torn up by the Russian Revolution, and finally finding sanctuary in another land.It might come as a surprise that the famous \\"Lolita,\\" which caused such a scandal at the time, is actually one of Nabokov's less complex books. He dabbled in metafiction, existentialism, autobiography, and almost always in satire. And there are almost always layers on layers of meaning in his books -- these aren't the exception.His writing is dense, lush and detailed, and he seems almost to blur the line between fantasy and reality, especially since \\"Bend Sinister\\" takes little bits from various totalitarian governments. Even stranger, Krug apparently discovers that he is actually Nabokov's creation, and has an existential crisis. And Nabokov's self-examination is as fascinating as any bestselling novel, where he revisits those bizarre thoughts that we all have as children.A harrowing political thriller, an amusing satire, and an intriguing autobiography make up \\"Novels and Memoirs 1941-1951.\\" A writer like no other, and three books like no other."},{"Title":"Vladimir Nabokov : Novels and Memoirs 1941-1951 : The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, Bend Sinister, Speak, Memory (Library of America)","review":"The two novels and autobiography in this volume are quirky, brilliant, tragicomic, and written in incomparable prose. One of the things not often mentioned about Nabokov is how hilarious he can be. Enjoy!--but not if you like meat-and-potatoes realism or mainstream tales of self-pity."},{"Title":"Vladimir Nabokov : Novels and Memoirs 1941-1951 : The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, Bend Sinister, Speak, Memory (Library of America)","review":"One must celebrate those plural minds who decided that a Russian exile and cosmopolitan writer could have a home among American classics. Navokob's elegant prose and humanistic sensitivity enhances the scope of The Library of America, and more than deserves these beautiful tomes."},{"Title":"Vladimir Nabokov : Novels and Memoirs 1941-1951 : The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, Bend Sinister, Speak, Memory (Library of America)","review":"Picture Vladimir Nabokov. In the hall of mirrors that is popular culture, he is the dirty man who wrote the dirty book &quot;Lolita,&quot; about a 12-year-old &quot;nymphet&quot; -- he invented the term, by the way -- and her affair with an older man.Angle the mirror another way, and he is one of the founders of the modernist novel, which to some people -- myself included -- that's a damning phrase. &quot;Modernist&quot; and &quot;post-modernist&quot; literature seems a) self-referencing to the point of egotism; b) dedicated to the advancement of decedent themes, and to score big points as a writer, pile it on, brother; and c) obsessed with the discovery that the &quot;arts&quot; -- whether books, pictures or movies -- are artificial, and that we use them to create, well, books, pictures and movies.Unless you think I am making it up, here's an example drawn from real life: a few years back, a Charlotte museum mounted an exhibition of a painter's work, one of which was a canvas whose front side was turned toward the wall, exposing a paint-stained frame. A newspaper reviewer breathlessly informed the reading public that the artist did this &quot;to inform the viewer that most paintings are recetangular.&quot;Now, a reasonably intelligent person could probably reach that conclusion without much effort, but discoveries like these seem to drive those who tread into the &quot;modern&quot; era of art.So Vlaidmir Nabokov's reputation is caught between two very opposing poles. He either panders to the worst tastes of man, or the worst tastes of art.Fortunately, he is neither, and the Library of America agrees. The non-profit publisher throws its reputation behind Nabokov as a writer worth reading by publishing all of his English-language novels in three volumes. The first volume covers his work from 1941 to 1951: &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,&quot; &quot;Bend Sinister,&quot; and his memoir, &quot;Speak, Memory.&quot; The middle work contains the notorious &quot;Lolita,&quot; &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; &quot;Pnin,&quot; and the &quot;Lolita&quot; screenplay Nabokov wrote for Stanley Kubrick. The concluding volume contains &quot;Ada,&quot; &quot;Transparent Things,&quot; and &quot;Look at the Harlequins!&quot;But of these works, only &quot;Lolita&quot; stands alone. It is not a dirty book, and one should pity those American and British tourists who, in the mid-1950s, bought the pale olive-green two-volume paperbacks published in Paris by the notorious Olympia Press. Those expecting frankly pornographic stories like &quot;The Story of O&quot; and &quot;How to Do It&quot; would have been sorely disappointed in Humbert Humbert's self-confessed defense of his rape (not &quot;seduction,&quot; which implies a willingness to be seduced) and exploitation of Delores Haze, &quot;Lolita, light of my life,fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.&quot;Even Olympia's publisher was taken in, telling a mutual friend that he though Nabokov was Humbert, and that he was attempting to popularize nymphet love.What does become apparent after reading through the volumes (and aided by an excellent two-volume biography by Brian Boyd) is that there is much more to Nabokov than meets the eye. Delving deeper in his works reveals a funhouse hall of mirrors that can lead to a definitive end, and there's not much in modernist fiction that could substantiate that claim.What sets Nabokov off from other writers is his use of the language. Raised in Tsarist Russia, Nabokov was a child prodigy who was taught Russian, French and English at an early age. His prose is elegent, his command of English astounding. It's close to the prose of Henry James, but except for the foreign phrases, which the Library editions provide translations and explanations, far more understandable.Descriptions pulled at random from &quot;Lolita&quot; ring as if English was a newly minted language, capable of expressing humor (&quot;The bed was a frightful mess with overtones of potato chips&quot;) and snobbish anger (&quot;Lo had grabbed some comics from the back seat and, mobile white-bloused, one brown elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of some clout or clown&quot;).Even, when Humbert meets his Lolita long after she escaped his clutches, when he believes that he still loves her, heart-rending: &quot;In her washed-out grey eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party, like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.&quot;This is not casual reading, but neither is it reading-as-masochistic exercise, with furrowed brows and an exasperated flipping of once-read pages. There is a surface meaning that is easily accessible, but there are deeper meanings, in-jokes, ironies and moral questions worthy of consideration.The best volume of the three is the second, which contains &quot;Lolita,&quot; the screenplay he wrote for Stanley Kubrick (which was not used), the comic novel (for Nabokov at least) &quot;Pnin&quot; and &quot;Pale Fire.&quot;But good works can be found in the other volumes as well. &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,&quot; in the first volume, is the author's account of his biographical research on his half-brother, the brilliant writer Sebastian Knight, who had died recently of a heart condition after writing a half-dozen novels. It bears all the hallmarks of the post-modernist novel replete with a self-absorption with writers, spurious biography, an unreliable narrator and ironical references. &quot;Speak, Memory,&quot; also in the first volume, is Nabokov's memoirs about growing up in Russia.Indeed, the only disadvantage to reading Nabokov is that it may cause a nagging niggling in the back of your head, while reading novels in the future, that they just cannot compare to those composed by the American from Russia."},{"Title":"Vladimir Nabokov : Novels and Memoirs 1941-1951 : The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, Bend Sinister, Speak, Memory (Library of America)","review":"This is not out of print, but is available by direct order from the Library of America website."},{"Title":"Vladimir Nabokov : Novels and Memoirs 1941-1951 : The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, Bend Sinister, Speak, Memory (Library of America)","review":"This collection of novels and a memoir is a must for anyone interested in twentieth century literature.

Kit accused Rafe of being too controlling when she walked away because he forced her to choose between him and her family.Ten years ago Rafe gave Kit his heart. Then she returned his engagement ring. For a year her ring burned a hole in his heart while he hoped she would change her mind. He believed that she couldn't commit. Kit still touches the secrets part of him that no one else ever sees, but he's not ready to risk that kind of pain again. Now her case thrusts them together, and Rafe vows that he won't let Kit out of his sight until they locate her ditzy sister. He also vows that despite the fiery chemistry they share, and the fact that he likes her new sassy attitude, he's not risking his heart again.Author Debra Cowan weaves an entrancing tale of love and danger in STILL THE ONE. After ten years, Kit and Rafe realize that the other is still the one who touches their heart. But healing old wounds, finding the honesty to confess the pain and the courage to let ago challenges this couple. The painful undercurrents lend depth to the plot seeking Kit's sister, and the touches of danger heighten the tension profoundly. As they confront the past, both Kit and Rafe undergo tremendous growth and change. Cowan's skillful balance of healing old wounds while maintaining a fast paced plot result a memorable read that comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hand puppets and string puppets","review":"Waldo S. Lanchester was a supremely talented puppeteer and his original book, \\"Hand and String Puppets\\" was a classic gem; small but dense with valuable information for aspiring puppeteers. The original publication by Dryad Press included Lanchester's full-size, two-sided fold-out pattern for an 18\\" figure. Diligent students could follow his pattern to cut plywood shapes to build up the limbs and make a superbly balanced wooden marionette.Hesperides Press' abridged edition of Hand and String Puppets by is a crudely condensed version of Lanchester's original book. Although the blurb here on Amazon states the book is 64 pages it is in fact only 44. Only one side of Lanchester's plans are reproduced, in a small size within the book. The all important limb patterns from the original plans are not included. Attempting to construct a marionette without this essential information would be confusing and frustrating.Puppetry is often referred to as a lost art, this edition clearly illustrates why. Waldo S. Lanchester was a superb artist and craftsman. He left behind a beautiful little book to inspire and instruct others. This edition appears to be edited by someone who knows little about puppetry and has no regard for the importance of the complete subject matter. Most of the photographs from the original which attest to Lanchester's talent and skill are not included here. Missing also are instructions for animal marionettes and their controls, and close up diagrams of construction details for specific joints.This abridged edition of \\"Hand and String Puppets\\" is a disservice to the legacy of Waldo S. Lanchester. I sincerely hope Hesperides Press will see the value of releasing a complete and unabridged version in the near future. That version would get five stars."},{"Title":"A Man of Respect: A Novel","review":"The book was captivating when I first read it back in 1986.

It conjures images of pirates, sharks, whales, mutiny and derring-do, and skulduggery upon the high seas. Under 150 pages, I figured it would be a fast read.Kipling tells a good tale here, and he paints vivid characters with salty dialect and attention to fishing details. Young Harvey goes overboard from an ocean liner, grieved by his millionaire parents, but rescued by a passing schooner. He soon finds himself working the decks and dories of the ship \\"We're Here,\\" while befriending Dan, the son of memorable Disko Troop. He grows up while on the seas, gets his hands roughened, and his spirit strengthened.This is no grand adventure, though. Most of the action is told by fishermen gathered after a hard day's work. I kept waiting for something frightening, suspenseful, or heroic, but instead I grew more familiar with the fishing tactics of the late 1800s. While it does have its moments of interest, and the research seems complete, \\"Captains Courageous\\" seemed to have more cod-fishing than courage on display.In the end, both young and old learn lessons from Harvey's time at sea, and they are all the better for it. Honestly, though, I'm surprised this story has stood the test of time as well as the much more interesting \\"The Jungle Book.\\""},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Captains Courageous is by Rudyard Kipling.

Read this book on a rainy day and trust me,you couldn't possibley put it down."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"This book shows how life's fortunes can turn quickly fromcomfort and predictability to hardship and adversity.In the instant case, a young man's fortune made thatprecipitous turn which tested his character in adversity.The book teaches important lessons for people of all agesbut especially children. There are many seamans' termsand the colloquialisms are difficult to discern at times.The overall thrust of the work is good because it portrayslife at sea which very few of us ever encounter to anysignificant extent. As such, this experience enriches us all.Finally, the work raises some important questions about what weshould teach our children. Should children learn that lifeconsists only of pure pleasure? I think that a balancedpresentation would provide a series of experiences depictingboth hardship and the triumph of the human spirit overadversity and unfortunate happenstances."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"He was a rich kid. Nobody liked Harvey because he was mean to everyone. He felt sick and fell overboard.Fishermen saved his life. He learned to fish. He changed his personality. Dan taught him to be a fisherman and a sailor. Long Jack taught him the ropes. Disko taught him how to steer. He caught a dead sailor and Dan showed him how to cut the ropes.At the end he was Dan's best friend and gained the respect of the crew."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"I know more than i did about fishing the Grand Banks; more about the interactions of men in a small space; more about what makes a boy a man than before i read the book. Kipling may be a little clich&eacute;d (or people may feel that way about him), but he knew people and what makes them who they are. Every one of the characters on the boat is a real, singular person; though you may not understand all they say, you know what they mean and why. An excellent adventure story; more than just a sea yarn, though a fine one too."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Known and translated in all the world as a children's classic, Rudyard Kipling's \\"Captain Courageous\\" assumes today an unsuspected historical value. The book is surely outdated and difficult to read by the audience it has been for many years restricted to, however it has gained an \\"antiquarian\\" taste that true lovers of classical fiction greatly savor and should not be put on the shelf among the books of a long ago childhood.\\"Captains Courageous\\" is Kipling's only entirely \\"American\\" novel. Published in 1897 (the same year Joseph Conrad produced the maritime \\"The Nigger of the Narcissus\\"), the year Kipling abandoned America where he had lived with his wife and her family for some time, it had appeared on an American journal in episodes from November 1896 to May 1897 with a dedication to James Coneland doctor, Brattleboro Vermont. James Coneland was Kipling's friend that had introduced and accompanied him in the numerous visits to Gloucester Mass, on the schooners and out at sea and had helped him gain all the information that would make the book's backbone.The location of the story is on the Grand Banks and the title should have been \\"Harvey Cheyne, Banker\\" (the pun residing in \\"the banks\\" but also in \\"banker\\" as a boat fishing on the Great Banks) but it was changed in \\"Captains Courageous: A story of the Grand Banks\\", from the captains courageous mentioned in a \`600 ballad \\"Marie Amberee\\".Many are the novel's themes that can be found, clearly stated in Kipling's diaries and letters. There is the disappearing of innocence in a society increasingly dominated by the getting of money, the rite of passage from childhood to adulthood, the lesson of the inevitability of physical death.The plot is well known: Harvey Cheyne a spoiled rich boy, heir of an American self-made tycoon with investment in railways and ships, falls of a liner on his way to Europe. He is rescued by the schooner \\"We're Here\\" where he finds discipline, friends and education, freedom and adventure that make him a man. When reunited with his parents he has grown up and is ready to assume his responsibilities in life.The novel is actually built in three time spans, the opening and the closure (Harvey's trip aboard and his going overboard and his reunion with his parents) that enclose the real story that is what is taking place on the schooner \\"We're Here\\". The two opening and closing episodes are surprising and in a certain sense unbelievable. Harvey's rich and idle life in unconceivable for the crew. The reader knowns Harvey is not lying, but Disko Troop feels insulted by the insolent young boy that after having been saved actually accuses him of theft. The closing episode of Harvey's reunion with his father has us meet this kind of super-tycoon that could only be the fruit of the American economic system. Cheyne's senior immense fortune and the way is has been made is as unbelievable and fantastic as Harvey's tales. The only reality between the fantasies is the story of Harvey's permanence of the \\"We're Here\\" (intended by Kipling to mean just what it says). Actually it is the permanence on the schooner that makes him worthy of being reunited with his father and to be part of the Cheyne dynasty. Cheyne senior with his means and influence integrates the men of the \\"We're Here\\" in his own economic system, where Dan (Harvey's brother in arms during the trip) is sent toward a brilliant nautical career on Cheyne's ships and the strange prophetical black cook is appointed as Harvey's servant. Kipling probably sent him to what he thought should be a black man's destiny in those times.\\"Captains Courageous\\" is altogether the story of the triumph of the America's hardworking and successful Calvinistic spirit. This is interpreted first by Disko Troop, the humble and brave captain of the \\"We're Here\\", and then by Cheyne senior that runs from the Pacific to the Atlantic Coast to get back his lost and found offspring.However, like in all of Kipling's best fiction the double rhythm sets up a crucial opposition that takes away the assertive value of ideologies and pedagogical intent, so \\"Captains Courageous\\" is practically the statement of the autonomy of a dream that lasts until the ship gets back to the land. On the schooner Harvey's past and future don't exist. The only existing experience is that of the voyage, searching for fish, during which he grows up not to become a tycoon but a captain courageous, brother of a small community of the little ship in the immense ocean, a ship of fools, where like in the epic Moby Dick the captain is a poor fisherman and rich and poor, wise men and fools, Irishman, preacher, Portugese and Blackman may live together.Even if lead by men the \\"We're Here\\" obeys nature's rules. Disko Troop must think like a fish. Accepting the sea's destiny Harvey acquires a new identity, on the \\"We're Here\\" he is removed from power's cruel struggle and economic's crushing logic.The salvation through water (baptism?) is evident throughout the book, from Harvey's fall into the sea to the final Memorial Day Ceremony when Harvey realizes he has taken the place of a young sailor who drowned \\"Otto Svenson, twenty years old\\". This is the only way Harvey can gain his social role as part of his dynasty (Cheyne = chain).Land wins over sea, even if the sea is necessary for Harvey's growth. The sea is also menaced by the modern steam boats, like the land is eaten up by Cheyne's trains. Harvey stays on land with his hostages, the black cook and Dan to interpret his future of richness. The \\"We're Here\\" instead leaves for a new adventure that this time will have no testimonies. Kipling still hopes not only that someplace there may exist a pre-capitalistic world but also a place for experiencing an innocence of heart. Until the \\"We're Here\\" can keep on leaving not all the world must identify with Cheyne senior's logic.Kipling's America was vast and multiracial and had many characteristics in common with India and its castes. The fascination with language that accompanied the Author throughout his life (think of \\"Kim\\") is also one of the themes of the story. The narration is constructed through a sequence of very cryptic dialogues that consent the explore the fisherman's world. At sea even though people speak different languages they understand each other perfectly, back at land they seem to speak in different idioms. Cheyne senior's functional down to earth words reduce all other languages to a babble. Even the titanic Disko almost stabbers his excuses for not having believed Harvey's story.The language has been deemed one of the problems of modern reading of the book, but when it is read outloud it gets easier to understand. A suggestion is to watch Victor Flemings movie \\"Captain's Courageous\\", where all the dialects seem to fuse and the issue of language comprehension disappears.I am sorry this review has turned into a small essay, but Kipling's \\"Captains Courageous\\" is still part of the perfect triad of boy's childhood \\"rite of passage\\" books together with Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\" and Twain's \\"Huckelberry Finn\\" written in the last decades of the Nineteenth Century. Sometimes adults rereading these milestones of their youth understand how their mythical thinking started."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"I was disappointed by the simplistic plot. The kid falls off the ship at the very beginning of the book. He's rescued, acts like a jerk for a few pages, and then straightens up.There's not much notable to the rest of the book, most of which is spent by Harvey doing chores aboard the boat, waiting until they reach port. No conflict, not much interest.Harvey gets to gloat at the end when it's proven that he really is rich as he claimed. This part of the story is rather embarrassing, with the author unabashedly worshipping success and wealth.(Not that I have anything against success and wealth, but thisdegree of worship is unseemly.)Not one of Kipling's finer works"},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today. Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page. Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner \\"We're Here,\\" which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of. My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, \\"Honey, I see what you mean.\\" One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.For example, when educated Harvey says, \\"Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?\\" his pal Dan answers, \\"Allus can, till we begin to dress daown. Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy. Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows. Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night. Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?\\"I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" than an unannotated version of this book.So why did I bother? A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving. The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me. But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever! (Let them read \\"Cannery Row\\" instead!)"},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Kipling's \\"Captains Courageous\\" wants at various times to be \\"Moby Dick,\\" \\"Treasure Island,\\" \\"Kidnapped,\\" and \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" but, burdening itself with flat characters and obtuse morality lessons, it flirts with a greatness that it never quite achieves. This is not to say that the novel isn't worth reading; as a seafaring adventure story, it is an excellent depiction of life and labor on a fishing boat and the dangers that face fishermen, spiced with a plethora of nautical jargon in salty dialects, but it doesn't have much beyond that, although for many readers that would be enough.To identify the principal hero of the novel is difficult because this is that rare kind of novel in which everybody is a hero. Harvey Cheyne, the spoiled, insouciant fifteen-year-old son of an American multimillionaire, is on a luxury steamliner going to Europe when he falls overboard and is rescued from the waters by a fishing schooner called, appropriately, the \\"We're Here.\\" The captain is a rusty old salt named Disko Troop who tells the boy that they won't be returning to shore for months and that he'd better work on the boat to earn his keep. Harvey, who is not used to work, naturally protests at first but, sensing the futility of his resistance, quickly changes his attitude and puts his nose to the grindstone.The schooner's small crew is a tough but benign group of sailors who, despite thinking Harvey's story of being heir to a fabulous fortune is just the product of a vivid imagination, treat him as one of their own, teaching him the ropes and allowing him to participate in their camaraderie, while Troop's son Dan, who is about Harvey's age, becomes his closest confidant regarding the tricks of the trade. Eventually the schooner returns to its home base at Gloucester, Massachussetts, where Harvey is able to contact his parents, at the reunion with whom his father realizes with pride that his son's experience on the schooner has given him a sense of responsibility and that he is now equipped better than ever to become a future business leader of America.While \\"Captains Courageous\\" doesn't have the intrigue of Robert Louis Stevenson or the psychological depth of Melville's nautical masterpiece or even the lush, exotic textures and prodigious scope of Kipling's own later novel \\"Kim,\\" it maintains a strong narrative drive and has a pleasant simplicity. The object lesson about the importance of self-discipline and the invigorating rewards of honest hard work may be a necessary accompaniment to the story, since there is never any concern that anything bad will happen to Harvey, but taken in the spirit of the adventure it feels like an integral part of the whole."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"This is still a great book for young readers (and old ones) who want to know what working life was really like for some in the eastern U.S. and Canada a hundred years ago. No picnic. The great thing is seeing it all in a gripping, often amazing, based-on-fact tale that centers on several teenaged boys who are part of a crew of a New England fishing boat. Death, mayhem, hardship, struggle, grim lessons, ultimate triumph in its strange way--all here along with a great portrait of poor men from all parts scraping to make a living on the sea. For what it tells about our history and the kinds of life our great-grandfathers led, this is Kipling's best, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Captain's Courageous is moe than anything else a great sea going yarn from 19th century America in which Kipling captures the spirit of the New England fishermen of the era in colorful language. To those who criticize the archaic language these characters use I would argue that the language and the dialects are exactly the point. America as a melting pot where people from various backgrounds blend words and phrases and communicate with each other.As an adventure story from the era it represents it ranks right up there with Mark Twain's work but it has something unique in that the narrative is seen through the eyes of an \\"outsider\\" , Harvey the millionaire's son who falls overboard on a cruise and is picked up by these rugged fisherman who take him in. His almost immediate recognition that something special is present in his new surroundings fill the book with a sense of wonder at the seagoing life these men live.A quick and rewarding read. Don't let the language dissuade you, this is a true classic and should not be missed."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"This book about a wealthy, spoiled and pampered adolescent, who discovers his true self when because of fate, is induced to the not-so-easy life aboard a fishing schooner in the 19th century Grand Banks.Falling overboard from a passenger steamer, the main character is rescued from drowning by a fishing vessel trawling the Atlantic off Newfoundland. During the ship's long, arduous look for it's catch, the boy is unwittingly, but luckily, netted by the fishermen. The captain, not believing the boy's claims of vast wealth, refuses to bring the ship immediately back to land, but expects him to work just like the rest of the crew, until the schooner returns home with its full catch of fish.I enjoyed this book because of the main character's complete transformation from a bratty, arrogant rich child, to a self-disciplined, wiser and likeable young man."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"This could be a difficult book to adapt for a modern children's audience, in that the much of the setting unfortunately is outdated and perhaps not immediately relatable to the Ipod generation.But the adaptation found here manages to score in all categories. Nicely edited for young audiences, and filled with illustrations, this book is great nighttime reading and will captivate boys of all ages. I spent more than a month reading this one with a few of my younger sons and they looked forward to it every night. A can't miss."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"In this tale, we have the classic spoiled brat who has the good fortune to discover that food and friends have to be earned. The slowness of his education is important, for it really does take grinding misery to blast an over-inflated ego. And yet, the reward is entry into the human race."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"This is a great book with a classic theme - and a fantastic depiction of a long-gone time and place. In a nutshell: the rich, snotty, spoiled, neglected teenager who's never done a day's work in his life falls off his Atlantic ocean-liner and ends up rescued by a tough, working-class fishing schooner where they refuse to believe he's rich, refuse to take his nonsense, and instead impress him into work - and in so doing help him find his humanity. I love the theme not just for its overt message, but because of the metaphor it encapsulates: that anyone can blossom in the right environment. Kudos, Rudyard Kipling: not bad for a book written in 1897!Now my complaints:1) The book dragged, especially in the paunchy middle. Too often the drama faded and the story became an endless repetition of fisherman's chores. Here I skimmed, to little loss.2) Many of the fisherman's stories made no sense to me, and it wasn't for lack of trying on my side. Frustrating! Many times I found myself wishing for textual annotations.3) In that vein: I found a hefty chunk of the dialogue unreadable. I'm pretty good at reading phonetics, which helped a lot, but many times when I decoded a word it proved only to be obscure, archaic maritime vocabulary.4) I get tired of books (modern or old) that extol violence as a necessary cure for spoiled kids. Yes, I understand how the captain punching the boy in the nose \\"worked\\" in this context, but violence proponents (and Kipling) too easily ignore the twisted motives hidden behind parental violence, not to mention the reality that violence ultimately begets resentment, primitiveness, and more violence."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Captains Courageous takes the tried and true plot of the spoiled city child who is rescued through the magic of hard work and honest living. Harvey Cheyne Jr. is washed off a steamship and left for dead, but is instead rescued by fishermen who take him into their boat for the season.This is, honestly, the first Kipling that I have ever read (aside from excerpts). His writing has been one of my larger gaps, and this seemed a good book with which to begin. The dialect is at times difficult, but did not really find it a barrier to understanding. I enjoyed the book. I particularly enjoyed the way the plot extended past Harvey's homecoming. Many books with a similar story end it after the rescue with no extension into the character's life. I also enjoyed the section with The Cheynes and their train ride.A solid, entertaining sea yarn which seems likely to appeal to bookish young people. I may be damning the work with faint praise, but there you go.p.s. If I started a band, I would call it Disko Troop."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Swept overboard a luxury liner into the Atlantic, teenage Harvey Cheyne is rescued by a Portuguese fisherman from the We're Here out of Gloucester, Mass. Captain Disko Troop, thinking the youth to be temporarily insane, refuses to believe his story of being a millionaire's son; he actually puts the selfish brat to work, treating him like a glorified cabin boy. Condemned to months aboard a fishing vessel which cruises the waters of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, Harvey embarks on his personal voyage to manhood. Befriended by Troop's decent son, Daniel, Harvey soon learns the ropes--quite literally--proving himself an able and positive addition to the crew by season's end.Kipling's research along the Boton wharves paid off, as he treats his fans to a fine tale about a youth's coming of age-- complete with accurate details about commercial fishing and sailing at the turn of the century. The relationship focuses first on the boys, but changes in the latter quarter of the novel, as Harvey's parents come to grips with his loss and then sudden reunion. The author contrasts the simple integrity of fishermen vs the acquisitive hostility of the transporation barons.The plot unfolds amid exhaustive nautical terms; in fact the action is occasionally becalmed in those chapters which offer general sea lore and even chanties. These reservations aside, CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS ranks as a ripping yarn which will hold the interest of most boys, and as Kipling's primary American novel--Yankee by setting and terminology. Although he also wrote THE JUNGLE BOOKS from his Vermont home, this young adult classic was truly inspired by his brief New England sojourn. A fascinating tale of emotional survival and character development on the high seas!"},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Rudy Kipling was one of the very finest story-tellers who everused the English language, and for my money this was his masterpiece.The story of Harvey Cheyne's sweaty journey from self-seeking adolescent to team-playin' fisherman is the best and most evocative tribute to thankless, strenuous, character-building physical labor that I have ever encountered!Lord willing, my children will each hear this one read aloud to them at least once. I would equally recommend it to any adult as well."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Fifteen-year-old Harvey Cheyne Jr. is a spoiled brat. His father is a multi-millionaire who made his fortune in real estate, mining, railroads, and shipping. His mother is a nervous Nellie who coddles and pampers him. While Mrs. Cheyne and Harvey are travelling on an ocean liner back from Europe to the United States, Harvey falls overboard in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland and is presumed dead. However, he is rescued by a Portuguese fisherman named Manuel who works for Disko Troop, captain of the We're Here, a New England fishing boat out of Gloucester, MA. Harvey demands to be taken home immediately and even offers the captain a huge reward for doing so. However, Troop makes a deal with Harvey for the lad to take the place of Otto Svendson, who had drowned earlier on their voyage, and earn his way back to the states.Harvey makes friends with Disko's son Dan, who is about his own age, and with the rest of the crew--Manuel, old Uncle Salters, Pennsylvania, Long Jack, Tom Platt, and the cook; and learns how to work. But will the boy survive and make it home? This is a classic novel that we did as a family read aloud, and everyone liked it. There are a few references to smoking and drinking. Harvey himself has cigarettes, and while Disko smokes a pipe, he tells Harve, who pulls a soggy pack out of his pocket, \\"bad for the lungs.\\" Disco also points out the dangers of liquor, and Dan warns Harve that his dad doesn't allow swearing. The euphemism \\"gosh\\" appears once, and the word \\"hell\\" is used once, though not as an interjection. Kipling's use of different dialects spoken by the sailors made some of the conversation a little difficult to understand at times and hard to read aloud. Otherwise, Captains Courageous, which originally appeared as a serialization in McClure's magazine, beginning with the November, 1896, edition, is a fine variation on the old theme of how the prejudiced rich kid sees how others live and learns to respect those who are different from him."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"I'd always misread the title of the book as Captain Courageous singular and my expectations were that the rich spoiled Harvey Cheyne would slowly over the course of the book develop into a man thanks to a courageous ship captain. Actually the title is Captains Courageous plural and comes from a ballad by Mary Ambree which explains its grammatical strangeness. Captains Courageous is a very short book, my copy being a mere 165 pages even with lots of illustrations, and Rudyard Kipling doesn't waste any time at all getting going. Almost immediately the 15 year old Harvey tips over his ocean liners railing due to a bit of ill advised bravado. Thanks to a lucky rescue by a member of the fishing boat \\"We're Here\\" he's scooped up saving him from a watery grave and sending him on a nearly half year journey fishing the Atlantic Ocean.Initially Harvey demands to be taken ashore and accuses the ship captain of stealing the money from his pockets but after captain Disko Troop lays him out cold the young man quickly discovers some humility and respect. There is no slow maturation for Harvey, the jaw dusting pretty much immediately transforms Harvey into an eager useful member of the crew. Harvey's initial arrival on the boat is April but since they aren't scheduled to pull into port until September he has almost a half year to absorb the fishing life as his parents grieve the loss of their son (the book was written in the 1800's so there's no means of communication between the boat and shore). The crew is a very eclectic group composed of different nationalities including a Gaelic speaking black cook.Despite the descriptions of the book the story isn't really about Harvey's coming of age. It's about life as a fisherman in the waters around New England with Harvey acting as an alien observer. I've read other books by Kipling and he really is one of the all time great writers but this one is a bit of a challenge. The crew of the \\"We're Here\\" all speak in various accents and constantly use nautical slang making it often very hard to understand what people are saying. Sometimes I felt like I was barely hanging by a threat in trying to understand the dialogue but once you get into it you really feel like the words are coming from the mouths of real sailors from the late 1800's minus the profanity. I've read a lot of classic fiction by some of the most famous writers and Rudyard Kipling is as good as any and better than almost all when it comes to writing flowing prose. The book doesn't take long to read but you may have to go through it twice to try and understand all the slang being thrown about."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],G={key:0},E={key:1};function W(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",G,"See more"))],8,q)):b("",!0)])}const L=u(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-74692850"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/63.md","filePath":"glossary/63.md"}'),B={name:"glossary/63.md"},R=Object.assign(B,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{j as __pageData,R as default};
