Were those authors not crossing certain lines in order to demonstrate the idiocy of society, and/or the government?Baker does just that with Checkpoint. He takes a conversation between two people, each of whom are displeased with the Bush Administration yet presents them with opposing solutions to the Bush problem. Either way Nicholson vents about his problems with the U.S. government in an extremely mature manner, through the channel of writing. This is an interesting dialogue, which I dare say will become famous satirical literature in the years to come. So, get your copy now and read it and reread it. For it involves all of us."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"When reading all the praise of Nicholson Baker's prose, on the dust jacket, and his ability to use the English language to create a satirical edge, I expected something more substantial. Apparently, this is case of reputation leading the book. There is nothing funny (except the Bush seeking Bullets), nor ironic in the text, and satire is checked in at another hotel. One cannot feel any emotional impact the ravings of Jay, as he plots to kill the bush baby in the White House. (Although, I suspect that if Shrub could read, the book just might make him catatonic.) This really is not a novel, but a one-act play."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"This book is billed as a novel, but it's really a short story told entirely in dialogue form -- there's a guy who's threatening to assassinate George W. Bush, and his old high-school buddy is trying to talk him out of it. The would-be assassin, Jay, seems to be delusional: I don't think we're supposed to believe that his intended plans (or weapons) could possibly work. At the same time, he's very well-informed about recent events, especially the Iraq war. I suppose that combination makes him potentially an interesting character, and the book might work as a character study -- but if that's the intention, it's too short; we don't have enough to go on to really understand this guy, and we certainly don't get anything like a thorough political assessment of the Bush Administration (or even just the Bush Administration's crimes). So I'm not sure what the book really means to provide. I like Nicholson Baker's writing, but I don't know..... maybe too little is expected of novelists these days. This isn't a bad read, but it seems dashed-off and insubstantial -- certainly not the novel that will be looked back on as defining this era."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"Like _Vox_, this novel is merely a dialogue between two people. One who wants to assassinate Dubya and one who wants to talk him out of it. The references to current events indicate to me that this was written quickly; it shows. This is the worst novel I have read by Baker: the dialogue is sloppy and the probing of individual reasoning is lacking. While I think there are some truly fantastic and thought-provoking points (some that will anger the left and the right alike) made in this book, I feel they suffer by being mouthed by a lunatic. Less a novel than an author's reaction to a president who he abhors, _Checkpoint_, like Fahrenheit 9/11_, brings up intriguing points but allows passionate sensationalism to override careful reasoning. I fear it fails as both a novel and political criticism."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"Jay has invited his friend Ben to meet him in a Washington DC hotel rooom \\"to talk.\\" Turns out he wants to talk about his plan to kill President George W.

During an afternoon of rambling conversation, the two old friends talk about all that is wrong with America and its leaders, have lunch, share a bottle of wine, reminisce about their lives and do some catching up.Since all this is being recorded, Ben is petrified that he will become an accomplice in this horrific plan, and tries all kinds of \\"therapeutic\\" maneuvers to distract, cajole, calm and perhaps reason with his friend, who is teetering on the edge of sanity.It is now the second term of George W. Bush, so obviously he didn't do it. (At least, not that afternoon). There's no other suspense involved. Basically the book is an extended rant. It is written as pure stage dialogue. The characters alternate lines. There is a brief digression for room service, then the rant continues.This is possibly the worst book I ever actually finished. I know some people who hate President Bush more than these fictional characters and who could have said it better. At a short 115 pages, the book seemed to go on to eternity. Admittedly there are some things wrong with our present leadership. There are many things in our country to take issue with. But Checkpoint adds nothing to the discussion.

I bought this book as an impulse purchase, simply because the cover caught my eye, and the jacket said something about two men discussing an assassination that could \\"change the course of history.\\" Plus I vaguely recognized the author. Turns about it's a lame anti-war diatribe, written in the form of a one-act play, with two characters: one a man bent on assassinating George W. Bush for war crimes, and one man who is trying to talk him out of it. That's right, it's topical, political rhetoric, unconvincingly written and poorly conceived. But what's worse is that there is nothing new here that you haven't overheard on the bus, listened to on talk radio, or read on a million weblogs by now. Sure, I hate Bush, too. I think he and his administration are practically evil incarnate, but the fact that I was duped into spending $15 to listen to some self-important intellectual tell me that war and abortion are wrong and that Bush is a bad man really disappoints me. I can get that a million times a day on TV for free, and even then I am always wondering, \\"Why do these people think I care about their opinions on the war or the president? I can make up my own mind, thank you very much.\\" Granted, this is because I am sick and cynical and jaded about all things political lately. But let's face it, at this point if you are still Pro-Bush, then you are deep in denial and seriously diluded about the state of the world, the nature of war, and the motivations of your president.

Nope."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"This wonderful, biting, cathartic little book should be read and reread by everyone who is in some despair over current political life in the U.S. It is likely to become as famous as Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal.Written entirely in dialogue, it would do equally well as a radio play except that no radio station would air it without significant bleeps.

Irresponsible? No. Political? Sure! Baker does a good job of framing his beliefs in an ironical parody of something like the negative image of a Hannity and Colmes show. Taken to the absurd, an actual attempt on the life of a president, Baker grabs the readers attention for a much needed voice to the destruction and dangers the current administration has waged and brought to our nation. This book is right up Baker's alley. In fact, I couldn't imagine another author to pull off a controlled tension exercise like this so successfully. Well, maybe Delillo could. At any rate, this one will not be relegated to the remainder tables as some have described. This novel belongs in your collection as a reminder of and testament to the craziness in which we live."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"I love Nicholson Baker, and I hate George W.

Worse the dialogue, especially early on in the book, rings artificial. I kept thinking, \\"no one talks like that.\\" Baker's great talent, in my opinion, lies in his ability to take the mundane and render it fascinating.

I can now see why. You can even look at it as indicative of the humanity that exists at the bottom of all political arguments - \\"even someone I strongly disagree with is still a person.\\" True, Bush won the election.

I'm now reading all the Baker I can find."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"Probably the least controversial thing one can say about Nicholson Baker's \\"Checkpoint\\" is that it's controversial. Released at a time when the highly polarized American public was awaiting the charged 2004 election, the book's main character spews invective against the incumbent president, George W. Bush. Some four years later the public remains equally divided as yet another tense presidential election approaches. Some things never change. 2004 also saw the release of Micheal Moore's \\"Fahrenheit 911,\\" a film which seemed to unify the left by showcasing President Bush and his administration at their absolute worst. Its phenomenal success prompted a catharsis of anti-Bush material. Doubtless Baker, or at least his publisher, saw an opportunity with \\"Checkpoint.\\" In August, 2004 it appeared to near universal disdain (at least in the mainstream American press). Though the book isn't necessarily political, its timing, subject matter and tone probably made it difficult for many to read it otherwise. Its incendiary topic: the assassination of President Bush.The cover of \\"Checkpoint\\" says \\"a novel,\\" but it reads like a play. It could easily be performed as one (for the controversy hungry, at least). Every page contains nothing but dialogue and the occasional bracketed stage direction or sound (such as \\"[Click... click, click]\\"). Perhaps the cover should instead read \\"Checkpoint a dialogue.\\" The text involves a tape recorded discussion between two main characters, Jay and Ben (\\"Room Service\\" has a few lines later on). Ben has rushed to the \\"Adele Hotel and Suites\\" in Washington, D.C. at Jay's behest. Jay soon says \\"I'm going to assassinate the president.\\" Ben's initial reaction seems a bit far-fetched, but as the book continues the reader discovers that Ben has a history with Jay. Jay isn't well. He hasn't been well for a while, it seems. Plus, he's a little loopy. His assassin's weapons include a large boulder, remote controlled flying saws, and \\"special bullets\\" programmed by marinating them with a picture of the intended victim. Jay also reads blogs. From these he's collected information on what he sees as the crimes of the Bush administration. The Iraq war plays heavily here, in particular an episode at a checkpoint in which a mother witnesses her daughters killing by US forces. Jay works himself to a frenzy. Ben tries to dissuade him and threats begin (when Ben threatens to contact the authorities, Jay promises to carry out his act immediately; the story's crucible seems a little contrived, but it suffices). Ben tries to calm Jay with some of the usual palliatives: killing just leads to more killing, all presidents have been bad (he lists them since Truman; only Carter gets a \\"meant well\\"). He then has Jay pound on a picture of Bush with a hammer (\\"[Flump!]\\"). Whether this provides adequate therapy remains somewhat ambiguous. The book ends with a \\"[Click.]\\"Following publication, a plethora of interpretations spewed from the press and public. Some excused it merely as a diatribe against President Bush a la \\"Fahrenheit 911.\\" Others saw it as a critique of liberalism, likely building on the seeming \\"nothing-we-can-do\\" passivity of Ben in the face of Jay's violent outburst and Jay's iconoclastic views on abortion. A much smaller number questioned the legality of the book. Still others saw its \\"therapeutic\\" value in providing a warning to not destroy oneself by raging against the machine. The literary minded tended to dismiss the politics altogether and focus instead on the character's personalities and interactions. Baker himself insisted that the book is \\"not political,\\" though he also said it was inspired by the events of the recent Iraq war. The book does read like an emotional outburst. It feels rushed and uneven in many places. But it also contains hilarious, disturbing, and moving passages; a few of which seem like harbingers of Baker's 2008 non-fiction follow-up \\"Human Smoke.\\" Ultimately, the question remains: will this book continue to inspire readers situated outside the political volcano it appeared in? It seems to have disappeared, swallowed up by the 2004 election results, though criticism of the Bush administration continues unabated. Nonetheless, the book contains enough intriguing elements that in a few year's time people may read it with a new perspective. In some ways the book was too close to the historical events that surrounded it. Time may provide enough distance to judge the book by other merits. Or perhaps it will remain a product of its fervent and frenzied time, when the United States saw a degree of polarization unseen since the Civil War."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"When a writer with the intelligence and abilities of Nicholson Baker produces guff such as this, it makes me wonder why he bothers to be angry. Mercifully, this is a short, well stylised, book, but it achieves nothing of consequence. It's time for the rant to stop and for the ranters to write meaningfully about how to improve things."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"I'm a big Baker fan, but CHECKPOINT is his weakest book. In most of his work, Baker flaunts his smarts with sharp dialogue and insightful rumination: his characters and narrators are expert ciphers of mundane little words, ideas and objects. They make boring subjects fascinating. No one but a Baker character (or Baker himself in books like U AND I) could ever get me excited about the way an envelope tastes or the literary benefit of having psoriasis.But in CHECKPOINT, the characters are stuck in familiar territorory: is George Bush evil? If so, what should be done with him? We've heard all of this before, albeit in less extreme terms -- I have yet to hear anyone openly debate killing Bush. But if you were to edit this book and replace every \\"kill\\" or \\"assassinate\\" with the phrase \\" vote against,\\" the prose would be no different than a long, discursive editorial. Nothing about Checkpoint justifies its 115 page length. As a rant, it's too long and wandering. As a commentary on assasination, martyrdom, and the effect of politics on our sanity, it's too short and limited. And, worst of all, we're deprived the classic Baker prose that makes books like THE FERMATA and VOX so damn enjoyable."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"I've read all of Baker's fiction and many of his essays and (except for his screed against periodicals on microform) I've enjoyed them all. He's inventive, he has a real ear for dialogue, and he's just weird enough to always keep your attention. Having said all that, I don't quite know what to make of this novel. Actually, it ought to be classified as a \\"novella,\\" since it's only 112 very small-sized pages, but let's not be picky. The whole thing consists of a dialogue between two old friends, Jay and Ben, in a Washington, DC, hotel room sometime in the summer of early fall of 2004. Ben is an academic, apparently (or occasionally) a college instructor, with an interest in 20th century political history. He's reasonably successful, judging by his comfortable lifestyle, and he has a wife and kids. Jay, who is divorced with kids, seems to be a drop-out of some sort from academe who has spent the past couple of years doing manual labor, including both the construction trades and commercial fishing. Ben is a pretty normal guy. Jay is a nutcase. Jay has decided George W. Bush needs assassinating, mostly because of the horrors he has inflicted on women, children, and other innocent civilians in Iraq, but also because of his general attitude toward the world. He has summoned Ben to hear and tape his explanation, so there will be a record of his motives. Ben, naturally, is fearful of being labeled an accomplice and hauled off to Guantanamo himself. The assassination is supposed to be accomplished with \\"special bullets\\" that Jay bought long-distance for $150 each. Along the way in their extended conversation, they discuss digital cameras vs. film, how to get what you really want from hotel room service, the sins of Wal-Mart vs. Target and Old Navy, and why all the U.S. presidents since Eisenhower (plus Lynne Cheney) have been no good. Well, okay. They both make a lot of good points. But what's the point of the book? When I got to the last page -- it doesn't actually \\"end,\\" it just stops -- I actually turned back a bit to see if I'd missed something. Nope. Very strange and self-indulgent. On the other hand, I wonder how long it will be before Dubya has Baker declared a danger to the public good and locked up without a trial. . . ."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"Our book club reviewed this book last night.

While the premise of the book is sure to peak the interest of many readers, this book really failed to generate much interest in me.First, the book is short, a mere 115 pages. I finished it in one sitting in less than 2 hours. The majority of the dialog is a political rant on past and present actions the US government has taken. Sprinkled throughout the dialog are moments of levity placed, I guess, to make the characters more human.The book is interesting, but exceedingly flat and shallow. There isn't a whole lot of intellectual stimulation that Baker has shown in his previous works. There is an overtone of violence-begets-violence throughout the story, but it doesn't go much deeper than that. Perhaps I've missed something in this book...If you want a good Nicholson Baker read, skip this one and try The Mezzanine. It is far more entertaining and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"The author brings up many interesting points through his character, Jay.

I think his foreign policy is pretty revolting though and the fact he's a born-again christian, and basing his administration on that, is a diservice to America.I shouldn't get into all that though. The book is something to read with other people and discuss. The facts about Dick Cheney and his wife, and Haliburton and our defensive system are all very interesting. What is incredible is how timely this book is, the offenses at Abu Graib are all here. At times I was reading this and I remembered the incidents in question and it made me happy I was up to date with the war in Iraq.I recommend this book to anyone that doesn't understand the Democratic standpoint against Bush. Not to say the Democrats are gun-wielding nuts. I think that this book adequately explains why Democrats dislike Bush and want him out of the Whitehouse.The ending comes abruptly and in a way, is expected. I think that the book serves as a metaphor for the way our country works. There is greed, there is corruption, and there is death....but we are still bound by our freedom. There isn't a way to stop Bush. The only way to get Bush out of the Whitehouse is the American way, he needs to be voted out."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"This book is a surprise.First: it is entirely dialogue, even lacking the typical stage directions of a written play.Second: it is oddly humorous, in shades of black. The two men in the hotel room are off kilter, rather bent out of shape by the dispiriting events in American life of the past 40 years. They are both wary, observant, and ambivalent about acting upon their reasonable (and unreasonable) conclusions.Third: this is not about conspiracy theories in an ordinary way; that is, George W should not fear that this is a How to Assassinate the President manual.Checkpoint is lively, erudite, and absorbing. It would make a mesmerizing stage play in the My Dinner With Andre mode--two intelligent people worried about the sorry plight of our lost America.Our current UNleader has certainly unleashed horrors, and he deserves all the bad things that will befall him.

Most reviews state that the book is composed entirely of dialogue, which is true technically. But dialogue suggests an equal exchange of ideas, and really Ben's contributions serve mainly as a foil for Jay's extended anti-Bush harangue. I suppose the theme Baker's going for is that violence only begets more violence-not the most original idea, and one that's not even very well fleshed out in these 115 pages. When you take the unusual approach of building your novel entirely of spoken exchanges (really it's more like a play without stage directions), you'd better be skilled at allowing your characters to reveal themselves through their dialogue, and Baker barely even tries. There's little here besides a dense barrage of disorganized political factoids.

The short novel (it weighs in at only 115 pages) is a transcript of a hotel-room discussion between two people, Ben and Jay, about the wisdom of assassinating George W. Bush. Jay contends that Bush deserves to die for what he has done in Iraq, among other things; Ben, called by Jay to help him with an undescribed situation, finds himself fending off these arguments with the notion that this violence will only beget more violence.Baker's book is, it should be said, not terribly good. The writing is smooth and the characters and their relationship to one another are revealed through their dialogue, and Baker has brought together an interesting hodgepodge of facts to create Jay's argument for his plan. But Baker has also taken the easy way out by making Jay clearly deranged. Ben's task in the novel is not to argue that Bush deserves to live but to argue instead that his death would do no good, and while that may provide a fleeting thrill to Bush-bashers everywhere--\\"You can't even argue against the idea that he deserves it!\\"--it's actually a disservice to the reader. No one even tries to defend Bush, making the book as unbalanced as its main character, and even I can see that this is a flaw. I may disagree with everything Bush has ever done, but I'd still give him a lawyer if he were on trial for his life. Baker doesn't."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"Reminded me that not every Bush opponent is a good writer or even a good person.

Live up to your moral responsibilities as an artist!"},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"In Nicholson Baker's best works (The Mezzanine, Room Temperature, A Box of Matches), he uses his incredible eye for detail and analysis to pick apart the mundane. It's fascinating to hear his characters ruminate on, say, peeing in the dark or why shoelaces don't break at the same time.Checkpoint shows a bit of Baker's genius, but every time the characters begin an interesting discussion, one of them always halts it to steer the conversation back to the main point... which is, of course, assassinating George W. Bush.The only two characters in this novel, Jay and Ben, talk much about the atrocities the U.S. government allegedly has committed over the past 40 years, and there's too much wrong with what they say to go into in a short review such as this. Readers should remember that the character they're listening to and agreeing with is a would-be murderer before taking his words to heart.I will say that Jay is spot-on in his analysis of abortion. I'll let you read to find out what that analysis is.At any rate, any book that focuses on the killing of any real person - president or not - is irresponsible, and Baker should be ashamed for publishing it. Not only for its premise, but for its dialogue-only style and extremely short length (115 pages) that took me less than an hour to read - the whole thing just feels like a rush job. I'll give it two stars, but only because I know Baker can do much, much better."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"Why didn't Nicholson write a book when he had the powerless seething fury many Americans felt when President Clinton decided to take the nation to war."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"First off, some reviewers on this site fault Baker for trifling the otherwise formalized cottage industry of Bush-slandering with something as puffy as an assassination. Anyone who has read the novel until its denouement will know that this is simply incorrect. The script never equates legitimate anger at the duplicity and dishonesty of the Bush administration with assassination, the whole \\"plot\\" of our crazed protagonist is meant to come across as silly as our second character so laboriously keeps grinding at.That cleared, this scamming little novella may not sport the sparkling prose of a typical Baker tome but it offers a delectable flavour in its own right.The text is in its entirety a dinner-table conversation between two friends, one a fanatic opponent of Bush's invasion of Iraq and thus contemplating killing the president with a giant rolling ball (and other contraptions like it, let's not dwell on trivia that're to be savoured in Baker's customary bizzare prose), and the other a wiser, more balanced sort attempting to dissuade his friend with murderous tendencies.With this scaffolding, Baker presents not only some very interesting trivia such as an updated version of Napalm being allegedly employed in Iraq despite all claims to the contrary (apparently because the formula is technically different; more lethal now) but also some very opinionated insights into the heart of the matter.Barring the somewhat twisted inference that our assassin-wannabe draws from his indignations, or the odd out-of-place rant on evils of abortion and such, this is quite a clever little conversation that shouldn't take more than a couple of hours to devour from cover to cover.I'd recommend it in a blink."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"I suppose it's a sign of the times that I feel strange checking this book out of the library, what with the Patriot Act, and now writing a review on Amazon.com. Hell, if the F.B.I. kept a file on Ernest Hemingway, they certainly have one on Nicholson Baker after this brave book.The novel is written as a transcript of a taped conversation between two friends, Ben and Jay. The book's a quick read at just a little over 100 pages and can be devoured in a few hours. The intense conversation captures Jay's rage at Bush and his bloody crusades in Iraq, and while Ben empathizes, he is the voice of reason trying to keep Jay under control. Jay rails about the mutilated Iraqi children, Bush and friends' shameless self-enrichment while others suffer, etc. Ben, who appears to be more interested in history than the present, tries to get Jay interested in photography, and tells him that he has to concentrate on the beautiful trees, not the metaphorical gnats swarming around him.If you're at the library or bookstore, do yourself a favor and breeze through this book. Anyone should be able to feel an echo or twinge of Jay's rage when he depicts the gross aggression and hypocrisy of this Administration. While the reader probably won't agree with the entirety of what Jay says, the dialogue is powerful and affecting.This book will be even more grimly relevant if Dubya manages somehow to win the upcoming election. The neocons are itching for more war and the silver-spoon simian is happy to appease them. We are a few small steps from reinstatement of the draft and other morbid reminders of Vietnam. If this happens, I am sure the streets will be filled with Jays."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"I think that people who try to take the political content of this book seriously are missing the point. The point of the book, like any good novel, is not in scoring political points but exploring the lives of the people involved in the novel. Because the political point of view of the two protagonists is contemporary, it's hard not to react to the political statements being made. Not surprisingly, then, many reviewers have considered the book as a political tract and have commented on how valid the political analysis is (maybe it helps to be Canadian).But that's not the point: The point is seeing two people living in the United States in 2002/2003. While the protagonists do, occasionaly, make points that real political commentators make, they also make absolutely loony points. Like a David Mamet or Harold Pinter play, the pleasure in this book is the dialog (the book is all dialog), the characters, and their relationship.When reading this book it might be worthwhile to take the long view: Assume that the protagonists are living in the time of Louis XIV and are considering assissinating the king. In that frame of mind, you wouldn't care about the politics and would only interested in the people. On that basis, I enjoyed the book. What is impressive to me is how much the author reveals about the characters and their values through the incidentals of the character's conversation. We see two people who really have given up on any hope of influencing their country's direction (or even the direction of their own lives) and who can not tell the difference between fact and supposition. They have come to the point where the only difference they believe that they can make in the public sphere is through some spasmodic dramatic action."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"This book is a little like Baker's Vox from a few years ago. It is a minor success. There should be more books about killing George W. Bush. I hope that this is the first in a trend."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"After reading Leon Wieseltier's absurd review in the New York Times Book Review, I was prepared to be outraged or at least disappointed by Checkpoint. Instead it turned out to be an enormously intelligent account of the political consequences of Baker's tender commitment to life -- to life as what is in the details, which is the point of all his books, or the bass note playing through them. What happens when you take all life seriously, as the dissuader Ben does, even the life of a man who doesn't, like Bush? And what life finally is, is the ability to...talk. There's a lovely, actually empathetic account of how Bush smiles when he finds a word when he's talking. That's what life is: talking. That's what Ben keeps Jay -- the would-be assassin -- doing. Talking. As in Vox, so in Checkpoint. Yes the book is a (justified) screed against Bush's policies. But ut justifies itself, because it's about screeds, about why the proper response to political evil, to thoughtlessness, is speech. Not just \\"free speech\\" but talking, where talking means (sometimes) caring for the crazy person you're talking with.Weiseltier's review, by the way, neglects to mention that the book attacks to of his colleagues at The New Republic by name, Also that Baker himself was mentioned in the Star report, since Bill Clinton was carrying around a copy of Vox that Monica Lewinsky gave him, a novel represented as pornographic or at least steamy (even by Maureen Dowd, who should have known better, and who is a friend of Weiseltier's). And he completely misrepresents the end of the book, which is unambiguous, and represents the triumph of talk, and then of just looking around.This is not my favorite of Baker's novels, but it may be his most courageous, and certainly makes the case for why his kind of novel is important: it puts life -- any life -- over death."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"i've read baker before (\\"mezzanine\\") and this is an entirely different approach. gone are the minute observances and analyses of passing moments and events, implying significance in detail. in its place, barely mitigated rage -- in the form of a dialogue between two erstwhile friends, representing temptation and discipline -- directed at the dubya administration. but that, of itself, represents a different kind of observation.many people will concentrate on the fact that the novel is framed as a persuasive argument (a dialogue, almost in theater form) for and against killing a sitting president, and that's for some a violation of \\"holy\\" edict. but that's really a sideshow within the book, imo, which is more of a discourse on the popular perception of futility and despair in the state of american government affairs, and is vivified by resultant (and altogether common) anger. it also pays to note that the novel could have just as well been written from the republican point of view about killing clinton.the dialogue moves quickly if obsessively and rambling, and the book is a short and easy read. the conversational language is typical of the informal stream-of-consciousness literature of our times, which robs the language of any poetry but is widely accessible even among the barely literate. symbolism is somewhat heavyhanded -- some of it made necessarily ridiculous by the need to skirt american law regarding our demotic royalty.works like this from intellectual authors -- especially one that has built a reputation on close observation -- appear only in times of great political stress, imo. the very existence of the book is perhaps its most interesting feature, serving as a sort of standardized-testing oval in an examination of our society that we can now shade in with our No. 2 pencil. as an observation of our world, it is a warning for the perceptive -- the understanding and compromise and patience of days gone by is fraying, even if it is still usually reached, and the end of civil peace may be approaching."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"In a remarkably novel narrative style - pure conversation between the only two characters in this novella, Baker provides an interesting take on the issues surrounding US politics. The war in Iraq is used as a centerpiece, along with divergent topics such as impact of Walmart, abortion, army, Halliburton/Enron, and a multitude of other issues that have gotten more than their share of headlines and extremist talk-show pundits. While the conversation between the two characters tend to become artifical at times, it is mostly engaging. The viewpoints expressed by either characters provide no new pespectives on the issues, and hence the whole book does not score much on originality. The book certainly plays to the anti-Bush and anti-war crowd, and attempts to provide a modicum of rational thinking when the main protagonist is being \\"calmed\\" by the other character. Overall, an easy-read, fairly novel narrative technique, a simple enough plot, strong (albiet, unoriginal) arguments against war and Bush."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"The is a sparse novel concentrating on two characters political conversation regarding the current regime. One of the protagonists wishes to kill the president. It is of course, a half-baked vague plan that is more to get attention and further one's egotism than a serious plot. This is the brilliance of the book that so many miss out on. The subtlety of the characterizations are brilliant. Like most people speaking about politics, some of the points are valid, others begin to drift into far fetched conspiracy theories. Baker walks the line brilliantly: he presents us with a character who we all meet in our everyday life. The language used and the forcefullness of the emotions are foregrounded, asserting a brilliant parody of armchair foreign policy theororists; if such a thing exists."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"\\"Checkpoint\\" is a political argument disguised as a book. No descriptive prose, no description at all actually, simply a scripted conversation in a hotel room between two friends, Jay & Ben. At the very start Jay informs Ben he is planning to assassinate President George Bush for the war atrocities in Iraq.Your reaction to the book will probably be influenced by your own opinion of whether you think Bush and his administration were wrong to invade Iraq. I don't know if anything new is shed in the course of the argument that hasn't already been said beyond a theory of why abortion should be outlawed. However, the book is interesting at the very least as an emotional response to what many people think is a wrong and terrible war."},{"Title":"Checkpoint: A Novel","review":"Generally, I find the two-guys-sitting-in-a-room-talking format for works of fiction to be uninteresting. It just doesn't exercise the imagination much. Nothing really happens; there's not really a story. And in this case, I think many readers will themselves have recently engaged in conversations very similar to the one depicted here, making many of the same arguments and expressing many similar feelings. The book does score some points with me, insofsar as it might help raise certain issues from obscurity into everyday discourse (eg maybe some things about napalm in Iraq, or about the Pentagon Papers). It also works hard to depict the empathy that we sometimes know we ought to have for each other human being, but nevertheless are unable to achieve. Both characters, and Jay especially, feel the pain of certain events acutely. Imagine if we all did.It's a very brief, quick read, most likely one sitting.

Eliot: A poem-by-poem analysis","review":"I've not been well pleased by this book. Though some of its insights are valuable, and though it is somewhat well researched and fairly comprehensive, it's a chore to read. The author has a style that borders on the incomprehensible -- one feels that he is one of these people who uses tortuous turns of phrase in the mistaken belief that they'll make him seem sophisticated. As a result, the text is disjointed and difficult, its arguments meandering and ill-defined. Williamson has some good ideas, and probably knows what he means, but doesn't get his points across clearly -- it's almost as though he's trying to emulate Eliot's style (or to merely restate the poetry as prose) and, frankly, one often feels as though Williamson has ideas above his station.In short, this has all of the hallmarks of high school essay-writing -- perhaps the author has spent too long in the company of his students. Using 'difficult' language is neither big nor clever if it serves only to obfuscate meaning; here, the wealth of double-negatives, run-on sentences and unexplained, bewildering conjecture is simply not helpful to the reader of an already difficult poet. If the reader works at it, he or she will gleam some benefit from this book - but there are far better, and better written, works out there. If in doubt, take a look at the excerpts on this site -- it may be that the rather purple prose will appeal to some readers; but I regret that where I had hoped for intelligent discourse, I instead found awkwardly adolescent writing that thought itself more clever than it actually was."},{"Title":"Edith's Diary (Highsmith, Patricia)","review":"I hope the movie The Talented Mr Ripley has brought new readers to the works of Patricia Highsmith. I started reading her books after falling in love with Hitcock's movie Strangers on a Train and hunting for the book it was based on. I have since read every Highsmith I have come across.Edith's Diary is the one that has stuck with me. It is not like her other books which are more traditional psychological thrillers with male protagonists. It is certainly not like the Ripley books. Edith has none of the glamor and allure of Tom Ripley. She is a normal, everyday housewife who is increasingly disappointed with her life. She starts to keep a diary which becomes more real for her than her disintegrating daily life. Highsmith makes Edith's descent into insanity understandable, believable, almost inevitable, and just as creepy as any of her other stories. A beautifully written book by a great writer.If you like Highsmith read this one. Also do not miss A Dog's Ransom, The Cry of the Owl, Found in the Street, Strangers on a Train.... etc. I am still looking for a Highsmith book I don't like.

But like all of Patricia Highsmith's novels is a masterpiece of claustrophobic suspense. I read it almost 15 years ago when I was a college student in Caracas, and believe it or not this story of a woman trapped in her home with a son from hell was a cult following novel for my generation, as well as almost all of Highsmith work. Our teachers couldn't understand our love for the american writer who choosed to live in Switzerland, she was to weird, too disturbing. I found that it was easier to find her novels in Europe and South America than in U.S.A. Now in 2000, thanks to Ripley's game and thanks to movie director Anthony Minghella, a new generation will know one of America's best and most underated authors."},{"Title":"Edith's Diary (Highsmith, Patricia)","review":"This book covers an 19-year time span, covering the years 1956 - 1975. Edith is an unfulfilled housewife whose husband ignores her, whose son Clifford is a fat, indolent no-account and whose infirm relative George takes up a good portion of her time, ruling from the limited kingdom of his room.Edith's cat, Mildred is renamed Mildew by Clifford. This seems especially significant as Edith's life appears to be decaying and the infirm George is described as a singularly foul man despite his illnesses.Her other cat, Nelson appears to be a symbol of her own rapidly deteriorating mental health. Nelson circles the periphery of a place, just as Edith circles the periphery of madness before finally taking the plunge. An unemotional divorce, an ineffectual son and the pressures of maintaining a normal facade get to be too great for Edith. Her husband's departure appears to be somewhat anticlimatic, as does the start of his second family. Clifford, too, remains on the periphery of life. He does not appear to have any interests or apsirations. Never an able student, Clifford seeks refuge in fleeting relationships and is dismally disappointed by every woman he ever tried to woo.Edith finally plunges into fantasy. She writes of a fictious life, one she wished she had. Edith starts by creating a fictional university background for Clifford, although the boy barely got through high school. She invents an engineering career for him and a brilliant career in that field. She creates an imaginary wife for Clifford, an imaginary wedding, imaginary children and equally imaginary lives involving all of them.Things take a drastic turn when she begins knitting for her imaginary grandchildren, making clay busts of their heads and fully retreating into her diary. The line between reality and fantasy finally merge for Edith and she cannot turn back to reality. On April 12, 1975 she becomes a casualty of her fantasies.This is a very sad, gritty book about how one woman succumbed to madness. It is well written with very sympathetic characters and one cannot help wondering what if Edith had had that fictitious life she wrote about in her diary."},{"Title":"Edith's Diary (Highsmith, Patricia)","review":"In this novel, Highsmith offers readers a meandering tale of the minutae of the quiet disappointments of Edith Howland. A gentle, modest soul, Edith is quite content with the role of housewife (to a preoccupied husband) and mother (to an odd surly son). The novel opens in the mid-1950s when it wasn't uncommon for young women with literary or intellectual inclinations to forsake career for hearth and home. As an intellectual outlet, Edith publishes a village newspaper, dealing with the eternally controversial topics of birth control, abortion, quality of education in public schools, the American presence in the foreign political arena. It is significant that while Edith is a firebrand in her articles (her viewpoints inflame and alienate her fellow villagers) which purport to set the World to rights, she is singularly incapable of managing her own life. As the novel progresses, we find Edith divorced, saddled with a deceitful, drunken 20-something son, and serving as unwilling caretaker for an uncle by marriage. Edith's reaction to these life-compromising events is that of a rock embedded in a riverbed while the currents swirl around and dash against it. Edith raises passivity to an art form.Unlike other reviewers, though, I do not believe Edith suffered a descent into madness. She was a bit delusional in that her diary (ostensibly a record of actual events) becomes a work of fiction. Consider that those who live alone are prone to fall into eccentric ways. As readers first meet Edith -- moving into a new house with her little family intact, and even though she never lives on her own for a second of the novel -- Edith remains essentially alone.Edith's Diary is quintessential Highsmith. Ordinary characters are depicted doing ordinary acts of cruelty, selfishness, or indifference."},{"Title":"Edith's Diary (Highsmith, Patricia)","review":"A chilling and haunting psychological biography. thoroughly modern in its insights. A believable look at a woman sinking into madness."},{"Title":"Edith's Diary (Highsmith, Patricia)","review":"I found this book fascinating - and was quite alarmed when Edith's husband kept insisting that she had to have sessions with a psychiatrist as she did not seem mad to me. She was unfortunately the product of a unloving relationship with her parents (\\"an only child, she and her parents were not close\\") who were more interested in growing prize roses than politics. As far as I can see she grew up to be uncaring about herself and that is why when Brett announces he is having an affair she reacts so very little and even agrees to have the woman in her home. She shoves reality aside in order to cope and simply hopes that Brett and Carol will split/get tired of each other. She is unable to stick up for herself and only agrees to tell Brett that she loves him (rather lamely) because her great aunt Melanie has persuaded her to do so. Edith even agrees to carry on looking after George who is totally her ex-husband's responsibility because she cannot get angry enough to make Brett take him away. She seems to be devoid of much emotion but is it simply repressed?In the same way she virtually ignores Cliffie who is growing up to be uncaring about himself to such an extent that he cannot look presentable, get a decent job or girlfriend. The tragedy is that he is a product of his parents' lack of love for him - not autistic - and as a child he was simply ignored unless he did something wrong. His father is disappointed in him and his mother is more interested in politics. (The cycle is repeating itself - he eventually creates fantasies about Luce his unrequited love.) Edith cannot even bring herself to confront Cliffie about his secret meddling with George's drugs as she is unable to cope with the fact that she also secretly wants George out of the way.So the fact that Edith starts to write a new reality in her diary is unsurprising, and personally I was sad that she dies so suddenly and accidentally as I think she was getting on just fine in her way, given what she had to deal with!"},{"Title":"Edith's Diary (Highsmith, Patricia)","review":"There was no American author as able as Patricia Highsmith (\\"Strangers on a Train,\\" \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\\") when it came to writing suspense, and \\"Edith's Diary,\\" originally published in 1977 is certainly of that genre.It runs from roughly 1955 to 1975, and describes the life of one Edith Howland, married to journalist Brett, mother of there's-definitely-something-wrong-with-him Cliffie. We meet them as they are about to leave an apartment many would desire on Grove Street, in New York's Greenwich Village, and move to a dream house in what the author clearly means us to read as the also highly desired, artsy, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Edith's diary, a particularly large, hardbound one with which she was once gifted as a young woman, plays an important part in the story, becoming almost another character. Mind you, not that much happens, but things deteriorate. Brett falls for his pretty new secretary and departs, leaving behind his invalid, unpleasant Uncle George, whose care falls on Edith's shoulders. Cliffie goes from bad to worse. Edith gets tired of writing depressing true stuff in her diary, and so begins filling it with happier fiction: Cliffie as a greatly successful engineer, sweetly married to a delightful girl, father to two pretty children. As the diary's fiction is so evidently preferable to her real life, Edith begins spending more and more time and energy there: she also seems to get closer to, more influenced by Cliffie, the constant companion of her loneliness.\\"Edith's Diary\\" is placed in a domestic setting: most readers would probably agree that that was never Highsmith's strong suit. Furthermore, the story is sometimes told from Edith's point of view, sometimes from Cliffie's. This, too, created a problem for me: as I had immediately interpreted Cliffie as autistic, by today's standards, I tended to discount his point of view, and didn't find it particularly useful. Moreover, Edith is meant to be a flaming liberal-- we're told early on that Uncle George condescends to her, thought she and hubby Brett(as his politics were then, when they were married) were \\"babes in the wood, doomed to failure.\\" So, there's a lot of discussion of the then-very-engrossing politics of the time: the Cuban missile crisis, the Vietnam War, Watergate. Most of this discussion, however, would no longer be of any great interest to the general reading public. Finally, the tale is also told slowly, slowly. Nor was I ever sure where the author was going: as best I could figure, Highsmith was looking to create a story illustrating what mental health professionals call a \\"folie a deux,\\" or a situation in which, when two people spend a lot of time together, and the dominant partner is mentally unbalanced, the dependent partner follows the other into insanity. Or that's how the professionals explain the 1950's killing spree of Charlie Starkweather and Caryll Fugate. But maybe not. At any rate, this book isn't the place to start reading Highsmith."},{"Title":"Edith's Diary (Highsmith, Patricia)","review":"...trying to make her life meaningful. - I read the book in one go as a 23 year old man.

The female lead here is a bit of a Martyr, while the son shows the worst results of an over protected American Middle upbringing. Her husband is a classic cad & even manages to foist off a relative of his on Edith; strongly against her wishes & unable to summon a model for his ejection.Its a fascinating & even genteelly horrific side of Suburbia that shows aptly what can scuttle out from our quotidian lives when a few whitewashed rocks are upturned.The novel kept me reading with full interest from beginning to end. The son & the Old Liability of a relative are both fascinating stories, while Edith's private diary reveals the grandiose imaginings many of us have. Unlike some I feel PH does a bang-up job of conjuring up the proper Middle Class confines of the '50s & early '60s USA.I don't want to reveal much of the action, so instead I'll repeat that I found the novel, while in familiar Highsmith territory at a bit of an oblique to the stories she usually writes. One thing I usually see is vivid, accurate portrayals of Gay men, while here the is only some sexual ambiguity in one of the characters.The one thing that puzzles me is exactly what happens at the end.

Unlike similar stories, there is little in the way of soap operatic drama (no major fights between spouses, no lurid scandals). All the disappointments and frustrations in Edith's life affect her inwardly, with the only clear outward sign of her insanity being relected in her diary (..which is full of entries which relect how she would like life to be, not as it really is).Edith's Diary is a slow moving novel, which often reads like an episode of the Donna Reed Show. But it does pull you in, thanks to Ms. Highsmith's excellent prose. And when the story is over you will think long and hard about Edith, wondering if you (or someone you know) is suffering from the same situation.While Edith's Diary is a book which can be appreciated by either gender I suspect women who are over 40 would be most interested in the story, and can relate to American suburban life back some 30 years ago.

His two earlier novels, MAN OF MANY MINDS and its sequel ALIEN MINDS, were published as for adult readers, but actually might as well have been issued as juveniles, since the hero of both is about 20 and there are no female characters.The \\"depicted universe\\" in THE PLANET MAPPERS is similar to that in his two earlier novels as well. It's the distant future, and interstellar travel is routine... yet the technology otherwise seems to be that of the 1940s. Two teenagers, Jon and Jak Carver, are out to help their famous explorer father, Tad, locate and chart new worlds in distant solar systems, and denote ones especially suited for human colonization. As the novel opens, a meteorite breaches the hull of their small interstellar ship, and by chance causes Tad to fall, break his leg and knock himself out against the deck... just as the ship enters a new solar system. Of course, Jon and Jak (who have complementary skills, one being a genius at physical sciences and engineering, one being a master of biology and medicine) take over, while their mother is [of course] completely useless at everything but fixing meals and taking an occasional photo.Can the boys manage to survey an entire solar system of planets without assistance from anyone else, following the exacting rules laid out by \\"The Board\\" which regulates and certifies such discoveries? And when is the evil Slik Bogin going to show up with his armed space ship and crew of cutthroats and steal their discoveries? [Of course if the discovery is not credited to the Carvers, Tad, who has borrowed to the limit to fund his voyage, will be penniless and in heavy debt, his days as an explorer over for good.]Readers unused to science fiction of the 1940s will perhaps be taken aback by the depiction of women or by the ridiculously primitive state of \\"advanced\\" future technology, but if you're willing to cut the slack that always needs to be cut in dealing with futuristic fiction of this era, you'll find much to appreciate in this work that carries quite a charge of that \\"sense of wonder\\" that was vanishing completely from science fiction at right about this time."},{"Title":"Stones, bones, and petroglyphs: Digging into Southwest archaeology : an ultimate field trip","review":"Susan Goodman is a very creative lady.

It has a wraparound cover featuring a bunch of interesting little illustrations, for character inspiration, I assume. The packet is 16 pages, containing a title page, a 2-page recap of character creation with all of the relevant tables, six pages of name tables, two more pages of tables relating to birthplace, doom, and heraldry (which, sadly, are not given spaces on the character sheets), a 2-page spell summary, and two pages of combat action (very useful). The final page is the spell sheet for characters, which will need to be photocopied. It would have been nice to include some of these in the actual pad of character sheets, due to the limited utility of the rest of the package. I am giving it three stars rather than two because of the novelty of a pad of character sheets, something I haven't seen for almost a decade or more. It's this old school approach I like about the new Warhammer."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Character Record Pack","review":"This is better than 1st edition.I just wished that I would have not bought 3rd edition now. From a GM stand point I love this book, it has a lot more detail about magic than the old one did. But it doesn't cover much of the empire. I would definitely still keep the 1st edition book around.I made the mistake about bought both 3rd and 2nd edition at the same time. My group really wanted to try 3rd edition because of the new combat system. They seem to really like it, I on the other hand don't. It takes to long to gather all your dice and then roll out the results.For example we did a fight with 6 humans vs our group of 4. It took an hour and a half to finish that battle. And these were regular dudes in the street. You don't get the great devastating crits that you do in the old editions.If I had to choose I would go with 2nd edition, and them some 1st edition rules."},{"Title":"Hats Off to You: A Celebration of Women","review":"As a daily wearer of hats, real and imagined, I find this book to be a wonderful gift...a five-star salute to women. It's not only beautifully illustrated with elegant hats adorned with flowers and ribbons, it's concisely written. It's actually a compilation of quotes by women through the ages...from Saint Teresa of Avila to Anne Frank to the author herself.It's a luxurious presentation of words and illustrations. You can't buy just one!"},{"Title":"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing","review":"May Sarton's novel \\"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing\\" tells the story of Hilary Stevens, a 70-year old poet and novelist who lives in a house by the sea with her cat, Sirenica. When a two-person team comes to interview her, she reflects on her life, love affairs, and literary career.\\"Mrs. Stevens\\" is a fascinating fictional portrait of a woman writer. It's fun to hear the characters discuss the novels and poetry books written by this invented character; the book has an almost Borgesian flavor in parts as this imaginary oeuvre is explored. In this book Sarton also explores sexual and romantic love in its various permutations: male-male, female-male, and female-female. Along the way the characters invoke a number of important female writers: Sappho, Jane Austen, Colette, etc.Sarton deals with a number of compelling issues in this book: the tension between female creativity and procreativity; women's mental health; the fickle fortunes of the literary world; and the impact of a book's reception on its author. Sarton has a satiric touch in her look at the literary/publishing establishment, a gentle touch in her look at human relations. And throughout there are some nice touches, like details about Hilary's work in her garden. Overall, a solid achievement from an impressively prolific writer."},{"Title":"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing","review":"This book is wonderful for all readers. Detailing the experiences of a lesbian woman coming to terms with the terminus of her life and the art she has produced, this book bridges ideas and generations. There is so much there that this is a must for any person who wants to think seriously about art and life."},{"Title":"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing","review":"about life, poetry...this was an incredible book. not based as much on plot as ideas, this book uses f. hilary stevens, an accomplished poet, as a medium through which we see that life, despite its inherent pain, is amazing and beautiful once viewed in the right way. eloquently written, and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing","review":"Do not pick up this book if you are hoping for an action-packed novel. This is a slow a narrative as it gets, and rightfully so. It is a very beautiful book. The Mrs. Stevens of the title is a poet. A newly published book of poems is bringing her fame and attention. A couple of journalists want to interview her. The book has four parts:her preparations and musings pre-interview: Hilary Stevens was born in New England with a hot-blooded Mediterranean personality. She was never the daughter her parents expected, and she hated being a girl, because at an early age she understood all the extra constraints she would have to endure just for that fact. She recounts her discoveries of love, her early passions, her writing, with a mixture of loving nostalgia and disgust.the interviewers dialogs on their way to her house: esoteric English majors (boy and girl) waxing about the beauty of language and love (quite boring, in my opinion)the interview itself: where Hilary takes the interviewers for a wrestling match of the brains, the meaning of life, the meaning of her poems, and comes out very victorious. Hilary and the girl journalist understand each other and make the boy journalist feel inadequate.the post-interview and the following day: Hilary has a young friend, Mar, who helps her in the garden and does small repairs in her cottage. Mar is tormented, coming to terms with his homosexuality. Hilary can understand this very well, because she was/is a passionate person, and Mar is still searching for the tools to deal with his passion in a less destructive way. Hilary suggests poetry as a good avenue. Mar and Hilary have fruitful conversations by the ocean. After a few days of stirring the past, Hilary comes to terms with her life as best as she can."},{"Title":"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing","review":"Hilary Stevens, a poetess and novelist in her 70s, prepares for an interview regarding her latest book of poems which has once again made her the darling of the critics. That morning, thanks to a puzzling encounter with young Mar Hemmer who desires to write his own poetry, Hilary begins to look back on her career and her life, her lovers and the elusive Muse. Just what is it that propels her to write her poems?, the interviewers want to know, and through their questions, she relives the moments in her life when the Muse entered and the poetry flowed -- when she was with the women who set her mind aflurry with words and passion.Slow-paced and thought-provoking, May Sarton's novel discusses what gives writers inspiration, as well as what effect love has not only on writing but on life. All the characters are well-fleshed out, from Hilary to Mar and both the interviewers, and even the young Hilary who provides a conflict between the generations within Hilary herself. A beautifully written book that examines what it is to be a writer."},{"Title":"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing","review":"A fast read, lyrical in places, but a rather strange, dated approach to lesbian/ bisexual experiences. Not a keeper for me, already donated to Goodwill."},{"Title":"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing","review":"This book should be read by anyone who is a writer or who wants to be. It is the story of an elderly woman, a writer, who is being interviewed by two young journalists. As they interview her, she flashes back to different times in her life and offers insights into how/why she wrote her various works. She is also trying to help a young man understand himself (and not always willingly). This book tells the tale of how Hilary Stevens found her Muse, a different one for different times in her life, and gives us insights in how to find ours. I am keeping this book."},{"Title":"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing","review":"Fans of May Sarton and serious literary types will love this book in which very little happens except in the mind of the narrator. It's an important book, as she was an important writer. She was also a pioneer, daring to bring lesbian characters to mainstream fiction. She risked a lot to do that and lost some of her support. As such, she is worthy of continuing popularity, but her fiction probably won't appeal to a wide audience because of its old-fasioned style. It's very lyrical, intelligent, rich, the kind of writing you read slowly and savor long. Sarton's prose is beautiful for a limited, discerning audience."},{"Title":"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing","review":"I read \\"As we are now\\" as a teenager and loved it. It has lived with me for years so I was excited to find this book and hoped for a similar experience. But I'm afraid I just found it dull and self-indulgent.

Just cut out all sugar and sugar substitutes, and follow a low-glycemic index diet. Ta-da! Seriously, it did miracles for me."},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"Let food be thy medicine, thy medicine shall be thy food. ~HippocratesDr. Nicholas Perricone is a pioneer in reversing skin damage and has finally solved one of the mysteries of my life. When I lived with my grandmother, she cooked salmon on a weekly basis and we always ate tuna fish sandwiches on a regular basis. Then, I got married and my husband insisted that I stop cooking fish because he disliked it. That was when my skin changed. For years, I've wondered about the effects of diet on our skin and The Acne Prescription reveals the need for advanced care and a healthy dose of antioxidants and Omega 3 supplements. He explains how skin disorders are caused by a systemic inflammatory disease and explains the details of sebaceous glands and how corneum cells block pores. I learned about oxidative stress, foods to avoid, foods to get into my diet fast and why I should look for creams containing DMAE.After reading this book, I went to the grocery store and found some Wild Alaskan Salmon which was on sale for 97 cents a pound. I baked the entire fish and tried to follow the three day diet in which you eat mostly salmon. The diet in this book is filled with tasty choices from the sea. If you enjoy scallops, salmon, crab, tuna and shrimp, you will love this diet. I also purchased the pomegranate juice as recommended and you can normally find it in the produce section of your local grocery store.Other moments of enlightenment occurred while reading about how chocolate can cause your skin to break out, but it is more the sugar than the actual cocoa butter. So, I did not notice any changes in my skin after eating a Hershey's Low Carb bar and then this book even made more sense. It is the sugar, not the cocoa. Another great product he recommends is Pycnogenol which can be rather expensive, but seems to work very well.Overall, this book emphasizes the need for antioxidants, essential fatty acids and a healthy lifestyle. Avoiding stress is essential and a series of yoga postures are recommended.At least a third of this book is filled with tasty skin-clearing recipes like:Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon, Seared Tomatoes, Asparagus and Lemon Olive Oil HollandaiseSpiced Diver Scallops with Ecuadorian Tabouleh and Lemon Myrtle OilPomegranate Citrus-Glazed Apricot and Garlic Roasted Chicken with Apple-Spinach Stuffing and Garden VegetablesSo, this all sounds very gourmet, but the ingredients are relatively easy to find and the directions are uncomplicated. The recipes were all created by executive chef Bernard Guillas.The glossary is excellent and if you read one book on how to care for your skin from the inside out, this should be it.This book is more about lifestyle change than a quick solution. I have only read one other book that is on this level and that is The Metabolic Plan. With those two books in hand, you will have a wealth of information and also understand why lifestyle changes will improve your health. Nicholas Perricone, M.D. has included so many solutions to the problem of Acne that I can only say I'll be reading this book over and over again. Even if you just suffer from occasional breakouts this book will give you the information you need to encourage a clear, glowing complexion. Many of the ideas in this book will also help you live a more healthy life. I definitely want to read all of Dr. Perricone's books. He really is an expert on antiaging and skincare.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"Perricone's diet/book serves as a great guideline. I have stuck pretty well to the diet -- not necessarily the diet plans -- but have used the foods on his okay list and worked with them to create my own meals. The Salmon I make a key part of my diet and occasionally create some of his recipes. This has worked fine with me. Although, because I was also concerned about fatigue, I picked up another book, The Mid-Life Miracle Diet -- that I thought would address my fatigue. I found Perricone's recommendations very similar to this book -- in both diet as well as supplement recommendation. I combined the two --and battled both acne and fatigue. The Mid-Life book isn't as adamant about elimating carbs from the diet -- only restricting them to later evening eating. So I compromised. I didn't eat bread often but if I did -- I kept it small and later in the day. Perricone's supplements are DOUBLE the cost if you were to just go to a very good quality health food store and put together the supplements yourself. I combined recommendations of what is in his book with the Mid-Life recommendations. The initial cost may be alot -- but will last longer than a month supply of Perricones -- and thus comparitively, cost less to do it this way. Once you spend time figuring out what is in the supplements and getting the supplements -- it's easy. All you have to do is replace when you run out. Mid-Life book recommends TwinLab and Country Life -- there are other good supps. And then there are bad supplements. So go to a health food store, and ask the advice of one of the workers there -- he/she will tell you which brands are best quality. (I have found the owner won't help as much as a friendly employee who knows his stuff.) I followed the diet and took my put together supplements before trying his products. A major difference took place without use of his products -- increased energy, better mood and skin health. I do not like Perricone's acne products at all. Instead I do like his Vitamin C Ester wash and his other products are okay. I give the Perricone book 5 stars because out of the many things I've tried for my acne -- this is the only thing that has ever really worked."},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"I was so excited to read Dr. Perricone's book. I recently purchased this book for my 11 year old son. It was not until I read his book that I really understood what had happened to me. I'm a 32 year old mom. I never experienced acne problems until my first pregnancy. I was one BIG walking pimple. You couldn't touch my face, chest, breasts, or back without touching a pimple. I was ashamed to go out in public because people would always stare at me as if I had leprosy or something. After my second child, I weighed in at 285 pounds. My doctor told me to go on a diet and cut out anything white (starches, sugar,etc.). Well, I did just that. In about 5 months time, I lost over 90 pounds. Also, people at work would always compliment me on my clear skin. I just figured my skin cleared because I was exercising (walking on my lunch break). I never realized until now that my previous skin problems were due to my overall eating habits. This book gets two thumbs up from me. If I can clear my skin and lose weight by just a few changes in my daily life, anyone can!"},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"Overall, this is a good book. The author clearly understands the connection between healthy lifestyle choices and healthy skin. His advice is good, and the book is an easy read.I agree with the reviewer who suggested getting it from the library. The author's writing style is repetitive, and I found myself skipping paragraphs or pages often. The core information provided in the book is simple and doesn't take much explanation. If you're familiar with anti-inflammatory diets, you're probably familiar with the gist of this book. If not, and you plan to strictly adhere to the author's recommendations, you may want to buy this book as a reference."},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"I tried the 3-day challenge and looked and felt fabulous, so I bought the little notebook and put the diet to the test for a month. People everywhere I went were commenting on how radient my skin looked! And this coming from someone who has suffered from terrible skin problems since I left high school. I felt better than I have ever felt before and this diet is well-balanced and delicious. When glancing at the menu, it looked as though I would starve to death, but when I actually implemented the program I found that I was very satisfied and couldn't even eat all of the food recommended for any given meal!! I have severe hypoglycemia, which vanished on this diet.The problems are that the suppliments are very expensive, so I bought my own at a local co-op and used Aubrey Organic cleanser instead of his recommended products, which are outrageous in cost! Plus, the salmon is expensive, so I just ate less overall. It still worked!! Going out to eat tends to be challenging, but I have tried to limit that in order to save money as well. I think that once you discover this diet it isn't too hard to make adjustments to your own budget and tastes.Since that beautiful month, I have gone back to my old eating habits and am, again, embarrassed to leave the house without makeup. So, as my New Year's resolution and in preparation for my upcoming wedding, I am planning to return to this wonderful program! Highly recommended if you want beautiful skin, high engery, weight-loss and control over hypoglycemia."},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"I haven't bought the book yet, but I get Perricone's newsletter. I read that a women followed his suggestion and started taking ALA Alpha Lipoic Acid every day and her acne cleared up!I was skeptical because my 15 year old son has pretty bad acne. I've tried a lot of things, even pro active. He wouldn't take anything orally he only would use topical things. He did try antibiotics. They did nothing.I said what the heck, and bought some 100 mg ALA caps at GNC. My son started taking them along with a multi and 500 mg of vitamin C every day. He would take vitamins for me.Withing one week I noticed his face was clearing up and now about a month later, his face looks about 75%-80% clearer!!! I'm amazed and so is my son!

I eat helathy normally, but i have improved greatly because of the diet regulations. The recipes are fabulous if you like to cook. They are so savory and delicious!! I have gotten numerous compliments on my skin. Like anything, it takes work. But it is well worth it. The book is fabulous!!!

For those of you who have suffered from depression or low self-esteem due to acne, this is a must read. I have battled acne for 15 years. I have tried over the counter products, infomercial products and prescriptions, all to no avail. Within ten days I saw a dramatic change in my skin, however I waited two months to write this review because I wanted to see if the results would last. AND THEY HAVE!!! Dont let the gourmet dinners discourage you, I have yet to make one of them. I have been substituting with other foods for dinner. This book has all the info you need and is right on the money. Not only is my skin in its best condition in years, I am also waking up in the morning with no more backaches and my arthritis is practically non-existent.

Not only has it really improved my overall skin quality, I have more energy and I am more vivacious than ever before! I have struggled with acne since I was about twelve years old. I have tried everything including accutane. It as not until I found this book and began following some of the principals that I really noticed a difference. I will say this, a really do not believe that all the supplements are required for you to reach your optimum skin health. I do fine with my fish oil and ALA ( which I will not buy at the overly inflated perricone web site prices), and watching my high glycemic carbs. I also take DMAE and eat a lot of salmon. Not only has my skin cleared, the entire color of my skin is different. People began to complement me for the first time in my life telling me that I had beautiful skin. In addition to the skin clearing, i also am much more toned and dropped about 10 pounds since the start of the program. The only problem I have with this book is it seems like Dr. Perricone really plugs his products waaaaay to much. The prices on his website are a little crazy for my taste. If you want to really save on your topical supplements go to a website called [...] With the products on this website you can make you own skin care products using cetaphil as a base. They are exactly the same thing."},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"What a scam. While some of the principles in this book are based on truth, it is scandalous that a doctor would abuse his role in order to make a profit. Most of the strategies he claims will give miraculous results are truly just a waste of money with a tiny grain of truth at the center. While it's true one should get enough vitamins (centrum will do just fine) and use good products to care for skin (drugstore ones are generally just as effective, and in this case more-so), using his products & strategies can only help you by convincing you to do what you already know you should - keep your face & body clean & healthy.

The program he outlines is excellent and within a few days of following his advice on diet, I had already noticed dramatic improvements in my skin.

I am a medical writer who is very familiar with the research others have done related to inflammation as a cause of acne, and the effects of the topical and oral antioxidants he recommends.

I wish there was a way I could give testimonials in his behalf on finally proving that acne is systemic. After having a child at 27 years old, my skin totally changed and I became very acne prone. I would suffer from mild to moderate acne at all times. It was very rare that I did not have some form of breakout on my face, neck, back and/or chest. I went to numerous dermatologists and received great treatments. However, nothing worked. I took the antibiotic - Tetracyclin off and on for over 9 years. Since finding this book, I have been eating the foods and taking the supplements that are listed in the book based on my type of acne. I look completely different. I even choose to go without any foundation on my face. His information is great. For the first time in 9 years, I have not taken any antibiotics.

This makes one wonder about the agenda of any who would disparage the book and its esteemed author. Dr. Perricone is a world-renowned skin researcher and scientist (and was the winner of last year's prestigious Eli Whitney Award for his significant contribution to science). While he may only see patients on a limited basis, he is bringing relief and an improved quality of life to thousands through his research, writing and unique patented products.Dr. Perricone's \\"The Acne Prescription\\" is effective and the price of the book money well spent--especially compared to the cost of a trip to your dermatologist!"},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"Dreadful.

My son read it, absorbed it, followed the diet, and 7 years later still follows the diet & the stress reduction tips and his face has remained clear. My son believes that diet is everything and we can't understand why the doctors don't get it! Probably because big Pharmacy is making sure doctors don't ever let patients know that something like diet could change their skin and their lives. I follow the diet too, even though I don't have problems with acne. The plus side for me? I lost 10 pounds in one month! This book is a life changer, but you need to follow the diet, which is essentially a Mediterranean diet. If you live on junk food, fast food, etc., it will be a major life change for you, but you will have clear skin with no drugs, will lose weight, and your health will improve dramatically."},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"This is a good book. It is filled with information that is helpful for everyone. Even though it is apparently targeted to acne sufferers, it contains a wealth of information about improving the appearance of the skin at any age and it sets you on the right path to achieving great health overall. The author's style is simple and straightforward. The program he outlines is excellent and within a few days of following his advice on diet, I had already noticed dramatic improvements in my skin.The author is pretty direct regarding caffeine, its really hard on your liver, and is a toxin to our bodies. I used to drink 8 -10 cups a day. I found out after giving it up completely, how much better I feel being off of it and how much my skin improved! I urge you to try to cut back, and eventually give it up completely. Even if for just two weeks, you'll be able to compare how you feel drinking caffeinated beverages, or being completely off of them, and then make your decision from there. I discovered that I feel 100% better, and have a LOT more energy without it, so I'll never go back, based solely on the way I feel. And when I feel the urge to have something warm in the morning I drink a coffee subsitute my doctor recommended. Its called soyfe e and its made entirely from soybeans. Not only is it caffeine-free but its taste even better than coffee! You can find it at health food stores or online at soycoffee.c om.While the book may not be a thrill to read like many other novels or reading material you enjoy, it lives up to its claims quite elegantly. I recommend this book to anyone interested in improving the appearance of her/his skin and overall health."},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"I suffered from cystic acne for some five years. It was weird because I didn't have terrible skin as a teenager but I suddenly got acne as an adult. Over 5 years, I went to 4 different dermatologists and tried an Ayurvedic doctor. Medicines taken at different points were - Minocycline, Tetracycline, Spironolactone and some horrible corticosteroids. The Ayurvedic doctor gave me a tonic that tasted so vile I literally vomited every morning after taking it.NOTHING WORKED. The prescriptions would work for a while but my skin would get used to them and the Drs would keep upping the dosage until they couldn't anymore. Then I'd be weaned off the medicines and boom my acne would return worse than ever. I also gained weight due to the medicines and I am sure all these drugs have terrible long-term side effects. I know someone for whom Spironolactone worked great which is fine but she got pregnant and had to stop using it. Well guess what? Her skin looks terrible again :-(I had just given up hope when I spotted Dr Perricone's book in my library's 'New Books' section. I did the diet diligently and three long, hard weeks later, my skin was PERFECT. It's been about 5 years since that time and while I don't do the diet anymore, I still follow his basic guidelines and my complexion is beautiful :) You would be shocked if you saw my Before/After pictures. I wish I could add photos here.If you have bad acne, do yourself a favor and follow the diet. It was harder for me because I am vegan and therefore will not eat meat, eggs or fish. I also didn't purchase any of his products (vitamins etc) that he recommends.A sample meal plan for me was:Breakfast- 2 cups black tea + 1 small bowl oatmeal with cinnamon and berries on top.Lunch- 2 Rotis (Indian bread) made of oat flour + stir-fried broccoli + a bowl of lentils + 1 women's multivitaminDinner- Big bowl of kidney bean soup + 1 pear + 1 calcium tabletI sprinkled flax seed powder on every meal.Lots of water throughout the day.If I went to a restaurant like say an Indian restaurant, I would order just chhole (garbanzo bean curry) and a stirfried veg. No naan, no other breads, no rice. It was hard seeing other people eat those yummy things but you have to tune them out :)2 cuisines that are great for anyone doing this diet are Indian and Ethiopian. Both feature tons of low-glycemic vegetables and Ethiopian injera bread is very good for you. I assume if you eat fish you could eat at Japanese places too. Do NOT set foot into an American or Italian establishment, you will find nothing worthwhile on the menu.I have to say, I constantly craved food while on the diet and in the beginning I felt tired and had trouble concentrating (lack of sugar and also weaning oneself off breads etc). But it was a 3 week diet so I slogged through it and my discipline paid off. By Day 4 I could see a reduction of the cysts and my skin was less irritated and/or itchy. I would highly recommend that before doing the diet, start writing weekly meal plans so you know exactly what to get from the grocery store and what you're going to cook. Also inform your significant other/best friend so they help you stay on the wagon.I also kept a food diary and discovered my biggest trigger for acne was BANANAS! I still cringe when I see a banana in the grocery store... although I do eat all citrus fruit as well as mango and watermelon (none of which are allowed while ON the diet)This diet has no cons whatsoever, and it really works. It is completely natural and free of cost. You don't even have to buy the book, get it for free from the library. The food you prepare yourself. If you're not vegan like me, it's a piece of cake because you have far less dietary restrictions.All those years that I wasted going to all those nincompoop dermats and the amount of money I spent on co-pays and prescriptions!!! Plus who knows how much I screwed up my body with all those prescriptions! If you have bad acne, please get this book. Give it a shot! :)"},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"I really appreciated the doctor's advice on diet, meditation, and exercise; however, I was disappointed that his ultimate solution was buying his 65 dollar supplements and his 85 dollars cleansers or lotions.

Instead, he provides only testimonials, exaggerated claims, partial truths, and incorrect statements. He cherry-picks possibly supportive studies from the literature and ignores contradictory studies. He cites lots of lab studies (in vitro or in animals), but few that demonstrate any clinical effects in humans. The diet he recommends is low in calories, and weight loss alone may improve the way his patients look and feel. His advice about tobacco and sunscreens is appropriate, but there is little science behind the rest of his program. He seems to have gathered every nutrient and skin cream he had any reason to hypothesize might work and advised using all of them [and sells them for an exorbitant amount of money to the exclusion of anyone else's]. A more rational approach would have been to first see which ones really worked, and later to see if any combinations of the effective agents worked better than a single agent.\\""},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"This book is not very comprehensive. I've read many books about acne and this book's description about acne is the least clear. In addition, the author uses many medical term so it's a little bit difficult for the lay people to grasp the meaning. However the book did help me by providing many facts that other acne books do not mention. The thing that annoys me the most is the commercial aspect of this book.

If I follow his program and buy his over-priced products, I would spend all my paychecks and some loans. I think he should practice his program with limited budget like the rest of us to see if it is realistic or NOT.I think the most effective, economical program is The Acne Cure: The Nonprescription Plan That Shows Dramatic Results in as Little as 24 Hours by Dr. Terry J.

He had tried antibiotics with no success and wanted to go on Accutane. Having heard bad things about the side effects, my Dad wanted my brother to try the diet for a couple months before deciding to take the medication. He faithfully followed it with no results whatsoever. Some of the ideas in the book are absurd - as a diabetic with a horrible eating habit and no teenage acne, I can tell you that the focus on dieting and insulin spikes as a direct cause of of the condition is preposterous. When I was a teenager, I'd go on serious candy binges that required insulin doses bordering on the irresponsible, and I got through high school with only the occasional zit. I've read that for a small number of people, diet can be a factor for acne, but obviously our experience points to something else as the primary cause (this assumes you eat reasonably well - malnutrition isn't sexy). Since medication should always be a last resort, a change of diet is probably a good first approach for those with minor blemishes, but those with a serious condition should look elsewhere. For the curious, while my brother had some strong side effects from the Accutane (none dangerous, primarily incredibly dry skin and eyes), it certainly succeeded in clearing up his skin."},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"I expected to find some product placement (and there was), but had no idea that most of the book would be Dr. Perricone bragging about how much smarter he is than all other scientists and doctors and taking credit for other peoples' work! There were also a lot of technical mistakes that I found (as a medical student) that make me wonder if he even understands the science that he claims to have discovered. To top it all off, I received some of his products as a gift and they were terrible. If you are interested in MD-formulated products, try MD skincare or Murad, both actually work (and, though I haven't read their books, they can't be worse)."},{"Title":"The Acne Prescription: The Perricone Program for Clear and Healthy Skin at Every Age","review":"Definitely worthwhile reading for those with problem skin.

Although some of the charms and spells invoke the moon as Selene, most of the material is Christian. Nevertheless, it is an interesting little book and gives some great hints about attracting and seeing faeries.There is a very extensive section on the meanings of flowers given in a a bouquet. Also the lore on some Angels, their planets, and their flowers.I would say that this book is a good starting point for anyone wishing to enhance their garden by magick... but definately not a great source for much in the way of garden magick."},{"Title":"Garden Spells","review":"This book is really cute. It is very quaint and has nice pictures and things in it, but it really does not serve to be a good reference for someone looking for information on paganism. I knew that when I bought this book. I own Fairy Spells, also by the same author. Both books have beautiful pictures and lovely rhymes in them (I hardly call them &quot;Spells&quot;, the title is somewhat misleading) but this book is a lovely addition to your library if you understand that this book is not really a reference, and rather more for entertainment value."},{"Title":"Garden Spells","review":"I saw the bad reviews calling this a Christian book diguised as being pagan, but I figured since it was only $0.01, I would get it and mentally erase the Christian Dogma and rewrite/rework any ideas that might be useful to something that would work for me. (Nothing gets more Pagan than gardening!) Look at it this way, the Christian pantheon is just another pantheon. Plain and simple. Pagans can be as close minded as we claim others are sometimes!In reality, I wasn't overwhelmed by referrences to the Christian God. It happens directly like five times.... I would say the author refers to Goddess an equal amount if not more. Angels and the fey are refered to quite a bit as well. Its a cute book too, its small hardcover, with colored illustrations (more for decoration than reference).Some useful topics: Noble trees of Ireland/Druidical trees of the year, A gardian angel invocation, gardening by the moon, instructions for created an Elizabethan garden, moss house, and garden grotto.All and all, I would say the best way to describe the book is what some would call \\"Christian Wicca\\"...its not what I practice, but I did enjoy the book, more than a hard stale tootsie roll, which is pretty much the only other thing you can get for $0.01."},{"Title":"Millennium Baby","review":"I've read a lot of romance novels in my life, but I have enjoyed each and every more than the entry by Judith Arnold.

Unfortunately, he had his own agenda, and it seems to have precluded him from getting to the facts. For example, he comments on Mahalia's role in Imitation of Life, and one wonders whether he ever saw the movie. His inaccuracies make the reader question passages of the book about areas of her life that are not so well known by the public. His writing is careless."},{"Title":"Got to Tell it: Mahalia Jackson, Queen of Gospel","review":"Mahalia Jackson was said to indeed be a very suspicious woman. That is why she had peculiar habits such as accepting cash only for performances. Even the author testifies to her distrust. Why therefore even if some of the things said were true I don't think that Mahalia would have revealed her faults and shortcomings to man whom she knew very little about. The book creates an evil picture of Mahalia. It would break the heart of any Mahalia Jackson fan. The author also claims to have been friendly with Mahalia's godson - Brother John Sellers, who was one of the interviewees for the book and who supposedly helped to degrade Mahalia. If Brother John did indeed love Halie like the mother he never had, I don't think that he would stoop so low as to want to defame her for the sake of a novel.I do agree with the critic above who says that there are alot of wrong facts stated stated in the book. Here are some corrections that need to be made.Mahalia was born in 1911.Her mother had only sisters.She went to Chicago at age 16.Jules never mentioned Mahalia's first recording date in 1937 for Decca RecordsShe divorced her first husband in 1941She toured Europe with Big Bill Broonzey in 1952 not 1955She played herself in the movie, Imitation of Life - she was also in four other films.She received her first Grammy Award in 1962She received another in 1963, a Grammy Lifetime Acheivement Award in 1972 and another Grammy in 1976.She did not start courting her second husband until the early 60's.She did not perform in a Pink Organza gown in the 1970 Newport Jazz Festival - it was sea blue/turquoise with diamond-like sequins along her collar, center and cuffs of her sleeve.There are other misinfo's that he is guilty of printing...shame on you Mr. Schwerin."},{"Title":"Mythic Time, Stone Circle","review":"Listening to folks hanging out around a campfire singing, story telling, and talking is just not that entertaining or maybe it was just to simplistic, but would be fun to do in real time."},{"Title":"Economics Today: The Macro View (Addison-Wesley Series in Economics)","review":"Has a real knack for conveying complex economic concepts quickly and systematically with little effort.

Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"I'd like to point out a few misconceptions in some of the reviews concerning the Imadoki series ^^ ---1) This is not \\"Watase's first high school drama\\". In fact, high school dramas are not a deviation from Watase's usual, a popular example would be Pubescence. Fushigi Yugi, Ayashi no Ceres, and Arisu 19th the only other Watase mangas released in the US, but although they're magic-girl mangas, this does not mean Yu Watase is not experienced in drawing a non-magical genre!2) Imadoki has 5 volumes total (not 6). It is complete in Japan a few years ago and VIZ is printing volume 5 in February (street date is in March, but you can buy it off Amazon during February).3) Imadoki does not come after Arisu \\"Alice\\" 19th. Although it was released in the U.S. after Alice 19th, it came out in Japan before Alice 19th. You might recognize Imadoki as a sort of \\"transition\\" artwork from Ceres to Alice 19th.As for my review on the manga, I won't give you a summary of this volume, since everyone else has already given you a very comprehensive idea of the manga. My opinion is that this is by far Watase's best work, next to Fushigi Yugi Genbu Kaiden (which has, in fact, been licensed in the US by VIZ and will be coming out this June!).//Character Analysis(as compared to Fushigi Yugi, Ayashi no Ceres, & Arisu 19th)Compared to the Yu Watase mangas released in the US, Tanpopo is probably the most sweetest main character of all. I believe that she has a lot more integrity than Miaka, Aya, or Alice, but is still a very realistic and sweet girl who believes in friendship above all else.While all the main characters have unique traits of their own, I feel that Tanpopo is a stronger girl than Miaka or Alice. If her best friend or sister is in love with the boy she likes (as in the cases of Miaka & Alice), she would abandon her own feelings and support what she respects the most - her relationship with family and friends. As you will see in a later volume, Tanpopo refuses to get in the way of a relationship even if the antagonist (I won't mention any names or details lest I spoil you) is neither her sister nor best friend.I also feel that this is a manga where all the characters glow equally with unique beauty. In mangas like Fushigi Yugi, it feels like the side characters often appeal to the reader more than the main characters themselves. Since Ms. Watase had once said that \\"character relationships\\" is what she tries hardest to be develop in a story, I think Imadoki is a success in this aspect. You will find that every character is loveable in their own way, especially the adorable protagonist, Tanpopo.//TranslationThe translation of Imadoki is actually very close to the actual Japanese text and the English variation did not take away from the story. Instead, the slightly altered variations only adds to the story, creating a comical character that you will meet in volume two (which is where the story starts to really pick up its pace).In conclusion I must say that Imadoki is worth every dollar you pay for it - and at five volumes, there's no reason for anyone to not read it!"},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"All right, I will admit this: I bought Imadoki because of the manga-ka's name on the front: Yu Watase. Watase-san has never disappointed me, and I have read all of her works that have been translated into English up to this date. (July 2004). However, I was a little surprised when I started to read. No fantasy world? No magical powers? No \\"ultimate destiny\\" like the ones faced by Miaka, Aya, and Alice? This is definitely different than Watase-san's other works. I'm not going to give you a plot summary, that's what the little Amazon review thingy is for up above. But, I will tell you this: Yes, this book is not like Watase-san's other works. Heroes and villians aren't exactly defined, the world isn't in danger, and golly, there are an awful lot of flowers.However, the elements that Watase uses to tell her story are still the same ones she uses in Fushigi Yugi, Ceres, Alice...she gives us a protagonist (female, of course!) that is struggling with something other girls in the world can relate to. Only this time around, the girl isn't thrust into this sudden alternate universe to help her solve her problems and realize her self-worth; this heroine does it on her own turf, with her own hands. There are the beautiful drawings and the handsome bishonen ^_^, and the fact that Watase-san puts a new spin on a pretty-much used up misunderstood-girl plot.If you are a Watase-san fan, then I don't hesitate to recommend this to you, although if you are going to be disappointed by a lack of fantasy genre and short length (this series is only 5 books long), you might consider picking it up at another time. If you are a shoujo manga fan in general, then this title won't disappoint. It has enough cuteness, and you might be turned on to Watase's other titles. Personally, I loved it!"},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"Tanpopo Yamazaki is not your average Meio High School Freshman, as evidenced by her grand entry into her school... by flying over a guard rail on her bike the day before she starts class. This brazen act of individuality is witnessed by a young man planting a dandelion with a spade. He is concerned for the dandelion, or \\"Tanpopo\\"... yes, the heroine's name means dandelion... because her actions have harmed it, and life at the school is difficult enough for the plants that the young man considers to be his friends. The two part ways for the day before Tanpopo learns of the young man's name.The first day at school Tanpopo meets the young man in her class, but he is extremely cold to her. She finds out from a fellow student that his name Koki Kugyo and that he is an heir to a large fortune. When she persists to remind him that they have met the truth of her allowance into the academy is revealed...horror of horrors, she actually tested into the academy instead of having her parents pave the way with their exorbitant fortunes. This immediately causes a reaction from the bourgeoisie , who find her quite plebian, and refuse to have anything to do with her. The start calling her \\"Weed\\" to her face and making all sorts of nasty comments, but no amount of torment from them is as bad as the out and out ignoring she is getting from Koki, who had been so pleasant to her on their first chance meeting. At a class assembly the first day Tanpopo calls him out, pledging her allegiance that she and he will be friends with one another and she will not rest until she has achieved that end.This causes some problems with her reputation, as you can imagine, but Tanpopo manages to navigate things in such a way that she and he are on the planting committee. This entails strange actions, because none of the plants at the academy are actually real, for allergy preventions. But, she and he become a team, and everyone is surprised when Tsukiko Saionji, a pretty, popular, and (more importantly to the elite members of Meio) rich young woman volunteers to join their committee. Tanpopo's first duty as a planting committee member is to go against tradition surreptitiously and replant all of the plastic flowers with real flowers... which causes some problems for everyone, the members of the planting committee included.So, at the core, what is this charming series about? It's about values, strength, and resolve to do what is right despite all the adversity. It's about a bubbly young iconoclast just being herself in a situation where everyone else has developed a faade to survive. It's about changing other people's perceptions and helping them grow when they realize that everything they have ever been taught to believe doesn't necessarily translate as being the \\"right or wrong\\" way. Is this a diversion from Watase's usual fair? Oddly enough no it is not. Typically her stories are much more harsh, but the core elements are still there. Friendship, overcoming obstacles, love and pain, growth, finding oneself... those are all key to enjoying a Watase story, and they are all here. This story may be lighter than typical Watase work, but it definitely stand among (and I would even argue out) in the pantheon of her work. Fans of her usual work will not be disappointed in this fun series."},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Yu Watase has done it again.

Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"I have read several manga,and this is by far my favorite. Imadoki features a great main character, Tanpopo, who is an example of strength and moral courage for young girls. She is somewhat similar to another one of Yuu Watase's characters- Miaka, from Fushigi Yuugi- a fearless young girl who sticks to what she believes in even if it costs her some humiliation. All the while she keeps a cheerful heart and never lets circumstances get her down. She has a great faith.A wonderful, wholesome manga- REALLY funny too- it shows what the power of real-unselfish love can do to change hearts. I only wish more manga were this well done! Yuu Watase draws her characters very beautifully too. If I ever have any children, this is a manga that I could share with them."},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"Imadoki is a very charming story. It bas sweet and charming characters, as well as a very realistic story that, quite literally, thrusts you into the life of Tanpopo (dandelion) Yamazaki (she enters the story by flying over her school gate on her bicycle). It follows her rambunctiuos and often hilairous antics as she becomes a student at a wealthy high school in Tokyo, wher she is called weed by the rich students there. Tanpopo doesn't fit in; she isn't from a wealthy family, her looks are average, and she's not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree. However, Tanpopo does have something that the other students don't-- she has unstopable optimism and a loving, forgiving heart. She almost immediatly decides that she wants the most prestigous and wealthy student of them all-- the handsome but cold Koki Kugyo-- to be her first Tokyo friend. She has some ideas of how to do this, but none seem to work--until she decides to create a gardening club (since Koki says that his favorite things in life are plants) that would build their friendship while they plant new life in the gardens together. This plan works (somehow) though only a few students join-- Koki, who finds her upbeat and incredibly optimistic lifestyle refreshing compared to the other \\"fake\\" students, mean and controlling \\"Tsuki \\" Saionji, computer geek and psychopath (but generally nice guy)Aoi Kyogoku, and pregnant but caring party girl Arisa Uchimura. As this fearsome fivesome get closer, Tanpopo slowly falls in love with Koki, but koki's family have some \\"issues\\" they need to get through first-- including a lovely fiancee for Koki to one day marry. I like this story--it focuses no some very serious issues, such as underage drinking, bullying, and pregnancy. However, most of the story is very cheerful and funny (it's about gardening for pete's sake...), which is strange for a story written by Yu Watase. I higly recommend this read. Very cute."},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"Imadoki! is one of those rare mangas you will encounter. Though it is a typical high school story it is more. It is about friendship, determination, courage, and most of all love. Yamazaki Tanpopo enters Meio Academy where everyone is rich and snubs her. She being a middle-class person tries to befriend the \\"lord\\" of the school Kugyou Koki. B/c he wants nothing to do with her, Tanpopo starts up the gardening committee. Gradually Koki's barriers around his heart are broken and he becomes her friend. They are joined by other students slowly, and little by little Tanpopo has an impact on their life as do they on her.I must say Imadoki is probably one of the most hilarious mangas I have read. I found myself laughing almost every page--mainly because of the character \\"Flippy\\" but also because of how naive Tanpopo is. But I love her...she is a strong, determined, couragous girl who puts friendship before anything else.My friend and I went shopping and she bought this. Reading the back of the book, the plot sounded dull and I totally dissed it...but I found scanlations of it and read it out of curiousity and ended up loving it sooo much I just had to buy it in actual book form. And so far out of all the Yuu Watase manga I've read, this is probably my favorite.So if you are a fan of shoujo manga pick this up (its only 5 volumes) and join in on the fun in Imadoki! I'm sure you'll be laughing really hard but yet be touched by this wonderful tale."},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"The girl from a middle-class family going to a school populated with rich students is a classic shoujo plotline. She suffers horrible abuse, but still somehow ends up with the guy. Series like &quot;Hana Yori Dango&quot; (Boys Over Flowers) is one of the better known varieties of this story.In &quot;Imadoki&quot; the big difference from the formula is that the main character, Tanpopo, is utterly clueless to some of the taunts and pranks. She doesn't get depressed or plot revenge. She's more concerned with the flowers she planted outside the school building.This title reminded me of &quot;Pollyanna&quot; in some respects. Tanpopo is almost always cheerful and when another character tells her that she will be Tanpopo's bitter rival for the affection of the male love interest, Tanpopo reacts by saying, &quot;Seeing the real you is so cool!&quot; And, like in &quot;Pollyanna,&quot; I can actually see her approach working with other students. She's gradually winning folks over. I'm sure she'll end up on the top of the heap by the end of the series and will have changed the fabric of the school's interpersonal politics by the end.Still, it's a standard formula, and unless I see some deviation or more interesting character development by the second book, I don't know if I'll read it past that point."},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"Imadoki has become one of my all time favorite graphic novels. Along with the beautiful art of Yuu Watase we are led into a fantastic world of rich kids where money and family background means everything. For the honest and bubbly Tanpopo, this is a great chance to make new friends. Unfortunately she is met with many troubles along the way as she slowly breaks down the stoic barriers of several very quirky students. Together their experiences lead them into what true friendship is in days like this, allowing them to put aside their bizarre differences and create lasting friendships. I'm especially fond of the theme of flowers that ties this whole story together. The main characters name, Tanpopo, translates as Dandelion, and she uses the love of flowers and act of caring for them to help her make her own friends. It's beautiful to see how her and her friends all blossom together. ^^"},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"I mean, it sounded kind of corny, you know? Wanting to be friends with a guy so you create a planting club? But I had seen some of Yu Watase's work and I decided to go ahead and give this one a try. It was hilarious! and you end up completely involved in the characters and plot line.Basically, this story is about a girl who gets into a rich kids private school. She doesn't really fit in, but on her first day at the school she meets a guy who seems like he would make a good friend. But when she sees him around other people, he's a completely different person! Tanpopo (the main character) is then determined to break through his cold persona and in the process makes a few friends along the way.I honestly can't wait for the next one to come out!"},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"I love Yu Watase... Rather Fushigi Yugi was one of my favorite things ever. It was the first anime series I ever saw, and it's probably at number one for me. Since, I have avoided some of her manga- Alice 19th and Ceres. The reason, I don't have a lot of money. And those series are probably exceptionally wonderful, but they are all really long. When I was researching Imadoki, I found that it only has something like, 6 volumes, so I thought, \\"I will give you a chance!\\" I picked up the first volume, and read the remaining available ones in less than a week. I love Yu Watase's writing style, her plots, and her characters. Things may seem reincarnated, and you might notice some character similarities through out her works, but Imadoki is still really good. It's her first \\"school\\" drama, so, it has a lot of new things that some of the others do not have. And in comparison, it's a very fulfilling series as compared to Fruits Basket. Don't get me wrong- I LOVE Fruits Basket... but it keeps you on edge. There are so many love intrests, but NOTHING EVER HAPPENS! Just a lot of people blushing, and awkward moments. So it's very refreshing to read along side Fruits Basket.But if you know nothing of Yu Watase, or Fushigi Yugi, Imadoki is about a country girl, Tanpopo, coming to an elite school in the city. She sneaks in to the school, and meets the son of the head family, and they share a moment. But the next day at school, he's all mean, and ignores her. And so the whole school makes fun of her, and decides to target her, and they do awful things. So, the first volume is her overcoming her peers torture and finding out what's up with that boy, and making him her friend no matter what! It's a good story, and it just gets better and better!"},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"But for Tanpopo Yamazaki, it could be hell. The students are all from wealthy families and got to the elite Meio Academy via family connections. To them, she is a weed, as her name suggests (Dandelion). Will she be able to make freinds? Why is she so clueless and cheerful? Is the tiny fox, who is her pet, some kind of alien?Funny, delightful, but not really anything to bring it out from the rest of the shojo. I might continue with the series or not - I don't see it being a MUST."},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"Although this book is not like all her other books with magic and stuff, this book is incredibly good!! It shows how life actually feels like when you are left out. This book is full of comedies and emotions. Reading the first book makes you wanting for more. This book is excellent for everyone(that's what I think)!! You just gotta read this book!!"},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"When I read this I thought it was ok...Usually while reading a manga, I dread it when I'm on my last pages. That means I'll have to wait for the next volume, and there's always a cliffhanger.But in this manga I couldn't wait to get finished with it. I mean I was only half way through it, by an hour. When things go slow like that I'm not enjoying it.Perhaps I don't think it's that great because I'm comparing it to her other popular series (Ayashi no Ceres, Fushigig Yugi, Alice 19th) which I do enjoy reading.And in this one, there's no magic or any sorts like that. Ah well...I'm sure her next new exciting series will be good.Some manga readers may like it, and some may not."},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"I'd like to say....Yuu Watase San definitely created another work of genius....though this is a very short manga series with only 5 volumes....it's content is different like the previous reviwers mentioned above....it's a different spin from what all her other works have been so far....yet....only someone who have an open mind to accept the change in style can fully appreciate this work by such a well loved creator of this genre of manga....If it's only solely fantasy you are after then you are not fit to be considered open minded and I suggest you to not even bother reading this and get dissappointed in the end....A true genius in the sense of the word for an author of any genre is someone who can make a change of scenes story and plot and character wise and still have the same effect brought out in his or her work....To fully understand I suggest as the other reviewers already suggest to read the other works by Yuu Watase San and keep an open mind before reading this series...."},{"Title":"Imadoki!

Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"I absolutely LOVE Imadoki! It is only five volumes, and completely worth the time! The characters are hillarious, sweet, and worth thinking about. I will always be happy that I picked it up. Watase never fails to make me smile!!"},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"This is a review for the entire manga series.The mangaka Yuu Watase has definitely made some great manga, but a lot of them tend to be a bit tragic so I was a bit hesitant to try Imadoki!, but I'm glad it didn't turn out to to be tragic but still had the same feel of Yuu Watase's other manga.Imadoki! is about a girl, Tanpop, who just moved from home in the country to attend a prestigious academy in Tokyo. Before the first day of school she runs into a boy, Koki Kugyo, who has a love for plants. The next day she meets the same boy but he acts coldly to her and she soon discovers that he is the heir to a prominent and wealthy family. Angered, Tanpop swears that he'll be her first friend in Tokyo. She creates a gardening club in the hopes that Koki would want to join since he loves plants. The manga series is about Tanpop's interactions with Koki as well as her interactions with the other students as she tries to make friends. But it's difficult since she's hated as she isn't wealthy like the other students.Although it doesn't sound like anything special, Imadoki! was a heartwarming manga and I really loved Tanpop's character. Despite everything she's been through, she never lets any of the bullying get to her and was a very strong person (although ditzy at times). I loved all the other characters and besides Koki, Tanpop makes three other close friends who are just as lovable and I always love a close-knit group of friends.The story was sweet, realistic and funny. It also taught a lot of important lessons. I was swept away with the story and didn't notice the time pass by. It also had no annoying cliff-hangers at the end of volumes. Imadoki! is a manga I would definitely recommend to any shoujo lover. So make sure to check it out when you have the chance and any other of Yuu Watase's work!"},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"I've read (and own) all of Watase's translated novels that are currently out (July 2004) and I must say that reading Imadoki is definitly a disappointment compared to Watase's other novels. All Watase's other novels captured me within the first novel and sent me begging for more because of the creative storylines, universal themes, and believible characters, but Imadoki lacks all of these along with a missing major conflict. First off, Tanpopo (protagonist of Imadoki)is flat with a positive, naive attitude which misses the realism of negative features in her personality . Another negative feature of the protagonist's bubbly attitude is that it provides no REAL conflict in the novel. The supposed conflict is of Tanpopo's struggle to make friends in her new school where everyone's a snob. But there really is no conflict because the protagonist is so naive she doesn't realise her conflict and makes friends anyway. Because there isn't a struggle in the novel so far, there's no hook that captures the reader and leaves them wanting more.Another great setback of this novel is that it's not a fantasy like Watase's other works so the plot (there's a plot?) is further bored down.If you haven't read an Yu Watase novels yet, I recommend Alice 19th, Ceres, or Fushigi Yugi instead of Imadoki. These are all captivating (even though all have a love triangle in them which is so obvious you can tell who the heroine ends up with without a brain) :P."},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"Very cute series and very hillarious. Gosh, high school can be so cruel sometimes truthfully I think tanpopo is a ditz but she has a little spunk in her.

Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"i thought IMADOKI! was a great book. i love the drawings and i think that the story is well written. i love Tanpopo Yamazaki being so optimistic about everything but i dont really like the fact that Koki Kugyu is rude during school and nice outside of school. but everything comes together and it is a really great book."},{"Title":"Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1: Dandelion","review":"Excuse me for abbreviating in the title; I am not Japanese, but I like to pretend I am ;)As for Imadoki, the main reason I wanted it was definitely because of who wrote and drew it. I love FY and Alice (can't say I care too much for Ceres, though), so I definitely wanted to try Imadoki. I don't think I can say definitely how I feel about this series, since vol. 1 is the only one out, but even though it is wonderfully drawn, and Poplar the fox is adorable (awwwwww), I did not feel the same way I felt after reading her previous books. Maybe I was having an off day, but I didn't really laugh at the comical moments (there were some, right?), and I felt disturbed by Tanpopo's character. She's like a creepy combination of Miaka, Usagi Tsukino, and a patient fresh into a loony bin. Her personality was scary. &#62;_&#60;The other characters also didn't bode well with me. I know that the personalities of the characters make a point about the school, but the only thing I really liked about the main guy Koki is that he's hot, and I have a thing for Alice's Kyou. If this is supposed to be a romance series like her other works, I hope Watase got around to introducing it in the remaining four books. I just hope it's nothing like the romance between Aya (ughh) and Toya (Mr. Personality himself).But if your main attraction to manga is the art, I recommend it! If it's story, I'll say 3 stars, because the story could make more sense than it does now. Characters are 2 and a half, the one I like most being the pet fox. ;) The cover art is attractive, too.And check out her other books if you haven't! Just be patient with Viz (grrr)."},{"Title":"Canek: History and Legends of a Maya Hero","review":"Read this book, when I was too young to understand the real meaning...

The writers bring us the dramatic history and culture of the expansive country of Tibet through the personal oddyssey of the amazing Ani Pachen. An early surprise is learning about the day-to-day life of a Tibetan town and its culture prior to the Chinese invasion. Quite poignant is the Tibetan perspective of the Chinese Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. Far from being merely a catalogue of the long string of horrific abuses on the part of her captors, Donnelley sensitively narrates the details of Ani Pachen's 21-year imprisonment and torture by weaving the narrative with the gems of Ani's faith. While it is emotionally-draining, the reader is provided opportunities to regain strength. You cannot avoid being deeply moved by the power of this woman and her fellow Tibetans -- and moved to help save her culture. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"Ani Pachen &amp; Adelaide Donnelly (2000), Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior-Nun, New York: Kodansha International, pp 293. Foreword by the Dalai Lama and preface by Richard Gere.Some people live lives of such difficulty and suffering that it is hard to imagine how they carry on. Other people live lives in which they inflict so much suffering and difficulty that it is hard to imagine how they carry on. This book is a story of both kinds of lives.It is primarily the story of Ani Pachen: a Tibetan woman born to a privileged life who lost everything when the Chinese invaded, became a resistance leader, was captured, tortured and endured 21 years of horrific imprisonment. When finally released she took part in protest movements before fleeing to India where she became a nun.It is also a larger story of the Tibetan people and their Chinese oppressors. Invaded, oppressed, mistreated and murdered, the Tibetan people have endured for almost half a century their own holocaust in which 1 million of their 6 million people have been killed. This book puts a personal face on their suffering. As such it is a moving monument to the courage and forbearance of a person and a people. A moving foreword by the Dalai Lama and an equally moving preface by Richard Gere add further perspectives to the book. As Richard Gere concludes \\"May this book help to dispel the darkness of this darkest night of Tibetan history and be of benefit to all beings everywhere. May the hearts of our Chinese brothers and sisters be opened and may they quickly come to their senses.\\""},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"Sorrow Mountain is both a novel and a woman's life story. As Adelaide Donnelley explains in an afterword, &quot;It is as much narrative as strict biography.&quot; Stories of the &quot;life&quot; of Ani Pachen, including her spiritual power to transcend torture and twenty-one years of imprisonment, and to transform destruction into hope, were the BASIS for this remarkable book. Ani Pachen wanted to be a nun, living peacefully and not killing (many Tibetan people have a religious calling); the circumstances of her birth forced her to become a warrior against the Chinese (again, this echoes the history of those of her generation). Captured, imprisoned, and tortured, she preserved her spiritual beliefs and her integrity (again, read the story of many her generation; the difference is that so many did not survive). Ani Pachen survived, made it to Dharamsala, and finally lives a life of meditation and spiritual focus. Thousands of Tibetans have escaped; many of those now live in northern India with His Holiness. The spiritual example they set: certainty of impermanence, compassion, forgiveness, and detachment--works for everyone on the planet. All of this matters.But there is something more which matters. This book, like the story of its subject, transcends and crosses boundaries: in form, in approach. It is a novel, a spiritual guidebook, a history of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism. The tone is mythic: &quot;My country was once at the roof of the world, a place where the great spirits lived.&quot; The tone is cinematic: &quot;In a darkened corner of my mind, a small patch of green appears. I watch it grow brighter, larger, until a vast green meadow stretches out at my feet. The meadow is dotted with clusters of flowers and is treeless, except for a willow or two.&quot; The tone is intensely personal, acutely descriptive: in prison, &quot;The lice were so bad that I could see them crawling all over the heads in front of me. So thick I could sweep them off with my hand and not make a difference in their numbers.&quot;The story is woven of dreams, memories, Buddhist teachings, horrors re-lived or imagined, and above all details that give it taste, sound, texture, and breath. As a work of art, it breaks all prior boundaries and should be studied by all writers who ever consider telling life stories--their own or anyone else's. If there is any drawback to the book, it is only that we cannot know what is Ani Pachen's voice and what is Adelaide Donnelley's. A Buddhist would assure us that the illusion of separation is unimportant, temporary, superficial. A Buddhist would tell us that Ani Pachen's story, and Adelaide Donnelley's storytelling genius, have become one voice for all of us. As the editor of another woman's life story, I come to this book to learn. I look back at my work and see how much trouble I took to leave Mpho Nthunya's voice exactly as it was, to be merely a secretary, taking dictation from her. I tried to keep my white privilege and sensibility out of the way of her African experience and her African ways of seeing. I think that was a good thing to do. But I deeply admire the merging of voices in the Pachen/Donnelley collaboration. It is a miracle to read, to study, to learn from. I am deeply grateful for it."},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"Need a reality check? Feeling sorry for your life?

I guarantee it will become your Sorrow Mountain too."},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"The story of Ani Pachen resonates with the kind of courage and spiritual certainty that perhaps very few of us our capable, but all of us admire. In contrast to her indomitable strength, the Chinese occupation of Tibet takes on outrageous dimensions -- an ugliness and brutality hard to bear. For one nine-month period during her twenty-one years of imprisonment, Ani Pachen endured a dark, earthen cell slightly larger than her body where she spent her time praying, accomplishing one hundred thousand prostrations devoted to the well-being of all. When released by the Chinese, she took up the cause of a free Tibet in Lhasa, demonstrating against the torture and murder of her people and country, putting herself in the greatest possible peril. Ani Pachen has lived at the very depths of the soul and sorrow of Tibet and emerged triumphant, a woman of compassion and beauty who will inspire all who read her magnificent story."},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"Ani Panchen, the only daughter of a Tibetan Cheiftan was looking forward to a life of contemplation after narrowly escaping an arranged marriage.

Living from day to day with the hope that in time she will meet with his Holiness the Dalai Lama. Her courage &amp; spirit to fight &amp; survive are astounding. This is her testimony for all the thousands of political prisoners still being held in Chinese prisons for 'crimes' such as 'waving a Tibetan flag' or shouting for independence.This book is another blot on China's human rights record.

This book will inspire everyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"When I first held this book in my hand, I was captivated by the picture of a Tibetan woman's face that measured less than a half inch square on the book's cover. Who is this Ani Pachen? I asked myself. And what bliss lies on the other side of Sorrow Mountain that she wears it so? This beautiful face shines with such a radiance of love and enlightenment, that I carry it now in my mind and heart. One afternoon when I was sitting in my recliner halfway dozing off, as I was recovering from a minor accident which was more painfull than serious, I held the book up and said to my wife, &quot;I've only managed to read six pages.&quot; Which brought me not quite to page 100. The next morning I held the book again before her and said, &quot;I could not have survived what this woman has. I'm not sure I've ever known anyone who could have.&quot; I held my emotions in check, as I had cried the night before, when I turned the final pages. My wife looked at the book and said, &quot;You've never read a book that fast before.&quot; This was not far from true. I spoke briefly about the book and then I spoke my heart aloud. &quot;I know we have no money, but I feel compelled to do something for the people of Tibet.&quot; If this review resonates with your heart, then I have made a start. As someone who loves the Chinese people and culture, it was difficult for me to read about the atrocities committed against the Tibetan people during the Cultual Revolution. After watching her homeland destroyed and her people murdered, after enduring 21 years of torture and imprisonment, Ani Pachen's message is pure, as she prays for an end to all human suffering."},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"I just finished reading this book and didn't want to put it down. The story of Ani Pachen is both horrifying and inspiring, how she against all odds not only survived but kept her faith, battling against her own anger at her captors to try to reach a higher spirit of generosity. The writing of Adelaide Donnelley is gorgeous and poetic, capturing the inner spirit and the mystical beauty of the land in words that lift this book to a high literary level.

It is a book of truth, compassion and human sacrifice. I am deeply impressed by the writers and the story that Ani Pachen told. Her life story can only be slightly imagined, but to have been experienced by a human being, it devalues the human race.Ani Pachen is a true believer of the Buddhist religion. I admire her strength in believing in the Buddha. No matter how difficult her life was, and the kind of horrors that she had to go through, she never waivered her belief. Her people, friends, and Mother, all died in the hand of Mao's communist. But her religion allowed her to live a collected life.Ani Pachen's tragic life is the ultimate test of the Buddha. She was stripped to nothing. She accepted her life as the karma that she accumulated.I think this book is the Bible of Buddhism."},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"Whether it is the plains of frozen Siberia in the Soviet Union or green pastures of Oswiecim in Poland, better (or worse for that matter) known as Aushwitz - history has been brutally repeating itself in the mountainous hights of Tibet in the current decades, outplaying itself right in front of our own opened (or shut) eyes.This time the Red Chinese yet again dramatize the same vile and satanic scenario - ruthless homicide, destruction of an ancient culture of highest value to the humankind, brutal denial and annihilation of one of the most profound religious creeds of this planet, and thus prove and warn of their continuing disregard for all life.If there is a difference, and an uplifting one, between the crematoriums of Aushwitz and those exiled who died in Syberia and that of the Tibetan destruction - the Tibetans uniquely defy their oppressors in life and death through their high and most advanced religious beliefs and their practice thereof.The warrior nun is the most beautiful example of this truth - thanks to her sublime spiritual background and training, as well as a lifelong following of the holy example of lamas and gurus of her indomitable nation - she does have the truths of reincarnation and karma not only in her vocabulary but first of all in the deepest depths of her heart.Such spiritual aristocracy is supremely prepared to face satanic oppressors with the legendary Chinese torturous twist. She has the unique mental and spiritual wherewithal to be able to suffer, survive and conquer. She has the body, sustained through her happy childhood on the best diets of the advanced eastern adepts, and the mind trained to perfection by the Buddhic practices of her holy faith, to be able to come out of the 21 years of the Communist hell and continue her life and service to the cause of freedom at the feet of the Dalai Lama in his (and hers) forced exile in India.This book is a must reading for all informed and open-eyed Western readers - those who see the signs of the times and wish to do something about the probability, if not possibility, of the Tibetan scenario repeating itself in the West. Beware of the complacency and comfortability of our times - Ani Pachen, though raised according to the highest aristocratic lifestyle of her beloved Tibet - was never spoiled, indulged in or undisciplined but otherwise supremely prepared to face the challenge.

Deeply personal; deeply moving."},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"If you want to read about how the Chinese government has been committing Tibetan genocide, this is a must read.

It reads as both an historical account of the overthrow of Tibet during the Mao regime, and as a personal narrative. The insight into Tibetan culture, and the damaging effect that the Chinese invasion had on a way of life, was overpowering at times. Although we can be nostalgic about many aspects of the past in any culture, including our own, the effect of the invasion on the ancient Tibetan way of life and Buddhist practices was extremely harsh and sudden. \\"Sorrow Mountain\\" is an apt title, to describe the feeling of what was lost. Hopefully many customs can still be preserved, both within and outside the country. I am thankful that the Dalai Lama and others continue to share the depth of their teachings with the rest of us. It's a pity that there was no political intervention while Tibet was being so irretrievably damaged, including the widespread burning of sacred texts and the destruction of holy relics that were hundreds (or even thousands) of years old. The loss of life paralleled that of the Holocaust. It is remarkable how \\"blind\\" political leaders can be when it is expedient. I was profoundly moved by this story, and would expect it to have a similar effect on many other readers."},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"This book tells the remarkable story of Ani Panchen, a Tibetan nun, who led the resistance to the ruthless Red Chinese occupation of Tibet, after her father's death in 1958.For 21 years she was imprisoned in hellish Chinese prison camps, only surviving because of her strong will and faith.After her release she continued to lead the struggle against the Red Chinese occupation and genocide of Tibet's people. In 1988 she was forced into exile in India, where she has continued to devote her life to the dream of Tibetan freedom, even after it has been forgotten by the world.She begins by her peaceful childhood in pre-occupation Tibet:In 1950 she describes how \\"Our country was still at peace, though on the eastern bank of the Yangtze River Chinese troops were gathering. In a few short years, they would sweep over my country, changing it forever. In the name of liberating Tibet from 'imperialist' powers they would destroy monasteries, plunder homes, burn sacred texts, and drive our people to poverty and despair.\\"Babies were removed from their parents in their thousands to be relocated to Red Chinese 're-education' centers were they were to be brought up in Communist doctrine. Over a million Tibetans were to be anihilated in the Chinese holocaust that followed, and even the animal life of Tibet destroyed in order to force the Tibetans to give up their reverence for life.Ani Panchen tells of her experiences fleeing from Red Chinese forces, and of seeing small Tibetan children gunned down by Chinese snipers.It also tells of Panchen's deep Tibetan Buddhist faith underpinned by her will to 'Let all beings be free of suffering, let all being find peace.'While the book hopes to expose the horrors of the Chinese destruction of Tibet, in actions paralleling those of the Nazis during World War II, Richard Gere in his forward expresses his wish this book may help to \\"dispel the darkness of this darkest night of Tibetan history and be of benefit to all beings everywhere\\".Will the world re-awaken to the suffering of the Tibetan people mand the destruction of their civilization, and not least their dream of the re-birth of their culture and self-determination."},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"I gave this book four stars because this book is a story that people should know. It is the true story of an amazing Tibetan woman who shows strength and courage in unimaginable situations. My problem with this book is that it is poorly written. It could have been an amazing book as well as an amazing story. \\"Autobiography of a Tibetan Monk\\" by Palden Gyatso is still the best I have read on the Tibetan people."},{"Title":"Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun","review":"One day, the daughter of a Khampa chieftain, seventeen-year-old Ani Lemdha Pachen, ran away from home to avoid marrying. It wasn't that she disapproved of the match her parents' had arranged, but rather that she preferred the cerebral and peaceful world of a Buddhist nun to the physical demands of traditional married life.Runaway Pachen had spent little time at the monastery, before she returned to her parents. Despite the shame of what she had done, they not only forgave her but agreed she would not have to marry. Before she could return to the monastery to complete her training, Pachen's father tells her of their country's dire political situation. The Chinese are coming to \\"liberate\\" them. As a Khampa princess, she will be expected to lead their people through this situation, especially if the Chief should die. So the young lady received a different type of training instead.For all her bravery, Pachen was unable to resist for long. She was captured by the Chinese army and spent 21 years imprisoned. This true story focuses on how Pachen's spirituality kept her hopeful and sane during her confinement and during the many tortures she endured. The book is sprinkled with the Buddhist teachings that helped her maintain both her sanity and will to live through these dark days and features an introduction by the Dalai Lama himself.Apparently Richard Gere also advocated this book's creation and publication. He contributed his own introduction and story of how the book idea was born. He speaks of Pachen's life as a \\"beautiful, disturbing, and deeply inspiring story.\\" He argues that no \\"serious literature\\" in the form of narratives or the \\"Great Tibetan novel\\" had emerged from the \\"Tibetan Holocaust, so a book like this one would be a great boon to the Tibetan cause. Gere, of course, had become a Buddhist and was studying in Tibet at this time.The story's merits include its insights into the life of a Tibetan woman seeking nunhood during the Mao era, it offers inspiration through triumph against extreme adversity, it draws attention to Tibet's political and cultural situation and the ways in which they have suffered in recent history, and it provides lamanistic teachings.Despite Pachen's, Donnelly's, Gere's, the Dalai Lama's, and many others' good intentions, however, this book probably has fallen short of its intended goal. The storyline does little to sustain the reader's interest because it is patchy and doesn't flow well (When Gere called it \\"a miracle of simplicity,\\" he wasn't kidding! Something is clearly lost in translation here.). Although the author supposedly consulted many reliable resources, oddly very little of Pachen's story is put into historical context and few of the sources are used to draw insights into Tibet's situation. Considering the book committee's intentions, I would have expected to find a list of support organizations for Tibet in the appendices. Because of the sketchiness of the writing, it was difficult for me to find the book an inspiration, though other readers might find it so. Those looking for a story of spiritual stamina and female courage may enjoy Pachen's story, while those seeking a new perspective on Tibet should borrow it from a friend or a library rather than spending the money to buy it. Everyone else, just skip it. Sorry Richard, this one's not the great Tibetan novel, either."},{"Title":"The Cape Cod Table","review":"As an old Bostonian and Cape Codder I bought this book for the sumptious cover photograph.

It's a travel journal of all his thoughts and escapades throughout Mexico that bounces haphazardly from topic to topic. The Mexican Night still has Feringhetti's poetic brillance but unfortunately lacks depth in comparison to his other writings. Strangely, the book reflects Kerouac's style with the prose form poetics, but doesn't have the unique poetic precision that is characteristic of Ferlinghetti. Nevertheless, the Mexican Night is a travel journal of a poet. So,the book is not necessarily a poetry book, but a thought journal of a unique poet that will always be a literary great. But the Mexican Night deviates from his usual writings that people would be familiar with. The Mexican Night reflects an interesting versitility of writing style from a exceptional poet. I definately recommend the Mexican Night to the Ferlinghetti enthusiast but not necessarily as an introduction to his writings."},{"Title":"Cold Print","review":"Cold Print contains a number of stories based on and influenced by Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. I find Campbell unique among those writers who have followed in the footsteps of the master of the macabre, and the author's introduction to this volume of short stories is quite illuminating. Campbell based much of his early work on standard Lovecraft themes and styles. Over time, however, he found himself rather frustrated with the types of Cthulhu Mythos stories being written by modern writers, feeling that most of them dealt far too much with the genealogies of the old gods lying outside space and time and concentrated far too much on exaggerations of the writing style of Lovecraft. His insights give me a much greater appreciation of the later works collected here, particularly The Voice at the Beach, of which he seems to be the most proud. Campbell most appreciates Lovecraft's ability to suggest far more than he showed, and in his own emulation of this central theme his later works strike some, such as Lovecraft authority Lin Carter, as insufficiently Lovecraftian. While other writers have expended a great amount of effort filling in the gaps of Lovecraft's list of monsters and otherworldly forces, Campbell has tried to dramatically expand the original vision of the Mythos.The progression of Campbell's writing is easy to discern in these pages. The oldest of these fifteen stories, dating back to the 1960s, are grounded in the traditional Lovecraftian universe. What you find here are dark, corrupted churches where dark deeds have shunned the light of Christianity, ancient, reptilian gods buried deep in the ground struggling to reemerge with the help of frightening acolytes, lives preserved for hundreds of years by means of secret rites best left undiscovered, frightening journal accounts of hideous revelations leading to the ultimate sacrifice of those who stumbled upon ancient knowledge accidentally, a plethora of references to dark tomes such as the Revelations of Glaaki, and explorations of obscure references to the insect-beasts from Shaggai and entities such as the blind god Azathoth and Daoloth, the Render of the Veils.Eventually, the stories began to change as Campbell sought new inspiration from the Mythos in the 1970s and 1980s. Among the Pictures Are These, for example, is not a story at all, but rather a description of a number of dark sketches drawn by the author in his youth. The Tugging is built around the sharing of dark dreams by father and son, and an esoteric calling from the dream world that determines the protagonist's thoughts and movements. The Faces at Pine Dunes remains firmly entrenched in modernity, as a young man seeks to understand his parents' incessant traveling and, more importantly, their decision to remain outside the dark woods of Pine Dunes; the story's culmination before a bog from which a gurgling, mud-drenched entity emerges betokens a human's return to that which lies outside more than an invasion of unworldly forces striving to regain control over our world. The Voice of the Beach is clearly the most important story to be found here. A cursory reading results in disappointment because it mentions nothing about Old Ones or dark grimoires filled with forbidden writing, nor does it showcase the type of all-pervasive menace Lovecraft constructed his dark tales around. A rereading of the book's introduction, however, allows one to place the story in the context of Campbell's unique vision. This remarkably new and abstract form of Lovecraftian art betrays hidden wonders writhing below a surface seldom scratched by other writers in the field.I actually enjoy reading Mythos tales told in the traditional vein, and for this reason I find Campbell's earlier stories much more fun to read than his more esoteric, later ones. However, I am much more impressed by the later tales reflecting a totally new type of storytelling based on the original influence of Lovecraft. Campbell's criticism of those who search for the heart of Lovecraft and the Mythos in genealogies of the Ancient Ones and in the traditional writing style of the Cthulhuian canon, refusing to consider untraditional stories such as those Campbell has contributed, is very telling, enlightening, and inspiring, and I for one can only praise Campbell for the groundbreaking contributions he has made in the field of Lovecraft-influenced horror."},{"Title":"Cold Print","review":"Ramsey Campbell's stories are an important contribution to the development of the mythology begun by Lovecraft and continued by Derleth and others. Rather than pastiche well-developed Lovecraftian entities and places, Campbell takes the core ideas (ancient survivals, subterranean catacombs, monstrous gods of old, etc.) and builds a parallel, contemporary mythology of his own. This one is set in the forests, lakes, and beaches of Britain, different books of horror such as \\"The Revelations of Glaaki\\", and different beings of power, such as Eihort and Y'Golonac.Campbell's tales are inherently Lovecraftian, but the different context creates a new flow to the stories. Lovecraft's back-atmosphere is Puritan New England; Campbell's back-atmosphere is Celts and Druids - the same, but different. Lovecraft looked at the pre-modern with both deisre and horror; Campbell makes you look at the modern in the same way. I think that he particularly inspires a certain revulsion to the body (think \\"Before the Storm\\" and \\"The Faces at Pine Dunes\\").The works included here are some of Campbell's best, and have certainly been drawn on most heavily by others writing in the Cthulhu mythos. The list includes \\"The Insects from Shaggai\\", \\"The Inhabitant of the Lake\\", \\"Before the Storm\\", \\"Cold Print\\", \\"The Tugging\\", and \\"The Faces at Pine Dune.\\" I was disappointed to see that \\"The Franklyn Paragraphs\\" was not included. Much of Ramsey Campbell's Lovecraftian fiction is being reprinted by Chaosium, but it is done, unfortunately, in a piecemeal fashion. This is probably the best collection that you can still find."},{"Title":"Cold Print","review":"Ramsey Campbell was a boy who loved Lovecraft's works and started to write stories set in Lovecraft's world of Elder Gods, zombies and ancient powers. While he went off to create and write about his own horrors and world this book, Cold Print, is many of the short stories he wrote based on Lovecraft's universe. But he just didn't copy old stories and monsters that Lovecraft designed. He expanded on the myths and legends, adding his own creatures, worlds and images, giving us more without taking away from the mystery and delight of the unknown darkness that swam just beyond our sight.I bought the book for one of the short stories, The Insects from Shaggai, but found all the stories worth reading. Mr. Campbell not only builds on the works of Lovecraft but also starts to use his older stories as history to create the foundation for other stories. New or used, this book is a great find."},{"Title":"Cold Print","review":"Ok so Campbell has been described as M R James for the nineties but his Lovecraft is pretty good too. Actually this book makes a great introduction to Lovecraft whose prose can often be quite dense and off putting for the beginner. Campbells tales are hit and miss but mostly hits, especially the eerie 'Inhabitant of the Lake' which definately got my pulse racing.Alot of the stories are set around the same area, the rather creepy town of Brichester (fabricated) which adds a nice touch of familiarity. Ok so his descriptions can often make you leap back into reality with a smile on your face due to their excess but this is lovecraft territory and Campbell adds this well-written and often terrifying novel to the genre. Nice one!"},{"Title":"Cold Print","review":"What do I like about this book.Well to put it simply the tales.Or should I say the ideas and how he puts them across.Ok so the monster's description's are lacking but you try to describe(or spell) an amorphous gelatinous blob with the odd tenticle and see how you fare.Each tale is different but sticks to premise that the people in the tales all die,or some run screaming and die.Or run screaming and end locked up in a padded cell.Though surprisingly a few do survive but none are left unchanged,some times both mentally and physicly.Such as Roy leakey who &quot;became like them&quot;.One tale has a bit of a ironic streak in it (to me any way!),which is the Will of Stanley Brooke.The essential tales to read are The Insects from Shaggai,The Inhabitant of the lake,The Moon Lens,and Cold Print. All right,with those essential Mytho's tale's I'll just cheack my many misspelling's(not too many this time)then leave you."},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"This is Spenser and crew at their best.

When Belson's young bride Lisa disappears, he talks with Spenser with nothing resolved. The stakes are dramatically increased when Belson is shot three times in the back and is in critical condition in the hospital. When he regains consciousness, Belson asks for Spenser and requests that he find her.Spenser's search takes him to California where he reconnects with Chollo, a Spanish- speaking gunner that he needs as backup as Hawk is in Burma. Wisecracking as always with references to literature and aspects of pop culture, Spenser follows the trail as it leads him through Lisa's sordid past of drug use, prostitution and destructive love affairs. My favorite reference is on page 72 where Spenser asks a female professor what she is doing in her position. Her response is \\"I came for the waters\\" and Spenser replies with \\"There are no waters here\\" and her final reply is \\"I was misinformed.\\" Right out of the great movie \\"Casablanca\\" starring Humphrey Bogart.Although the climactic rescue is very tense and gripping, the lack of fundamental honor among criminals leaves a bad taste in Spenser's mouth as the kidnapper turns out to be nothing more than a man with too much lonely little boy in him."},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"I believe I've read all of his books and I've been obsessed with the Spenser series.

Her resume isn't what it said it was, and this all leads Spenser through a history of prostitution, alcoholism, and more, and leads his associates to a show down in the Hispanic turf wars in the barrio.Throughout this story, Spenser peppers the reader with his famous snappy banter, such as: \\"Henry Cimoli had been a ranked lightweight until Willie Pep urged him into the health club business by knocking him out in the first round of both fights. It was a lesson in the difference between good and great.\\" In describing Homicide Commander Martin Quirk: \\"He was always quiet, except when he got mad, then he was quieter.\\" In describing a lush cop: \\"with a lot of broken blood vessels in his cheeks, and an ugly red vinyl hairpiece on top of his head. It didn't match his sideburns, but it probably wouldn't have matched anyone's sideburns except maybe Plastic Man's.\\" And in describing himself: \\"I took a shower and put on one of the terrycloth robes the hotel provided.

THIN AIR is relatively original because Hawk isn't in it, and also because Spenser has an interesting new Latino sidekick.

Hawk is off somewhere while Spenser tries to track down Belson's lost wife. She of course has been abducted by someone addicted to her. Spenser of course has to barge in and rescue her, with the help of Chollo.The book was written from two sides - Lisa's and Spenser's. The back and forth was not always smooth, which is why the live version worked better. Chollo, from California, was actually a fun replacement for Hawk - he brought his own style of wisecracking and humor. Susan's become quite tolerable at this point, which can only be a good thing.I've actually driven past this area of Massachusetts, tho I didn't feel like driving into it to find the buildings mentioned :).

Among the first things that Spenser discovers is that Lisa St. Claire is not her name. Apparently she has lived a rather checkered past - Spenser worries that telling Belson this will not be a favor at all. Finally following a trail to Proctor, well North of Boston, Spenser calls on Chollo (from L.A.) to come East and lend his assistance, since Proctor is mostly Latino and Spenser hopes Chollo's presence will help grease the wheels, so to speak. Things quickly go from bad to worse and before he knows it, Spenser goes from a simple job of tracking down a missing wife, to overthrowing a local government.Definitely an edge-of-your seat book, this one alternated between Spenser's POV and Lisa's - the chapters where we hear Lisa's voice are all in italics and, unlike the main body of the book, stated in third person rather than first - which definitely fits in with the concept, as her abductor dehumanizes her by constantly filming her and playing back the films in her room. It was an interesting way to differentiate between the characters and I think it worked nicely.This was a great chapter in the Spenser series - too bad I didn't get it reviewed in the proper order.

Especially rewarding is the re-introduction of Cholla who we met briefly in &quot;Stardust&quot;.Parker varies his narrative style this time out. The perspective switches back and forth between the victim Lisa, who's police detective Belson's young wife, and Spenser, so we can see when Spenser gets on the wrong track and when he gets back on the right one.This isn't quite the best Parker, but it's good and worth your while if you're a Spenser fan."},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"When a great writer dramatizes trapped helplessness, I'm ready to eject.

I began clutching to hope for Frank to keep faith that Lisa wouldn't have left him willingly. I'm glad Parker didn't push the potential of dark tragedy of a soul drop like that. He worked the question just enough to rush the realism, then allow it to simmer under the diligence of \\"Keep the faith, baby.\\"I won't go into detail about why Frank turned over the search to Spenser, and why Spenser went to Chollo instead of Hawk, for the first time in a rescue partnership.

Dialogue scenes were evenly effervescent, with just the right amount of fizz to counter the interjections of ongoing Italicized segments. I was intrigued with the subtle shifts in patterns-of-psychosis of Lisa and her captor, as each seemed to be enduring an individual \\"cathexis\\" ... New word, probably brought into psychological jargon through the same sewer-line-purge-tank as \\"catharsis\\" ... Look up the original meaning of that one! \\"Cathexis\\" was brought into the plot by Madeline St. Claire, the current plot's previous psychiatrist for Lisa, as a sample of Lisa's uneven vocabulary expansion through reading a plethora of self-help books (too many, too indiscriminately, according to Madeline).Lisa's attempts to retain a recently seated kernel of healthy self served as an effective drama for exposing the visceral levels of retention-and-resurgence of psychological growth.Dictionary entry for Nexus: 1 - a connection. 2 - a connected group or series. 3 - the central and most important point. -ORIGIN Latin, from nectere 'bind'.A bad nexus would ultimately require a cathexis. Get yours here!Throughout the plot, I was led by the nose with curiosity about how and if Frank and Lisa would be reunited, hopefully at that central and most important point, which I was guessing would be a clean type of Love (considering Spenser's Romantic soul).Also found another key passage in THIN AIR, which exposed another appeal of this series:>> \\"You big with the bad guys, Spenser. You got Santiago helping you, Mr. Del Rio helping you, now this guy Broz, that I don't know, he's helping you. You sure you are a good guy?\\" \\"No,\\" I said. I'm not sure.\\" &lt;&lt;A nice collection of profound quotes could be lifted out of THIN AIR, from Spenser's ruminations discriminating the good in bad guys. Another collection of artistic quotes could be lifted from Spenser's observations of physical settings, weather machinations, and environmental pathos. I'll speak this softly and with conviction, \\"This is Good Literature.\\"After finishing this novel, I saw not only why Parker brought Chollo in as Spenser's partner instead of Hawk: The nationality fit the situation. I also saw Parker, a WASP macho male, chef and sensitive guy, as a literary ambassador for the menage of sub-cultural minorities which came to the fore through Media Massages and marked-up messages, from the mid 1970's to the present time. Purposely or not, Parker evolved and designed Spenser for the job of providing missing links between good and evil, and connecting lines of cultural differences, allowing polarities to cathexis, gradually purifying their \\"acts.\\" We ain't there yet, but Spenser's a good scout.This was primely-done detective fiction, with trailing ridges of psychological plummets and literary finesse carefully eased out of Spenser's closet ...

The story line is tired and the plot could have been drawn from a medicore remedial high school student. More than likely this is my first and last Parker (written book?) book. Who writes a good mystery?"},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"More plot to this novel ~ more detecting too ~ than some other Spenser stories. Still, plot is not everything, and still not the real reason one reads Parker. The interplay between Spenser and Susan is as strong as ever; Hawk is in Burma ~ don't ask ~ so we miss seeing him and Spenser. There is a Hawk replacement in the person of Chollo, a Latino hit-man from one of Spenser's West Coast connexions and, while not as detailed or intricate as the Hawk conversations, his with Spenser are still pleasurable. The pretext for the action this time is the disappearance of Lisa St. Claire, wife of Spenser's Boston PD friend Frank Belson. When Belson is hit with three shots from behind Spenser activates himself and goes hunting. The trail leads to a Hispanic community in northern Massachusetts ~ hence the introduction of the Latino side-kick. A welcome innovation (from Parker, not for fiction as a whole) is the use of third person sections interspersed, in a different type-face, telling of Lisa's experience. We thus are given both the hunter and hunted points of view."},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"In Thin Air, Robert B Parker deviates from his normal mystery format and produces more of a thriller. What happened and who did it is never in question -- the issue is what will happen. While this is being resolved, Parker reveals rich details about the principal characters, keeping the reader engaged throughout the entire book.Viewpoint varies with the primary chapters, as usual in the Spenser series, from the detectives perspective. Between these, the victim Lisa's view is represented. This is quite nicely pulled off.The welcomed trend in the series of deemphasizing the tiresome participation of Susan in the primary plot continues with Thin Air. Additionally, giving a rest to the use of Hawk as a superhero to completely suppress any opposition is also welcomed. While Hawk is a very enjoyable character, he's overused in the books preceding this.So Thin Air is highly recommended. If there is one criticism, some of the action at the end strains credibility to the point of collapse. But the reader is still touched by the result, something which can't often be said for genre work. This book only reinforces my assessment that Parker is an excellent writer.Dan"},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"This one is one of the better installments in the Spenser series. Hawk is not featured, but it was still surprisingly good with the addition of Chollo from California (from a previous story). Why Chollo would be willing to help Spenser fight this fight in Massachusetts was never explained, but it was still fun and effective. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"I like Spenser, almost all books written involving him, Parker does a better job with him than with any of his others. It is only my opinion. Here we have a cop friend of Spenser's who loses his wife. He does not come asking Spenser for help in finding her, it is only when someone tries to put Belson away that Spenser becomes highly active and of course cracks the case. The action is a little different in this book, Hawk is missing and Spenser does no physical heavy hitting to solve the case, this time he uses his mind and a Latino (hispanic) sidekick to invade an ethnic enclave with an Anglo administration, Irish cops, and Latino population with an inferior Barrio population inserted in it. It is this minority Spenser must invade and turn it over to the majority in order to aid his friend Belson. Belson's wife is introduced in third person form and kept separate from what Spenser is doing as the story unravels. Of course this adds to the suspense and I think the book has an awful ending, I feel sorry for the barrio leader but Spenser must make sacrifices to end the story in some sort of a satisfactory way. I woulld not reveal the ending, just read the book and find out for yourself, it is worth it.tags: Parker, Spenser, kidnap, prostitute, drunkard priest"},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"When &quot;Thin Air&quot; begins with the italicized description of a woman bound in the back of a van, abducted by someone who knows her and is videotaping everything, it is reminiscent of Robert B. Parker's &quot;Crimson Joy,&quot; the first Spenser novel to get away from the first person narrative style of the series. When Detective Frank Belson shows up and tells our hero that his wife is gone, we know the identity of the woman in the van. As far as her husband is concerned, Lisa St. Claire has disappeared into &quot;Thin Air&quot; (Parker has been much more mundane with his titles in his recent efforts and it has been years since he started off with any grandiose literary quotations). Each Spenser novel is unique in its own way and for this one the main trick is that we know what has happened to the damsel in distress and we get to watch as our hero gets closer and closer. Belson does not know anything about his wife before the fateful night they met, and, of course, Spenser uncovers a whole lot of information. But what looks like the old story of the beautiful young wife who leaves her older husband is shattered when Belson is ambushed and almost killed.Whereas the previous Spenser novel dealt with Chinatown, &quot;Thin Air&quot; focuses on the Hispanic elements in the greater Boston area, which forces Spenser to use the assistance of Chollo, the enforcer for the L.A. mobster we met in &quot;Stardust&quot; (Hawk is in Burma--the mind boggles). But while most of the usual supporting cast is not around for this one, Spenser certainly meets a couple of interesting women in the course of his investigation (although I find it strange that Quirk is not a lot more involved in this one). Once again Spenser tries to put all the pieces together and then find a way of making everybody happy, but as usual, things never do work out perfectly. While certainly an atypical Spenser novel, &quot;Thin Air&quot; probably grades out as an average effort for Parker"},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"Like most of the Spenser books, this one moves quickly and holds the reader from start to finish. It's always fun when one of the supporting characters needs a helping hand from Spenser. Here we get a glimpse of Belson's life, and his wife's nefarious past. (Jeer within a cheer: Just once, pretty please, I would like to see some female character have a nefarious past that has nothing to do with selling her body. Women do commit other crimes occasionally, at least in the real world.) My biggest problem was poor editing. The resolution was not believable. And the errors in Spanish were an amateurish mistake. It's a good vacation read though."},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"The story takes place in Boston, Massachusetts. The narrator of the story is Spenser, who was hired to find Lisa St. Claire. Spenser is a private detective who used to work for the FBI. He is hired by Frank Belson to find his missing wife who is Lisa St. Claire. Her ex-husband, Luis Deleon, has kidnapped her. Luis is still madly in love with Lisa. But Lisa is in love with Frank, who is much older than she is. Every one assumes she left him because he is much older than she is and that is why a private detective is hire. During the investigation, Spenser found out a lot of personal things about Lisa St. Claire. She was not the person every one thought she is. Her real name was Angela Richard. She ran away from home ever since she was seventeen with her boy friend, Woody. Woody turns her in to a prostitute. One day she got caught and was sent to rehabilitation. There she decided to get her life back on track. Mean while, Frank was shot at on his front porch from behind leaving him in the hospital for a while. Luis had shot him. Luis was known for being a crazy person. He was the leader of a Hispanic gang. Luis was a hard person to find because no one likes to talk about him. She was kept in a castle like place with cameras all around the room recording her every move. Through out the novel it switches back and forth to the scene where Lisa was at and then back to Spenser.I would recommend the novel because I found it very entertaining. It was like watching a movie. I can picture the whole thing. Spenser was very amusing. He was also tough. He states. \\"You'll think I'm offensive? I'll give you offensive. Ms. Lisa St. Claire's husband is a cop. Cops look out for each other. I can, if I have to, have some really short-tempered guys from the Essex County DA's I could probably even get them to come in here in force with the sirens singing and the blue lights flashing, and haul you ass down to Salem and ask you these same questions in a holding cell\\" (60). This quote shows what type of person he is. He can be serious but funny at same time. You can tell he is very serious with his work. He was not a boring guy.This is a good novel if you're into mystery because through out the story you keep finding surprising things about Lisa. It made want to keep reading it. \\"I don't know could or couldn't. I will say that Angela lived a very harsh life, in very difficult circumstances. She had fewer restraint mechanisms perhaps than some women might have, and she harbored a lot of rage\\" (133). Here is when Spenser was meeting up with a woman named Madeline St. Claire. She was a psychiatrist that was seeing Lisa when she was in rehab. She was aware that Lisa was using her name, but did not seem to mind it much. The quote explains how Lisa life was and how she had a rage for men.It was also interesting when Spenser investigate people. It made me seem like I was the investigator. Each interviewer gave helpful facts about Lisa and her whereabouts. There were a lot of people who he had to investigate until he was sure it was Luis who kidnapped her. Each investigation was at a different place. He gave great descriptions when the story takes place. It makes the novel seem so realistic.Overall, I enjoyed reading the novel very much. There were times where I did not want to stop reading because there were things that I wanted to know. This is a great novel for entertainment. It was full of drama and humor. You will like Spenser. It will make reading fun. A great novel to share with a friends or love ones."},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"Good Spencer book; less violent than others. Love listening to the Spencer character audios even though they all have the same theme; person-in-distress, with Spencer/Hawk now Chollo rescuing. This is great w/me as long as Burt Reynolds or David Dukes read. These readers put you right there and make the characters more real. I listen to a lot of mysteries and these readers are among the best."},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"I had never read a Spenser novel before but saw this at a garage sale so figured it was worth a try. As some reviews have mentioned, I see why a first time Spenser reader might be better off starting with an earlier novel. Spenser's' relationships with the recurring characters and his little \\"quirks\\" (like an aversion to caffeine) might have made a bit more sense if I knew the background. However, I did enjoy the book from the level that it was a nice breezy read which kept me hooked me enough to read it over a span of just a few days. The story is very simple and uncomplicated so don't go into this expecting a novel that will leave you thinking about it long after you reach the back cover. I happen to be a fan of (the late) Ed McBain's 87th precinct series and I found Parker's writing style to be similar. The structure, humor, and the way a single line of dialog or subtle action can define a character, helped me enjoy the book a bit more than I otherwise might have. As a matter of fact, I do recall an 87th precinct novel circa 1976 that involved the kidnapping of a detective's girlfriend. Overall, to me this book was like my favorite fast-food burger; it satisfied my particular appetite, the nutritional value was zilch but, I'll eventually go back for another."},{"Title":"Thin Air","review":"Didn't see any of the early episodes on TV but I hope they were as good as the books, thanks."},{"Title":"Courtroom Evidence Handbook, 2004-2005 Student Edition","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read for getting a handle on the Federal Rules of Evidence.

The included summary list of objections alone is extremely useful. The summary of the Federal Rules gives the foundation for getting a view of the whole picure and allows for quick refreshers, while the gloss on the objections not only reinforces ones understanding of the rules, as well as helping in getting comfortable with getting ready to make the objections at trial.

Before using this text, I relied on a gut sense of what exercises might work with high school kids and on reading them lots of examples of poetry I thought they would enjoy. What is exceptional about this book is, first of all, its eloquence: teaching aside, I'd recommend this text to anyone who simply loves rich, sensual language; clearly, honest-to-God poets wrote it. (How often has anyone been inspired by a textbook?) The exercises ask the student to examine professional poetry in fresh ways, and each chapter deals with a specific writing skill; for example, narrating, organization, endings. The chapter called &quot;Architecture&quot; is especially well done. Highly recommended for high school English teachers and for any student of poetry."},{"Title":"Teaching the Art of Poetry: The Moves","review":"Imagine this: In an inner city classroom, students examining a haiku debate over denotation and connotation of words (one boy looks up a word, then cross-references all words in the definition), mood and atmosphere, use and significance of rhyme, syntax and word placement, purpose of and meaning from punctuation marks, imagery, shape and symbol. How does this happen? With activities from Baron Wormser and David Cappella's book Teaching the Art of Poetry: The Moves. No magic or experience required.Based on the premise that poetry contains all the essentials for understanding language and how we use it, Teaching the Art of Poetry explains how teachers can create &quot;poetry-based classrooms&quot; to raise language learning to higher levels of critical thinking and analysis. Compact and easy to use, each chapter begins with an essay on an element of language/poetry from grammar, punctuation and capitalization to details, metaphor, image and sound as well as techniques specific to poetry such as stanzas and form. Wormser and Cappella, however, understand the plight of overburdened teachers; those who have little time for reading may skim the essay and skip to each chapter's classroom exercises, lesson plans and bibliography. The application exercises are clear, simple and easy to implement without the use of extra planning or materials, yet they guarantee to change the way students think and learn about language, which influences everything else they do in an English class. The potential is exponential.After carefully perusing almost every book for middle and secondary English found at the National Council of Teachers of English, November 2000, Teaching the Art of Poetry clearly wins as the most useful book exhibited. Rarely does one find such an invaluable gem in educational literature, containing sound pedagogy, brave technique, and practical applications to transform the language classroom.

She dies requesting her heart go to a patient she knows ( Bhoomika Chawla). The husband opposes this decision and doesn't know who the recipient is. However the girl comes into his life and there is mutual attraction. He resists this. Is the wife pretty much channeling through this heart conveying her wishes? Who is he drawn to - his dead wife or the girl? Will his resistance be too much for the heart of the girl to take?I found this movie average overall. However Salman Khan was particularly good at conveying subtlety and grief, and it is one of his best performances. In fact he more convincingly conveyed grief than Preity conveyed wasting away (though Preity is always solid and generally is here too). For me (and many others I see) the patient with the heart, while attractive enough, lacks substance and Salman's connection with her seems distant. In fact he showed more spark with a short chat with her best friend. There is also a short divergence into unnecessary comedy with an over-effeminate stereotyped gay boy, which should have been jettisoned.There is good evidence that in cases of heart transplant the recipient does seem to develop tastes the donor had so the premise is an interesting one. I felt uneasy with the ending of this though. Was he really in love with the girl legitimately or was he trying to continue a shrine to his dead wife through the body of another. Getting them together seemed sudden and forced.If there is a reason to recommend this is Salman's performance (and if you are a fan of Preity she's mostly fine too). The movie itself though is pretty average but OK enough. Elsewhere on the Net it rates about an average (though some put it down at a 3 out of 10 and a few up at an 8 out of 10).

It is only a system of thought, experimentation, and peer review which allows us to theorize and then act upon reasonable assumptions. Zealotry in science definitely must be scorned, but the actions of a few do not invalidate the process.In my opinion, those claiming natural selection is a fraud are ignorant of the science behind genetic mutation and reproductive statistical perpetuance, lack the required mental abilities to understand it, or are extremely biased by erroneous preconceived notions.

All the other denizens of the house pride themselves on their fearlessness at make-believe games, and they deride poor Custard for his timidity. However, when a real danger arrives in the form of a burglarizing pirate bent on mayhem, only Custard is ready with a suitably ferocious response. After the danger is past, everyone begins to boast again about their courage, and Custard agrees that everyone else is braver than he is.Nash's hilarious wordcraft and sly humor will amuse children and adults alike, and Lynn Munsinger's whimsical illustrations merrily evoke the mood of the poem, while bringing the rather complex vocabulary into reach for kids. Younger listeners may not immediately grasp the central irony, and a brief explanation may be necessary for them to appreciate the joke. This book is probably best introduced as a read-aloud, although confident readers will also be able to enjoy it.Purists may also want to check outCustard the Dragon, the earlier version illustrated by Linell Nash Smith, Ogden Nash's daughter, although it's out of print and hard to find."},{"Title":"The Tale of Custard the Dragon","review":"LOVE this book.

It's a great springboard into a discussion on kindness and perspective. Whatever you do, don't pass this one up because of that review. I was amazed this book had less than 5 stars. Parents will love reading this to their children. Also, a great discussion on the true meaning of bravery can ensue as a result of this book."},{"Title":"The Tale of Custard the Dragon","review":"Spoiler alert: So many apparently gullible readers have reviewed this poem, that I'm going to tell you the entire plot. If you want to be surprised, then just move on to the next review.(1) Belinda and three other pets *say* that they're very brave. Custard the Dragon *says* that he'd rather live some place safe. Based on what they *say* about themselves, the four \\"brave\\" characters tease the one \\"cowardly\\" character.(2) When a pirate breaks into the house, the four \\"brave\\" characters instantly turn tail and run away. Cowardly Custard, however, stands his ground during the attack and ends up eating the pirate.(3) Once the danger is past, all the so-called brave characters come back and thank Custard.(4) Ultimately, however -- and this is more like the real world than a fairy tale -- Belinda and the \\"brave\\" pets go back to their habit of saying that they're really brave, and Custard goes back to saying that he'd really rather live in a nice safe place.This poem is an interesting bit of commentary on our own willful blindness to our faults, our narcissistic dependence on erroneous self-talk, and one of our stupider working definitions of bravery.This book is an excellent opportunity for you to talk to your kids about the difference between what people *say* and how they behave. Who's really the brave character after all? Is it always safe to trust a person's self-description? Is there anything wrong with Custard preferring security to danger? If you were there, would you want to tease Custard, or to tell that self-deceived Belinda to put a sock in it? If you saw someone picking on another person on the playground just because they're different, then should you be ganging up with the Belindas of the world, or sticking up for the Custards?If you're at all familiar with the parable of the two sons in the vineyard (see Matthew 21:31's \\"Which of the two did his father's will?\\" question), then you won't have any trouble figuring out the difference between Belinda's brave words and Custard's brave actions. This poem may be beyond the ken of a two year old, but it shouldn't have been so confusing for so many adult reviewers. Just repeat after me: \\"Actions speak louder than words,\\" and \\"Do not believe everything you hear.\\""},{"Title":"The Tale of Custard the Dragon","review":"I have always loved Ogden Nash's writing.

It helps them to feel the rhythms of the English language, they can anticipate what will come next, and then they can memorize passages - it's just a wonderful thing.So many kids have loved this book - I read a review about some of the characters being \\"mean\\" to Custard...

But this book more than the others is a tribute to his love for his wife. That being said, most of the poems in this collection are pretty weak.

Schools around the country regularly held \\"duck and cover\\" drills, where the students were taught to get down on get down on their knees and cover the back of their neck with their hands. As if that would do a great deal to protect you against a nuclear blast.This story is set at the height of the nuclear arms race where the race is not in numbers but in the power of the blasts. Each side sets off the most powerful nuclear blast yet and there on one casualty of each blast, a humanoid with wings. Neither side really knows how to deal with a dead angel; there are discussions about how much to reveal and some studying of the bodies in an attempt to learn the truth. However, circumstances dictate that neither side is able to learn any details about the mysterious visitors and each one leaves behind a book.This book is a metaphor for the semi-controlled insanity that permeated the Cold War and points out that the paranoia was so great that it is likely that even semi-divine intervention could not have stopped it. The latest generation will have no idea what this book is about unless they have studied history in depth, those that lived through it will relive a part of their lives."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"I first came across this work late one night when my father, just in from a very long hard day of work, sat in our dark living room nursing a short glass of scotch while Arthur Prysock's recording of This Is My Beloved spun on the turntable. The captivating words, though not yet understood by my young mind, wove a spell about me as I sat in my pajamas there in the hallway, unwilling to disturb my father in that quiet moment. Years later, when I lost the first love of my life. I asked my father about the record. He strode over to his cabinet - the one with all of his 'priceless' records - and put the tattered record jacket into my hands. As he handed the record to me, he rested his other hand on my shoulder and said, &quot;Son, if you must love, love like this&quot;. Those words, especially from a man that didn't usually have much to say, touched me deeply. The sheer poetic power of Benton's words and majesty of his unique phrases also has touched me deeply over the years. It eventually led to a lifelong love of literature and a degree in English Literature. As with other masterpieces that speak to the soul, I discover a new gem with each reading. Throughout my life and loves, I've never been without a copy. It's the quintessential definition of love's pain and the bittersweet memories it leaves, like the tang of a lemon on your tongue. ..and as for the music, the recording by Prysock is now in my &quot;priceless&quot; cd collection, but I do have another copy, unopened, for when my son loses his first love."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"This book is a sensual look of how a man sees a women when he loves her. I recomend this to all my fiends and feel it is some of the best poetry I have ever read and as a creative writing major I have read quite a few pieces of poetry."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"&quot;This is my Beloved,&quot; published during WWII, captures the full sense of the emotional and physical aspects of a doomed love, the joy of time together and the despair at the end of the affair. This is continued in the second volume, &quot;No Greater Need,&quot; which is out of print. Both should be required reading for those who understand or have experienced such deep committments or who have lost their soulmate. One reviewer noted that &quot;This is my Beloved&quot; was recorded by Lawrence Harvey, and this is true. It was an excellent reading. However, there is a second recording, done by Arthur Prysock. It is a censored verson of Benton's poetry (some of the more descriptive lines left out and some poems merged in the reading) and Prysock does not always read the lines as one would expect, but it's still captures much of Benton's emotion and the musical background adds a lot. It's worth the few bucks for the CD."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"This Is My Beloved IS my favorite book of poetry. Walter expresses love so completely. The true depth of love when it is real, honest and free. I absolutely love this book. I feel his words. This book has touched my heart.

This birthday was like no other. Reading the words, seeing the images and feeling beloved stopped time. The blush from head to toe as I was younger in years and knowledge than I am now, recurred each time I read this book. It has been on the shelf for years now; periodic readings have not diminished the force of feeling beloved or loving another as Walter portrays. I picked it up 2 December 1997, noticed for the first time such details as printed in 1943, reprinted twenty nine times and, of course, Knopf name which always spelled quality to me. Curious as to whether this book could work its magic, I read August 9 entry about the forgetting in each season, a favorite, and wept. Reading the other journal entries of love found, lost, found and lost ever more, I came here to order another copy or two as the magic continues. I have been learning to write poems by writing them. Walter's poems suggest I have a ways to go before my beloveds over time are as well enshrined."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"Seldom have I ran from the truth.

What I find so disarming about both of them is the fact that they were written in the 1940's! To think that a man could be so articulately erotic on love and sensuality from that 'era' is astounding to me!One thing you come away knowing for sure (after reading these books) is that he truly loved his lady, and that she was probably the 'luckiest woman' around in those days! What a lover he must have been, and I feel sure that she was very 'grateful' to have known such love, and to be involved with such an aficionado on the subject! He makes the reader \\"feel\\" his deep, sensual love and need for her ~ so, if we [the readers] feel these 'feelings,' we can only imagine how she was able to receive his love and adoration for her!What beautiful words and descriptions in these pages! So much better than anything around these days! O, that it were 1943 and if I had read these books, I would go searching the world over for Walter Benton myself! I want to 'know' a man like this! Every woman wants to! If you haven't read these aforementioned books, make sure that you include them in your library -- especially if you're a 'romanticist\\"! They are not to be missed, and you will never forget them!One more romantic favor you might do for yourself, purchase Herbie Mann's CD called \\"The Family Of Mann: First Light\\" it contains the complete words from \\"This Is My Beloved\\" read by the late English actor, Laurence Harvey. He puts a beautifully poetic/erotic touch to this masterpiece, and I love reading the words along, as he speaks them!We have nothing that even compares to these books today, and if you don't own them, you should buy them and place them on a permanent spot on your nightstand, to read and reread many many times over!"},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"There are two striking characteristics in the relationship between Lillian and the author...first is the overwhelming commitment to Lillian (images, many of sexual nature, described with intense, vivid intimacy) and, second, the abject destruction of the author as the long affair with Lillian disintegrates bit by bit, complete with a failed attempt at reconciliation..."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"My father gave me a first edition copy of this book back in the mid-1990's and all he ever said when he handed it to me was \\"Don't make the same mistakes I did\\" and walked away. It took me awhile but I finally realized (and later events confirmed this fact) that my father was still in love with his first wife, a woman replaced by my mother. This was now a period of fifty years or so since they were married and he was admitting to me what a terrible mistake his male ego and foolishness had done to him, carrying a love for someone all these years, knowing that \\"the one\\" was now gone and - between the lines - knowing that you had done it to yourself and destroyed the most wonderful thing that life had ever given you.Walter Benton opens his heart and reveals his soul to all with his love for his Lillian, a love that I think everyone wants and so few truly obtain. Do you love? Do you love so that without thinking you would sacrifice your very being to protect this person, become the fool for all to see in your quest you are so driven?Is your \\"one\\" now gone? Perhaps we must all make our own journey but Mr. Benton will let you know that the path of sorrow and loss over love has been traveled before and will be traveled again.And yes, I have finally loved as did Walter - and now share this same sorrow with him in my heart - bitter sweet in the realization that I was allowed to love as others only dream.And understand my father perhaps a little better as I continue to grow."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"every man should read this book , it puts you in touch with the most beautiful creation in life a woman. it gives you a sense of purpose in life with a loving mate, and it makes you want to experience that wholesome feeling that every man desires."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"I have just purchased my fourth copy in 30 years of this erotic collection of poems.

My favored lines are those that read, \\"Your words are born, not spoken. Dimensional, soft-vowelled words, palpable to the eye or to the fingertip...\\" With imagination and honest desire, Walter Benton writes of his lover, transporting the reader to that place where all those who have loved have been.

How fitting considering both Benton and Prysock were Los Angelino's of the highest caliber.My roommate at the time, Pepi, worked as a chef over at the Veteran's Administration and loved to read this on the weekends whenever he had some downtime. I can still see him now reclining in the wicker chair near the window that opened up to the balcony above the street. A large eucalyptus blew like a waving hand outside the window. Pepi smoked cigarillos and had a voice that sounded like gravel across an iron skillet and was easy going. He would sit at the window for the best part of the morning drinking coffee and flipping the pages on the book. The good things of having a roommate are often too few against the many cons.One Sunday morning when we were both doing our thing, he switched off the am radio that typically wofted out R&B;, and put in the Arthur Prysock version of the book, on disc. I had read the book a few times myself over the many months that we were roommates, but he had never mentioned anything about the Prysock recording. When you hear something like that for the first time, it's unlikely that it will be a moment that you would soon forget.Everything I had thought about Benton's poetry was instantly magnified in my mind from hearing the first few lines uttered by the smooth and immortal voice of Arthur Prysock:Because hate is legislatedWritten into the primer and testamentShot into our bloodLike vaccine or vitaminsand I didn't snap from that reverie until I heard the next set of words which effected me like no other words of poetry because I knew it had more to do with me than any other thing that was ever directed at me trying to define me, tell me who I was, where I was at, or what I was going to be, or never become.Each season of each yearI will be forgetting you all overEach season, every yearI will need to forget youMost people put a connection with either this book or Prysock's recording with a late spouse or a long lost love. Some even have stated that Benton must have been a 'real lover' and 'smooth' to have written this or 'known about the true beauty of love' and so on and so forth. But let me tell the reader, plainly: Benton was probably none of those things in real life. Walter Benton probably suffered a great deal in his relationships, squandered and wasted the love he was given and watched the love he gave discarded. This is often the case for any man that seeks to understand love, loss and his relationships through verse, song or novel. A happy man in love will tend to that love and not spend the months and years brooding and lost in distracted loneliness, wasting his years on paper over what once was. It's a burden and a punishment to truly love which is why most men often don't.I read this book from time to time and still listen to Prysock's album regularly."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"This Is My BelovedThis exquisite work can be humorous and elegant, although laden with syrup.Regardless of your age, if you're \\"young and in love\\" or have an insatiable \\"love jones\\" this book is for you and your loved one."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"I listened to this version after having heard the rendition by Arthur Prysock's melodious voice.

It was painful for me to listen."},{"Title":"This Is My Beloved","review":"I love it that the Benton book and the Prysock record have been linked this way. Talk about poetic justice! My first husband bought the book for me when we first met and I truly did \\"grow up\\" on the lyrical, passionate, inspired writing of Walter Benton. When my husband passed away the lovely readings helped sooth my wounded heart. Then, some years ago - 1987 - I was fortunate enough to 'win an evening with Arthur Prysock'. The great man was in Pittsburgh and Mavis, the jazz DJ on Pittsburgh's am jazz station was giving away an evening with Arthur Prysock. When she anwered and said that I had won I nearly fainted. Winning that evening was, for someone of my generation, akin to a young girl today winning an evening with Robin Thicke. I asked Mavis to please tell him that I was looking forward to seeing him that evening at Walt Harper's club. \\"You tell him yourself,\\" she said and put Art Prysock on the phone. Oh my. Those honeyed tones. I wished I had been recording the call! When I met him that evening I was carrying my copy of his This Is my Beloved recording and asked him to sign it for me, which he did. He asked me why, if I owned so many of his albums (6), I chose that one. I knew he was just wanting to see me blush (those fabulous green eyes were sparkling in a very mischievous way), which I readily did, even at my advanced age. It was a wonderful evening, his brother's band (Red Prysock) was very good, Art was in great voice but the crowd was pitifully small.

Perhaps today young love is more casual than it was in Benton's 1940s. It surely is moreso than in my 1950s young-love days. When I discovered \\"Beloved,\\" I devoured it. I bought both sizes in which the book was issued. And I memorized passages, which I can quote today: \\"And the long bright ribbons you laugh\\"; \\"I need love more than ever now/I need love more than hope or money, wisdom or a drink\\"; \\"you rise out of sleep like a growing thing rises out of the garden soil, two leaves part to be your mouth.\\" The recorded version which I listened to was an LP album by actor John Dall (best known for his role in Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Rope\\")and the music was composed by Vernon Duke (\\"Autumn in New York\\"). It is superior to any subsequest recordings, but, alas,it is out of print; so Amazon's Prysock version is the best you might be able to do. Benton's beloved book provided a great influence on my own writing craft and talent. In fact, a Washington newspaper review of my book titled,\\"As the Wine Must Taste,\\" compared it with \\"This Is My Beloved.\\" I took that as a compliment, indeed.If you've not read \\"This Is My Beloved,\\" buy a copy, set aside a solid uninteruptable hour, and read it.

In fact, that is exactly what they were, no matter how they dressed.The earlier ones were often of slaves. Most of the others were of young girls without the protection of family driven into prostitution. It is not the French who were responcible for this. It was the Algerians themselves. Though the author does not show it, there were often series of photographs taken of the same girls. It is obvious when viewing these series that many of these girls were having the times of their often short, tragic lives being photographed. Others show the dispair of social evil.The author shows none of this.This book isn't worth the paper its written on.

Gyana Yoga is the path of attaining the Absolute through the use of right knowledge, that is, through constant discrimination between the true and the false. Learning to recognize what is true can be a difficult path, and there are many philosophical quandaries along this road.But Swami Vivekananda with his powerful oratory and use of his vast knowledge lays bare the basic principles of Gyana. In this book, he shows that Gyana is not a doctrinal path but something that can be reached through reasoning. This is one of the greatest expositions on the beliefs of Advaita Vedanta, specially since it is done not through technical terms but through a direct appeal to logic and reason. The path of Gyana Yoga through this book becomes a path of spirituality that is accessible to those who would not like to abandon science and reason for religion.----- P. J. Mazumdar, author of \\"The Circle of Fire\\""},{"Title":"Jnana-Yoga","review":"Swami Vivekananda's Jnana-Yoga is a sublime work. Rather than a volume filled with numerous Sanskrit terms and modes of thought which are difficult to follow, as most works of this nature are, the swami speaks directly from his heart to yours and the end result is a compilation of straightforward lectures than instantly transmit wisdom that can be immediately applied. This book was immediately placed upon my shelf of Vedanta favorites. Great for those well studied and practiced to those just beginning their search into this lovely mode of religious thought."},{"Title":"Jnana-Yoga","review":"Lectures of Vivekananda. Jnana yoga was his main field and he presents many insights and interesting thoughts about it. For anyone on the spiritual path, this will be interesting reading. But it's from a hundred years back, so it may not necessearly appeal to the modern mind."},{"Title":"Jnana-Yoga","review":"A beautiful book elucidating the crux of Vedanta, one of the oldest philosophies of the world. Jnana Yoga is the method of 'realizing' religion or God through knowledge and discussion. The other methods are Karma(work), Bhakti(devotion) and Raja(mind) and everybody should select a method according to his/her interests/capabilities. Jnana Yoga presents an extremely logical and intellectually satisfying view of God and religion. Vivekanand has been quite impressive, his style very 'scientific' and language : simple and superb. Must read for people with an inquisitional bent of mind. I especially recommend the chapter called &quot;Atma&quot;."},{"Title":"Jnana-Yoga","review":"This book if anyone was to read it is amazing and I find it difficult to find words of praise that could do it justice. Therefore the best thing would be to read it. Some one said that this 'does not appeal to the modern mind' This is certainly proof that the person has not read the book or read it with closed eyes, what a pity! Vivekananda blends ancient hindu texts, into modern thought and also weaves into his work modern scintific thought into the ever so ancient wisdom of India. Whosoever reads this book is bound to become transformed, trasfigured and awakened to higher truths in this universe. This rare crest-jewel of a book has come from a great soul, and I feel blessed and thrilled to have come accross this precious gem."},{"Title":"Jnana-Yoga","review":"Though Jnana yoga is presumably the favorite subject of Vivekananda, he himself is supposed to have quoted that his bhakti is covered by a cloak of jnana, while his guru's (Sri Ramakrishna) jnana is covered by a cloak of bhakti. Whatever he may have learnt from Ramakrishna, who spoke in parables, Vivekananda transforms them into powerful words with striking sentences to give a sublime meaning. He is at his best while expounding the Vedanta philosophy.His examples simplify the understanding of such a complex and profound philosophy. The way he coins the words and grammar in his lectures is unbelievable. His logic is almost always unarguable. One of the best lectures is &quot;The Real and Apparent Man&quot; where he lays a solid foundation of the nature of man, the support of which comes in later lectures on Maya and Cosmos . The exposition of Katha upanishad is beautiful and one does not get that picture and depth of understanding while reading the original upanishad. The final lectures delivered in Pasadena, California appeals to the unity of religions and friendship with science - a subject which is probably never more important than now.No wonder during his lectures in America, he was the last to deliver, as the audience would wait patiently to listen to him."},{"Title":"Jnana-Yoga","review":"Swami Vivekananda, a major (if not the main) disciple of the famous Ramakrishna, has done both Hinduism and comparative religion a great service by writing several works that address the main types of transformational yoga. Interestingly, Hinduism has constructed a wonderful model that differentiates among and between these seemingly divergent paths up the spiritual mountain (or paths to God for Theists). These include: Karma Yoga (addressing action) and Bhakti Yoga (of devotion) included in one volume; Raja Yoga (of mind, but addressing more psychic development); and Jnana Yoga (of wisdom). The latter is more difficult, IMHO, to find out about. Religions generally specialize in one of these four with additional elements (sometimes only in subsets such as clerics or monks) from some of the other ones. Jnana or Gnani appears to be among the rarest. Thus, having read this book is a great coup in understanding the higher philosophies and theological approaches to Omneity or spiritual development. In Tibetan Buddhism, for example, it would be applicable to Dzogchen and Mahamudra as opposed to the more normal or pervasive Vajrayana practices. IMHO, Jnana (and its equivalents in other religions) is the most profound of teachings. Vivekananda was obviously a Master and has presented a wonderful exposition on this esoteric subject. We are privileged to have the opportunity to read and study it."},{"Title":"Jnana-Yoga","review":"swami vivekananda is/was one of the giant intellects of all time. a direct disciple of the great 19th century indian god-man, sri ramakrishna, vivekananda learned his lessons well at an early age and built upon it to the point of sometimes surpassing his master. especially in the sense of providing a bridge from the worlds oldest extant religious traditions to plain spoken accessability for the spiritual seeker of our own time. jnana yoga is the approach of experiencing oneness with God using the path of knowledge/philosophy/contemplation. this book is among the very best in laying out the methods and ideas the aspirant can use for his own search [ thru the path of knowledge ] of direct experience of God, i.e. being-conciousness-bliss absolute. the book carefully and clearly leads us thru our most primitive lowest levels of humanity up the ladder of understanding spiritually we are truly One with the highest of all realities. that indeed, \\"thou art that\\". \\"what frightens you? what holds you down? only ignorance and delusion; nothing else can bind you. you are the Pure One, the Ever Blessed...he who knows this and models his life accordingly will no longer grovel in darkness.\\" the good swami's writings on all the yoga paths are among the best the world has yet seen. this particular volume is a must read for the student practitioner of jnani yoga. if i could spend an hour having a cup of tea with any person who ever lived, swami vivekananda might well be the one i would choose. not only for his giant intellect but his purity and holiness and breadth of understanding man's need for transcendence and the ways of actually doing so. this is a great book for anyone looking for the true innermost Self."},{"Title":"Jnana-Yoga","review":"For those who reject standard religious dogma but still recognize the certain spirituality of mankind, this book is for you.

Of these different paths such as Raja Yoga (Yoga of mind), Bhakti Yoga (Yoga of devotion) and Karma Yoga (Yoga of rightous work); I could best relate to Jnana Yoga. I believe westerners would feel the same because Western Society has scientific bend of mind. This book is about the \\"Logic\\" of GOD. It uses deduction as a method to uncover secret upon secret. It contradicts the commonly held belief that there is some Superuser sitting up in the sky, running the whole Universe. It explains how that is false. It preaches nothing. It deduces.I would also like to mention that my profession is about Logic, the descipline of Computer Science.

Both have sought and been granted sanctuary by the Abbot, but there the similarity ends. Wilfred is of a restless and questioning nature, eager to learn and discover new things. John seeks nothing more than peace and prayer in the protection of his teacher and mentor, Wilfred. It is AD 1228, during the Crusades; and when the Pope decides to send a mission to Rome, Wilfred eagerly volunteers to join it. John goes as well, only out of fear of losing Wilfred's protection. The journey to Rome is the start of an odyssey that takes the two into the heart of the Mongol Empire where they are exposed to physical and philosophical differences wholly at odds with their Christian beliefs. Their journey covers more than 12,000 miles over a period of fourteen years during which they witness and become part of the forging of the largest Empire on earth. THE WAYFARERS is a vast canvas filled with warfare, conquest, theological conflict, even a love story, which the author, Howard N. Ellman, skillfully brings to life in this vivid and well-crafted debut novel."},{"Title":"The Wayfarers","review":"I recieved this book as a gift, and to be quit frank this was not a book I would usually read,I had no interest in that subject matter. But, the book revealed insite into the historically infamous Mongolian Empire that was rather interesting and the auther developed 2 characters that I could relate to. The first Wilfred, who appealed to me because he was sick of the monotiny of his current life and was caught up in the adventures of exploring a truely opposite culture to that of his own. The other character, Johnnie, likes the comfort of a routine and though curious about the culture could not adapt to a culture so opposite of his own. The draw back of the book is that I got lost when the author named cities of that time period, thats a reflection more on my non intrest in that time period than anything else. I also couldn't help but think that the more graphic parts of the book were forced, just to keep me turning the page ( it did however accomplish that). When the book wraped up the author, I don't know if intentionally, put another spin on it. It makes me want to reread some of the book to see if Johnnie a Wilfred are more than just 2 companions.It would rate itmore than 3, less than 4"},{"Title":"The Wayfarers","review":"About The Author: Howard N.

This is the 2nd in a 4 book/4 author Half Moon Ranch Series. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the first book but it was still pretty good. You see a tiny bit of Brent in this book from book #1 not really any of his wife Crystal. In book #1 we fell in love with these 2 so I would've liked to see just a bit more of them but there's still 2 more in the series so hopefully it will happen. Overall though this series is off to a really good start & I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Renegade Moon (Half-Moon Ranch)","review":"From the back cover:Half-moon ranch...Somewhere in the lush grasslands of Texas hill country was a place where the sun had once shone on love and prosperity, while the night hid murder and mistrust. There, three brothers and a sister fought t o hold their family together, struggled to keep their ranch solvent, while they awaited the return of the one person who could shed light on the secrets of the past.Quince...No sooner had he rescued spitfire Glory Townsend from deadly gicksand than Quince found himself trapped in a quagmire of emotions far more difficult to escape. His homecoming after five years tracking renegades hadn't changed his father's drinking, lessened his rivalry with his brother or resolved the mystery surrounding his mother's death. But those issues felt like easy going compared to the shaky ground he traversed with Glory. Every time he looking into her flashing green eyes he felt himself sinking deeper. Maybe it was time to stop struggling and admit that only her love could save him.And my review:As another reviewer has stated, this is pretty standard fare. This is a 350 page book, but only because the print it quite large (almost the size of a largeprint book). I'd guess this is more of a 200 page shorter story than a full-length novel.One really annoying thing was that this book doesn't really work as a stand-alone. There are a lot of loose ends left dangling, in an effort to entice the reader to read the next book in the series. Most authors can manage to write linked books that still work on their own, but unfortunately, that didn't happen here. Still, nothing about this book was compelling enough to induce me to read the next one.The character were rather flat and uninspiring. He's a tortured hero. She's a spitfire. Yawn. Been there, done that a hundred times over. I've got no problem with the same sort of plots or characters, but the author needs to be able to breathe new life into them. That didn't happen here. And I had a hard time liking the heroine. Instead of coming across as \\"spirited\\", she came across as more of a shrew. I mean really, when a man saves your life, you should be thanking him, not spewing venom at him. It wasn't like he tried to take advantage of her after saving her or something. If he had, the heroine's reaction would have been understandable. As it was, I was left wondering why someone would be so immature as to return kindness with witchiness.I do think that Barbieri has writing talent, but I think she needs to develop more likeable characters. If I had been able to like the heroine, I would probably have enjoyed this book. As it was, I was left wondering what the hero saw in her."},{"Title":"Renegade Moon (Half-Moon Ranch)","review":"Loved this whole series of books.

I'm glad to have them all back."},{"Title":"Renegade Moon (Half-Moon Ranch)","review":"Again I will stress - characters make the story - and sometimes we must deal with an idiot female.But do you know, we are not dealing with a contemporary romance - this is the 1880's. Where the gal must struggle against a male dominated society.Quince Hunter - 29 and not ready to meet up with his father yet answers his sister, Abby's request to return home. He leaves the man he has befriended and scouted for, Major Jonah Tremain recovering from his wound and heads for Half-Moon Ranch.Glory Townsend - age not even hinted at - makes a mistake in trying to save her mare, Cinnamon from the quick sand and almost goes down herself.This mare was to be the foundation of her father and hers breeding stock to help put their Diamond C ranch on its feet. She also has the fiery-tempered attitude of a red-head.Brent is now married and Crystal is expecting their first child. But both Brent and Quince are strong willed self-confident men and continue to clash.An Army contract is being offered to ranchers to supply horses. No one moves to apply for it until Quince decides to. Due to that buzzard Edmund, owner of the Diablo State Bank, wanting to keep Jack Hunter in debt, the Half-Moon ranch wranglers are off to round up Jack's mares.In the meantime we meet Blanche, 17 from the saloon who has made the mistake of taking up with the bum, Lobo. Lobo comes around when he wants money and &lt;g> a little nookey. He enjoys his brutality. Except when Quince belts him one. Blanche wishes for the fairy-tale romance to develope between her and Quince and hopes he will save her.Edmund clashes with Dr. Gibbs over his wife, Iona's use of medicinal sherry and laudnaum. Mixing them can be dangerous.Well we follow the mustang round-up - the clashes between Glory and Quince, he wants to protect her and she, who will not acknowledge the danger she could put them in. Attraction between two such opinionated people - just don't forget the pheromones we can't smell.And we must occasionally have these idiot females who think they can solve their problems by themselves and want to prove that they are equal to men. Don't they wish! They just don't know how to acknowledge their own value.We are let into the underhanded dealings of the stinker, Edmund and his henchman, Kane. As for the story standing alone - who would want it to as this is the Saga of the day to day lives of the Hunter family and the problem of survival against greed, [lust] and evil machinations that began 30 years ago.There are deaths, intrigue, danger and romance incompassed in this Saga - whats not to enjoy - I hate drawn out stories but this is worth reading - the pace is good just not the intensity of spine-tingling danger. But I can live with it.Definitely Recommended --M - I probably have not touched on all the intriguing characters but I am now into Abby's story with Major Jonah Tremain. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Renegade Moon (Half-Moon Ranch)","review":"average western that didn't quite meet its potential.

Love naturally blossoms.RENEGADE MOON is a fine follow-up to Bobbi Smith's HUNTER'S MOON, but is a fine stand-alone. It is that ability to provide a complete western romance inside a series written by other authors that displays the talent of Elaine Barbieri. This novel is exciting as the lead couple refuses to give in to something as pathetic as love. Readers will enjoy this tale immensely.

In Europe we are used to recieve best quality.

Lee and Stonewall Jackson, meticulously chronicled the Civil War career of Jeb Stuart.The book begins with a stirring accout of John Brown's raid at Harper's Ferry prior to the war, and Stuart's critical role in his eventual capture. The narrative grabs the reader's attention, and never lets go - even into the maelstrom of battle and Cavalry engagements. Stuart riding circles around McClellan during the Seven Day's Battles, his role in being Lee's eyes at Antietam and Fredericksburg, and his taking command of Stonewall Jackson's Corps when that great Confederate leader was mortally wounded at Chancellorsville.Then it all goes downhill from there. No,not the book, which does keep the reader enthralled to the grim end, but for Stuart and the Confederate Cavalry. Mistakes are made at Brandy Station, and shortly afterwards at Gettysburg, where Stuart encounters a Union Cavalry General just as flamboyant as he - George Armstrong Custer.Other Union Cavalrymen make their mark - Pleasanton, Buford, and finally Sheridan - as the worn and tattered Confederate Cavalry decline towards the bitter end and Stuart rides to meet Sheridan and Custer at a little hamlet called Yellow Tavern.Davis' narrative makes the reader feel as if he or she is indeed riding with Stuart - the smell of leather, of gunpowder and the sweat of the horses. The Rebel Yell and the fast gallop.Stuart's family is also given fine coverage, his devoted wife Flora, his hapless father-in-law, General Cooke, who remained loyal to the Union, and who was soundly thrashed by his own son-in-law! and his entourage, including the amazing Heros Von Boercke and banjo man Sam &quot;Jine The Cavalry&quot; Sweeney. It is all there."},{"Title":"Jeb Stuart,: The last cavalier","review":"While Burke Davis' book about Jeb Stuart is well writen, and flows nicely, I felt shorted with the book. Davis spends much of the time talking about the staff surrounding Stuart, and the battles from a general standpoint. Insight into the personality of one of the most famous generals in US/CS history is limited to the letters he wrote to his wife, a source which allows for self service when presented independently of other opinions. There is very little to explain his eccentricity, his thoughts about battles, or the significance of his accomplishments. I enjoyed the book, but will definitely need to read other works about Stuart to get a feel for what the MAN was like."},{"Title":"Jeb Stuart,: The last cavalier","review":"This is the third civil war book by Burke Davis that I have read, and it is just as good as the others.

Ride with the General, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Jeb Stuart,: The last cavalier","review":"Many biographies tend to be cold. They contain numerous facts strung together to make a coherent history of a human life. The Last Cavalier is an exception to this tendency. Burke Davis brings the most dashing of Civil War generals to life with personal letters, comments from his contemporaries and a reluctance to let J.E.B. pass into history without a fight. It was a very good read and though I knew how J.E.B.'s career ended, as I neared the end of the book, I began to dread the outcome that had to come. It was then that I knew Davis had done his job of bringing The Last Cavalier back to life."},{"Title":"Jeb Stuart,: The last cavalier","review":"The book starts out very well, establishing basic background and geographical history in a very easy to read anecdotal style.

This is it. Ann Thwaite, following up on her massive biography of A.A. Milne, created this biography of Winnie-the-Pooh, and seldom have I been more impressed by ANY BOOK of any genre. There is plenty of information about A.A. Milne the author and his son Christopher Robin Milne (as well as Mr. Shepard, his own son and his bear Growler, and others), including much textual and photographic material that the average person would have real difficulty finding or seeing on his own; but it's all aimed toward supporting the biography of the real stars of the book, the Toys, the characters they inspire and above all Pooh himself.I've been wanting this book for years, finally was able to get it, and have never been more pleased with the purchase of a book.

Levenson writes about being poor in a world -of- hard knocks, with a large loving family as early companion. He is a person who shows great respect for others, and his humor is gentle and self- deriding. His ability to turn a winning expression is never in doubt. And this book is filled with amusing one- liners, anecdotes, little stories.Among the subjects he writes about are 'Sorry, Wrong Era' 'Poor Sammy's Almanac' ' Geta New One ' ' You never get the Dessert' 'Auto Biography' ' Frank Lloyd Wrong' ' The Men in Mama's Life ' 'Mama, It's Cold Inside' 'There's No Present like the time' 'Panic Button' \\"Meatballs vs. goofballs' 'He's a Sophomore' 'LOve, Shmove' et al.Here is a sample of the kind of wisdom with a chuckle Levenon gives us.\\" Along with Papa's \\"if you ever need a helping hand\\" advice, he often threw in \\" And remember if you want your dreams to come true, don't sleep.\\"I followed the American dream, often at the price of sleep.It left me more time to work on my dreams. I figured that after my dreams came true I could always catch up on my sleep.My dreams did come true. In fact, it is truth that has been causing me a great deal of insomnia. Every silver lining has a cloud.In this way, I started out in one era and arrived in another. The trip took half a lifetime.By the time I got to my good old dream castle at the end of the rainbow ,I had been condemned and replaced by something more up-to-date in pre-fabricated temporary contemporary. The times had changed.I met all the challenges, reaped the rewards, and now find myself with everything a man could ask for , including an outstanding collection of doubts, misgivings, and ambivalences of all sizes.\\"Again this work provides an opportunity to be in the company of a gentle, wise, and humorous human being. A real mensch and a funny one at that."},{"Title":"in One era and Out the Other","review":"if you have not read sam levinson you are missing a treat. his stories are funny and down to earth and are easily related to."},{"Title":"in One era and Out the Other","review":"If you want to laugh get this book. I loved his old-style humor. At the end he gets a little serious about modern day changes. Purchased at Amazon."},{"Title":"King Manasseh and Child Sacrifice","review":"I cannot critique the scholarship or thesis in this book as I am an undergraduate with relatively little knowledge of Hebrew or the Ancient Near East. That said, I found this book to be fascinating as a very detailed argument for how the Jewish scriptures were edited to reflect theological/ideological concerns rather than historical reality. The author disputes: the historicity of the united kingdom, King Manassah as the ultimate cause of the exile, the nature of Molech, and the practice of child sacrifice as the work of idolaters. His most interesting claim is that child sacrifice was an accepted part of the Yahweh cult and that the practice was condemned only after the exile. The author believes the Bible is a purely human work and does not trust its historical accuracy, so if you are a conservative Christian you will certainly be challenged by this book. If you don't believe the Bible is the word of God, you will still be challenged by his reinterpretation of history. I asked my Christian friend in ANE at Chicago what he thought of the author's ideas and he said that there's just as much evidence for the traditional interpretation of the Bible and Biblical history. Conclusion: This book is fascinating and will challenge you, but even scholars can disagree about its ideas so it will probably leave you just as confused as it left me."},{"Title":"King Manasseh and Child Sacrifice","review":"This is one of the worst texts on this subject that I have had the unfortunate circumstance to waste time reading. The author's premise is historically wrong from the outset, relying on outdated information and even older theories of Jewish history. Just because it is well written (and it is) does not mean that the actual hypothesis is sound - it most defintely is not. This is, however, an excellent text illustrating what has become an alarming trend withiin written history that is long on personal agenda and extremely short on fact.Avoid at all cost - especially since the book is so expensive!"},{"Title":"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy of Schizophrenia","review":"Detailed text summarizing the authors' 15 years' experience doing psychotherapy with people who have schizophrenia. They modify CBT to address hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, & negative symptoms. They give suggestions for co-morbid syndromes. Many treatment issues are covered in detail. They support use of medication but go well beyond the medical model. They provide a lit review (up to 2005) summarizing, among other things, 16 randomized, controlled trials showing significant benefits for CBT relative to supportive counseling or \\"befriending\\". They use 4 case studies to illustrate topics at the end of each chapter. Clearly written, with sample educational handouts & assessment measures included."},{"Title":"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy of Schizophrenia","review":"This book is clear, concise, and perspicacious. It brakes down the elements of schizophrenia and its symptoms into understandable, although exaggerated, human experiences. This book would be excellent for any friends and family members of people with schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Kingdon and Turkington describe the intellectual process of psychosis in terms that allow the lay person to comprehend the illness."},{"Title":"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy of Schizophrenia","review":"... they seem to have the idea that delusions and hallucinations have some psychodynamic meaning, rather than being randomly generated.

God only needs us to allow Him to work through us, and He will use us to change lives."},{"Title":"The Cereal Tycoon","review":"You probably never thought about the fact that somebody, at some point, popularized the idea of eating oats for breakfast. It was previously considered horse food, but Crowell changed that perception by coming up with a great packaging idea, creating a trusted brand by assuring that the food was clean, (not tainted with dirt and animal droppings), and pointing out through the newly developing advertising business the nutritional value and low cost of this breakfast food. It was just the thing that a nation full of hard working immigrants needed for their growing families.Upon these ideas, Crowell built a wide ranging empire. It is a fascinating story of a classic American entrepreneur.Crowell did not stop with building his fortune. He was a devout Christian who applied himself to his community, helping the poor, and spreading the gospel.Crowell does not fit the &#34;robber baron&#34; sterotype that is applied to many other tycoons. He was a great businessman who used his skills to help others. Through his foundation, Crowell's work is still a force for good to this day."},{"Title":"The Cereal Tycoon","review":"Not a difficult read, but the author could not decide how to best present all the facts for the story. No real development about business, no real development about personality or family, no real development about contemporaries.

Bunk. Jeff Knorr, in his highly accessible text The River Sings, introduces poetry at a level anyone can easily &quot;get.&quot; His text is written as a conversation with the reader, in plain and simple English. And in the best practice of teaching, he makes sense of the impossible and makes the reader want to appreciate and experience the craft in the same way Knorr does himself. He also explores some of the loveliest poetry written, honoring Theodore Roethke, Alice Walker, Linda Pastan, Langston Hughes, Gary Soto, Elizabeth Bishop, and others who have become fixtures in contemporary anthologies. But he also honors lesser published poets like Jimmy Santiago Baca, Jim Harrison, Richmond Lattimore, and Sekou Sundiata, and in doing so introduces new and accessible voices across many cultures. And yes, for all of you who think a poetry text can't be complete without Frost, Poe, Barrett Browning, or Longfellow, they're in here as well in the section &quot;For Further Reading.&quot; Knorr finally lets the canon take a rest in the back of his text, using fresher and more easily understood voices to explain what poetry is all about, and this device works. Bravo. But what I like best are the sections on Reading a Poem and Writers on Writing, which encourage the readers to appreciate poetry at its oral roots and let them in on the thoughts that myriad writers share about poetry. With credit to Naomi Shihab Nye, The River Sings helps all of us understand that there is \\"a great energy released just by the act of being receptive to words,\\" and anyone who has ever shied from poetry, as a student or as a writer, will find it a welcome art when studied through the eyes of Jeff Knorr."},{"Title":"The classic Grimm's fairy tales","review":"I would say that this book is the exact bedtime story to read to children.

The stories have all been abridged, but mostly retain the flavor of the original stories. These are suitable for young readers and for read-aloud for younger children [preschoolers and up]. It all depends on the level at which a young child is reading, and as for reading to preschoolers, I'd advise caution [some of these fairy tales have dark elements as in Hansel and Gretel that may cause nightmares for young children].The stories contained in this version are \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\", \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\", \\"Snow White\\", \\"The Bremen Town Musicians\\", \\"Rapunzel\\", \\"The Shoemaker and the Elves\\", \\"The Frog Prince\\", \\"The Fisherman and His Wife\\", and \\"Hansel and Gretel\\".

Most topics are covered in a reasonable amount of detail for an introductory class, but not too much. Many of the concepts are \\"re-presented\\" in later chapters as needed (the interior of the earth, for example), but in varying amounts of detail depending on the topic (so the interior of the Earth is described is less detail in the discussion of the geosphere and in more detail in the earthquakes chapter).My problem is mostly with the organization: I find that many of the topics are not covered in the chapters I would expect (for example: hotspot volcano \\"traces\\" appear not in the plate tectonics chapter, but in the volcanoes and deep sea chapters instead). I don't really follow the logical flow of the text, and it's made teaching a course with the book much more difficult.

Through out the story, the author manages to provide the reader with easily understood buddhist concepts they can apply to their everyday life. As the story unfolds and the concepts seep in, I dont believe there is a person on Earth who could not start to examine themselves simply by reading this tale. While reading this book I myself found that I wished desperately that the amazing technological discovery made in the story that changed the world could really exist, and the people of this planet could begin really taking responsiblity for their actions, in fact having to. The magic of this fun story is that, while the technology in the book does not yet exist to help you be a better person, it turns out that the book itself almost creates the same results. I made a few changes in my life immediately after reading this book, and I believe that others will naturally do the same. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone, but believe it could be most effective for teens and adults with very little knowledge of buddhist philosophy and/or those who should be examining their behavior and how it effects others; other than that it's simply a fun read!"},{"Title":"Karma On Tap: The Online Buddhist Revolution","review":"I enjoyed this book. The premise intrigued me; I've been studying Buddhism for pretty close to two years now. As a computer geek, a sci-fi fan, and a practicing Buddhist, the idea that people could check their karma online is a very cool one!The characters were well thought out, interesting, and realistic (for the most part). Being science fiction, though, it's ok to have a character be a bit over-the-top! I think it's difficult to write a sci-fi book that is based on real teachings and real beliefs. In this, Wilcox did an outstanding job.The author's ideas (or Maitreya's) for revolutionizing the country were strong ones. A lot of thought went into them, and I thought they were explained well. I didn't agree with all of them, though. For me, that would be way too much governmental/spiritual control over people's lives. Funny I say that, because I do agree with the principles behind them, and I do actually practice most of the ones that I am able to! I'm just not so sure people should be nearly-forced to follow them all.The best thing about this book is that it did cause me to have to \\"absorb\\" it. It is more than just a sci-fi novel. When I read a simple sci-fi novel, there's not a hell of a lot to absorb or think about afterwards! \\"Karma On Tap\\" gave me food for thought, more like the books about Buddhism than the novels I read. I'll be sure to go back and reread parts of it."},{"Title":"Karma On Tap: The Online Buddhist Revolution","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book...Wilcox weaves buddhism, politics, and technology into a very timely (and not so far-fetched ) story. The reality of the accelerated improvements and progression of computer design and function help ground this work of science fiction, and make the scenario he presents seem all the more plausable. This present age of war, political intrigue, etc. demands that we all consider how our own actions impact others--\\"Karma on Tap\\" is a must-read."},{"Title":"Karma On Tap: The Online Buddhist Revolution","review":"Karma On Tap: The Online Buddhist Revolution is a novel that uses narrative structure to showcase how the digital revolution is changing the world, allowing the spread of the peaceful philosophy of Buddhism as a message of hope in an era when multinational corporations dominate human governments and daily life. Originating from the simple question \\"What if you could go online and see your karma real-time?\\", Karma On Tap follows the struggle of individuals in search of an ethical, compassionate, and non-violent existence. A moving narrative of the best and brightest that humanity is capable of in spite of the greed and negative influences that cause people to lose their way."},{"Title":"Digital Convergence Phase 2: A Field Guide for Creator-Collaborators","review":"I am the very definition of the creator collaborator that Andy Covell describes in his second book on Digital Convergence. I have a doctorate in English, but I make my living as the Webmaster for the School of Government at UNC-Chapel Hill. And now I teach courses part time at UNC-Greensboro that help students put into practice the very ideas Covell talks about in this book (the course syllabus is online at http://www.unc.edu/~pyoung/eng524).Both books are extremely helpful for anyone who wants to have a better grasp of the technological revolution where the rubber meets the road, not only in terms of where and how technologies converge (book 1), but where and how we can creatively make them converge (book 2, this book).Different audiences will find different values reading this text and Andy Covell's previous one. If you are a layperson who simply wants to understand the impact of technology, which includes far more than its current shining star, the Internet, then you will find both of Andy Covell's books accessible and easy to read. If you are a layperson interested in flexing your own technological muscles to express yourself to the world, then this book is a definite must read. The Interent has sidesteped the gatekeepers (publishing houses, TV Newsroom editors, radio programming directors) of the traditional routes for publishing information and opened up the entire world to public expression. A good companion text would also include Lawrence Lessig's The Future of Ideas, which on its own is a challenging read (but far more accessible than most books written by lawyers).If you are a technologist (a company Webmaster, university IT department head or support staff, or an IT training specialist), then you will find this an excellent book to assign as primer for discussion about how technology works and fits into our super-industrial, modern society. Get your administrative personnel a copy for a birthday present or some upcoming holiday (President's day, Columbus Day, Bosses Day). They will be better informed about technology without having to take a computer science course, and they'll better understand your work.Covell does something I find valuable in a number of writers across a number of diciplines, Lawrence Lessig (law), Stephen Gould (natural science), Walter Truett Anderson (cultural studies), Ann Berthoff (writing), and Mary Pipher (psychology); he makes complex ideas accessible without losing the complexity of the idea. In this second book he encourages people generally, not specialists to look to the future and see all the possible things they can do BECAUSE technology has become so accessible. I know my students, several of whom started out with no knowledge of how to design a Web site and no prior knowledge designing marketing material (a brochure and PowerPoint), became powerful creator collaborators by the end of my course (just 15 weeks). Projects included an online cookbook business site, a health food site, a site for a local church, a business site for writing romance novels, and so on. My students brought together, print, photo, and Web technologies to create businesses and professional hobbies and/or support organizations.This text is a most helpful text that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"I Will Not Serve (Virago Modern Classics)","review":"Very well written in-depth account of a young woman enduring the pressures of life in a catholic school in early 20th century France. A lot of dark humor at times. This is the only book written by this author who took her life shortly after writing this book at the age of 29. One wonders if in fact this could not have been autobiographical."},{"Title":"The Snowy Torrents: Avalanche Accidents in the United States 1980-86, Special Series 39 (Colorado Geological Survey special publication)","review":"Anyone who is considering or is going to, travel away from developed ski areas or open and maintained highways, over snow by foot, snowshoe, skis, sled, tobbogan, snowmobile, snowcat, by any other possible means, or stay in a snowbound cabin, should purchase this book (and its 3 other editions)and read it. Then before next winter read it again, then before the winter after next read it again, then . . . . . . . Retired after 25 years with the U.S. Forest Service, completion of The National Avalanche School, a few field classes in avalanche awareness, and traveling a thousand or more miles in snow covered mountain ranges, I keep this book close to my desk and read and study it, along with almost every &quot;Avalanche Handbook&quot; I've ever come across. This book relates the consequences of a powerful force which often has serious or fatal consequences. The danger is subtle, the indications of the hazard are difficult to read, but there are potential loaded weapons lying in wait all over those magnificent, beautiful, and inviting mountains. Some are just waiting for a trigger and that could be you.&quot;When I was young and first started in this business it really scared me and made me nerveous, then as I grew older, I learned and became more experienced.

These stories drive home the point that avalanches don't just happen to someone else, they can happen to anyone who puts themselves in bad situations. This book can help you recognize and avoid those bad situations. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Black Corporate Executives (Labor And Social Change)","review":"Since this book was first published in 1996, there has been at least some progress in terms of what Vernon Jordan calls &quot;signs of new opportunities&quot; as indicated by the appointment as CEOs of Kenneth Chenault (by American Express) and Richard Parsons (by AOL Time Warner). However, obviously, much more remains to be achieved in a society which still relies so heavily on gender-specific adjectives (e.g. female jockey) and hyphenated descriptives (e.g. Lilliputian-Americans). Let us all hope that Chenault and Parsons were selected wholly because they were best-qualified to provide the organizational leadership needed. Period.The subtitle of Collins' book (&quot;The Making and Breaking of a Black Middle Class&quot;) implies -- to me, at least -- initiatives which were consciously and deliberately expedient. That is to say, in response to various pressures (especially from the federal government) on many corporations in the late-1960s to create access to career opportunities previously denied to black executives. These same corporations then &quot;racialized&quot; the positions many black executives occupied by limiting their responsibilities to supervising Affirmative Action programs, cultivating &quot;special markets&quot;, and solidifying relationships with minority customers. In almost every instance, this eliminated them from the &quot;fast track&quot; to positions at higher levels within their respective organizations. Their income permitted what Dick Gregory once referred to as an &quot;Oreo lifestyle&quot; but job security was tenuous. I was curious to know: Was the emergence of a Black Middle Class, throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, more a perception than a reality?In an e-mail from her, she responds to that question. &quot;I really don't think the emergence of the middle class was illusionary at all. I think the socioeconomic gains were/are real but they are grounded in different sets of conditions than those that prop up whites. I think that its emergence and growth was, and still is, dependent on the continued support of public policies and social pressure. When I look at the Ken Chenaults and Richard Parsons of the world I see them as anomalies rather than as symbols of a a trend. In other words, I don't think these companies are going to integrate their power structures in a sustained way unless there's some type of external nonmarket pressure to do so. Of course, I could be wrong and, if so, I'll have to rethink my understanding of race relations in the business world.&quot;I was also curious to know to what the extent (if any) the demographics of black executives (male and female) have changed since 1996 when her book was first published. In the same e-mail, Collins observes: &quot;The demographic trends associated with the number of black executives is almost impossible to measure for several reasons. One, the best source (EEO1 data that surveys private employers) groups managers so that rank is obscured. Managers counted here could be the manager of a 7-11 food store or a CFO of a Fortune 500 company. Census data does have an &quot;administrator&quot; category, but that probably relates more to public than to private sector employment. This problem has been my nemesis and probably will continue to be so because I am forced patch together information from various sources and than draw inferences.&quot; Although the scope and depth of Collins' survey sample may seem insufficient to support her generalizations (i.e. two sets of interviews with 76 of the most successful black executives in Chicago's major corporations), she consulted extensive supplementary research resources which apparently confirmed what she learned from those interviewed.The Collins Web site features a statement which asserts that her analysis in this book &quot;challenges arguments that justify dismantling affirmative action. She argues that it is a myth to believe that black occupational attainments are evidence that race no longer matters in the middle-class employment arena. On the contrary, blacks' progress and well-being are tied to politics and employment practices that are sensitive to race.&quot; That brief excerpt refers to her analysis of circumstances almost two decades prior to 1996. It remains for each reader to read and evaluate Collins' book, then draw her or his own conclusions as to its relevance to circumstances today. I rate the book so highly because she addresses so many important issues which remain timely in 2001; also, because she raises questions which must continue to be asked, and then answered honestly, until such time that there is no longer a need to do so."},{"Title":"The Politics of Prudence","review":"Russell Kirk (1918-1994) was a dominant figure in the post-World War II revival of Conservative thought. Toward the end of his life, he gave a series of lectures at the Heritage Foundation which form the basis of THE POLITICS OF PRUDENCE. Like everything Dr. Kirk wrote, the POLITICS OF PRUDENCE is insightful and also a pleasure to read.The book is in a sense a summing up of Dr. Kirk's though and also a primer on Conservatism. Kirk describes 10 important events in Conservatism, 10 important Conservative books, 10 important Conservative thinkers, and 10 important conservatives. He also has chapters on the nature of Conservatism, Conservative foreign policy and the Conservative approach to various issues.Dr. Kirk's version of Conservatism is somewhat controversial. According to Kirk, Conservatism is not an ideology, rather it is an \\"attitude\\" reflecting \\"prudence.\\" Kirk defines ideology as a type of secular religion. For this reason, many libertarians have criticized Kirk for reducing Conservatism to an \\"attitude\\" rather than a coherent ideology that is able to confront statism. I don't agree with Kirk's definition of \\"ideology,\\" but it is important to note that Kirk supported free enterprise, and limited (and decentralized) government. Although he wasn't supportive of libertarianism (which he critiques here in a somewhat off the mark essay), he was no apologist for the state.Two essays stand out here. In \\"The Neoconservatives: An Endangered Species,\\" he makes the now-famous statement that \\"And not seldom it has seemed as if some eminent Neoconservatives mistook Tel Aviv for the capital of the United States.\\" In \\"Toward a Prudent Foreign Policy\\" he criticizes the first Gulf War as a \\"war for an oil-can.\\" No doubt Kirk would have opposed the recent Gulf War (and been denounced as an \\"unpatriotic conservative\\" by the nitwits who now pass as deep thinkers in the conservative movement.For an even more basic summary of Kirk's thought, see his book THE AMERICAN CAUSE, which has recently been republished by ISI."},{"Title":"The Politics of Prudence","review":"I became a conservative long before I knew what a conservative was, exactly. In fact I didn't know what a conservative was EXACTLY until reading this extremely helpful and clear book. Kirk takes for granted that his readers - or, as other reviewers have pointed out, listeners - will already have read his magnum opus THE CONSERVATIVE MIND, though I had not, and others need not. This work is the more elementary of the two, and to a beginner the more helpful.Of particular usefulness is his careful distinction between conservbatives and libertarians, and between conservatives and neoconservatives. It had puzzled me for years why neo-cons who I thought of as &quot;almost&quot; conservatives were nonetheless saying in public such appallingly stupid things. Now I know.By all means, son't stop with this book. Look up his recommended readings and plunge in. Though most are obscure, some can be found in libraries, others at Amazon, and a couple of REALLY hard-to-find items can be gotten at Project Gutenberg, that extraordinary (free) internet resource."},{"Title":"The Politics of Prudence","review":"Kirk is indeed the father of 20th century American conservatism. This book serves as both an excellent introduction to his foundational writings and to conservatism, properly understood, itself. If you want to study conservatism you couldn't do better than starting with this fine collection of essays."},{"Title":"The Politics of Prudence","review":"If you want to know what conservative core principles are there is no better place to begin than this hugely enjoyable and fascinating compilation of the work from our latter-day Edmund Burke. He has shaped my thought and guided my study of conservative political principles for some time now and it is high time a younger genertion rediscovered the works of this magnificent man. His erudition is a perfect match for his charmingly old-fashioned writing style. You might want to follow up a reading of this work with either \\"The Roots of Order\\" or \\"Eliot and His Age.\\""},{"Title":"The Politics of Prudence","review":"This book was the first one of Kirk's books that I read. I consider Kirk being one of the most inspiring writers when it comes to politics, but sometimes a bit unclear. The chapter on libertarianism offers a quite narrow presentation of the libertarians, and sometimes when it comes to practical action Kirk might be too close to the laissez-faire-liberalism that dominate much of the contemporary conservative thought in the US. &quot;Ten Conservative Principles&quot; is a very good consenation of conservative political and social thought. &quot;The Cultural Conservatives&quot; and &quot;Towards a Prudent Foreign Policy&quot; are other great chapters. In it's whole, I think this book is a good introduction to the contemporary conservatism in the US."},{"Title":"The Politics of Prudence","review":"Another reviewer said it best, this is \\"Conservatism 101.\\" Kirk offers an overview of conservatism and the movement in the 20th century. The pillars of conservatism are an embrace of tradition, upholding limited government and ordered liberty. Moreover, he makes a good point, in quoting Hughes, he purports that conservatism is not an ideology, but the negation of ideology. Kirk offers a bittersweet assessment of libertarians and their limitations and flaws as he perceives them. He elaborates on the Humane Economy posited by Swiss economist Wilhelm Roepke. Roepke stands opposed to the \\"colossal\\" mass welfare state of big business, big regulation and the proletariat masses. A humane economy rests on the principles of subsidiarity and distributism (widespread distribution of private property) while the state doesn't displace or usurp the role of civil society and its humane institutions. Kirk writes an obituary for the so called neoconservatives, though this maybe wishful thinking at best, since unfortunately the late Russell Kirk is dead, and well the neocons have taken over the conservative movement. Kirk also brings the ideas of Richard Weaver and southern conservatism to the table. All things considered, this is a good volume and a good introduction to true blue conservatism, though not Kirk's best."},{"Title":"The Politics of Prudence","review":"This book could not be any more useless. I can see why only a conservative press would publish it. What a weird little cult the Kirk cult is. Definitely avoid this condescending, yet unlearned author."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"Maybe I missed something but there is little in \\"Stock Market Jungle\\" that would be new to anyone with minimal institutional experience. Mr. Panzer, however, does a great job of having many of his ex-clients and colleagues give glowing reviews about the book...although I'd be willing to bet that most of them did not read the book."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"I didn't warm to this book. The author seems to lament the 'good old days' when individuals were forced to relay their orders through brokers. This offered brokers a wonderful insight on the directions markets would take since they had first hand information about the next day's trading session, from the best and worst traders. A broker can make a lot of money with that.Alas, these days are gone. People now use electrical order placement systems and brokers are just as clueless as the retail traders. Pity. Of course, few of us had this inside track and I'm not sure we need to lament its passing.The musings described above make up the bulk of the book. Here is a summary of the changes. Each of these topics is given chapter long treatment.:Intraday volatility:New rule: Intraday share price volatility is on the rise.Old rule: In the past, wide intraday share price swings were less common, and when they did occur they were often associated with unexpected geopolitical or economic developments.Trading like commodities:New rule: Stocks are increasingly being bought and sold like commodities.Old rule: In the past, institutions generally bought and sold stocks based on traditional methods of investment analysis, often with a longer-term perspective in mind.Approaches and attitudes:New rule: Investing and reason frequently give way to speculation and emotion.Old rule: In the past, institutional buying and selling was primarily driven by logic and measured analysis (although emotions have always influenced investor behavior).Information and communications.New rule: More information and faster communications often have unexpected consequences.Old rule: In the past, information tended to circulate around the marketplace in a slower and more orderly fashion, and the telephone was the primary means of communication.Derivatives:New rule: Derivatives are exerting a growing influence on share prices.Old rule: In the past, the action in the derivatives market was generally secondary to what took place in the underlying cash markets (except on certain occasions, such as Triple Witching Fridays).Seasonality and cycles.New rule: Many seasonal and cyclical patterns are becoming less predictable.Old rule: In the past, many seasonal and cyclical patterns were less widely known and were not affected by today's rapidly changing market forces.Form and fantasy.New rule: Substance and reality increasingly give way to form and fantasy.Old rule: In the past, data produced and distributed by companies, analysts, government agencies, and others was less subject to error, distortion, and manipulation.Market Indicators:New rule: Many traditional market indicators are becoming less reliable.Old rule: In the past, many market indicators were less widely known and were not affected by today's rapidly changing market forces.Global factors:New rule: Global factors and foreign investors are exerting a growing influence on share prices.Old rule: In the past, American investors and domestic concerns were much more relevant to the direction of U.S. share prices than overseas influences.The book is also sprinkled with 'action plans'. Here are few:\\"...when a stock abruptly breaks out of a clearly defined trading range on relatively heavy volume, creating visual \\"gaps\\" on a daily bar chart, this is often a sign that a dramatic change in the outlook has taken place.\\"\\"When volatility begins to intensify after share prices have fallen for an extended period of time, it often indicates that a downtrend is nearing an end, at least in the short run.\\"None of this interests me a great deal. Upon reflection, the title suggests a much better book, something along the lines of 'Post 2003 changes in securities trading rules, and how to use them for competitive advantage'. This book would investigate the surreal world of Sarbanes-Oxley, how securities are added/subtracted from the Russell 2000, etc."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"I thought this book was very well written and extremely insightful. I have been working in the financial markets for nearly twenty years and agree with the book's premise that the rules of the road have drastically changed over this time period. Mr. Panzner does a very credible of job explaining what is different about current financial markets and why some of the old indicators and maxims are no longer useful. More importantly, he provides some very useful advice on how to increase the chances for long term success in an increasingly short-term oriented world.I rated this book a 5 out of 5 and believe it to be a must read for anyone who serious about investing."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"This book gives serious investors the sorts of gritty, first-hand insights we have been looking for (but can't seem to find in too many other places).I am impressed with the way the author has taken a series of seemingly unrelated developments (e.g., falling commission costs, the growth of the Internet, electronic trading, the rise of hedge fund investing) and analyzed how they fit together in a broad sense, as well as the impact they are having on the day-to-day action.Best of all, the author offers terrific advice throughout the book that clearly reflects the wisdom of someone who has learned (the hard way?) what it takes to make money in the stock market.In my opinion, New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle is well worth the investment."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"I really found that Mr. Panzner did a fantastic job researching and writing this book. Not only did he touch upon some of the larger evolutions currently taken place (ie. increasingly global market place), but he also shed light on some of the gray areas such as volatility and emotion. Furthermore, as one who loves the English language, I appreciated his flowery and sometimes wordy style of writing. It is very different from the concise 'business writing style' I see day in and day out."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"I enjoyed this book and got a lot out of it. The author's insights on how short-selling and derivatives affect stock prices were particularly interesting, as was the chapter on global influences.It seems like those who gave negative reviews either didn't read it or were trying to prove something."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"The most appealing aspect of this book is the thesis itself -- the investment world is changing. This is the first book I've read that effectively addresses many of the cause-and-effect relationships taken place in today's stock global market. I thoroughly enjoyed the derivatives, trading like commodities and the global factors chapters.Overall, I found this book to be a very good read."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"Investment pro Michael J. Panzner offers an insider's guide to Wall Street that will appeal to investors on several levels. He starts with easy-to-comprehend definitions of stock market terms such as \\"short-selling\\" and \\"equity-derivative products,\\" and advances to more sophisticated concepts. With his down-to-earth approach, he demystifies the jargon, hype and superfluous data. What's more, he provides an excellent account of the historical factors and recent innovations that have altered global finance. His \\"10 laws of the new investment universe\\" are useful and comprehensive. Unfortunately, Panzner tends to glorify the past, glossing over well-documented foibles to focus on modern sins. Still, he provides a frank and insightful view of Wall Street's seductive lure. We recommend this book to investors who want to understand today's market."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"I bought \\"Stock Market Jungle\\" after reading some of the favorable reviews. The book is helpful for those who need an introduction to changes in the industry. This book does not shed any new light on current issues facing the industry. One has to question the credibilitly of any market professional that tells you that this book is excellent or insightful; either they are being deceitful (not to surprising when you consider the source!!!) or they shouldn't be in the financial industry because they obviously haven't been paying attention. I suppose the glowing reviews were more disappointing to me than the book."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"My reason for purchasing this book was because a number of experienced and well-known markets participants gave great reviews for Stock Market Jungle. Don't make the same mistake I made. I doubt that most of the reviewers listed in the book actually read it. The book itself adds little to anyone who is the least bit knowledgable about the financial industry. Your time would be better spent reading any one of a thousand other business/financial books."},{"Title":"New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle","review":"While the basic premise of the book is that \\"investing world has changes and therefore so should you\\", is certainly true, it doesnt really bring anything original or substantially novel. The author discusses in great detail, well supported by data and analysis, the impact on different aspects or the new \\"rules of the jungle\\". Topics such as as increased appetite for speculation are well know now, but the facts behind those conclusions are explained in a detailed manner. Overall, it is an interesting treatment of the topics, though brevity is not one of the author's strong points. Dont expect to find any significant information that will alter your portfolio, but it may give you some info on how things work in stock markets and some of the trends associated with trading. Could have been a 4 or 5 star book, but the arguments and explanations are a bit too long-winded...."},{"Title":"The Science in Science Fiction","review":"Twenty years ago Australia's expert on science fiction, Peter Nicholls, wrote this unique and informative book about the well-known ideas in science fiction's stockpot. In a way, it's ironic that an Australian should have written this book. The publishing of science fiction in Australia is on nothing like the scale of America or Britain, but we've got a core of talented writers making themselves known. There's more to Australian culture than a love of sport.Unlike the TV shows that explain how a magician does his tricks, &quot;The Science in Science Fiction&quot; is not a book that tries to take the sense of wonder out of an imaginitive genre. Rather, it discusses the viability of ideas which science fiction writers commonly exploit, e.g. time travel, hyperspace or cloning, describing how these things may be achieved in the future, and the steps scientists are currently taking to make fact out of fiction.If there is one thing this book teaches us, it is that we shouldn't be too dismissive of things that sound like idle day-dreaming. There was a time not so long ago when people scoffed at the idea of walking on the Moon. Look where we are now. Unfortunately, it is also possible for us to bring about the end of the world with those much talked about &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;.Towards the end the book does provide a list of failed predictions and wrong science. Quite rightly, Nicholls points out that the space craft in &quot;Star Wars&quot; would be inaudible in space and that laser beams would be invisible, but he does concede that films like &quot;Star Wars&quot; would be less fun if they stuck too rigidly to the facts. Invisibility sounds great until you realise that invisible retinas would result in blindness.It is interesting to read about the section on cloning, because at the time of writing no one had yet succeeded in the cloning of mammals. It would be another fifteen years before the controversy over Dolly the Sheep erupted. This information about cloning is accompanied by an amusing illustration of two Ali clones in a fierce boxing match.Science fiction has provided a wealth of inspiration for both writers and artists. Things may not be achieved in the way they imagined, or in the time that they predicted, but we can still accept the phrase &quot;all things are possible&quot;."},{"Title":"The Science in Science Fiction","review":"&quot;The Science in science fiction&quot; effectively presents how SF is based in solid fact. It explains, often in detail, how SF ideas and technology are based on real-life scientific advances and cutting-edge research. Excellent colour illustrations and detailed examples from SF novels round out the no-nonsense links the author traces between fact and fiction, leaving readers with the impression that what many pass off as &quot;fantasies&quot; may one day be accepted facts. Writers, in particular, beginning writers of SF would find this book particularly useful in avoiding the impossibilities one all-too-often finds in new or lower-quality SF. Readers, too, will appreciate the simplicity of the layout and the directness of the subject treatment, and the non-technical layout makes it easier for the layman to understand. All in all, a very good book, although I was let down by the lack of speculation on possible future advances."},{"Title":"The Science in Science Fiction","review":"i had this book way back in india, this is where I learnt a lot of Sci-Fi stuff... A real conversation holder. love it"},{"Title":"The Science in Science Fiction","review":"The book is great, with great pictures and lots of detail, using both fiction and science to explore what can and can not be.

A good all-round volume."},{"Title":"Melymbrosia: A Novel","review":"Woolf's first novel \\"Melymbrosia\\" was completed in 1912, but wasn't published until 1915 under the title \\"The Voyage Out\\". Louise DeSalvo has pieced together this first manuscript to offer the public a glimpse into the early creative mind of Woolf. Following the same basic plot as \\"The Voyage Out\\" (a young woman's journey to sexual and emotional awakening), \\"Melymbrosia\\" is much more frank in its portrayal of politics and sexuality (including homosexuality). Another difference is the raw and unpolished feel that this early draft contains. DeSalvo chose to retain some of Woolf's errors in this version, and while this doesn't necessarily detract from the story, it does make the reader wonder about their inclusion. \\"Melymbrosia\\" is a fascinating and powerful look into Virginia Woolf's early writing and life that conveys the passions she felt for all aspects of life, which she felt she needed to mute to some degrees in order to gain acceptance."},{"Title":"Melymbrosia: A Novel","review":"This is an excellent addition to one's Woolf collection. I'm not certain if I would read it before reading her published works, but certainly afterwards, as it will add a lot of dimensions and insight to what you already know."},{"Title":"A Celtic Miscellany Hardcover","review":"An excellent little collection of Welsh and Irish poetry, including satire, elegies, romance, nature, and Celtic magic, as well a host of traditional ancient fairy tales and ballads. A fine little book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Oil Well Testing Handbook","review":"This book is very well written and would be a very useful on the shelf of Reservoir engineers who want to have quick look at the methods to do well tests on the available well pressure data. I found the explanations for the tests to be short, but then they are precise! You can use them to understand the subject pretty easily if you have a basic understanding.I'd not recommend this for a novice. You should have knowledge of reservoir engineering subject and maths (differential equations) if you want to purchase this book and use it. It is on the expensive side too.As for myself, i'd use this book as an when required as its difficult to remember all the tests and how they should be used (i'd not use the calculations myself - but its good to have).A nice purchase personally."},{"Title":"The Six-Spoke Approach to Golf","review":"One of the best instruction books to come along in years; the approach is simple, pragmatic, noncompromising and effective. From getting your body in golf shape to picking out the right equipment to keeping your mind in the present moment when on the course, Patri and Moran hit all the right notes. This is a must have if one is serious about improving all aspects of one's golf game."},{"Title":"The Six-Spoke Approach to Golf","review":"I found the book very informative and easy to read. It lays down a plan on how to improve your game and requires you to commit a half hour several days a week if you truly want to improve your game. Each chapter builds upon the previous one and I found it worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Six-Spoke Approach to Golf","review":"This book is the first coaching manual, I've seen, that covers the non-technical, as well as the technical, aspects of the game.

I usually don't read books more then 300 pages but this keep my entertained and interested. I never knew how much was going within Disney. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Part corporate behind the scenes, part soap opera, this book is a really enjoyable read. The book centers on Disney's former megalomaniac CEO and all the dysfunctional behavior going on in the company."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This book is a very eye opening piece. Nothing seems to be hidden or spared. It's written from a factual point of view, and although I have not completely finished it yet (about 3/4 through it) I have been surprised and amazed at the information presented. This book does not take the \\"let's jump on the pro-Disney bandwagon\\", nor does it take the stance of a \\"Disney is so awful\\" book, instead I feel that this book presents both sides of the tale (pardon the mouse tail pun), and discusses the backstabbing, deals and underhandedness whiloe also presenting things that were also positive during the Eisner years. It (so far as I have seen) is balanced in what it presents. I look forward to finishing this book to see what other surprises surface in the court battles and the conclusion. War was an appropriate title!"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I could not put this down. An easy read and fascinating look into the entertainment business by a superb author"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I puchased this book because I am a huge fan of anything Disney. Planning to read it for some inside information I was really happy to not only get that, but a really entertaining and readable story. It deals with inside corporate stuff but not in a boring sense and it reads more like you are enjoying a fictional story. Pure entertainment and something that any fan of Disney or a great story should read."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"A rather lengthy book (over 600 pages), but I found that I went through it much quicker than I ever imagined I could. Both me and my wife read it and just couldn't put it down. There really wasn't any boring parts to it and thats simply because Eisner did so much backstabbing and just plain afwul things to his underlings, you are constantly turning to the next page to see what happens next.About the only \\"complaint\\" overall is that there are just too many names to keep track of and what jobs they performed within Disney. This is no fault of the author's and actually a direct result of Eisner's non-stop turnstile of corporate executives. Eisner would hire/fire anyone at anytime (actually, he would never do it himself. He always would get some poor schmuck to carry out his dirty work even after he directly told the person getting fired that they were safe, etc).Having grown up watching Disney classics and visiting the parks, this book certainly raises your blood to the boiling point seeing how Eisner asserts himself as Walt Disney's equal, if not better. Stewart does clearly point out that although the Eisner/Wells team vaulted Disney from rags to riches in 10 years, the death of Wells pretty much spelled the end of Eisners good fortunre. However, that death of good fortunre makes for a great story and a superb job by Stewart to put it into book form. Anyone that can drive off the beloved namesake of the very company he works for certainly gives you an idea of the no questions asked power Eisner held over Disney's Board, the company, and its shareholder.Who else can not honor a contract, say you won't pay, reneg on a $90M settlement, and then have to pay $300M in court when you are found guilty?? Who could hire their best friend as President, fire them after 14 months, pay $140M in severance pay? Who could purchase a cable network with no real advisement, buy it at $5.2 BILLION, afterwards have your accounting dept. realize it is only worth $1.75 BILLION, and then not do a tax write off in order to save your shareholders MILLIONS of dollars? Who could do all of that and STILL remain Chairman and CEO of ANY company?Its pretty simple when you are Michael Eisner. These are just some of the things he did in this book that keep you wanting to read more.The book ends just as Eisner is asked to step down as Chairmen of Disney's board, but still keeps his CEO title. Its a shame that Eisner hung on awhile longer and that didn't make it to book. Even without it, I found it unbelievably fascinating and shocking that this kind of behavior finds a home in the board rooms and companies of America. But look no further than Enron to even worse, which is probably why Stewart picked that topic for one of his books, too."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"The book is a must-read for anyone who has a job in corporate America, without respect to the industry you're in. Eisner and the other characters bring real corporate intrigue to life, to which we can all relate. The games, the titles, the hirings and firings, the information sharing and hiding -- we can all relate to how this works in large brand corporations, and when it's exposed in the largest and most widely known brand, it's a riveting. Really a great read."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I was concerned when I purchased this book that it was a very long, corporate novel. I typically find non-fiction about big companies difficult to read and often give up before I've gotten halfway through the book. James Stewart, however, found a way to make this book easy to read - I even found myself wanting to stay up to see what happened next. The book doesn't paint a \\"magical\\" picture of the Disney Company during Eisner's reign, but I thoroughly enjoyed the inside look at the corporation and the behavior of its upper management. I even found myself looking at the corporation I work for in a different way after reading this book. One note, though: if you plan to visit any of the Disney theme parks after finishing Stewart's look into the company, I would recommend trying not to think about the book while you're there."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"James Stewart delivers another knockout story in Disney War. The book which is relatively fair to all who are portrayed goes behind Disney to show the break down of the company between Roy Disney and Michael Eisner. Roy's pettiness and Eisner's arrogance are brought center stage. The book even gives you a glimpse of the insane genius that is Jeffery Katezenburg (at least at this point he is not complaining about a gay mafia). This is a must read for anyone studying the movie industry or Disney as a whole. It is a fair and balanced look inside one of America's best companies. In order to really understand this company far more will have to be exposed but this is a good start to what will be an interesting story when it is all told."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This book is as entertaining and provocative as Bruck's \`Predator's Ball,' Burrough's Barbarians at the Gate,' and, for that matter, the author's \`Den of Thieves.' What could be better than a tale of greed, venality, hubris -- and Mickey Mouse?Advocates of unregulated markets and \`self-correcting' corporations may want to read this book, which is as colorful as fiction. Those who own Disney stock might want to avoid it."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"A sprawling book encompassing a (short) history of Disney, a detailed review of the major achievements and failures of Disney in recent decades and a character assassination of Michael Eisner (largely in his own words).A great read for anyone interested in the business side of Hollywood and creative industries, but be prepared for a long ride - it is *not* a short book or one to dip in and out of.The narrative is largely chronological, however it appears that at times the strict chronology is shifted slightly (perhaps for dramatic effect).Overall, recommended - most definitely one of the better Hollywood/business books."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Continuing along the \\"a pushover for anything Disney\\" trend, I picked up a copy of DisneyWar by James B. Stewart at the local library. As with so many companies these days, the external image is far different from the internal reality...Stewart was granted a level of access quite uncommon for someone who's not writing a puff piece on a company or CEO. In this book, he takes on Michael Eisner's reign at the helm of Disney. While it started off on a pretty positive note (say, the first decade...), it came crashing down hard in 2005 when Eisner was stripped of the Chairman title and pretty much forced to resign. Of course, that's not the spin you'll get from him, but that's the reality. Through interviews, research, and court transcripts, Stewart lays out a pretty damning picture of power corrupting an individual and nearly toppling a company. The book takes you right up to the point where Eisner announces his resignation at the end of his contract in September 2006. We now know that he actually walked away earlier than that, and that Iger did end up being his successor. But still, what a nasty divorce...Eisner comes across as an impulsive, psychotic CEO who has people reporting on conversations with others who aren't on \\"his team\\". His definition of truth was basically whatever he wanted you to hear at the time. Whether he's even capable of knowing the difference between the truth and his fantasies is still up in the air, but if even half of what Stewart wrote was true, you wouldn't want him running your company. And I suspect that far more than half of the book was accurate. It amazes me how little the public knew about what was going on, and how close Disney came to becoming just a part of some larger company as they floundered and their stock tanked. It also scares me how close the Disney image and brand came to disappearing as we know it.A great read which won't reinforce any positive images of modern corporate America or boards of directors. It's these types of activities by corporate leadership that has made me generally cynical about believing any explanation or spin of \\"facts\\". Worth reading..."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I have to be honest. The only reason I bought this book is because it was on sale at Costco. Am I ever glad I did. What an amazingly captivating page-turner. I kept expecting this book to slow down. It doesn't. It's unrelenting. You put this book down and it calls you to come back and turn some more pages.If only half of what is written here is true, Michael Eisner might go down in history as one of the worst villains in modern business history. But that's not the point of the book. While the tome is overwhelmingly anti-Eisner -- because the evidence is anti-Eisner -- the thing I most liked about this book was that Stewart seemed to take great pains to give a balanced portrayal, even when he wasn't required to do so. Like a good reporter/writer, he gives us the entire picture and lets us decide for ourselves.Like every good Disney story, this one has good characters and bad characters and those who fall somewhere in between. And, like most Disney stories, the villain gets his comeuppance. The one caveat I have (and this is a minor point) is that DisneyWar is the worst title for a book in recent memory. I wish they had spent as much time coming up with a captivating title as they did researching a captivating story. Again, this is a minor point that does not affect the content of the book itself.Read this book for yourself and see how Stewart keeps you glued to the proverbial screen to see what happens next. You'd have to be Dopey (or Eisner) to not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Disney War is an incredibly compelling, and most interesting, history of the Disney Corporation since 1984, during the \\"reign\\" of Michael Eisner as Chairman and CEO. Although Disney was not in limelight like Enron and Tyco, all the same dysfunctional elements of corporate governance existed at Disney -- but fortunately, the story had a better end. In spite of a board of directors that consisted mostly of Michael Eisner's patsies, the shareholders prevailed, and Eisner was ousted as Chairman. THis book is a must read for anyone who is concerned about leadership and proper corporate governance. It is a case study of how NOT to lead a corporation, and how NOT to run a board of directors. Those with eyes to see will learn many lessons from this book of how to do it right."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I have enjoyed many of James B. Stewart's books--The Partners, Den of Thieves--so I bought this on his reputation and I wasn't disappointed. His access to Eisner himself, his interviews with persons in and out of the company, plus, as he acknowledges, the unprecedented opportunity to see internal company documents because of the Katzenberg and Ovitz litigations, allow for a fuller and richer understanding of Disney's successes and failures than a reader has any right to expect. That this came out almost coincidentally with Eisner's announcement of his retirement and his successor, proving Stewart's point that the critical Pixar relationship might be saved if \\"anyone but Eisner\\" ran the company, made it all the more telling and timely.Stewart really strives to be fair to Eisner, even though he concludes in the end that he is a liar. He gives him credit when due for the successes of his early career and throughout his time at Disney. He has such a mound of evidence about his duplicity and inability to get along with others, plus his obsession with loyalty on the board, that I thought this might descend to the level of hate for the biographical subject that Robert Caro had in the second volume of his LBJ biography (Caro gave LBJ his due in volume III, too, by the way). Stewart never does; if in the middle of a list of failures he has a success, Stewart describes it, the mark of a good biographer.The one issue I wish he had dealt with in more depth was the curious success of Anne Sweeney at ABC, even though executive after executive leaves rather work with her. At the very end, she is taking credit for \\"Desperate Housewives\\" even though Susan Lyne was responsible for it (at the same time Eisner was criticizing Lost, since it was Lloyd Braun's baby). So who is she, why does everyone hate working with her, and how does she survive? It's odd that someone who figures so prominently in careers of persons whom Stewart featured is left as such an enigma. Doesn't detract from the book, but it would have been nice if it had been covered."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"One can't help but reflect on the irony as they read this book. The Walt Disney Company has always been presented as a place of great joy and happiness but behind the scenes it was far from the case. Author James Stewart shows how arrogance can topple even the most powerful people in Hollywood.Michael Eisner is one of those bosses you dread...totally miserable. As he becomes more entrenched in the company, his arrogance grows. Eisner is one of those employers who are never happy with anyone or anything even when things are going extremely well. Stewart shows how Eisner deliberately and professionally sabatoged the careers of at least three men who believed that he was their friend and benefactor. As a result, the Walt Disney Company paid hundreds of millions of dollars in court costs when folks like Jeffery Kazenberg sued and won.Eisner's ultimate undoing came at the hands of Roy Disney, Walt's gentle unassuming nephew who was badly underestimated by just about everyone who had business dealings with him. Disney originally brought Eisner to his family's company but when Eisner tried to force him off the board years later, the nephew took his case to the public and shareholders. As a result, Eisner annouced he will be stepping down next year.Aside from Roy Disney, there are very few individuals in this story who are sympathetic. But Stewart tells a fascinating tale."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"You think you know something about the making of movies from watching DVD extras? Think again. Great story, holds you riveted to the unwinding sucess and failures of corporation men who rule the movie business. James B. Stewart tells it like it is..masterfully."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"If you like spending quality time with highly intelligent yet emotionally retarded multi-millionaires this book is for you. Very well written, well researched, no argument there, but honestly, after 100 pages you wonder why you're even reading this. There isn't a sympathetic character within 100 miles of Burbank. Everyone lies. Everyone's greedy. Everyone's unhappy. Everyone's earning a gazillion dollars. I suppose Roy Disney's got some integrity, but he unleashed these dogs on Disney in the first place."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Holy smoke! The stones on this guy!James Stewart's \\"Disney War\\" makes it ABUNDANTLY clear that Michael Eisner was at times a talented and creative executive but also a severely flawed human being. No amount of business acumen or success can compensate for his pettiness or his dangerous and odd mixture of arrogance, manipulation, hubris, self-entitlement, insecurity, passive-aggressive behavior, disloyalty, or self-delusion. This man is Shakespearean and Dickensian in scope. He is Ebeneezer Scrooge, Richard III, King Lear, and Henry VIII all wrapped up in one huge and distasteful sociopath of a package.If you ever get the chance to work under Michael Eisner, run the other way as fast as you can!Great book, Stewart. Loved reading it and appreciate the abdominal workout it gave me from having to bend down and repeatedly lift my jaw up off the floor time and time again after learning of Eisner's numerous and continuous and seemingly never-ending line of boneheaded moves, lack of social graces and personal ethics, and disastrous business relationship strategies.I didn't think people like Eisner were even possible -- SURELY monsters like him would have been weeded out long before they could reach that level of embarrassment to the company and the industry. I guess not. Eisner is the poster boy for every evil and shallow show business cliche you've ever heard. I'm still not convinced he was a real flesh-and-blood human being. I think he was built in a lab from parts of famous movie monsters and the world's most hated and feared despots and dictators.This book is a fascinating read about the kind of business executive that nightmares are made of."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Boy is this is a soap opera! It's 500 pages of unrelenting detail. Don't read this book if thinking hurts your head. The author covers a lot of space and paints a vivid picture of the modern CEO - rapacious, egomaniacal, and totally devious.Ironies abound.Example 1, Walt Disney has been portrayed as an anti-semite or even a pro-Nazi (cf. Marc Eliot's book). Then his successor - Eisner - brings in a panoply of jewish executives (Katzenberg, Ovitz,the Weinsteins, Shapiros, Bornstein, Iger et al - and this is a short list). Of course, Eisner in his dementia considers most of them threats to his hegemony and many are either fired or forced to leave the company. Eisner can make friends (he's a charming guy) but he can't keep them.Example 2, Roy Disney (Walt's nephew)and Ron Miller(Walt's son-in-law)are fighting over the Disney legacy and Roy brings in Eisner to subvert Miller's position as head of Disney. Miller is driven out and Eisner takes over with Roy's approval. Then after a decade or so, Roy decides Eisner is no good and then he tries the same trick on Eisner he used on Miller. Eisner eventually steps down. Of course, he pretty much screwed Disney over on his way to making hundreds of millions of dollars so I don't have much sympathy for him.Example 3,NBC's Don Ohlmeyer called Ovitz the anti-Christ and Ovitz bawled that this remark was anti-semitic. How sensitive. Yet the Weinstein brothers produced Disney's flagrantly anti-Catholic movie \\"Priest\\". Also, once, an enraged Eisner refered to Steve Jobs of Pixar as a \\"Shiite Muslim\\".Read Schweizer & Schweizer's \\"Disney - The Mouse Betrayed\\" for some details not covered in this book."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"James Stewart is the best business writer working today. After reading one of his books, whether Disneywar or Den of Theives, it's hard to read any other narrative journalism. His books are written in such a convincing and understandable way that the Enron exposes seem dry in comparison. I'm not a nonfiction reader, but Disneywar held my attention all the way through, and I remember most of the details and anecdotes from it even now, a full year after I read it."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Could Walt have imagined how ugly his namesake company has become under the watch of Michael Eisner. James Steward, the author, provides a wonderful distillation of court papers, interviews, recordings, newspaper articles, etc. that he gathered to weave together a story (how Disney-like!) that is very readable, enjoyable, even spellbinding in places.MBA students, both experienced workers and babys just out of college should find this book on their required reading lists. It is not overly long, and you will find that Stewart pulls you through the occassional tedium by using dialogue and emotion to show how stock positions, hostile takeover bids and accounting issues affect real, live human beings. Eisner's mercurial decision-making process and temper, Katzenberg's lack of social graces and hardheadedness, Roy Disney's determination and toughness, the ineptitude of most of the board; Stewart uses his skill as a writer to bring us into the thinking and feelings of titans of the entertainment industry in an engaging manner. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Stewart does a terrific job of reporting and writing here -- the book kept me up past bedtime more than once, wanting desperately to find out what happened next. (Which is pretty remarkable, given that, from reading the business pages, I already kind of knew.) He gets a bit bogged down toward the end, when he reaches the present day, perhaps because that's the time period when he was doing first-hand, on-the-scene reporting. But it's still a great read, and a potent reminder that Hollywood (or any business) really is just high school with money."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Whether you own stock in Disney or just want to know the corruption that exists within the working framework of Disney, then this book is for you. Excellent details and investigative analysis of one of the biggest corporations in the world. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This is a terrific book about corporate governance and internal politics at Disney. The book chronicles Michael Eisner's reign at Disney from his being named CEO of the then sleepy corporation to the shareholder revolt that may have led to his decision not to renew his contract in 2006. Stewart is able to draw from a treasure trove of source material, ranging from personal interviews with most of the top management of Disney and access to tens of thousands of pages of depositions and e-mail material made available from court actions surrounding Ovitz and Katzenberg. The book is well written and, despite the tremendous controversy surrounding Eisner, seems fair in its overall tone and critical conclusions.Much has been written about the book's expose of in-fighting among Disney's top management and the passivity, and control by Eisney, of Disney's board. Indeed, this is one of the best researched books about the management of large, public companies I have read. I was amazed at Eisner's ability to drive through multi-billion dollar acquisitions, first of ABC/Capitol Cities and then (and more disastrously) of the Fox Family cable channel, with little to no discussion with the company board and, from reading Stewart's account, little due diligence. Eisner also appears to have invented the strategy of compensating top executives with low base salaries but massive grants of share-options, which ended up rewarding Eisner with over $700 million in compensation over his 20 year reign. There is no doubt from reading this book that the \`high powered incentives' created through this system produce tremendous dedication and commitment from Disney's top management to the company. But at the same time one does question whether this system has any teeth, given the board's willingness to continue providing generous bonuses to Disney's top executive ranks despite dreadfully poor performance between 1997 and 2002.Finally, this book has excellent material for anyone interested in the management of creative industries. I didn't know that Eisner was brought to Disney primarily due to his record in managing the decision-making process over film and TV development, first at ABC and then at Paramount. At Paramount Eisner created the \`high concept' strategy of movie development. Using a baseball analogy, Eisner often refers to this as the \`singles and doubles' strategy of development, in which low-budget movies focused on clear, easily explained plots are given priority. The book contains many fascinating scenes documenting Eisner's involvement in decisions over development decisions. For example, a device used early in Eisner's reign was the \\"Gong Show', in which large numbers of plot ideas were presented and most summarily dismissed, in the hopes of uncovering one or two good ideas to push into development. I was surprised at the level of involvement Disney's top executives, including Eisner, had in creative management decisions. Eisner seems most at ease in these scenes (reading scripts, attending screenings, etc.). While he may be ultimately judged for success and failures in high-profile acquisitions, or for the mismanagement of his relationship with Katzenberg and then Ovitz, the mostly successful management of creative decision-making at Disney may be the area where the most value was created for the company, and where other aspiring managers within creative industries have the most to learn."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"...and Disney War had me lamenting why poor Michael Eisner had suffered from heart troubles -- after reading through the beautifully-crafted pages of this title, I quickly got to understanding a \\"day in the life\\" of the Hollywood Studio Executive. Not a job for the passive...With more twists and turns than a maze, author Stewart does a tremendous job of chronicling precisely how the former Disney CEO rose from unsullied grace to pathetic disgrace in a matter of two decades while at the helm of the once-fabled studio, the legacy of Walt Disney's fertile and fantastic mind.Reading through all the source material, which Stewart so keenly supplies and deconstructs within this particular work, I was stunned to discover the absolute pettiness of the people who are mainly responsible for the nation's filmed and other mediated entertainment -- to imagine that people who wield such tremendous authoritative and media-based power can be so darned catty and disgustingly petty -- I guess the higher up you go, the more rarefied the air becomes. With less oxygen channlled to the brain, the quantity and quality of corporate shenanigans seems to increase...I commend the author fully for succeeding in collating the wealth of archival and documented material, and for gifting us -- his readership -- with such privileged access to the happenings at the countless shareholder meetings, ad hoc discussions, and formerly confidential for-your-eyes-only emails and memos that Disney people, of past and present, had disseminated over the course of two decades of Michael Eisner tenure -- especially during his final five years, when things paced at their most frenetic.Stewart paints former CEO Eisner as such a predictable petty-crat that it mustn't have been all that difficult to predict the former studio exec's next move. At least, Eisner appeared to be some sort of man-on-a-mission juggernaut, ready to take down all comers. The fact that he held on in such a mode for as long as he did speaks to his command of the leadership position.Plus, as the author indicates in several spots within this narrative -- Eisner had been keen to document nearly all of his moves by email and memo and in numerous other places, which only served to facilitate the compiling of an accurate account of the past.One gets to thinking that it was part of Eisner's grand scheme all along. His last laugh, as it were.I reached the point in this excellent assemblage of narrative non-fiction where Eisner explained to the scribe one afternoon over lunch that \\"D'isney,\\" the surname, was in fact the French-ified pronounciation of \\"Eisner,\\" sans the leading \\"d,\\" biensur.I kind of knew at that point that things were doomed for the former CEO -- even though we already knew the outcome of this sordid little tale, the magic in Stewart's recouting of it was that you never quite knew *how* it happened.I wonder how the author might have felt right at that precise moment, as Stewart was noting this particular event in the storyline, taking copious shorthand, and then looking up from his lunch of spagetti al pesto, or what have you, to notice Eisner's grave face staring right back at him, stone-cold serious about this gobsmacking revelation.It must have been a precious moment indeed..."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Remember eighth grade? Relationships were fickle and fleeting. Perhaps you had a good friend. And maybe one day the friendship veered in the wrong direction. Who knows why. Unkind words were exchanged. Someone leveled ugly slurs about someone's mother. Icy hallway stare-downs ensued. Emissaries were called in to mediate. There was frantic note passing in fourth period math class --- an effort to arrange an after-school summit among the power players. But, of course, the relationship could not be salvaged. Years later, you looked back on eighth grade as a lot of contrived drama --- energy wasted on nothing, really. James B. Stewart -- in his engrossing new book, DISNEYWAR --- tells us, in excruciating detail, that under Michael Eisner's stewardship the powerful corridors of Disney Inc. were not very different from eighth grade.Eisner made his mark as the golden boy of the ABC television network in the 1970s. A young, creative executive, Eisner developed some of the most-watched shows on television, including \\"Happy Days\\" and \\"Laverne and Shirley.\\" In his high-profile job, Eisner became a hot property in the corporate world. His ascension at ABC led to a top job at Paramount film studio. At the time, the house of Mickey Mouse was in disarray. Disney was badly off-course in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Roy Disney, Walt's nephew, sat on the Disney board and was eager to bring Disney back to greatness. He and fellow board member Stanley Gold decided Eisner was the man to restore Disney's glory. Roy and Stanley got their wish --- Eisner did restore the glory, and for many years he brought the company periods of immense wealth. But Roy and Stanley got much more than glory and financial security. They got the unimaginably weird world of Michael Eisner.Life was good for Disney shareholders in Eisner's early years. The live action and animated film studios were churning out hit after hit, including Pretty Woman and The Little Mermaid. The wildly innovative Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was a creative watershed and another financial blockbuster. On top of this success, the Disney theme park franchise enjoyed unprecedented prosperity. Eisner introduced a retail business --- stores hawking Disney wares --- that, like everything else at Disney, opened a financial spigot from which shareholders, employees and officers fed. Eisner became an unstoppable force, Wall Street's darling. And yet, as Stewart tells it, as a manager Eisner was stuck hopelessly in eighth grade hell.DISNEYWAR is mostly a chronicle of the snake pit culture that Eisner assiduously cultivated, and the consequences stemming from that. Lies, obfuscations, half-truths, and backstabbing were Eisner's preferred management tools. And these things came easily to almost everyone in Disney's executive suite. Eisner's lieutenants --- Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Ovitz, Sandy Litvack and others --- were, to a man, duplicitous, scheming and loathsome. In their wake, a trail of broken deals, ruined careers and, eventually, bad business decisions marked Eisner's tenure as one with mixed results, at best.James B. Stewart is a gifted writer. His rich material --- the intersection of Hollywood, power, and pathological men --- is used to great advantage, especially when the action is focused on Eisner's boardroom shenanigans. At times, however, Stewart strays far from course. He devotes too much time, for example, on meaningless rivalries among low-level executives. The pages on the rise and fall of the Disney-produced \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\\" is another low point that could have used a good edit. On balance, however, DISNEYWAR offers a fascinating peek into the brutal world that was Michael Eisner's Disney Inc., one that will appeal to the eighth grader in all of us.--- Reviewed by Andrew Musicus"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"and really anyone who has a deep interest in the Disney brand/art/works/etc. A compelling look inside one of our most beloved companies and at corporate politics and power structures."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Never before have I read such an epic drama with such a wide tapestry- betrayal, backstabbing, friendships shattered, arrogance. And it's all true, juxtaposed against the magic of Disney. I'm never going to watch any of the animated classics the same way again. This book covers the whole sweeping saga of the Eisner regime, from the golden \`90s to his great downfall. James B. Stewart does a masterful job of presenting Eisner fairly; a hundred pages in I was wondering if my loathing of the man who \\"ruined Disney\\" was justified. Its kind of sad how Eisner's character disintegrates as time passes. As such, Disney War is really a tragic tale. Its too bad Eisner was far from the only one hurt. If anything, this book is a reminder of how cutthroat this business world is, even the \\"wonderful world of Disney.\\""},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I purchased this book to gain an understanding of the rise and fall of Michael Eisner in the Disney organization. Not only did I get a full overview, with some very interesting details, of Eisner's career (how he came to Disney, what he did to improve the company, and then his ultimate fall) but gained other invaluable insight on the Disney Company and its major players throughout the years. I learned so much about how huge companies such as Disney function in terms of public trading, leadership and politics. Stewart definitely did his research, and I believe he fairly presented all sides of the arguements with effective footnotes, endnotes and proper credentials. It was SO interesting and although I am a Disney fan myself, I completely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about big companies in corporate America.

I did during the final few years the book cover had stock in Disney and was one that voted to without my vote from Eisner. After reading this book I am glad I did.This is some of the best investigative written with facts to back it all up. You find out how the magic begun and how it got all turned into making money over the people that worked so hard for the company. I could not put the book down and had to run to work and tell all the other Disney fans the news from my read the day before. You will also find out due to Eisner hiring and firing people whenever he likes is what ended up leading to the creation of DreamWorks.The only thing I would say is it is hard to maintain who everyone is and what they do and where they placed as they do pop in and out throughout the book. This is not the writers fault as this is just due to the players being changed and moved so often. I would recommend this book as a business education and corp corruption book."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This was an interesting read... it did very much read like a documentary. Alot of times, the public isn't exposed to the internal workings or scandals or fiascos of a company this size, and this very much got into it.I think things are much different now with more corporate governance, and more independence required throughout the organization, but this definitely gave some insights as to how things could/should be done, and telltale signs to look out for in your own company."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"James Stewart wrote DisneyWar with the knowledge and support of Michael Eisner. Eisner was initially reluctant to have an outsider see and write about the inner workings of Disney but apparently he overcame that reluctance. Now he probably regrets it.Not that it would have mattered in saving Eisner various high profile positions with the company. Despite many early successes the first ten years the story of Disney -- especially since 1994 -- has been much more dramatic and truamatic than anything they have put on a screen. As with all companies there are good decisions and there are bad decisions. But it seems with Disney, since 1994, the bad outweighs the good. EuroDisney has been a monumental bust. Many of their productions have not done well. The decision to buy Fox Family at far more than it was worth (I would love to see what Ruppert Murdoch's reaction was when Disney paid over $5 billion for that mistake) was another less than brilliant move. The acquisition of ABC has been more troublesome than it was perhaps worth. And on top of the Disney pyramid -- warts and all -- set Michael Eisner.Stewart writes a scathing denunciation of the corporate Disney that most outsiders may hear only rumors and bits and pieces. One had to figure that Eisner must have done something wrong to be ousted despite claims of great successes. What did he and his entourage do wrong to earn the wrath of stockholders?This book brings life to what could have been a dull study of corporate politics and in-fighting. This book would make for an interesting movie -- one that I doubt Disney would produce."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"James Stewart has done it again.

Anyhoo, this is really a facinating book, brings together all the stories of the feud and brings it into clear perspective.

I have always taken these movies for granted, not appreciating before reading this book how many fights and battles often go on before such great movies are out.Despite the negative tone, the book is a great inspirational read. A lot of lessons can be learned from the mistakes of Disney executives. The book also demonstrates how corporate politics are inescapable at huge corporations like Disney and they can be quite an invigorating challenge to deal with.The book felt too long and could have been made much shorter while still retaining the great stories and lessons.Still, Disney War is definitely a recommended read, especially for those who have entrepreneurial aspirations."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This is one of those \\"can't put it down\\" books that I really enjoyed. Incredible inside information about the inner workings at Disney and the power struggle put on by Eisner et. al. If you have any interest in Disney (or the workings of corporate America) this is a great book."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This morning I finished reading James Stewart's DisneyWar. Stewart's investigative journalism credentials are impeccable--the Pulitzer Prize is not, as they say, chopped liver--and the Walt Disney Company under Michael Eisner sure had its share of corporate intrigue to investigate. In the end one of Eisner's biggest mistakes seems to have been failure to recognize that old show business axiom, \\"Know when to get off the stage,\\" until it was clear that more than just the company, the state of the art needed to move on without him.As the book convincingly shows, if Eisner had left halfway through his reign he would have been hailed as one of the great CEOs in corporate history. Now, all his wins--and they are impressive--must be measured against the standard of his losses, and they are staggering.My favorite story in the book? Eisner writes in an email to Disney board members, about a film made by another studio and distributed by Disney:\\"Of course they think it is great. Trust me, it's not, but it will open.\\"\\"They\\" were Pixar, and the film was Finding Nemo. There's a whole stack full of reasons the board came to feel they couldn't trust Eisner, but that one stood out at me. Ifyou can't even trust the man who's supposed to be running Disney to recognize one of the greatest films ever made (of any kind), why are you paying him so much money?Although Eisner will be the one most stained by this book, it is not a simple \\"Michael Eisner bad, Roy Disney good\\" tale. Stewart makes the point that much of the latter's goodwill comes from his name and facial features, and that Disney the company is bigger than either of the two men.Near the beginning of the book Stewart quotes Eisner on the then-looming war with Iraq: \\"Surely Bush won't do anything so stupid.\\" Though he doesn't draw a direct paralell, I couldn't help but infer one as I read instance after instance of Eisner's mistrustful, controlling ways. But it is said that a hallmark of the good executive is that he has structured his company so that if he were to be hit by a bus, it would be able to remain fuctioning unimpaired.There, at least, Mr. Bush has it over Mr. Eisner."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I absolutely loved this book. First of all the people that Stewart is writing about are bigger than life. They are the Hollywood SHAKERS and the MOVERS. They are the people that dominate American culture. They make our movies, and they produce our television shows. They own our news channels.This book read like a novel. The author has a compelling writing style and compelling subject matter to go along with it. How could you not love this book - after all it's about Disney, the people that gave you Mickey Mouse, and Minnie too? There's scandals, and intrigue. There are big heavy egos trying to blow each other out of the industry. You are going to eat it up, no, more than that. You are going to love it.You meet all the players in this book, and the funny thing is that in spite of all the wealth and power that is displayed in this book, there are no happy people. A man like Michael Eisner (Chairman Disney) amasses a billion dollars, and he's still insecure looking over his back wondering who's going to put the knife in.Eisner to his credit along with Frank Wells created one of the most dynamic Hollywood teams in decades. Wells died an untimely death while helicopter skiing in 1994. With Wells' death, it seemed that the magic in the Eisner-Wells partnership died with it. Within a few years, the extraordinary growth in sales, and earnings that had been talked about in the 1980's takeover was gone.Eisner alone apparently, simply could not continue the magic. He had Jeff Katzenberg, a brilliant, egotistical (not a negative, every heavy in Hollywood is egotistical) producer running the movie studio for Disney. The problem was that Katzenberg wanted Wells' job, before the body was buried. Katzenberg keeps hammering Eisner to give it to him, and Eisner just won't do it. The two butt heads, and Katzenberg gets fired, and then the fun begins. There's severance pay to discuss, and this means lawyers, courts, judges, and testimony, and then there's David Geffen.David Geffen is one of the smartest men in Hollywood with a $4 billion net worth. He created Asylum Records, and then sold it, and created Geffen records, and sold that too. Over a 30-year career, he had an uncanny sense to figure out where the world was in terms of music, and then bring it to them. He's made movies, plays, and is a brilliant dealmaker. He's the richest man in Hollywood, raises $18 million for President Bill Clinton, and then recently goes public telling Hillary, \\"Obama is number 1 with me\\".Geffen is also one of Jeff Katzenberg's closest friends, and confidants. Geffen would call Disney CEO Eisner constantly, and tell him to settle with Katzenberg. Each time Eisner resisted, and each time Geffen would tell Eisner, \\"Whatever you settle for today, is the cheapest settlement you are ever going to make.\\" The bids just kept getting bigger and bigger until ultimately Katzenberg scored one of the biggest settlements in Hollywood history.Katzenberg then takes the settlement, and joins financial forces with David Geffen himself, and Steven Spielberg to form DreamWorks SKG, which Katzenberg ran as CEO for the three of them. What a story, it's a story without end, and continues even today.In this fabulous book, which you won't be able to put down, you will meet Steve Jobs of Pixar and Apple Computer fame. Eisner and Disney had an opportunity to buy half of Pixar for $10 million dollars from George Lucas, the Star Wars creator, and Eisner walked away. Lucas settling his divorce, sells to Jobs instead for $10 million, and years later Jobs sells the whole thing for $7 billion to who - WHY DISNEY OF COURSE.But wait - There's MOREThe author James Stewart does a fabulous job telling the story of Michael Ovitz the man who created the most powerful talent agency in Hollywood, Creative Artists Agency (CAA). Ovitz was Hollywood's ultimate deal man. Eisner always liked Ovitz, and their wives were best friends. Before Wells died, Eisner had discussed with Wells the possibility of Ovitz joining Disney. You can read the rest of the Ovitz story in the book.There's battles, yelling, screaming, power, anger, revenge, and it's all about Mickey Mouse. Where else are you going to find this kind of drama involving a corporation. The answer is NOWHERE.Eisner gets FORCED OUT TOO!!!Perhaps the best part of the story is the long process by which Michael Eisner gets forced out of the company that he completely rejuvenated with Frank Wells back in the mid 1980's. Very few visionaries know when it's time to quit. They don't quite realize when the creative juices are gone, or its just not as much fun getting up in the morning as it use to be.The arguments between Disney shareholder and namesake Roy Disney and Eisner went on for years. The clashes were private and the clashes became public. The laundry was hung out to dry for all of us to read about. In this final clash you learn about Eisner's brilliance, and his pettiness. His vindictiveness is evident for all of us to read about, and wonder.If you want to understand how an American icon like the Disney Company is managed and mismanaged, this is the book for you. If you want a page-turner that you just can't put down, written in an action packed style, than James Stewart's Disney War is in a class by itself. Get it in time for a weekend of fabulous reading. Good luckRichard Stoyeck"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I usually plow through all the books I read until the end. Even if they are dull, tedious or downright snore producing, I slog through. This book, however, defeated me. It begins promisingly with a droll description of the author's stint as the character Goofy in a Disney theme park. However, the author seems determined to chronicle every little spat, power play or fight that the big guns at Disney engaged in throughout the years. Eventually, they all blurred into each other. While egoisticalbehavior can be an entertaining topic, a little goes a long way.

Aside form the lack of corporate governance and the internal politics of the Company, what really impressed me about this book is the fact that no matter in what aspect, if you are part of something great, you can live that greatness and take advantage of it. All these executives that came from Disney and where part of successful projects such as Lion King or Aladdin or Toy Story went on to lead fantastic roles. I found that incredibly interesting and inspiring. In conclusion, a great read as a business book, an incredible tail of how a company went from nothing to greatness and how that greatness dissipated sooner than expected for lack of management and governance. Definitely a must read."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Stewart has done a remarkable job stringing together a compelling narrative from 1984-2006, when Eisner was head of Disney. The beginning of the book has tremendous momentum, but it does start to slow down towards the end. There are simply too many names in the Post-Katzenberg/Wells era, and Stewart should've found a way to keep some of the details out (way too many executives are named for the reader to keep track or care about them all). Compared to Michael Lewis, we can clearly tell that Stewart was trained as a lawyer, with an emphasis on meticulousness. Nonetheless, I finished reading this book in about a week (although I read the first 200 pages in the first couple nights) and feel it was worth my time. If the final half were trimmed a bit, I think this book would be considered as iconic as Barbarians at the Gates. Final comment: the amount of research that went into this book is simply astounding."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"As a former Walt Disney World Cast Member during the times when this book was written I can assure you that the way that James B. Stewart described Michael Eisner is honest, true, and bold. Disney employees were shaking in their boots when he was around. We had to refer to him amongst ourselves as \\"M.E.\\" (his initials) out of fear of being fired or retaliated against for speaking of him at all. He was a forbidden topic! \\"Did you hear what happened to M.E. today?\\" was a common phrase used among co-worker friends!I worked at what was then Disney-MGM Studios as a paid intern- don't get me wrong, I would never trade the experience for anything in the whole, entire world! It was mesmerizing and amazing, and it sent thrills up my spine to be so close to the \\"magic\\" and to be a part of the magic of Disney! We were making dreams come true! But our magical world was being threatened by a money-hungry monster called Michael Eisner.Every light has it's darkness. Michael Eisner started off well-enough, but after the death of Frank Wells, (essentially after the Lion King was released), he lost his way. Not only did the company lack a creative visionary, but Eisner became mean and ruthless. He once walked into a store I was working at in peak time (right after the \\"Fantasmic!\\" show) and demanded that the entire store be shut down so he could do his shopping by himself. He selected only a handful of employees to be in the room with him and his entourage and then proceeded to call everyone names and degrade them. He said, and I quote, \\"A bunch of trained monkeys could do their jobs just as well.\\" Then he had the audacity to smirk and giggle with his entourage of fools.There was no love lost between Disney employees and Michael Eisner- the love there was loooooong gone. He decieved us, he manipulated us, he degraded us- and he just stopped caring. We were especially livid when Michael Eisner kicked Roy Disney (Walt Disney's nephew) off of the board of directors because Roy (rightfully so!) challenged Eisner's lack of vision!We banded behind Roy Disney and his savedisney.com website and eventually justice was served. Michael Eisner was gone- large golden umbrella aside. He was gone and that's all that mattered. Roy could work on fixing the problems that Michael Eisner created. Unfortunately Roy passed away shortly after being reinstated to the board of directors. Our company- His company - rallied around him and he was our hero. I am proud to say I was there and a part of that epic fight of good versus evil... but good always wins in a Disney story. (And why would you kick Disney out of the Disney company anyway?!).This book is a definite recommend. You can truly see what corporate greed and lack of vision does to people. (Before I get any attacks, I am a conservative and I do support corporations, but there is a time when greed gets in the way of anything productive, and that - my friends- is what happened here. )"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I listened to this on audiobook, so I'll discuss the content and the production separately.Content:Maybe it's because I'm a trained historian, but I found myself mumbling, sometimes shouting at my kindle: \\"according to who?\\" \\"says who?\\" \\"you can't know that was what happened!\\" There was just too much dramatization in this non-fiction book, too much certainty about people's thoughts, beliefs and conversations to which the author was not privy. I couldn't relax and trust it. Some dialogue is needed to break up non-fiction, sure, but that should be clear transcriptions of interviews about the incidents (preferably from more than one point of view), or recordings from the time. If the author is going to insist upon dramatizing conversations and phone calls (including stage directions!), it needs to made clear upon whose information the author is crafting his scenes - without such attribution, the reader can neither trust the information as truth, nor enjoy it as biased gossip.I hate to say this (as someone who directed audio books for seven years) but I might have to get a print copy out of the library to see if it works better on the page than in audio - perhaps Stewart used footnotes to attribute/explain the liberties he took with dramatizations (though it should be in the main text.)Audio production:The production is not great. Every gap between sentences, paragraphs and even chapters has been viciously removed, often disturbing the flow of the narration and allowing no space for the reader to reflect and absorb. I, personally, found the Lawlor's accent and timbre a little strident for long listening, but that's subjective. What was disturbing was Lawlor's raging case of 'tag lag' - when a narrator allows the emotion of dialogue to continue into the tag so, \\" \\"Oh no!\\" she said.\\" becomes \\" \\"Oh no,\\" she said!\\" It's not a problem on occasion (though a good director aims not to let any slip through) but it's constant in this book (and probably made worse when the listener is pissed off by the dramatization anyway!)All in all, I think this book probably suffered for being made into audio :("},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Delving into the minds of ingeniousness and watching them tumble from high pillars.

Details many of the things that all CEOs have to worry about and grapple with on a day to day basis. This book re-ignited a passion for films that has been stagnant for quite some time, not just Disney, but film in general and the creative process that creates the fantasy world to which we all seek to escape. A great read!"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"As all of Mr. Stewart's work, this also was superb. I have worked in my corporate days for people similiar to Eisner, driven, intelligent, shrewd, and demanding; I have also worked for people like Eisner, egotistical, arrogant, selfish, petty, resentful, and vindictive. But Stewart is right on target when he points out the one characteristic which makes managers like him not only undesirable to work for but also unpleasant to associate with: his extreme dishonesty. I have always felt that dishonesty and lack of candor from senior management are the most ruinous traits which contribute to an organization's stagnation.In contrast, the integrity of Stanley Gold and the humility and virtue of Roy Disney are characteristics that promote the enriching environment for commercial and professional growth.I could not help but think of the tyrants of history who killed off their immediate subordinates for fear they might seize the throne of power."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"For starters let me say that this book isn't a quick read, it's in depth and covers so many different \\"characters\\" in the plot of the so called \\"Disney War\\" that at times I felt more like I was reading a convoluted soap opera than a profile of a corporate giant. That said - I was fascinated from cover to cover. The research that has gone into this book is phenomenally detailed and while not always flattering it was interesting for me to see that the petty problems smaller businesses have are present if not magnified in the companies we most admire and respect."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I was aware of the big picture issues with Disney from articles in the business press. But, I wasn't particularly aware of how truly Machiavellian Eisner was as a manager. If the book is to be believed, Eisner was in fact a horrible manager who had success because he had a great product and despite his corner office antics, the business overcame the obstacles. Of course, in hindsight maybe Disney did flourish because of the constant pressure from Eisner. Who can say for sure that their performance over time would have been better with more benign leadership.The book isn't bad if it is details and a chronology of events that you want. Stewart does fill in the details and did seem to have access to some private documents that gave the reader insight into what was happening in the executive suite. But, by the middle of the book I found that I was getting bored reading what seemed like a strict accounting of fact, after fact, after fact.What this book needed to make it a more enjoyable book was some outside perspective and some paragraphs that broke the monotony of \\"Eisner did x, y, and z and Executive John Doe felt betrayed...\\" Plenty of analysts, investors, actors, directors, writers, rival executives and competitors interacted with Disney over the years - didn't they have a view?Read this if you want a sense of what occurred at Disney during the Eisner era. But, if you want to be entertained while reading a business book (after the first couple of hundred pages) this isn't the book. If you want to be entertained while reading about boardroom antics and bad management read \\"Barbarians at the Gate\\" instead. (Maybe Stewart should make Disney War into an HBO film and inject some humor, like they did with the RJR story.)"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"A fascinating tale of making money, keeping power, and doing whatever a CEO can do to scrimp on a buck. If anyone ever wondered who was at fault on the Katzenberg or Ovitz sagas, wonder no more. Eisner shows himself to be a cutthroat business man that has loyalty to no one. He betrays each of his executives one by one and lies to all of them repeatedly. He isolates each division to maintain power and control over the creative process of each division. One would think that if he would have died when he had his heart operation that the company would have fallen apart. There is plenty of in depth material on how the Disney empire was built after Eisner and Katzenberg showed up from Paramount. They sure knew how to generate income from every source Disney owns. In the early years when billions were being made, Eisner just could not be satisfied with sharing credit with any of his executives. Eisner seems to not like any of his executives even though they are his handpicked choices. Ovitz and Katzenberg were just two of the arrogant princes to Eisner's throne, but they are made to look sympathetic next to the king. Not even Frank Wells when he was alive seemed to be close to Eisner. Eisner comes off as an egotistical tyrant that seems to have no friends in the world, he has only business acquaintances. Eventually all the Eisner inflicted turmoil and pain comes to haunt Disney. Once Katzenberg left, Disney was stuck with Eisner's creative ability which seemed to have went downhill since his Paramount stint. His bad decisions on new projects coupled with not paying his departed executives what their contracts promised, end up costing Disney plenty. Failures such as the Eisner led Euro Disney and losing distribution for Pixar are made to look as if someone else screwed it up other than Eisner. Just think, if he listened to Ovitz, Disney could have made over 30 billion from buying half of Yahoo. After the purchase of ABC, one wonders who was really at fault for all their failures. It appears that all the good people get fired. ABC President Bob Iger is made to look as Eisner's errand boy, and also as a person who could never run Disney as the CEO. All of the players in this book show that they have no ethics. They have no empathy for the working folks at Disney, whether they be actors or just general park personnel. They took as much money as they could get their greedy hands on and shared with no one. Now one knows why it's $60 bucks each to get in to Disneyland and $30 bucks for a lunch for two. Eventually Roy Disney and a few members of the board get revenge on Eisner, but what does Michael really care? He made over a billion dollars from Disney and retirement was getting close anyhow. Disney also has grown to a large diversified company under Eisner that is worth many times more than when he showed up. It loos like he will get his way soon with his successor no matter what the board really wants. A good read and great information on how corporate America really works."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This book is on the rise and fall, mostly the fall of Michael Eisner as boss man at Disney. In reading it I was reminded of Lee Iacocca saying that Robert McNamara coming to Ford was the best thing that could have happened to Ford at that time, and that Robert McNamara's leaving Ford was the best thing that could have happened to Ford at that time.It appears that Eisner's dealings with Disney fall into similar terms. When Eisner came into Disney his talents were desparately needed. His achievements in the first ten years were fantastic, the stuff of which legends are made. Everything he touched from movies, cable television, to the movement of movies to Broadway turned into gold. In the last ten years the glitter seems to have gone from his touch. In the last ten years Disney's financial performance has been pretty bad. It also seems that the executive suite has had a revolving door. Senior management comes in, and in turn are replaced, often at great cost.This book analyses and describes the full twenty years of Eisner's rule, but spends more time on the down side.I was left with the feeling that success spoiled Eisner. Perhaps he needed the sense of desperation that the company had when he was hired."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Ever wonder what the reality was behind the happy, smiling faces at Disney World -- not to mention those of Disney's top executives? DisneyWar tunnels into the dark catacombs of the enchanted castle to reveal the carefully hidden underbelly of one of the world's best-known corporations. From the heady days of hit movies like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast to the disastrous white-elephant construction of Euro Disney, from Michael Eisner's double crossing of his best friend, Michael Ovitz, to his fatal mistake -- underestimating the determination of Roy O. Disney, Walt's nephew -- James B. Stewart illuminates the entire odyssey that is Disney under CEO Michael Eisner. The book reads like a thrill ride at one of the Disney theme parks. You won't believe your eyes ..."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I honestly don't know whether this book is a total hatchet job on Michael Eisner, or if he is, in fact, a patholigical liar (among other things). Assuming this is all true (and it seems fairly well documented), I am amazed that he is STILL running this company (the Board cannot be anything more than a rubberstamp for him).As for the book, it is FAR more detailed an account of the story than I really needed to read, but I somehow kept working my way through the 530+ pages."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This book gives an interesting behind-the-curtain look at Disney during the Eisner years. It seems very well researched and the author's many first-hand interviews lend a great deal of credibility to the story he's telling. The author also includes lots of fascinating information such as Disney's split on the Lord of the Rings package (chap 12). The Weinstein brothers brought Eisner LOTR and even though Eisner turned it down, Disney still got 5% of the gross. The Weinstein Brothers got half of that 5% (1.25% a piece), so all parties walked away with a pretty penny.That said, the book has serious flaws that keep it from being a great read. The endless bickering and backstabbing at Disney gets tedious and becomes a laundry list of conflicts.Key details are missing that would have added to the story. For example, the author repeatedly tells us of Katzenberg's dismal performance at the box office with Disney live-action films, but rarely names the movies that bombed. Missing details like this frustrate the reader.Also, some widely publicized events are barely discussed. I was truly interested in Euro Disney and the financial bailout by Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal that made headlines. However, the Euro Disney problems are barely covered (maybe 12 total pages) and Prince Alwaleed isn't even mentioned!Essentially, this book is an interesting boardroom drama, but lacks the fun generally associated with books about the entertainment industry."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Reading DisneyWar, I went through a progression of emotions: fascination, disgust, and pity.This book is a fascinating glimpse into a pivotal twenty period for the Walt Disney Company. After the creative heights and business success of its years under Walt and Roy Disney, by 1984 the company had become moribund, producing mediocre films and fostering a work force that had become listless. The Company seemed ripe for dismemberment by corporate raiders.Into this environment to engineer a truly remarkable turnaround steps Michael Eisner, Jeffery Katzenberg, and Frank Wells. It is fascinating to see this team turn the company around, especially with a re-energized animation division producing a string of films to rival those from Disney's 'classic' era. The company rebounds, investors are happy, the Disney brand built around beauty, creativity, imagination, and high quality is restored.My fascination quickly gave way to disgust: Is the growing petty, shallow, suspicious, and two-faced toxicity depicted here really typical of modern corporate culture? The levels of deceit, the inability among executives to deal with one another honestly and fairly (there are notable exceptions of course), the treating of subordinates as pit bulls who should kill each other off, the layers being added upon layers of executive management with no clear lines of communications....well, I know the word dysfunction is overused these days, but it applies here. This certainly starts at the top since leaders (especially those with absolute power) set the tone. But it should be noted that most of the cast of characters here fail to come off well. Behind the facade of the \\"happiest place on earth\\" swam a pool of sharks. Who would want to spend any time with these people either professionally or socially?My disgust reading this book eventually turned to pity. It's hard not to pity those who, despite working for an American icon (for better and worse) beloved by millions and who are making phenomenal amounts of money while doing so, are essentially unhappy and insecure people. There comes a point where the spinners get tangled up along with those around them in their own webs of suspicion, insecurity, fear, and deceit. The inability of this crew to escape the Hollywood mindset is the great tragedy of the book.I gave this book four stars because it truly is a gripping, but ultimately unsavory read. The reporting is excellent, the research is exhaustive, and the writing is compelling and understandable to the lay reader. Recommended."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I have no idea how James B. Stewart accessed the documents and people important to this book, but he certainly nailed both aspects. How Michael Eisner has survived in the wake of failure after failure, after horrendous departures, betrayals and a multitude of misjudgements is a tribute to the guy's duplicity, treachery and manipulation of both management and board.Stewart once again establishes himself as an able and expert chronicler of our times. Hats off to Mr. Stewart!"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"James Stewart's \\"Disney War\\" is a compelling read made great by Stewart's uncanny ability to merge his obvious investigative skills with the deft pacing of a page turning thriller. Stewart traces the career arc of CEO Michael Eisner beginning with his rise through the ranks of the entertainment industry and into the present day, as a chief executive of more than 20 years at one of our nation's most venerable companies.In the interim there is enough palace intrigue to make Shakespeare and Puzo jealous. Sadly, Eisner comes off little different than managers or supervisors many of us have known, unwilling to take blame, but always glad to hoard credit (even when the credit is due others), paranoid, insecure, constantly undermining and constantly manipluting those below him. Of course, here the difference is that the manager is a CEO worth nearly $1 billion and the company is Disney.The litany of poor interpersonal relations Eisner had with senior executives, from Jeff Katzenberg to Mike Ovitz to Lloyd Braun and others reads like a who's who of the entertainment industry. Indeed, one of the great ironies of this book comes well toward the end, when the list of former Disney executives is itemized by Stewart along with their current roles, many as CEOs or senior executives with companies like Ebay, Yahoo, Dreamworks, Hilton, etc. Had Eisner even kept a handful of the many executives he chased off, the search for his successor would have been far easier. Shareholders who wish to consider Eisner's views of his now chosen successor, Robert Iger, may not leave with a very comfortable feeling. This distrust is then coupled, for the last third of the book, into a damning portrayal of the Disney Board of Directors, which comes off as feckless and indecisive, unwilling to cross Eisner, and for the few who do, a quick stripping of power occurs. Comcast's abortive 2004 attempt to acquire Disney is not given the full reporting it is probably due (though in light of the interest in getting the book out, it is perhaps understandable); however, the reader is given a good sense of the rapid decline of Eisner's power as disgruntled Disney family member Roy Disney and his lawyer Stan Gold, ratchet up the heat and secure a near 50 percent disapproval of Eisner at the 2003 Disney shareholders meeting.In addition to Eisner's questionable management skills, Stewart also sheds light on a litany of decisions that Eisner poo pooed (passing on both Survivor and the Apprentice) seemed to have little faith in (Sixth Sense, Finding Nemo, etc.), or were just reckless and bad (overpaying for Fox Family, Euro Disney). Eisner seemed little interested in the animation division when he took over, and Stewart clearly assigns almost exclusive credit for rescuing Disney animation from the brink to Katzenberg (a view largely verified when you consider that almost all the post-Katzenberg animation successes came from Pixar, not Disney, who merely acts as a distributor of Pixar films).The one question left unanswered by Stewart is perhaps unknowable, the internal, \\"what makes him tick\\" question that drove Eisner to litigate Katzenberg's severence (stewart suggests that what could have been a $50 million settlement ended up rising to 280 because of Eisner's intransigence), undercut his chosen #2 Ovitz and then allow him to leave after 18 months to the tune of $140 million, and the revolving door nature of upper management around him. Stewart damns with faint praise by leaving until the end the \\"greatest hits\\" bullet points of Eisner's tenure, the exponential expansion of the company's market cap, share value, etc. and instead spends most of the 500 page book (which by the way reads quickly) detailing the many slip ups, miscues and bad decisions of the Eisner era. Self-serving vignettes where Stewart is allowed \\"fly on the wall\\" access to Eisner meetings are just that, having the literary equivalent of Trump's bogus \\"meeting\\" segments during \\"The Apprentice.\\"This is a great book that sheds light on the internal workings of a large corporation but also serves as validation to the long ago observation that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This was a very readable book. Well written with a good flow for the narative. Given the amount of negative information on Eisner, I kept thinking that there must be another side to the story, but with multiple sources cited for the claims, and the author including counter claims, this book is not just readable, it is believable."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"James Stewart, the best-selling author of Den of Thieves, takes a look into the fascinating world of The Walt Disney Company. The epic research project begins with the early years of how Walt Disney struggled in his early years to establish his company until the corporate denouement in late 2004, when Michael Eisner, CEO of Walt Disney since 1984, finally announced his successor. Stewart explains how this great institution, one of the most popular American companies, has become a gross under performer due to ego clashes resulting in bad business decisions. The book is enriched by insights from up-close interviews of many Disney top management executives, along with Eisner.Stewart takes the readers through the early years of Eisner, a Paramount executive working under Bary Diller, at Disney. During the mid-1980s, as Disney was in a crisis, Eisner built a remarkable team and had led an outstanding turnaround of the company. Along with Jeffrey Katzenberg, also from Paramount, Eisner delivered a string a big hits at Disney including Splash, 48 Hours, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit among others. He also resuscitated Disney's ailing animation department, which led to one of the golden eras at the company. From mid-1980s, Disney churned out a array of blockbuster animation hits such as Little Mermaid, Snow White, Beauty & The Beast, The Lion King etc.But things started getting ugly by early 1990s. Katzenberg, annoyed that Eisner reneged on his promise to make him Disney's President, left to form his own studio, DreamWorks SKG along with acclaimed director Steven Spielberg and music mogul David Geffen. Katzenberg was also paid $280 million by Disney honoring his contract with the company. Katzenberg was long considered by insiders as the real brain behind Disney's animation success. But fortunately, Disney's deal with an up-and-coming independent animation studio Pixar, helped propel the studios revenues. Pixar, presided over by Apple's Steve Jobs, delivered an unheard of back-to-back six blockbusters for Disney. Some of them include, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. Stewart looks deep into Disney's falling out with Pixar by late 2004.Another fascinating account is the chapter on Michael Ovitz. Considered by many as Hollywood's most important agent, Ovitz also happened to be Eisner's best friend. Eisner brought Ovitz to Disnet, only to fire him in 18 months with a cost of $140 million to Disney. Katzenberg, Ovitz, Pixar are just some of the falling outs Eisner had with Disney. In 2003, founder Walt Disney's nephew Roy Disney had so many difference with Eisner that he resigned from the board. Eisner's fallout with Pixar and his animosity for giving Miramax any creative independence are also highlights of the book.DisneyWar is a racy account of the inside workings of a creative enterprise. As much as Stewart credits Eisner for Disney's successes, he also gives him blame for the failures. Ultimately, Stewart shows how Eisner has consistently undermined his potential successors within the company leaving the future of this great institute in jeopardy. Is Robert Oger a good choice or as Roy Disney and Stanley Gold claims, Eisner should have also looked at other guys?"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This was a fabulous book. It is hard to believe this is a rela story. The Disney Wars reads like a miniseries drama. And to think the political wrangling that goes on behind the scenes to produce innocent childrens show, movies and videos. This book could book juicy miniseries. I wondered when my company www.livinginstyleonline.com grows large will we have a story lik e this one to tell."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I bought this book and returned it. It's that bad. I was ecstatic when I heard that it was coming out, since I'm fascinated with Eisner, Katzenberg, and the other personalities that make up the Disney drama. I don't think Eisner is all bad or all good; I think he has positive traits that made people follow him for years but some very negative traits as well. Controlling, manipulative, all that. But he's a fascinating man, and I was hoping for some insight into his relationship with Katzenberg--if they became such enemies, WHY ON EARTH were they so close for so many years? What drew them together? Why did Katzenberg want Eisner's approval so badly? Stewart has NOTHING on these questions, almost everything he writes about this topic has been said before. Psychologically, socially, culturally, Disney is a fasacinating place, icon, symbol, (and the dramas that took place within its walls make it even more interesting) but Stewart makes no connections about these people, doesn't do anything that lets them rise above the Wall Street-NAZDAQ feel. It's all about money, deals...who cares? To say Stewart, who had unprescedented access to the Disney company (and Eisner--unlike with Kim Masters' Keys to the Kingdom book, he AGREED to be interviewed) missed the boat is euphemistic in the extreme. All the stuff about the making of Pirates, Millionaire, Tarzan the Stage Show is nothing but padding. Can't a writer, for once, take us inside these larger-than-life personalities instead of just skimming the surface with headlines we've heard before? Did he even bother to edit this book? And sticking in an opening chapter about his own experience as a \\"Goofy\\" cast member is completely irrelevant and does nothing to broaden the scope of the book. Everything he's said about Eisner's childhood (very little) has been written before--Stewart acts like he's the first person to relate that story of Eisner boxing a bully at camp. Give me a break. Frank Wells, who's never been understood all that well either, is kept in the shadows as that \\"Saint\\" figure who never should have died, but Stewart apparently didn't feel much like researching his life either...Stewart basically trashes Eisner throughout the whole book and in the last chapter, almost as an afterthought, he says: \\"Well, Eisner is very funny and charming and will be remembered.\\" He might think that passes for \\"nuance\\", but trust me, it doesn't.All I can say is \\"UGH!\\" I still can't believe this man won a Pulitzer Prize.

Few of us don't hold a special place in our hearts for one Disney character or film (even if we won't admit it in sophisticated company). James B. Stewart has written a terrific book documenting the reign of Michael Eisner over that empire. Stewart quickly covers how Disney came to be and how it stagnated after Walt's (and Roy's) death. This book really gets underway when Eisner, Wells, and Katzenberg arrive on the seen and begin ten years of phenomenal success and growth.Things changed drastically when Eisner broke with Katzenberg, Wells died in a helicopter crash, and Disney bought ABC. The network became a drag on Disney rather than an engine for growth. Eisner advocated the need for ABC to protect Disney from a hostile takeover. Others never really bought that notion. Some have seen Eisner has trying to recapture his early success in TV, but times had changed no matter what Eisner thought of his ability to make the network successful. Whatever the reason, the integration of ABC into Disney has not been smooth or seamless. The overpriced acquisition of Fox Family and the failed scheme of repurposing ABC programming on ABC Family was also an anchor to earnings and growth.However, this book is much more than a narrative of actions, acquisitions, and numbers. In fact, there are very few numbers. It provides rich insights into the politics, maneuvering, and outright fights between the many managers and directors involved in this story. The cast of characters the author provides at the front of the book is a real help in following the machinations of the people who make up the fabric of this tale of ambition, greed, betrayal, and boardroom war. The three main sections of the book tell the arc of the story: The Wonderful World of Disney, The Disenchanted Kingdom, and Disney War.I found the background story of how certain programs got on the air, how movies were greenlighted and then backed or abandoned all fascinating. The way failure was assigned to people often had nothing to do with their actual culpability, but rather the need to get someone off the plank and into the sea so that another's career ambitions could continue. It was also fascinating how Eisner's ego never lets him be wrong even when he so clearly was. As his power grew, and he carefully groomed its growth, his identity of self with this public corporation became not only odd, but also a bit creepy. It is clear to me that the board of Disney managed the company for their own benefit and their egos rather than for the benefit of all shareholders. However, I am sure that Eisner and others on the board do not see it that way. One of the many strengths of this book is that the author does not take sides or make anyone out to be a villain (or a hero). In fact, he often points out contradictory accounts of certain conversations and actions. Stewart provides a balanced account that is very clear and lets each character speak for himself (or herself).For me, the saddest part of the story is the really bad behavior at the highest levels of management in the way they treated not only each other, but the employees they were managing. One person said that Eisner liked to put six pit bulls together and see which five died. Since Eisner was above the firing line, it was easy for him to keep rivals from becoming a threat to him by keeping them tearing each other apart. One of Eisner's methods of staying in power was keeping the board afraid that he would leave because there was no one left who could run the company. Just as a possible successor would appear, something would happen to undermine them and drive them away. All coincidences.The epilogue does a superb job of analyzing Eisner and his time at the top of running Disney and noting that even though it appears Eisner is through in 2006, that it might not be so. This is a book that should be widely read and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"If you have any interest in the history of Michael Eisner or want to learn more about the inner workings at a major US Corporation's boardroom, then Disney War is for you.I was totally sucked in to learn more about how totally out of place Eisner is. He is a true Emperor without any power. This book will forever change they way you read a corporate press release, think about how high level manager may or may not earn their pay, and whether you believe in creativity over the capitalist drive.Anyone with a passing interest in the legacy of the Disney company should read this book."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Disneywar is for fans of Disney and nonfans alike. . . it's also for fans of business books, and fans of spy novels. Excellently written, Disneywar is exciting from start to finish.I wonder, as some of the other reviewers, why Michael Eisner gave James B. Stewart such access. It's true he's not painted in the most flattering light. However, it's also true-- I think-- that Eisner IS an empathetic character. Ironically, although he comes off a bit megalomaniacal, he also truly believed his way was the best way for this company.Stewart did his homework. He shares more than enough background so that every event we read has a clear context. Not a book about Walt, we learn more about him as well as the other executives that brought Disney to where it is today. Stewart's book is really a masterpiece and, although many companies' inner workings would be fascinating to read about, the fact that this is the Walt Disney company we're reading about makes it just that much more exciting.This is a great book and, with its weighty size, would also make a great gift for any Disney or business fan."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"If you're a fan of business situation bios, like I am, you'll enjoy this book. It's not of the same caliber of Stewart's previous work, but I thought it was the best book in this genre that's come out in a couple of years. Please tell me that the pettiness and insecurities of many of Disney's management was overblown for dramatic effect. I hope that it's not a true reflection of their maturity and character."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This overview of the Eisner years at Disney is an enjoyable look at the reality that even big corporations like Disney are still run by and greatly effected by very human people. Stewart does a nice job of showing both the positive and negative aspects of Eisner's personality and the way that his outsized personality, along with those of Jeffrey Katzenber, Michael Ovitz and a score of others create a tempest that ultimately finds its way to the many products and projects of the Disney empire. While not the focus of the book at all, there is also a very nice sequence at the beginning where the author describes his opportunity to portray Goofy at the Animal Kingdom theme park. Very poignant and nicely rendered. In general if you enjoy the intricacies of the machinations of business as well as personality and to spare this is your book."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"James B. Stewart has produced a compelling read. I couldn't put it down and when I was done I wanted more.Mr. Stewart has slapped us in the face with what really goes on in Disney's corporate suites and its board room. It is not pretty and it is clearly more about \\"them\\" than it is about the customers, employees or shareholders. This excellent book is all about Disney but is the dysfunction that is detailed pandemic in corporations? This might be a good time for us to consider what it is about the power, compensation and perquisites that top managment and board members receive that causes them to behave so badly.It is naive of me to believe that those that want power, wealth and respect do not want to maintain the position that grants them the same. However, what is it about the Michael Eisners of the corporate world that causes them once that have achieved it all to not let go and move on - to believe that they are indispensable and \\"destroy\\" anyone that is perceived to be a threat to the maintenance of their hegemonic control? Didn't they ever hear of the glory of going out at the top of your game?"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I loved it!!! I read this book in a flash. I usually don't rip though non-fictions the way I go through fiction. I had a great impression of Michael Eisner before I read this book. That opinion is totally changed. I remember watching him on Disney movie of the week intros and Disney was the golden company in my first few years of collage. By the end of my undergraduate all of Disney's good press was still rolling in but things were beginning to change. I haven't really paid much attention to Disney in the last few years but I did realize that I was no longer going to their animated movies. I thought that maybe I had just grown out of them. I don't think that that is it. The company lost a valuable rudder for Eisner and without that person there to stand up to Eisner things went downhill. I loved the way the book progressed, not in a strictly chronological order. I just finished my MBA and I trying to read more business books. I hope they are all this inresting."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This is a fascinating character study. Michael Eisner emerges from the pages of this book as an outsized personality -- Machiavellian, brilliant, impulsive, and less than truthful. The book focuses on his twenty year tenure at Disney and primarily his conflicts with Jeffrey Katzenberg -- who spearheaded the renaissance of the Disney animation unit, Michael Ovitz, his erstwhile best friend, who became president of Disney for one fateful year, and his relationship with Roy Disney and Stanley Gold, who ultimately led the \\"war\\" to oust him from the company.It is very fast-paced and often compelling, and as a portrait of the executive suite, probably has few rivals in business literature. It is also an object lesson in how corporate governance can be suborned -- the bylaws and governance climate were used to oust board critics like Roy Disney and Gold, while shielding Eisner cronies like John Bryson.However, it definitely has a point of view and a frame of reference. You won't really learn how Disney operated during the Eisner years. Stewart wasn't interested in the mechanics of the company, except to the extent that they provided the backdrop for the executive suite drama. You will think that most of the profits generated by Disney over this time period came because of the leadership of Wells, Katzenberg, Pixar, Braun or Lyne, and that all Eisner did was make disastrous decisions after Wells died. There's more to the story, which is why I gave it 4 stars out of 5, not because it isn't great, but because it leaves you wanting to know more about the background & context, more about the history before Eisner, and more about what comes next.Definitely a buy."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Everyone has been touched by the Disney Company from an early age. After beginning as a producer of \\"short\\" cartoons, today Disney owns, besides its famous animation studios, theme parks and associated hotels and resorts around the world; hundreds of retail stores; several live-action television and movie production studios; several cable tv channels, including the wildly successful ESPN; ABC Broadcasting; a publishing house; and a recording studio. And I probably forgot something.This fascinating and highly readable book is a fast-moving account of the company's rapid growth and revival over the past 20 years.By all accouts, in 1984, the company (then lacking its major cable and broadcast television components) had become moribund and a possible takeover target in the go-go economic market of the 1980s. Michael Eisner, an executive best known for his creative skills who was groomed at ABC and Paramount Studios, was recruited, at the age of 42, to become Chairman and CEO, in which position it was hoped he could revitalize the company's products. At the same time a man well-regarded for his financial acumen and skill with people, Frank Wells, was recruited to balance the more mercurial Eisner in a complementary position.Walt Disney's nephew, Roy, a lifelong company employee, was promoted to head the animation division and Jeffrey Katzenbach, a long-time Eisner protege, was recruited to head the motion-picture studio.Again, by all accounts, the first ten years were quite successful. But Wells died in a tragic helicopter crash in 1994 and Katzenbach, who believed he had been promised Wells' and/or Eisner's position if a change were to ocurr, was not promoted and chose to leave the company to form what became an extremely successful studio (Dreamworks SKG, with director Steven Spielberg and music guru David Geffen). An unusual compensation plan in Katzenbach's contract unleashed a multi-year lawsuit that cost Disney $285 million to settle, plus enormous legal fees and the distraction of top executives.In the meantime Eisner had recruited another close friend, the high-profile Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz, to replace Katzenbach (at one point Ovitz reached an agreement with Katzenbach to settle the lawsuit for $90 million, which Eisner premptorially rejected). Ovitz's disastrous, highly publicized 18-month tenure, during which he complained that Eisner refused to delegate any meaningful work to him, ended up costing the company almost $200 million.Despite his efforts to stack the company's Board of Directors with milquetoasts and cronies, by the early 2000s several Board members were complaining about Eisner's arrogance and divisive behavior. (I doubt that I have ever read an account of how thoroughly power corrupted an individual.) At Disney's 2004 annual meeting shareholders voted a stinging rebuke to Eisner's and the Board's leadership and it was agreed he would leave when his contract ended in 2006. Eisner actually left in October, 2005, a few months after this book's publication, although he remains a major (some 18%) shareholder, thanks to lucrative stock options granted him during his employment. All in all, he earned approximately $700 million during his 20 years at Disney.In addition to relating Disney's tale, Stewart manages to also provide an easy-to-understand guide to the recent shareholder revolts and changes in corporate governance, designed by the SEC and Congress to protect future shareholders from debacles like those seen at Exxon and WorldCom."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"It seems the author's goal is for us to shake our heads at Eisner's boorishness and insensitivity, and cluck our tongues at his mean backstabbing and general naughtiness. But to what end? What's missing from this book is a proper assessment of Michael Eisner's strengths, as well as his weaknesses. The author is so busy throwing mud at the guy that at the end of the book we are left with pretty much that-a big indistinct lump of mud.On one level I found the book fascinating: I liked the fly-on-the-wall perspective on how a major company is run, the Sturm und Drang of creating Disney's high profile movie hits (and flops). But while I found the author's observations absorbing, it was hard for me accept the implicit premise that Eisner was/is a total villain. The essential problem with any \\"he-said-she said\\" story is you just don't know what to believe.In addition, the narrative pace of the book does not flow smoothly; it is rather a dizzying recitation of anecdotes. Each page introduces at least one new person into the saga, and not are all are vital to the story or well-identified. (For example, Sid Bass is mentioned every 20 pages or so, but he is not identified in the prefatory list of \\"Cast Members.\\" I eventually figured out who he was, but until then he was a humorous Zelig.)I wonder if the author has any idea how rare it is for a CEO to run a company for 20+ years, as Eisner has done? A Booz Allen Hamilton study of CEO succession revealed that in 2001 the average tenure of a CEO was less than five years. Similarly, does the author understand that companies usually grow unevenly due to cycles of investment, market slowdowns, maturing products, and new competition? Yes, Disney under Eisner made mistakes, but they do not have a monopoly on failures. Remember the XFL Football League, New Coke, the Concorde, Segway scooter, Betamax VCR system, and hydrogen-filled zeppelins (airships), to name only a few?A recent article in Slate magazine argues quite persuasively that Disney boomed under Eisner's leadership. \\"Eisner turned a faltering animation-and-amusement-park company into one of the world's most successful purveyors of home entertainment.\\" Slate credits Eisner with perceiving that the future of Disney lay in home entertainment, not in theaters. His two major achievements were putting the previously sacrosanct Disney videos into stores, and second, buying Capital Cities/ABC. His tenure as CEO was long and successful. I would have liked a better assessment of Eisner's talents, not just a litany of his tantrums."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Great book about Eisner's huburis. The best was when he said his family name was D'Eisner, or when pronounced in French, Dis-nay."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This is a fast read and excellent view into what was and wasn't, what almost happened and who got fired along the way. This is perfect for anyone interested in the inner-workings of the Disney Company between the 1980s and 2003, and a look at what happened during the infamous stock holder revolt.The writting is fabulous, and I highly commend the research effort put into this book. It is non-fiction, and definately not your \\"typical Disney story.\\"I must read for any Disney fan or investor!"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I've read this book a couple of times now; it's a long read (over 500 pages) but a compelling one. I'm interested in the Disney Corporation and how they became what they are today, and have read a couple of bios of Walt along with some books on the Imagineers, and I found Stewart's DISNEY WARS to be a worthy adjunct to those types of books. It takes the reader from the \\"dark\\" days just before Michael Eisner and Frank Wells took the reins through the rebirth of animation and of live action films for Disney owned studios, and finally to the relatively recent struggle by Eisner to hang on to his power. Along the way we meet tons of executives, managers, and creative types, including Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Ovitz. We watch as Disney executives move on to other corporations. We live through the takeover bid by Comcast (though I would have liked more on this topic). And the constants through the entire book are Michael Eisner, who goes from a risk taking creative executive to someone desperate to hold onto everything he feels is \\"his\\", and Roy E. Disney, Walt's nephew and the closest thing there is to a \\"face\\" of the Disney Corporation.It's an engrossing tale of corporate intrigue and maneuvering, and I will probably read it again in a year or so."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I love biographies, and once again Stewart is the tops. Eisner's reign seem s too strange to be true, but it was."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This is a work of serious reporting. This book is not about the Disney of Walt's time. It's about the behind the scenes of the Disney from 1990 to 2005. The author had exclusive access to first hand conversations and range of documents (such as internal company memo and mails) which were accessible on account court cases that happened against Disney. Patrick was invited by Eisner, to have conversations with him. But little did Eisner know that through course of Patrick's investigation, this book would be highly negative about him. The book is divided into 3 parts. The wonderful world of Disney, the disenchanted kingdom and Disney warMain highlights:* Michael Eisner exit from ABC and entry into Disney* Eisner's 1990 era of success as CEO proving to be the most creative and productive years for Disney. This success is also attributed to the \\"rudder\\" or \\"balance and checks\\" association with Frank Wells, the then chairman. Their combination seems to have worked, Michael having creative input , his harsh way of getting work done by people, combined with the more sober and mature Frank Wells* Emergence of Jeffrey katzenberg , a creative executive who revived the flagging animation department by producing hits like beauty and the beast, and lion king and his championing of the deal with Pixar.*The building antagonism on the part of Eisner towards Jeffery and the final split. Jefferey was ambitious and fiery and innovative like Eisner. Eisner preferred a more serene and non-ambitious type of colleague who would be ready to play second fiddle to Eisner. These were essentially two incompatible people who were both ambitious and were at loggerheads with each other in terms of style of working and vision.*The hiring and firing of Michael Ovitz (from CAA) as president and the paying of the 200 mill or so in terms of penalty to Michael Ovitz*Eisner passing up on projects like \\"sixth sense\\" and the \\"lord of the rings\\" trilogy. Disney even sold of the national distribution rights to sixth sense and saying no the lord of the rings franchise wereconsidered big mistakes and marked the downward spiraling tendency of Eisner as the right Disney CEO. Eisner passed up projects like \\"survivor\\", \\"CSI\\" which later on became hits for rival networks.*Eisner' character as the person playing dirty politics, backstabbing people, incorrectly reporting what one said to the other to spread mistrust and misunderstandings and deliberately asking staff to spy ontheir managers (who reported to Eisner) and report everything to him*Eisner's Euro Disney and how it lead to financial disaster.*The financially unsound acquisition of Fox family channel, and of getting into internet businesses.*Esiner's split with Steve Jobs and Pixar cancelling a fruitful bussiness association uptil now.*Disney's loss to Jeffery in court and having to pay the decided upon 200 odd million as per Jeffery's contract (which had a clause smartly included on Jeffery's insistence). This clause attributed a certain percentage bonus to Jeffery of the sum of all profits Disney would make from all animation projects on which Jefferey led the projects as head of Disney animation department. Jeffery then went on to form Dreamworks SKG with Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen (of Geffen Records). Thus the intials SKG in Dreamworks SKG(S= Spielberg, K=Katzenberg, G=Geffen)* The save Disney campaign by Roy Disney and Stanley Gold. Most enjoyable parts of the book .For a movie fan like me I loved discussion of the behind the scenes business related decisions on movies like the sixth sense, pirates of the caribbean, pearl harbor. The passing up of lord of the rings trilogy .Eisner said that the lotr would not be done well on the big screen ,survivor, CSI which later on became hits for rival networks.The save Disney campaign or the so called \\"fight back\\" to unseat Eisneras CEO and chairman and to force him off the board. This is likereading the final retribution section of a fiction. The villain, in thiscase Eisner unseated forcibly from the throne.To his credit, Eisner's concept of \\"singles and doubles\\" as he called it is very level headed. Eisner preferred Disney to make movies which were small budget with relatively high profits. So instead of big stars and script writers, investment could be saved. This way each film even if not a whopping big hit would still be a confirmed profit. As Eisnersays \\"we are not responsible to create art, we are here to make a profit\\"Be prepared for a heavy read, because as a corporate biographies go, Patrick B Stewart leaves no stone unturned in providing as much specifics of events as possible. The narrative is interesting and intercut with \\"supposed' dialogue between characters and via excerpts from internal memos and internal Disney e-mail. It's a very good book. The book is great and Basically it can be summed up as painting a highly negative portrait of erstwhile CEO and chief Michael Eisner. And this seems to be true, since the reporting is accurate as most of the stuff is from testimonies, memos and mails.Vikram"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"If you had any doubt that Michael Eisner totally mismanaged Disney and disregarded the shareholders, particularly in the last couple of years, this book should forever remove those doubts.The book almost reads like fiction and is a page turner if I ever read one. The sad part obviously is that it is non-fiction, and that a significant amount of people have paid for Eisners and the Disney boards incompetent and inappropriate management for years."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Love the book. I've learned so much! Love the book and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about what the Disney Corporation has gone through over the years under Eisner."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"The fireworks on the cover might lead you to believe there's a bombshell inside. Sadly, there isn't anything other than a smoking gun.The book is a critical examination of Michael Eisner's decisions at the helm of Disney. He reports on the outcomes of those decisions but it's like reading a book about the 4th of July from the perspective of someone who arrived after the show ended. Michael Eisner is probabaly a paranoid and he appears to be a pathological liar as well as a major control freak, but don't expect Stewart to explore those aspects. Unfortunately for the reader, by the time you get half way through the book, that is exactly what you are hoping to have answered.The book is worth reading, but don't be surprised if you put it down after Stewart reports, for the 100th time, that Michael Eisner stabbed in the back, another executive he recruited in the first place."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I just got finished reading DisneyWar and am anxiously awaiting the sequel \\"After the DisneyWar\\". This is a fast paced fly on the wall book about Mr. Eisner's power over The Walt Disney Company. I was fascinated on all of the turmoil and backstabbing that Mr. Eisner has caused. This book shows how powerful a few (or one) person can become. Why nobody in The Walt Disney Company did anything to protect the company is amazing. They must be counting there blessings that Mr. Eisner didn't do an Enron or other disaster and destroy The Disney Company. I would say had he wanted the money, more than the ego of running The Disney Company, it might have been in big trouble.Just think, had Mr Katzenberg stayed, would there be a Dreamworks?Had the animators and other Disney employees been treated better and the animation department allow to grow, would there be a Pixar?Though like a history book, which this is of Disney's past 20 years. I await the outcome of Mr. Eisner's departure and watching how The Disney Company will proceed over the next few years. Mr. Stewart is a wonderful writer and DisneyWar should be required reading in every college business class."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Stewart's book is an entertaining history of the personality conflicts (with almost everyone) and dubious management by Michael Eisner. Full of gossip and amazing personal details, the story begins with Eisner's takeover of the company and his first ten years of excellent results (or were they Katzenberg's results?) all of which appears to end with the death of Frank Wells in a helicopter crash in 1994. With Eisner left alone to manage the company he implemented his cult of the personality style of management. Eisner's worse traits took control of the company culture as he refused to share credit, or give credit, bullied managers, fired anyone who was viewed as a successor or contributed anything to results. It's almost like he wished certain people to whom he delegated would fail. Over and over again he is caught saying if he only had more time he could turn this or that (ABC) around, but he did not want to undermine his managers. You read this wondering why did it take till 2002 for some on the Disney board to begin to rebel and ask for Eisner's head? But Eisner ran roughshod over the Board. The story of what he did to Andrea Van de Kamp to remove her from the board is just awful. And then the real highlight of the narrative is Eisner's buying the Fox Family channel for $5.3 BILLION without any plan or due diligence, only to find out that months later the purchase was worth maybe $4 BILLION less. Eisner is the dark prince of ego and arrogance and some of his management team come off little better as they are more concerned for their own welfare than the companies employees or shareholders. In the end the one thing that struck me as most interesting was that 72.5% of Disney employees voted via their 401K shares to remove Eisner in the shareholder revolt. Eisner had the hearts and minds of only 27.5% of those who worked for him. This all certainly is a major blow to those who would push the myth that business experience is a must in political leaders. If you learn nothing else this book demonstrates the consequences of not doing your homework, and having a leader who does not ask questions or listen to those closer to a given transaction. A leader that has all the answers is no leader. How many other CEOs could learn from Eisner's mistakes."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"A creative and informative summary of this book would be -- \\"An Eisner-dominated atmosphere of nonstop conflict and bickering, punctuated by the occasional stinker (\\"Pearl Harbor\\") or gold mine (\\"The Lion King\\").

Snow White is nowhere to be seen.\\"And the book certainly brims with illustrations of unbridled executive arrogance, including describing Disney's Darwinian corporate culture. \\"What Michael likes to do is put six pit bulls together and see which five die.\\"However, my disappointment with the book is that it doesn't go to the core, philosophical underpinnings adopted by Disney which have allowed for its messy current state. That is, I wish the book had disclosed the specific corporate values which triggered its decline.Here are the questions I wish were asked and answered:1. What was the defining point constituting Disney's \`sell out'?2. What are Disney's real \`corporate values'?3. Is there a clear \`social agenda' Disney is pushing?4. Is Disney more of a corporation, a belief system, or a religion?5. What are specific examples of dollars taking precedence over the veneer Disney calls 'family-friendly' entertainment?"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This is the story of a self-annointed entertainment industry mogul, in which Michael Eisner establishes himself as the absolute ruler of Disney (yes, like Louis XIV, to whom Stewart compares him). In the beginning, there was a balanced team of Eisner, the visionary; Frank Wells, the diplomat who smoothed Eisner's rough edges (you could go to him for \\"redress\\" and \\"understanding\\"); and Jeff Katzenberg, the glorified gopher of enormous talent and potential. When this team took over in 1984, many thought that the Disney empire was teetering on the verge of decline, ripe to be acquired and with an animation dept that was all but dead. The only profitable part was the Disney parks. They began to seek \\"one- or two-base hits\\", that is, relatively inexpensive films for modest hits at high profit (e.g. Down and Out in Beverly Hills).Over the next ten years, this team engineered a series of smashing successes, from a string of hits to the establishment of the Disney stores and the sales of videos. Disney became huge: from a revenue of $1.4 billion in 1984, it grew to $30 billion by 2004; price-adjusted for stock splits respectively grew from $1.33 to $25. By any measure, it was a phenomenal run, unprecedented in Hollywood history and even in terms of American culture. Disney moved into bold new areas of film by establishing a number of production companies of great originality, which Stewart describes competently, if in excessive, yet non-analytic, detail. However, under the surface, there were serious tensions growing: by his lies and senseless slights, Eisner was alienating Katzenberg, an executive of superior gifts and judgment, and was tiring of Wells, who soon died in an accident. Eisner then fired Katzenberg after 19 years of unbelievably productive collaboration; Katzenberg took his gifts to Dreamworks, which many believe is beating Disney animation in both revenues and originality (e.g. Shrek) - that more or less proves it was him, and not Eisner, who was responsible for the golden years of the late 1980s, up to Katzenberg's Lion King.From the mid-1990s, with Eisner at the pinnacle of his power and (as CEO and CHairman) dominating a meek board, the stage was set for a series of catastrophic decisions that cost Disney billions. This is when his worst side came out, that of an ego maniac bent on maintaining his power and firing anyone who dissented from him: he became erratic, vindictive, and unable to question himself in the worst type of narcissism imaginable. Here, you see the costs of bad decisions: Euro Disney ($1 billion loss, due to a complete lack of understanding regarding the differences between American and European vacationing), the failed internet ventures ($1 billion loss), and the acquisition of Fox family cable ($1 billion loss, due to insufficient commercial analysis and due diligence regarding distribution rights). Even the films became risky attempts at blockbusters (home runs), in accordance with the Hollywood formula of extremely expensive talent and ever more spectacular special effects, though most of them flopped. THen there were the personnel disputes, which Eisner seemed to relish: he refused to settle with Katzenberg's contract-based bonus for $90 million in an Ovitz-negotiated deal, going instead to court and eventually settling for nearly $300 million; picking his best friend, superagent Ovitz, and firing him in one year at a similar price. But the list of lost talent, both execs and animators, is a horrible indictment of an intolerant man who could not question his own judgment. Finally, you get the story of his ouster, after he alienated even his board and virtually all of his creative collaborators, such as Pixar and the Miramax studio brothers (the Weinsteins), who were the independent groups that produced most of the hits that Disney distributed. In my opinion, the book often reads like a hack job by a journalist who essentially disliked his subject, or at least disrespected him; while Stewart strives to sound neutral and fair, it is clear he despises Eisner.That is about it for the story. Unfortunately, I was looking for more about how Disney was run strategically as well as a view inside the black box of decisionmaking and method. How did it become a manufacturer of popular culture, beyond the original entrepreneur and pioneer of genius, Walt Disney? This is not the book to answer that. Instead, it is more like a score card about battling corporate titans, none of whom are attractive people - and we would be naive to think that they might be - and it endlessly catalogues their brutal maneuvering and sleazy intrigues at the expense of the nuts of bolts of how they engineered their successes and ran their business. You get very little about the Disney company and way way too much of an attack on Eisner alone as a person and secondly as a manager. As such, it is yet another dreary description of a dysfunctional corporate environment, with some irony thrown in about how it is supposed to produce stories that make customers happy. Nonetheless, at the end, I did not feel I understood much about Eisner's deeper motivations or character, or for that matter those of any of his colleagues and competitors. The chronology is also hopelessly confused, the descriptions of innumerable details of film productions seemingly irrelevant rather than enlightening.This was a great disappointment to me. I recommend it only to those interested in Hollywood trivia and not to those wishing to learn about how corporations might be better run, though it is an interesting lesson in failed corporate governance."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I thought this would be about Walt Disney in the War, but it's the company he founded who is at the center of attention.

The author did his homework ... most of it. But the book, for all of its surface detail, was very superficial in really exploring what the last 20 years have meant for the company.Instead, it's a narrative of the ongoing soap opera in Disney's executive suites: Who got mad, who got hurt, who got double-crossed. For a person who had hoped to gain some actual insight into the mechanics (good and bad) of the operation of an entertainment empire, this was a disappointing re-hash of one petty event after another.One major problem is that the book dealt only with Disney's very top management. There was little exploration just why Disney's golden age (early '90s) was so successful. There was likewise little discussion of how the goings-on upstairs affected and were received by the rank-and-file of Disney.The author seems to have an agenda from the beginning of the book: To illustrate the dissolving of Disney's corporate 'magic,' particularly Michael Eisner's. That's fair (I'm not a big Eisner fan), but it's only half the story. There was literally no discussion of the Disney Cruise Line (a successful venture championed by Eisner), or of Disney's unusual collaboration with the Oriental Land Company in Japan ... a venture largely unknown here in the U.S., and very much deserving of a closer look. I didn't feel like I knew Eisner any better after having read it. (Perhaps that's by Eisner's and Disney's design. But still ...)Most disappointing ... the book simply wasn't fun. Even a 'tragedy' can be told with a bit of humor. This book had none. The author seemed only to have a passing curiosity of Disney and the Disney culture, instead of an enthusiasm and deep interest that something so unique demands. It was one dry anecdote after another, and I found it cumbersome to wade through.This book is probably for some people ... It got good reviews. But there isn't much here for for those who follow business, or die-hard Disney nuts, so I'm hard-pressed to describe who would enjoy it."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I'm not that far into this, but I'm quickly losing patience. In view of the very serious challenges faced by America (and American business), the backroom machinations of a bunch of overprivileged, petulant, egomaniacal one percenters are less than enthralling.I suspect the prime audience for this book is Hollywood executives, who will pick it up, flip to the index to see if they're mentioned, and if not, put it back down."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Quit reading this and go buy the book. It is a great read and will give you all kinds of insight on the inter-management of Disney. I like the way the author ties decisions to the movies we watch. His last chapter, where he indicts Eisner is terriffic.You are wasting time, buy the book. You will be glad you did."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I'm only about half way through this book so far. Mostly interesting...As I am interested primarily in the personalities involved I find I'm slogging through the business-speak of a lot of the book...I really don't care who bought how many shares of one company at so many dollars while trying to acquire a new company whose share was going for X dollars and is now Y dollars but would have been worth Z dollars in 1965 etc, etc, etc....I'm sure the chapters relating directly to Ovitz will be interesting!"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Beginning this book with the knowledge that it is a bitter account of a bitter affair, I was stunned by the lack of fairness or logic to the book's treatment of Disney's Michael Eisner.The only points I have come away with are that an aggressive CEO micromanaged his (successful) operation, and that in his position of power, Eisner grew increasingly distrustful of those around him. Who wouldn't, I wonder.Michael Ovitz, portrayed as both an innocent victim of Eisner's plotting and an ineffectual weakling unable adapt to Disney or to read the handwriting on the wall, is way too flat in this account to resemble a real or sympathetic person.The successes of Eisner, by and large, are attributed to his heads-up inner circle, while his failures are his alone; more often than not, his failures are attributed to a psychic malaise upon which never Stewart never sharpens his focus."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"From its jacket blurb, Disneywar promises to be a lively telling of the rise and fall of the Eisner-years of Disney.Someone got their adjectives confused. \\"Deadly\\" is more apropos a description than \\"Lively.\\" Page after page of he said/he said/he said/memo said/letter said/email said...It wore me out. As page 200 neared I looked in the index and saw that Pirates of the Carribean was discussed at page 399. I skipped ahead and rest the rest of the book. I will never go back and bore myself again with reports from Mike Eisner about Mike Eisner and how Mike Eisner is great.I don't recommend this book for anyone who wants to stay awake when they are reading."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Disney War is what many will expect, but not much more. There are no new insights offered by James Stewart except for the premise of the book. Stewart suggests his motives were to write a behind the scenes look at the Disney corporation and Michael Eisner gave his blessing with the word, \\"I have nothing to hide.\\"However, the description of the book gives away the track that Stewart decides to cover, How could Eisner have so misjudged Ovitz? Why did Eisner so mistrust Roy Disney? How did Eisner lose control of the Disney board? If the author and the contents of the book to be believed then Michael Eisner has done little in his tenure at Disney except make bad decisions about projects and the people who formerly worked for him. Those who have been disgruntled with the leadership of Eisner will find this book as their new gospel, those who are wishing for a more balanced look behind the scenes will go away wanting more. There is only one perspective offered in this extensive work. One might easily conclude that Eisner is a power hungry, control driven, insecure executive with few administrative relationship skills. Yet somehow, the victories, the triumph, and the rescuing of the Disney corporation, if this literary work is to be believed as credible, had little to do with Eisner and much more to do with those who once again are in the news trying to save the Disney corportation. Both extremes are the stuff of fairy tales, there must be a real story somewhere in between."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Under normal circumstances I would unabashedly rave about DisneyWar. Drawing on access to Michael Eisner and Roy Disney, the author offers a rare look inside the normally secretive world of the corporate boardroom.It is an engrossing tale of one of the world's most powerful media and entertainment companies and those who own it.But alas, I worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert during the period the author wrote about in one of his previous ventures. In that book, Den of Thieves, it was obvious that Stewart had no access to the main character and the result was an unbalanced story. Though successful at the book stores, it did one of our country's most ingenious financial minds a disservice. The Drexel Burnham that emerged from Stewart's agenda-driven portrait was not the Drexel Burnham I knew and experienced daily for almost six years.DisneyWar is the story of a corporate tragedy. It contains unsuspected twists, larger-than-life characters and a predictable, yet exciting, climax. Well-written, it often reads like a page-turning novel.Yet, I am left wondering. What did the author omit? What important character denied him access? It is too bad. DisneyWar is a great story. Too bad I cannot trust the author to tell in a fair, balanced and accurate manner."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"After reading \\"War,\\" I felt I needed to take a shower. The company once known for its wholesome family images seems to have been run for the last twenty or so years by people wholly unlike Wal Disney, bright and egomaniacal people who might know how to do lunch but not people I'd want to sit down to share lunch - not that they'd share lunch.In retrospect, much of the financial boom of Disney they owe to leveraging well-established assets. I remember going to Disney World in Florida in 1973 for $4. Today it's more like sixty dollars. The Eisner dynasty got off to a good start simply by rapidly tapping the highly inelastic demand for Disney theme parks by jacking up prices considerably, then mining its warehouse of Disney characters and movies, and realizing the power of the video market.Disney made some good animated features under Eisner, only Disney did not make them, Pixar did. And Eisner so enraged Steve Jobs that Disney lost that gold mine. Disney also thought that they could open another equally profitable amusement part outside Paris, ignoring the fact that France is the center of anti-Americanism and Paris weather leaves a lot to be desired. Disney made some great movies but also a lot of duds. One good film can balance ten or twenty bad ones; such is the economics of moviemaking.What was most revolting was the self-serving, narcissistic, egomaniacal behavior of the main players in this very expensive, very bad melodrama. Disney officials threw around tens of millions of dollars paying off fired, disgruntled, and even more egotistical former employees. Even a late attempt to embrace Sarbanes-Oxley governance legislation was twisted, misused and misconstrued; the definition of independent and dependent directors seemed to be arbitrary. George Mitchell may have been a good senator, a great diplomat, and a nice guy, but he comes across as a gullible, unsophisticated dupe among this cast of egos.Stewart assembled a long, tiresome if highly readable book. It's a sad story just the same."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I was initially told to not read this book if I at all valued the \\"magical, pixy dust\\" side of Disney. However, I think reading this book did not change my opinion of Disney simply because I am aware that Disney is what it is, a corporation.Eisner, in my opinion, for the most part, had a great rein in Disney and really helped it make it what it is today. However, as time went on he became increasingly power hungry and greedy. One may also be shocked by the amount of good ideas and movies Disney turned down but you know what they say, \\"Hinde sight is 20/20\\". (Them turning down of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" particularly struck me personally, since I am a huge fan. I couldn't help but think. \\"You fools! Why?!\\")All in all, the book showed me nothing worse then what I expected from any multi-billion company. The drama, the betrayal, the lies, THE POLITICS."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"After surviving for thirty years participating in the advertising end of the motion picture world, and having done a little work for Disney during Ron Miller's short tenure at Disney, I occassionally got to peek behind the curtain at the wonderful world of Eisner's Disney, and every word of Stewart's opus rings absolutely true. Middle level munchkins like me are treated like furniture, and these guys at the top have big mouths. For me, it was clear from the start that Eisner and his crew, after the initial years of fabulous success (which can be traced to raising the theme park prices, plus raiding the library vaults) were riding for a big fall. By the time Eisner was reaping his obscene bonuses, the good years were all behind him and his most talented suborindinates had been banished or escaped to less psychotic venues. (which in Hollywood is all relative.) That he was able to hold on for another ten plus years, is a tribute to his powers to manipulate and intimidate people chosen for specifically for their talents be terrific toadies....or their guilibility that they would be annointed to inherit his mantle.For some reason, the Disney name, for a lot of people seems to have this irrational aura which makes it the stuff of something different from other studios. And while Walt was a talented visionary, he was a mogul like any other, and was just as venal and as ruthless as his peers.Even so, for those who love this \\"inside Baseball\\" look behind the scenes of corporate excess and insanity, this book will serve as an education to disabuse those who wish to pursue a career in the entertainment industry of their innocence and illusions. In order to get into a position like Eisner's you do have to be something of a monster...where nobody is a friend, and relationships are disposable. Even a power player like Ovitz, who was assumed to be the most powerful man in Hollywood came to the studio as Michael's \\"best friend\\" and from the beginning was undermined and betrayed. Katzenberg, not the most lovable fella in the world was considered expendable when his successes threatened overshadow Eisner. Andrea Van De Camp, the most innocent party in this saga, is treated particularly loathesomely. Yet for all his successes, Eisner is a tragic villain, whose insecurity, neediness, and pettiness is apparent for all the world to see.And in the meantime, the lesson which can be taken from this is that for all the hundreds of millions of dollars these guys have, their lives are driven by stress, fear and sadistic manipulation of their victims.I suppose there is a lesson to be learned here. But as far as I can tell, the only thing I have learned from my own experience with these titans of my former industry is that surviving in a nest of vipers means you got to become a snake."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Amazing and very well done, all of us at Extinct-attractions-club.com could not put this amazing book down"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"The \`War' from before, during, and after is vented if not represented. The easy pontification is kept down. However, using quotes and explaining significant though not obvious causes of effects wordiness is inevitable. The innocent aligning of the principle participants, through the nascent commencement of hostilities, through the casualties and survivors of the conflict are covered."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"James Stewart's \\"Disney War\\" is a meticulously researched book, although the writing feels a bit rushed. I can see why Stewart would want to get his book out on the market as soon as possible though -- it really is a blockbuster tale of one of the greatest media moguls of the present age. It's a very long book, and for the first one hundred pages I couldn't help but laugh with jealous glee at Disney chairman Eisner's megalomania, narcissism, and paranoia. His early years of success at Disney would catapult him to the top, and from there he relentlessly trampled down on his friends, allies, and supporters. He fired his most able and most talented general -- Jeffrey Katzenberg -- and he destroyed the reputation of his best friend, Michael Ovitz.But because the book is so long Eisner's idiotic antics soon became annoying, and it became no longer fun to laugh at his self-defeating megalomania and paranoia. He demonstrated one bad judgement after another, killing what could have been lucrative ventures.\\"Disney War\\" is at once hilarious and depressing."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Disney War is one of the most thought provoking and insightful looks inside the company that has transformed American imagination. The investigative journalistic style brought to life by Stewart takes you on a thrill ride over the 20 year reign of Michael Eisner. Some of the industry giants such as Katzenberg, Roy E Disney, and Igar surfaced during this history lesson of the Walt Disney Company.Make sure your seat belts are fastened as you travel through history with a look back at Disney's humble beginnings, and then fashioned itself into a movie-making powerhouse that saw hits like The Lion King, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Lost while losing out on some TV hits like Survivor, CSI and The Apprentice.This rare look inside the Disney Corporation was eye-opening and a wonderful read. I would highly recommend this read to anyone who would love to peer inside what made Disney tick or didn't."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Stewart had access to some incredible source material for this book, which gives an unflinching view into how Eisner became an almost untouchable dictator. It also reveals just how egregious a CEO's malfeasance must be before a board will eject him. It is a damning indictment of the corporate governance system in the United States, and displays just how little fiduciary responsibility and shareholder value matters."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This book was an enjoyable read. It gave us an inside look at one of the most entertaining companies of our time. While many people associate the Walt Disney Company with Walt Disney himself, people fail to realize that Walt has not been around for close to fifty years. While his company and legacy definitely lives on it is very important to acknowledge and realize that there were many trying years since then with different phases and leadership in order to get the company to where it is today.This book is the dramatic story of the reinventing years of the mid 1980's thru the mid 2000's. It's focus is mainly on Michael Eisner, the CEO and boss during that period. We get a good look at what went on behind the scenes and in the boardroom during that time frame. As a child, I always watched Disney movies and productions without giving much though to all the hard work that went on in order to get these productions to the public. It's fascinating to see how Disney went from the king of animation to a struggling studio trying to keep up and then back again to the top of it's field. In this book we get a great inside look at the characters that worked tirelessly to maintain the legacy. Some personal stories had happy endings while many didn't.Through all the ups and downs the team was able to pull through and bring the world Disney as we know it today; a mega entertainment and media company with strong arms in television, consumer products, theme parks and anything to do with entertainment for the family.The only complaint I have is that I feel the story could have been condensed into a shorter version. It seemed that there us a lull in the middle book which seemed to drag on endlessly. I feel that could have been dozens of pages abbreviated out of is book.Nevertheless, I must say that this book was very exciting to read especially if you love thrilling boardroom drama filled with cut-throat politics. I highly recommend tbis book to anyone interested in business and entertainment. It's a drop long but I believe it's a very manageable to read."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Everybody in this book, at one time or another, acts like a millionaire boor; Eisner all the time. It really is fascinating. And disheartening, for it is obvious that the once creative and innovative Disney company has lost its way, its stewards (no pun intended) looking for power and money instead of ideas. There's another book out there (\\"Cult of the Mouse\\"), written by a creative head at Disney during these years, that limns some of the same problems, but goes on to suggest ways to fix them and to keep them from happening. Together, they make a great one-two punch, something that too many American companies seem to need."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"James Stewart's book is a fantastic overview of the Disney history but especially the detailing of Michael Eisner's rise to power and how he stayed there. I was especially taken by the descriptions of all the TV shows and movies I either watched or heard about through the years and hearing the intense history behind the scenes, the personalities and creative ideas and how decisions were made. The creative people at Disney are amazing but you can see that there were clear collaborative efforts made between different teams. It is also amazing how political the whole organization became and how everyone seemed to fear Eisner. If anyone desires to manage creative, energetic people this book will detail how *not* to do it with many examples from the 80s through 2005. This book will also instruct you on how it is important to nurture a corporate culture that asks questions of upper management and encourages dissenting opinions at different stages of the creative process. The book also teaches us how to be very aware of what Daniel Goleman calls the \\"glitter factor\\" when we look at people at the top. Giving upper management a blank cheque is a dangerous trap for employees who have responsibilities...especially in a public company.Ultimately, Eisner was his worst enemy and hopefully managers and CEOs like him will find that humility goes a long way when you want to lead well."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This 4 and 1/2-star book is a wonderfully detailed account of the rise and fall of Michael Eisner within the Disney company. It is very well written but needs some editing--most of the accounts are so detailed that at times you want to say to the author: \\"Just summarize it for me!\\" His access to the major players allowed him to have minute inside information that includes physical gestures, specific meals eaten, and phone conversations.In the end Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg look like spoiled brats that use Disney as their playground. You will be disgusted as you read page after page of lying and cheating people, while lower-level executives are just yes-men that say anything to keep their jobs. There are few heroes here. Roy Disney is certainly criticized throughout (even called \\"idiot\\" and other bad names) but he seems like the sensible one, whereas the highly-paid guys that run the company seem totally blind to the real world (Eisner had never seen an animated Disney movie until the year before he took over!?!). Ironically, it is Eisner who comes across as the idiot when he fights the pre-production of some of the company's biggest successes while championing some of its largest flops. Eisner also never seems to shake his rich-kid persona and is only attracted to hiring young male rich kids who carry his same style of bravado.The book does skip over major of the major events in the Disney company history by just mentioning a movie or devoting only a couple paragraphs to a company-altering film. If you are looking for a history of Disney films from the past two decades, this isn't the book. They are glossed over to instead focus on the business aspects and behind-the-scenes leadership fights.Another problem is that the book often states as fact things that are actually opinions the author gleaned from conversations with one of the major players. The writer will state conversations as fact but not attribute who reported that version of the discussion.The book also has a couple of really big factual errors, simple things that a fact checker should have picked up. At one point the author calls the TV show \\"Friends\\" a \\"drama\\" and the hit Disney Channel show is called \\"She's So Raven\\" instead of the correct title \\"That's So Raven.\\"In the end it's all about Eisner. He is a total, complete, egomaniacal fake. A born liar who appears to have no ethics. Anything to make a buck and make himself look good, always worrying about how every tiny move in the company will impact him. How in the world did Eisner get away with all of this for so many years and then make multiple millions on top of it? The one person who tried to stop him, Michael Ovitz, was out of the company faster than Katzenberg. And for the notorious jerk Ovitz to look like a hero means Eisner was really a terrible human being!It's a great inside look into how Hollywood operates and the dysfunctional people who run the companies. The lessons learned can apply to anyone who works for any hierarchy, proving that you should never believe anything those in charge say and the more they praise you the greater chance they really hate you! The Disney culture ends up being untruthful, anti-family and one of the worst companies on the planet. It will make you never want to spend a penny on a Disney item again."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I read this book after reading Comic Wars by Dan Raviv which was also a corporate tell all type of book. Disney War was even better and it was really difficult to put down. It was truly amazing and somewhat comforting to know that even men and women we believe to have reached the top of their professions still exhibit the same human flaws of jealousy, distrust, insecurity, pettiness, and vindictiveness that typically are central to our most revered literary classics. It's hard to know who the good guys and bad guys are as everyone seems to provide a little or a lot of both sides. As with most corporate stories the main characters lose their reputations but remain as wealthy if not wealthier then before their downfall."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I thought that this book was outstanding. What I dont understand is why everyone seems to be so shocked that Disney is a cut throat corporation. You dont become one of the most powerful companies in America by being nice.The whole \\"Magical\\" aspect of Disney is simply an illusion used to sell, and they are great at preserving that image. People say \\"if you read this book you will never look at Disney the same way again\\". Well, anyone that has ever bought a Disneyland admission ticket within the last 5 years should know full well that Disney is a company that is indeed strictly profit driven. I like Disney and I enjoy Disneyland, but lets face it, Disney wants to be as powerful and wealthy as any other company, this is not breaking news, rather this book is a fantastic insight into the rise of power of Disney and the behind closed doors politics and greed."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"What an awesome book!From an 'overall' perspective, let me assure you that you get your money's worth. This is a B-i-i-i-g book! Small print, not a lot of pictures, just a LOT of information...some of which might make you say 'Holy Cow! He did THAT?!?!'.Despite it's size, it's a good, easy read. Lot's of dialouge to help move it along. And everytime you think Eisner has hit a new low in how to treat people, he steps down even 1 rung further.I wouldn't want to be Eisner now! This book spells out in great detail his paranoid, two-facecd, micro-managment techniques that made him look great when the product was ALREADY great...and made him look crappy when a 'real' turnaround expert was needed.I've read about Ovitz and I've read about Eisner. I can't decide which of the 2 is a bigger narcicist...but I sure as hell have enjoyed the read!"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"For as long as I can remember I have been in love with \\"Everything Disney\\". Beyond loving its theme parks and all of its characters, I really thought Disney had something special. I wanted to become a part of it and live out my dream of perhaps becoming a corporate attorney for them someday. Well my dream was shattered after reading this book. I have become an attorney but thank goodness I never had the misfortune to work in a company run by an egomaniac like Eisner.After reading this book, Disney went from a company I idolized to a company that disgusted me under Eisner's leadership. I had always heard of the almost cult-like DisneyThink and how Disney employees were just corporate drones who lock-and-step blindly followed the bidding of the maniacal Eisner. Before reading this book I had always thought this mentality served them well as Disney grew into a formidable company during his tenure. Until...page after page I became increasingly angry at the way he treated people. He hires them, doesn't support them, berates them, and then fires them (Er, I should say he has one of his lackeys fire them because he is too much of a coward to face them and do it himself). He blames his people for everything wrong with the company and only lays the blames to himself for hiring them in the first place. He treats people with disdainful indifference when he is through with them. Oh why doesn't he find a puppy dog to kick while he is at it. The unsuspecting eager beavers were quickly deflated. Their will to do some good didn't stand a chance against Eisner evil force. I could almost can see it coming and found myself screaming to book, \\"Don't take the job; you'll be sorry you did,\\" as Eisner offered his newest victim a \\"chance of a lifetime\\" opportunity to work for Disney. \\"You're fired\\" takes on a whole new meaning in that company. Disney should file a trademark suit against The Donald because surely they said it first--over and over and over again.Somehow Eisner would have us believe that all of the people who were at the top of their game when he hired, upon working at Disney, suddenly lost the very business sense and acumen that got them to the top in the first place. Oh please Eisner, if you would get off of your throne long enough you would see that the constant is YOU and your own ineptness and failure as an effective leader. I find it hard to believe that a man like Katzenberg was someone too unfit to work for Disney but somehow managed to cofound one of Disney's biggest competitive rivals, DreamWorks. What, did he suddenly get smarter or luckier coincidentally after leaving Disney or could it have been Eisner's fragile ego not wanting anyone else to shine brighter than him? Or take Ovitz, who founded one of, if not the, top talent agencies, Creative Artists, in Hollywood and ran it successfully for over 20 years. After being best friends with him for over 30 years, suddenly Eisner has an epiphany about Ovitz and sees him as a suicidal, worthless waste of a human flesh. Mmmm...I don't know about you but I think 30 years is a long time to get to know someone. It defies incredulity that Ovitz suddenly turned into the poster child for ineptness after Eisner has respected him for so long. Rather, Stewart gives us several instances in which Ovitz presented genius ideas and proposals just to be shot down by Eisner's short-sightedness. Oh how great it would have been for Disney to have a sports park in LA like Ovitz suggested. For a man who professes to be such a visionary, Eisner surely couldn't see talent right before his very own eyes.The book is an insightful account of bad decisions, missed opportunities, and poor judgment on Eisner's part. It's a wonder how the company ever progressed at all under his direction. For a Disney lover like myself this book was akin to pulling apart the curtains in the Wizard of Oz and seeing the Wizard for who he really was. Not the grandiose, all-knowing Wizard who could accomplished anything but the small, mortal man who is fallible at best and downright destructive at worst. Perhaps it was my mistake to put \\"Everything Disney\\" on such a lofty pedestal. I just hope that Iger can restore Disney back to its polished image that Eisner so painstakingly tarnished so he could live out his own destiny instead of the destiny of a company started by two wonderful men with an absolutely delightful dream.I caution all those, like myself, who grew up watching Uncle Eisner regale us on The Wonderful World of Disney on Sunday evenings. Unfortunately, read this book and your image of sweet Uncle Eisner will turn into an image of that wicked Uncle no family members talk to and who doesn't get invited over to Thanksgiving dinners or June weddings for fear his mere presence will cast a dark shadow over the event. You will feel betrayed by Eisner and the fraud he perpetrated upon our innocence to have us believe that Disney was really a Magic Kingdom where mice could talk and girls could find their Prince Charming. But really all that time it was nothing more than a greedy empire that sucked the \\"magic\\" out of most who were foolish enough to believe that he carried forth the Walt Disney dream. But fittingly in the end the King was dethroned by his own arrogance. (Assuming you can call walking away $300 million short of being a BILLIONARE, being dethroned). Life isn't fair is it folks?Bravo to Stewart for a job well done. I await his next insider, tell-all book."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"This book could have been called \`Michael Eisner, this is your life at the Walt Disney Company.' About ten years ago Michael Eisner had heart surgery which undoubtedly saved his life. Paradoxically, if he had died then he would have gone down in Hollywood history as the greatest studio head of all time. However, as this book describes, the events of the last decade have greatly tarnished Mr. Eisner. The author describes how, following the death of Walt Disney, the company languished in a slump for many years. Then they hit upon the idea of bringing Michael Eisner to Disney. Read about the amazing first decade when the Disney management troika of Eisner, Frank Wells, and wunderkind Jeffrey Katzenberg increased the financial worth of the Disney Company more than ten fold while, at the same time, achieving great creative and artistic success. And this is in spite of Mr. Eisner's ill-fated decisions concerning Euro Disney. Then Frank Wells was killed in a helicopter crash, Mr. Eisner had heart surgery, and Jeffrey Katzenberg was forced out. Read about how Mr. Eisner strung Mr. Katzenberg along for 19 years with promises of grandeur and riches only to push him out in the street when the time finally came to make good on all those promises. Of course, Mr. Katzenberg later became partners with David Geffen and Stephen Spielberg forming Dreamworks, which became a serious competitor for Disney. Read about how Mr. Eisner then induced his best friend Mike Ovitz, the Hollywood super agent widely considered to be the most powerful individual in Hollywood, to come to Disney. When it soon became clear that Mr. Ovitz intended to be more than just a rubber stamp for Eisner he was pushed out as well, costing the Disney shareholders $140 million for 16 months employment. At one point Mr. Ovitz had brokered a settlement with Mr. Katzenberg to drop all his claims against Disney for $90 million. Then, to nobody's great surprise except Mr. Ovitz, Eisner just flat out refused to pay. Eventually, Disney lost in binding arbitration and was obliged to pay Mr. Katzenberg $280 million, not to mention the millions spent on litigation. Read about the decision to buy the ABC television network for $19 billion and what it led to. Read about the falling out between Eisner and Steve Jobs of Apple Computer and Pixar. Read about the Comcast proposal in early 2004 to buy Disney. Read about how Mr. Eisner was able to stack the Disney Board with people that he could bend to his will, thereby making Disney a textbook example of how powerful corporate management can turn the tables on their board of directors and transform it into a rubber stamp. Someone once said that Napoleon Bonaparte was as great as a man can be without morality. Michael Eisner could be described as the Napoleon of the entertainment industry. Just as Napoleon was an upstart who crowned himself Emperor of the French and attempted to create the greatest empire in the world, this book describes Mr. Eisner's relentless drive to make the Walt Disney Company into the world's greatest entertainment company while, at the same time, in my own opinion, intending to ultimately push out the Disney family and make it into the Eisner family business. Eventually, all the powers of Europe combined against Napoleon and brought him down. Now we are witnessing all the Hollywood and entertainment people that were used and abused by Mr. Eisner over the years combining against him to attempt to bring him down as well. Roy Disney, now in his 70s, once disparaged as \`Walt's idiot nephew,' has emerged as the champion of the Disney family interests, the Disney animators, shareholders, and pretty much everybody else that Eisner has burned. Together with long time Disney Board member Stanley Gold he initiated the wildly successful Save Disney campaign to withhold shareholder support from the Eisner management and Disney Board members. Read about how Walt's daughter Diane sent a letter to the Disney Board in February, 2004 which included her opinion that its time to select a successor for Michael Eisner who should then leave Disney when his contract ends in 2006. Mr. Eisner then called her on the phone and she repeated to him her opinion that its time for him to leave. She later repeated it again to the L.A. Times. Its all here in this book. If that's not enough to get you to want to read it then nothing will."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Superbly written - you can notice the enormous efforts of the author researching the subject.This books takes an inner look at the corporative-world behind Disney, and helps us understand the decision-taking process: for goog and bad. Specifically, I ended up loving and hating Michael Eisner: Surely he was an egocentric maniac, but without him, Disney might not have endured the 80's and 90's."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I enjoyed the details given in this public corporation known around the world. Very interesting read and gives a good insight to why admission to the parks have gotten staggering high...CEO's, CFO's and COO's."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I am a huge James B Stewart fan (loved The Prosecutors and Den of Thieves) and an ex-Disney exec (I was there for five of the years discussed) so I was looking forward to this book. My net feeling is that it was fun, not a bad choice for the beach bag this summer, but (a) it takes a relentlessly negative point of view, even more than I think is justified, (b) there are some weird gaps in the story which I attribute to rushing to out to press (but maybe there's some other reason), and (c) finally and most importantly, it fails to rise above the facts it portrays to make any larger point. What does it tell us about or times, about corporations, about America, about the people discussed...? Unclear. Somehow Stewart didn't get enough perspective on it or insight into it to make the narrative into something more memorable and insightful than a solid recounting of some important events in Disney's recent history. That's too bad. I hope that in Stewart's next book he finds some larger meaning.But, that being said, a lot of the events are nevrtheless quite fascinating:It's unbelievable how Eisner burned Ovitz straightaway after hiring him. Just completely hung him out to dry when only weeks before he had been the most powerful man in Hollywood. Brutal and horrible.The details with Katzenberg were awful too. That must have been the worst deal ever made (next to the Ovitz deal). And Eisner's carping about Roth, Iger and Wells behind their backs? He really comes off as a psycho freak you wouldn't want to work for.Some of his problems were legitimate though. Katzenberg was equally psycho at least. What do you do with an employee who is good at producing animated films, has failed to create a profitable live action motion picture division, advocated a failed strategy of producing 40-50 films per year and now wants to be the President and COO of a Dow 30 company? Developing animated films is no better preparation for being the COO of a major corporation than being an agent is. So what was Eisner to do with this jumped up producer? Tough one. But what he did do was probably not the right choice. Katzenberg is in the right job now as head of a free standing Animation studio.The parts that are somewhat mysteriously left out are the massive increase in value at the Disney Channel and ESPN. I suppose it doesn't fit the \\"Eisner is an idiot\\" theme, but if he's such an idiot how did all that happen? That's why I feel the book is a little unfair. Also, the fact that Eisner didn't lose his *** on some horrible internet deal like Gerry Levin probably deserved more emphasis.I was surprised at a few negatives that were left out: why wasn't there more discussion of the talent exodus -- Dean Valentine, Gerry Laybourne...? I don't know. Also, what about some of those sketchy investments -- magazines? Professional sports teams? I guess the book could only be so long.I also wish that Stewart put more data in the book. If Eisner's reign was a failure, let's see a bar chart with actual cash flow. Why not? There was essentially no data, which I thought was odd for a business book.But, again, I wish that Stewart had gotten some insight out of all this. Let's just stipulate that Eisner's a smart guy who accomplished a lot. So why did he make all these horrendous difficulties managing other people? That 'Rosebud' answer is what we don't get here."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I live in Burbank, CA, just up the street from the Disney corporate headquarters. When I heard the DisneyWars was coming out today, I rushed down to the local bookstore to get my copy. As I was making my purchase, the cashier mentioned to me that earlier today, the Disney Company had come to the store and bought out their entire stock of the book. There were a lot of copies on display, so it must have been quite an effort. But then a couple of hours before I came to buy my copy, they returned them all. What strange behavior. The must be afraid of what the Stewart wrote. Their apparent paranoia made me even more eager to read the book.From what I've read so far, they should be afraid. It's quite a scathing expose. So far, it is proving to be an excellent book. What Walt Disney accomplished through the power of his genius and ability to tap into the genius of others is simply amazing. But this book is a stark revelation of the damage the current management has done to the Disney Company. If you are a Disney fan, I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Pulitzer prize winner James B. Stewart paints a portrait of Michael Eisner that has more in common with a totalitarian dictator than with most CEOs. Stewart is careful, though, to trace the Walt Disney Company's growth and success under Eisner, even though he was really running Disney for the benefit of just a handful of people - including himself. And, just as carefully, Stewart traces the company's spiraling internal chaos. The pluses: the author tells an instructive, intricate corporate saga in intriguing detail. Minuses: He is no expert on the film industry and the narrative doesn't build much momentum. Frustratingly, although no doubt for sound reportorial reasons, he also mostly refuses to draw conclusions until the short final chapter. We recommend this troubling portrait of corporate excess and misbehavior to all managers and to students of entertainment and media as a lesson on the pitfalls of untamed corporate politics and unbridled CEO power."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"For the reader who has been to any of its theme parks or enjoyed any of the Disney films over the past two decades, this book is required reading. James B. Stewart has won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the corruption and hubris of the business community (for Mr. Stewart's writing at its best, see his \\"Den of Thieves\\"). \\"Disneywar\\" is his history of the 20 year reign of Michael Eisner as CEO of the Disney Company, culminating in a corporate high noon showdown between Mr. Eisner and Roy Disney.Though the book could have been trimmed a bit, Mr Stewart presents a thorough account of how the finished Disney product that the reader knows (whether it is \\"The Lion King\\", the theme parks, et al) came to be. Why Mr. Eisner should granted such unprecedented access to Mr. Stewart is still unclear to me, for his public image will take a further tumble with the release of this book.The reporting is impressive, the writing is clear and the behind the history tale is interesting. It is a fun read with the financial details make understandable for the non-MBA reader. A prequel of sorts is \\"Storming The Magic Kingdom\\" by John Taylor (1987) which tells the story of the corporate raiders who attempted to take over the Disney Company in the early 1980's."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Having grown up in the eighties and remembering first-hand movies like \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" and whats more gaining an affinity and admiration for their creators I plunged into DisneyWar. Having landed a job while in college at The Disney Store just after the Ovitz fiasco I first learned of the darker side to 'Uncle Eisner' that Disney character that played himself on T.V. Sunday nights.Stewart's book is a juicy chunk of details involving Eisner and his (in his mind) bit players including Katzenberg, Ovitz, and Roy Disney. Each of these men in their rise within the Disney corporate structure and the chance at the coveted presidency threaten Eisner. A cycle of corporate double-speak and false promises ensues and with each one cost face and money. Michael Ovitz' record severance package, Katzenberg's infamous 2% clause that Eisner disputed and delayed to the tune of $280 million. Ovitz' hiring was among scores of conflicts of interests of which include the offering of a seat on the board to a fundraiser for the Gehry-designed Disney Concert Hall. (Eisner wanted her to stop asking the company for money to help pay for it. Eisner himself never personally donated any money for it.)That none of the characters are infalliable and essentially it comes down to battle of the millionaire's egos is not suprising. It is daunting to learn of Eisner's perception of power. True, he revitalized a dying brand but since then he has allowed pettiness or just plain lack of innovativeness to control his decision making. How else to explain not acquiring Pixar when he had multiple occasions? To pass on various projects such as 'Lord of the Rings'? Worst of all, to think that his ideas have a place anymore in creative places such as his embarassing 'Pomp and Circumstance' suggestion in \\"Fantasia 2000\\". The book itself reads like a listing of facts with no particular voice...like a Vanity Fair article turned into a book. It spends a little too much time on the ABC acquisition and not enough on animation. For a book on a man that controls a company with such vast departments Stewart does maintain a good balancing act of addressing Eisner's approach to each. Indeed it becomes clear that Eisner's inability to see that he may be overextending himself and thus impair his judgement (especially after his heart surgery) is Machivellian to say the least.Ironically the conclusion is that he is the kind of executive that he hates...he creates bad publicity and is risky in the wrong places. Disney movies, particularly animation continually lose money and the brand itself is tainted: the name synonymous with greed. Read the book and see just how the magic faded."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Certainly the author researched the book well and the reader felt a part of the inner machinations of the company, but after 200 pages, I felt thoroughly disgusted with all the characters, feeling little empathy or sympathy. After a while it was hard to get excited about millions, billions or zillions of dollars and stock options and I felt Walt Disney and the creators of Snow White, Fantasia and Pinocchio must be turning over in their graves at the current crop of Disney leaders."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I'm at the beach in Cabo San Lucas and although this book is heavy, still hard-back, and what some might think dry for beach reading, I am completely loving it. Never have I been so intrigued by the business practices of any company. It helps that I am a Disney fanatic, but I find myself more wrapped up in the dramatic aspect of this story as opposed to a love for the company. It's very interesting to see how a monolithic corporation like Disney has an affect on our daily lives and why they have been so tumultuous in recent years.I would reccommend this book to anyone and if you love Disneyland, this will give you even more reason to as their is so much passion found in most of the people working for Disney. It is also good to know that people make mistakes and we can learn from them. Please read if you have some time!"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"I'm not sure the people who rated this book 3-stars read the same book that I did. All I can say is that it has been years since I have read a book that kept me as enthralled as this brilliant work by a pulitzer prize winner. I was amazed at how juvenile and insecure the people who ran the company were...the back stabbing and grab for credit was simply amazing.Eisner comes across as slightly unstable and one has to wonder if he really was the right man to stay and run Disney for 20 years. When Disney hired Eisner it was a sleeping giant with enormous potential that Eisner and his cronies were able to \\"awaken\\" with some pretty easy fixes. After the obvious, well, that's when the tough part really began for all of these childish, boorish, and insecure men.In my mind, Eisner's run as CEO will always be tarnished. Every man has flaws but Eisner has a lot more than his share. This book is one heck of an engaging read. I hated to finish and had trouble getting anything done while reading this engaging book. I'm not sure how anyone could not love this business soap opera. Stewart has always been a cut above and I am grateful that a man of his ability tackled this particular project. The reader is the big winner. 5 very enthusiatic stars!"},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"In the Prologue, the guy shares some of his own experiences as a Cast Member in the late 70s and early 80s.More interesting, though, is how he describes his pursuit of Michael Eisner to give him access to Disney's inner workings for a full year to write a behind-the-scenes book about the Company.Only a couple months after Eisner finally agreed, though, was when all the Roy Disney/Stanley Gold/Shareholder Revolt stuff started, and the \\"behind-the-scenes at Disney\\" slowly morphed into a VERY intriguing book chronicling the company during Eisner's tenure.It is VERY well-written, all factual, and manages to stay surprisingly neutral. It may be hundreds of pages long, but I cannot put it down... and I HATE reading!Yes, Michael Eisner quickly became one of the richest CEOs in America. Yes, he was hell-bent on making money. But everything you don't know about Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Ovitz, and his \\"real\\" relationship with Roy Disney will truly disturb you. It's acary how much power some people have, and especially scary to learn why some decisions were actually made."},{"Title":"DisneyWar","review":"Megalomania has unlikely been put on a more searing plain than what author James B. Stewart has done with Michael Eisner in this fascinating book about the Machiavellian power structure he built at Disney. Having been a big fan of his book on the underbelly of Wall Street in the eighties, \\"Den of Thieves\\", I was greatly anticipating Stewart's take on the harsh business realities within the Magic Kingdom. He does not disappoint in what seems almost like an update of \\"Citizen Kane\\" by recounting Eisner's \\"Rosebud\\" moment when as a 7-year-old, Eisner lost a boxing match to a child twice his size and refused to cry in front of his stern father. Stewart then uses a first-person approach to conversations that he obviously could not have witnessed and even playing something of an investigative role as he spends a day in a Goofy costume at Walt Disney World. More importantly, the author paints a portrait of a complex man who had a track record of turning around failing studios like Paramount but seemed completely at odds with what turned out to be the family-like Disney culture.Fully empowered as CEO, Eisner was not interested in upholding Disney traditions in filmmaking, according to Stewart, but rather increasing the bottom line to fund the perks and salary for himself and his executives. Granted he expanded the empire to include television channels, Broadway shows and other assorted properties, but he also fumbled badly when it came to key hiring decisions, chief among them was Hollywood &uuml;ber-agent Michael Ovitz, who was admittedly \\"not sophisticated about matters of corporate management.\\" But Ovitz was savvy enough to know that Eisner was stabbing him in the back the minute expectations dipped with Ovitz. Eisner was certainly not intuitive when it came to potential moneymakers for the studio, bypassing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" and almost \\"Finding Nemo\\", the latter resulting in what looks to be an irreconcilable firestorm with Steve Jobs, head of Pixar. Key talent like Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney to build their own fortunes leaving Disney in near-financial ruin. Yet, for all the venom spewed at Eisner, justifiable as it may be, Stewart puts second-in-command Bob Iger under an equally unforgiving microscope and sees a problematic CEO-in-the-making, already scarred by the purchase of the precarious Fox Family Channel at a hefty price tag of $5.2 billion. Iger comes across as equal parts toady and mercenary and hardly the inspiration for a Disney renaissance. This is good, dishy stuff, and Stewart is a pro at making all this feel like a cross between penetrating investigative journalism and an episode of \\"Dynasty\\". Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jungian Symbolism in Astrology","review":"The semi-autobiographical format of this charming book makes it a must for any student of astrology, no matter their level of expertise. It is especially meaningful for those with an interest in Jungian depth psychology or the therapy process. It provides a wonderfully warm and humorous introduction to astrology without the common cookbook format which can be so exceedingly boring, yet can be enjoyed just as thoroughly by those with any level of astrological knowledge.While in Monterey, MA visiting my in-laws, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Alice Howell was their neighbor. A meeting was arranged and I spent a delightful time sharing afternoon tea with her and being regaled with wonderful antecdotes that so reminded me of this favorite book of mine.My own copy is well worn and profusely highlighted and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a profoundly insightful and valuable addition to their astrological library."},{"Title":"Jungian Symbolism in Astrology","review":"Alice O Howell is such a fantastic and lively writer.

Jung himself would have loved the syncronicity of events that brought this book into my life. After being a self taught student of Astrology for almost 20 years, it was this little book that \\"opened the floodgates\\" for me and helped me to understand Astrology at a whole new, higher and holistic level.Written as a series of personal letters, it gives the reader the feeling that the words are intended especially for you. I fell in love with Ms. Howell after reading this book, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in Astrology."},{"Title":"Mary: A History of Doctrine and Devotion","review":"I have had the oportunity to work extensively with this book as a theology student studying the history and development of the doctrine and devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. I am a Catholic priest and I work in Latin America in the Family Rosary Apostolate. I have been taking this past year to study, and as much as I can I have finally been getting to the more in depth study of Marian devotion that I have wanted to do for years. This book, together with Jaroslave Pelikan's &quot;Mary through the Centuries&quot; have been the most valuable resources, and someone who did not have much time to study could simply work with these two books and come away with quite a bit of depth and breadth in their Marian knowledge. Mrs. Graef offers a wealth of detailed yet broad knowledge about Marian devotion and Mariology as it has developed through the centuries. Her treatment is at the same time reverent and questioning in a healthy way (i.e., she questions tendencies to excess that at times have entered into Marian devotion. As John XXIII said, Mary is not pleased when she is elevated higher than her Son.) The work is well written, and is appropriate equally for the scholar and any intellegent and interested reader."},{"Title":"Mary: A History of Doctrine and Devotion","review":"Hilda Graef has written a very detailed and comprehensive account of the development of Marian doctrines. She begins with Mary in the New Testament, pointing out the fact that the Lord actually extended the motherhood of Mary from Himself to the entire church (John 19:26). Graef devotes some detail to Revelation 12 and notes that, because of the \\"totality thinking\\" of the Hebrew mind, this chapter refers to BOTH Mary and the entire Christian church.A good summary of the development of Marian doctrines in the first few centuries of the Church is given by Graef on page 160. She points out that the concept of Mary as the \\"second Eve\\" goes back to early post-apostolic times. Graef suggests that the veneration of Mary, at least in the Greek church, was well underway by the middle of the 4th century. By that time, Mary was called Theotokos.Epiphanius is credited with being the first witness to the idea of Mary's bodily Assumption into heaven. Soon thereafter, a sect called the Collyrideans actually worshipped Mary. Ephiphanius condemned this, pointing out that, while Mary is beautiful and holy and venerable, she is not to be worshipped (pp. 72-73).Graef then traces the course of Mariology throughout the remainder of history. One notable aspect of this is the Ave Maris Stella. In this Marian hymn dating from the Middle Ages, Mary was portrayed as the Star of the Sea who guides travelers into port."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"This book was one of the most intreguing and memorable books I ever read. When Steven King lamented that \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" was not read much these days, he was right to the mark. Don't miss this great murder mystery. A villan you'll hate in an irresistible story.Be sure to read the Amazon review by Ryan Harvey \\"Wolf Shadow.\\" Here's a quote from Ryan Harvey's review:\\"Stephen King once commented about author Ira Levin: 'Every novel he has ever written has been a marvel of plotting. He is the Swiss watchmaker of the suspense novel; he makes what the rest of us do look like those five-dollar watches you can buy in the discount drug stores.' He went on to lament that Levin's most effective book (and his first!), 'A Kiss before Dying,' is not much read these days.\\""},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"A Kiss Before Dying combines psychological suspense with precision plotting. Every detail dovetails; there are no superfluous characters, no extraneous filler, each fact carries the story forward, twisting and turning, to its chilling conclusion. This is the sort of book you can reread with pleasure, noting how even the smallest details co-incide.Levin has a great ear for dialogue. The characters of the three Kingship daughters are clearly differentiated, yet not stereotyped. Even minor characters come alive. Levin has begun his trademark use of day-to-day minutia to counterpoint the growing horror and tension, a technique that he would hone to perfection in Rosemary's Baby.I recommend this novel wholeheartedly. It is hard to find a flaw in it."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"A Kiss Before Dying follows a man who decides he wants to kill his girlfriend when he finds out she is pregnant with his son.

He makes it look like suicide. The family of the girl is in complete shock.This is a well written book that holds you in suspense. At the same time it disgusts you that a human would be able to kill someone so violently."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read.

Thinking in 50's terms, the book certainly was a great and thrilling read, but audiences are more sophisticated today, and what was probable in 56 is not so probable today, and even seems a little dumb. But, if you've managed to hold on to your innocence and haven't plowed through a thousand illogical TV and Film mysteries, you might get a kick out of this one-time great mystery which spawned copies everywhere."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"The first two parts of this book are excellent. Part One is chilling because of its depiction of what is now known as Anti-Social Personality Disorder. The fact that it was written way back in the 50's long before American Psycho's Patrick Bateman makes this even more creepy. Part One manages to put the reader in the killer's deranged little mind and even makes us cheer him on a little bit.Part Two of the book is excellent because it is completely different from Part One. It puts us in the shoes of the victim from Part One's sister as she tries to discover the identity of the killer and narrows it down to two men, but which one?It's unfortunate that Part Three is so typical after the cleverness of Parts One and Two. The ending isn't nearly as shocking as the end of Levin's later masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby but up until Part Three you'll be on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"Ira Levin always goes to the dark heart of the human beast--and in this, his first novel, he certainly shows an understanding of his species.

As I had hoped, A KISS BEFORE DYING delivered twounbelievable surprises that shot me out of my seat. And, as with Levin's superior novel ROSEMARY'S BABY, Levin uses a simple but firm prose. It was a fairly satisfying read. On the other hand, I was disappointed. The first part of the book is almost a blow by blow ripoff of Dreiser's AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY. Between its clever surprises, I was left bored and counting pages. And the ending is sadly contrived coming off of its earlier brilliance. A KISS BEFORE DYING is worth a read for its several shocks, but the rest is dismissable, dated, and sadly predictable after fifty years of similar TV movies."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"I am digusted with the meanness of some of these reviews.Although this identifies me as a naive and simpleminded reader, I must admit that I found the book impossible to put down, and speed read it in about four hours.

Just when you think you have the whole thing figured out, Ira Levin throws another shocking curveball your way, which keeps you wondering until the very end. If you're a fan of mystery/suspense novels, this is one of the best in its class.(Note: this is the second Levin book that I've read, \\"The Stepford Wives\\" being the first.

While his stories are a bit far-fetched (as with \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", \\"The Boys From Brazil\\", and \\"The Stepford Wives\\") they are always entertaining.

The girl is pregnant and the choice ahead is grim: either get married and lose daddy's money, or risk an illegal abortion (remember this book takes place circa 1950).

Good characterizations, including the murderer.I'd put it on my top ten list for suspense novels."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"This 1950s thriller opens with a college couple's conversation about their unwanted pregnancy. Her name is Dorrie; his is not revealed until much later in the novel. Dorrie has a wealthy father who will surely disown her if she marries her lover and has his baby. Her lover feels that abortion is the only answer, since, really, what's the point of marrying a rich girl if her funds are cut off? In his mind, though, there is at least one other solution: kill the girl, make it look like a suicide, and move on. This scenario reminded me somewhat of Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy. Anyway, the manner in which our anti-hero elicits a suicide note from Dorrie is clever indeed, and he still has a few more tricks up his sleeve. So does the author. The most intriguing section in the book is when Dorrie's sister Ellen, never convinced that Dorrie's death was a suicide, starts digging into Dorrie's demise. She has just enough to go on to narrow her murder suspects down to two. Since we still don't know his name at this point, we fear for her safety as she pursues these two strangers. There are some very tense moments, and we discover his identity at the same moment that she does. He's a twisted sociopath, emboldened by his horrifying success, who will now stop at nothing to achieve the social and financial status that he craves. The dialog and quandaries may be dated, but the suspense that Levin generates has not gone out of style."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"A Kiss Before Dying takes one back to men wearing fedoras and languidly building suspense plots. This one keeps adding layer on layer. You know what's going to happen, but when? And how?

A lot of us didn't know that Levin had started out doing traditional mystery/suspense before turning to horror (STEPFORD WIVES, ROSEMARY'S BABY, etc.) We were talking about how much, as a group, we enjoy shocking plot twists, and one of us said that A KISS BEFORE DYING has one of the best plot twists of all time. We took that as a challenge and decided to read the book.It's tough to describe the plot without giving away too many details. But I will try: It's the story of a social-climbing, money-grubbing young man who decides the best way to live an idle life is to marry a girl with money. (Several of us noted that the concept is far from unique--isn't this the main plot of so many Gothics, and isn't this the way it was done in the world until very recently?) He thinks he has it made, but then the girl gets pregnant--which is problem, because her widowed father is a prig and will likely disown her when he finds out. So he decides to take matters into his own hands... (And this is just the first few pages of the book, but it does give a good idea of what the book is about.)I can't say more because even trying to describe the book, its structure, and its tricks would give away the pleasures of the read. Suffice it to say that we took a vote, and of the twelve of us in the room, ten said that the book does indeed have the single best plot twist they'd ever read. I mean, it's really, really shocking and surprising, and it's testament to Levin's abilities a writer and storyteller that he gets away with it. When you realize what has happened, you sort of shake your head in disbelief, but then you go back and re-read some things, and you see how Levin made it happen.The more interesting discussion was whether the twist is \\"fair\\" and if it plays by the rules or not. We talked for quite a while about that, and the conclusion we came to is that this kind of trick can only be pulled off in writing. If you read the book, you will see what we mean. Again, I can't go into details for fear of a spoiler!The book is a very fast read, and it seems to be more from a different era because of the way the characters are drawn. They are pretty two-dimensional, and you either like them or you don't, which is fine for whiling away the time with a good mystery. We had some good discussion, too, about the ending of the book, and whether we liked it or not. This is so frustrating--I'm afraid to said anything more because I know it would be a no-no to prejudice readers' ideas about the book before reading it.All told, we were glad we read this, and we were sorry that Levin didn't do more with the traditional mystery/suspense book. Then again, if you are only going to write one mystery, A KISS BEFORE DYING is a heck of a thing to have written."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"I am reading this book for the third time. The first time was when it first came out, then some years later, and now I'm reading it again. Although I don't usually read mysteries, this one is so mesmerising that over the years I have always counted this as one of my favorite books, no matter what the genre. It is fast paced, not an unnecessary word. And the ending-- well, you have to read it."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"Stephen King once commented about author Ira Levin: \\"Every novel he has ever written has been a marvel of plotting. He is the Swiss watchmaker of the suspense novel; he makes what the rest of us do look like those five-dollar watches you can buy in the discount drug stores.\\" He went on to lament that Levin's most effective book (and his first!), \\"A Kiss before Dying,\\" is not much read these days.Here's your chance to fix this situation! \\"A Kiss before Dying\\" is now back in print, in a nice trade paperback, for the first time since the early 90s (when a mass-market paperback was briefly available to tie-in with the forgotten movie adaptation starring Sean Young and Matt Dillon). First published in 1953 when Levin was only twenty-three, \\"A Kiss before Dying\\" is one of the most remarkable suspense novels ever penned and a masterpiece of literary noir. The greatest suspense writer of all time, Cornell Woolrich, highly influenced Levin, and this book seems like an overt homage to many of Woolrich's devices. It's the only suspense novel I know of that honestly compares with the master.To tell much about the plot would ruin the shocks and surprises awaiting you in these pages. Levin hurls out plot twists that genuinely jolt the reader and turn the whole story upside down in moments (King referred to one of the twists as \\"a real screeching bombsell\\" of a surprise). The story begins at a large college, where Dorothy Kingship, daughter of a wealthy industrialist, has learned that she is pregnant. Her boyfriend, a handsome, dashing, but callous, calculating, and completely amoral young man is unhappy with the news; he hoped to marry into the rich family as his quick ticket to success, and the uptight Leo Kingship will certainly disinherit his daughter when he finds out about the pregnancy. Dorothy wants to marry right away, not caring if her father cuts her off or not, but her boyfriend starts secretly devising another plan...if only he can make it look like suicide...And that's merely the beginning. The book takes so many u-turns and switchbacks that you'll spend most of your time reading it shaking with tension. Levin crafts his three central set-pieces using minute detail that makes for agonizing suspense. He lets the reader in on the secrets of the story bit by bit, but the more you know, the tenser the story becomes. Sometimes, you know the WHAT and WHO of a situation, but not the WHEN or HOW. At other times, you know the WHAT and WHEN but not WHO. Levin will drive you nearly mad in places! King is right: Levin's plotting is so ingenious it's like workings of a perfect machine.But beyond plot machinery, Levin dazzles in another area: characterizations. Like Woolrich, Levin can create haunting portraits of lonely souls, and frightening sketches of soulless killers. \\"A Kiss before Dying\\" is pure noir: a world of sad people aching for real love and of people who find that killing is no more difficult than putting on a jacket. This is not a \\"snack food\\" suspense novel like you find sitting on bestseller shelves. This is a novel that will stay with you for a long time.It's unfortunate that Levin has written so few novels since (he didn't write his second novel, \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" until fourteen years later; he spent the time between as a writer for TV and Broadway stage). Everything he has written is worth reading (check out \\"The Stepford Wives,\\" \\"The Boys from Brazil,\\" \\"Sliver,\\" and his hit play &quot;Deathtrap&quot;), but \\"A Kiss before Dying\\" is his art at its best. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"Do you know how most books save their big surprise for the end? This one fools ya -- there are a couple of big surprises sprinkled at the most, well, surprising places in the book.

Even the villain is memorable, and in many ways, understandable.Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance"},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"'A kiss before dying' was written in the fifties, and apart from some very non-essential aspects it is not dated at all. The book is about a young college student from a poor family who wants to marry a rich girl and for that he is prepared to do practically everything.

It is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"This book began my love for the writing of Ira Levin. It is so stylish and damnably clever and holds up perfectly, these many years later. I have given this book to several people recently and they all have been amazed by it. So deftly plotted, the writing so assured. And even though the plot device has been ripped off ad nauseum by many lesser talents, this book still packs a helluva wallop. Bravo"},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"This is one of the most suspenseful, most enjoyable books I've ever read. How tired I was on 3 workday mornings because I'd stayed up late reading this book, unable to put it down - only 3 mornings because I read it all in 4 evenings. This book is too good to give away any of the plot. Reading it, I felt I was watching one of Hitchock's best movies playing in my brain. There's a point about 1/3 through the book where I stopped dumbfounded and said to myself \\"no way - that can't be\\", and then thumbed through the pages I'd just read to confirm it *was* true. An absolutely ingenious element left me feeling like I was starting from the beginning after reading 1/3 of the book. There are many other twists and surprises in this story, too, and the subject matter is surprisingly contemporary.I can't imagine anyone not loving this book."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"The thing that sets this book apart from other, similarly plotted stories is the way that Levin plays with our emotions concerning the murderer. For the first third of the novel, there is a small part of us that is sypathetic with this man; we almost catch ourselves hoping that he does not get caught. Several surprises later, however, and our emotions are totally flip-flopped. Now we are gived things from another persons perspective, and we can see just how monstrous this man really is. The book is very addictive (I finished it easily in two days), but the ending left me slightly unsatisfied. I would still place Levin's &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; and &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; above it, but it is impressive nonetheless considering that it is one of Levin's earlier novels."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"I have read several of Ira Levin's books. I have really liked them all. Ira has a style of writing that engages you and makes you feel like a friend is telling you the story. If you have seen &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (Elizabeth Taylor, Shelly Winters - a fabulous movie) then you pretty much are going to guess most of the story. It doesn't differ too much from that, HOWEVER you will be engrossed absolutley even though you THINK you know what's going to happen :) I was a little disappointed with the ending-the rest of the book was so exciting that the end seemed a little too neat and pretty - pretty. I really don't think you can go wrong no matter which Ira Levin book you read (or can manage to find..most are no longer in print-part of the attraction). Devious actions and thoughts make his characters memorable. I think the real horror lies in his ability to take a mundane thing and find the dark side of it."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"The author sure knows how to keep things exiting! He always ends the chapter with a thrilling moment, which made me want to go on reading. I almost couldn't put the book aside, I utilized every spare hour. Her style of writing pleased me very well, it never drops off. I experienced this book as a form of acting, in writing. The characters in the story are individually exposed from the inside, in a seamless performance from one perspective to the other. Perhaps this is the secret of this books' vividness. I detected only one small thing where I was beginning to feel bored about; In the part called \\"Marion\\", we caught sight of the inside of the factory of Mr. Kingship, by looking through Buds' eyes. But in my view he was endlessly persuading about it, I got tired of it. All in all I'm very glad I've read this book. The film wasn't as good as the book itself."},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"It is a shame that there are not more books out there like this one with fast moving suspense. All I could think of while reading this book was how tight the story was. Ira Levin does not waste a single word. He gets right to the point and holds you there!! This book made me want to read everything that Ira Levin has ever written. Fantastic!! If you like great suspense, psychological thrillers and stories with a twist...this book is definately for you!"},{"Title":"Kiss Before Dying","review":"Just when you think you know exactly where this little tale is headed, it veers off on one of the most unexpected (and simply perfect) twists I've read in a long time.

By contrast, Webb's book covers much of the history of cosmological distance measurement, including errors and changes-of-mind.Webb's book proceedes in a very good, logical, historical order of measurements: the Earth, the Solar System, nearby stars, more distant stars, the Galaxy, the Local Group, more distant galaxies, the universe, yielding the current standard models.It covers well the successive improvements and changes in theoretical models, as they adapted to fit new data. It is always insightful to see what people could do with fairly minimal data, and where they seemed to go wrong, and how those errors were later corrected.This offers an especially good reminder that much science is a series of successive approximations, although sometimes a modest improvement of data accuracy may well overturn an existing theory.It also emphasizes the dependence of the distances to further objects on relationships with nearer objects. Figure 11.6 seems an especially nice summary of the inter-relationships among the various measurement techniques.Readers without some college-level math and physics background may find it a bit heavy-going. However, each chapter tends to be useful, with less math up front, so that one need only go as deep as is comfortable.Webb is also to be complimented for at least mentioning dissenting views, such as those of Fred Hoyle or Halton Arp (as in &quot;Seeing Red - Redshifts, Cosmology, and Academic Science&quot;).All-in-all, this is a good book that ties together many problems and measurements in a coherent way."},{"Title":"Measuring the Universe: The Cosmological Distance Ladder (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"This is an excellent account and a well-written history of how we meaure distances within the solar system, galaxy, cosmos.

Amazon needs to,step up and improve typeface quality to make things more legible."},{"Title":"Measuring the Universe: The Cosmological Distance Ladder (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"Rating.....Three and a half stars, and here's why:This book explains clearly and simply how it is that distances are measured in astronomy. It is composed of long descriptive sections plus a scattering of simple equations (no calculus), so it is accessible to all students and enthusiasts of astronomy having only a small knowledge of algebraic manipulation. The arguments are pared down to their essentials, so this book is a quick path to understanding those large portions of astronomy which are needed in the process of astronomical distance measurement. This book is by far the strongest in its first half, which describes in extensive detail the \\"baseline truths\\" upon which the Cosmological Distance Ladder is built up: planetary distances, parallaxes, moving cluster method, main-sequence fitting, and the Cepheid period-luminosity relation.The book then moves to an all too cursory discussion of the critically important problem of dust extinction (the dimming by dust of the light of our \\"standard candles\\" such as Cepheid stars), both the foreground extinction from the Milky Way and the extinction coming from within external galaxies. This is where the book gets frustrating, because, while the essentials are there, the book does not give you the means to calculate the extinction value in front of a galaxy with any precision or to understand how astronomers figure out dust extinction values. An up-to-date discussion of extinction is lacking, despite the fact this is essential even in a basic exposition of how to derive the distances of astronomical objects. (and by the way, extinction calculations require only simple maths).The second half of this book discusses the various up-to-date methods that today's astronomers use to measure the distances of galaxies, e.g. Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function, Surface Brightness Fluctuations method, Tully-Fisher method, Globular Cluster Luminosity Function, etc. However, by this stage of the book, the reader is treated only to a bare-bones treatment of each method , which is only enough to generate a broad understanding, without really teaching him/her how the methods are to be used in a realistic way.At the end of this book, the dedicated amateur, or early undergraduate, or college student, will have learnt a lot of astronomy; moreover presented in an easy and gentle \\"pain free\\" manner. However, the book could easily have presented adequately detailed and up-to-date discussions of the modern distance-measurement methods, rather than giving mere sketches of them. Thus, the book wastes a very good opportunity to bring the reader to the point of fully understanding how it is that professional astronomers currently measure galaxy distances."},{"Title":"Enchanted Places: The Use of Setting in F.

The proper 2:1 ratio is 2: for omega 6, and 1: for omega 3 [1,000 mgs of omega 6 twice a day, 500 mgs omega 3 twice a day]. These dosages were transposed in both the Wrinkle Cure and the Perricone Prescription. There are quite a few misprints as to dosages, but am taking Dr. Perricone's \\"Prescription\\" with a grain of salt. I learned a great deal about antioxidants, nutrition in general, as I furthered my research outside of Dr. Perricone's books, and vit c/c-ester products.ONE OF HIS BOOKS IS ENOUGH -- Wrinkle Cure is best; you don't have to suffer the embarrassment of those before and after photos in the Perricone Prescription.

THERE IS A CHEAPER WAY TO DO THIS THING!!! You will find some remarkable changes in your skin and the way you feel."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"Dr. Perricone developed a triple skin care program that provides a wrinkle-free skin through diet, supplements, and cosmetics. He promotes a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet which is heavy on fish, especially wild salmon, non-starchy vegetables and a limited variety of fruits. Although he considers his diet balanced, he prescribes a huge number of supplements in large amounts. And he sells a skin-care line at exorbitant prices with questionable ingredients.Throughout the book he emphasizes his medical training and makes you believe that if you don't trust his advice you prove your ignorance. He shows a series of photographs that he has taken of patients before and after they had undergone his wrinkle-free treatment. The pictures show no difference at all although he keeps pointing to the lack of blemishes on the faces. The blemishes are there, before and after. The only visible difference is that many of the patients wear make-up on the after-pictures while they were photographed without make-up before the treatment. In two patients the after-pictures show more wrinkles or blemishes than in the previous photographs. This, of course, can be due to photography, lighting, etc. but whatever the reason, the photographs do not prove his claims (namely that his diet reduces wrinkles).Perricone claims that his diet is well balanced and healthy. I wonder why he has to supplement it with such large amounts of vitamins and minerals. To his benefit, though, he does list foods that contain those vitamins naturally.Throughout the book, Perricone emphasizes the value of fish, especially salmon, which you should eat at least 5 times a week, and possibly more often. He recommends wild salmon, which is the most expensive salmon available but, according to government sources, also the least polluted. In addition to salmon he also recommends mackerel, tuna, and later on the list, swordfish - all three are known to have high concentrations of heavy metals. (And while some of them are still acceptable under US government standards, they are not by Canadian government standards.) I am not refuting that fish is healthy, but from all the data I have read about toxins in food, no diet should rely so much on aquatic animals.The Perricone diet recommends primrose and borage oils, while other authors question its use, especially the forerunner of the omega-connection Dr. Artemis P. Simopoulos. She states that both oils convert in the human body to arachidonic acid, which causes inflammation.I also wonder about his meal combinations. Salmon for breakfast does not strike me as too odd, if you can afford it. But combining salmon with raspberries? Or hard-boiled egg with strawberries? Or salmon with oatmeal and blueberries? Those combinations are not created for a sane palate but from a list of food items that fulfill certain requirements: no starch, no sugar, high protein.Omitting sugar and junk food from one's diet is certainly good advice. And this alone will get results But the rest of it, I am unconvinced. Especially because the before-and-after photographs do not prove the author's point.To complete my search, I looked at his cosmetics line on the Web. Two ounces of Firming Activator cost $95 on-line! 6 ounces of Nutritive Cleanser cost $30. Both products list ingredients that are known skin irritants, such as fragrances, parabens, and according to some studies, sodium laureth sulfate. The products also contain diazolidinyl urea, which is a preservative said to release formaldehyde.I would like to end my critique with a statement Perricone made in the New York Times on November 18, 2001, saying \\"Promise them an unlined face, and you can sell them anything.\\" His book, and especially his cosmetic line, reflects that attitude. He is selling the Empress new clothes."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"This book will change how I live life.

Dr.Perricone's book--bless him--is the first to present a diet plan for people with my skin type--and it works!On a more general level, the book features other diets for other skin types and ethnicities. While I can only speak for myself and my own specific needs, I would imagine that his suggestions stand as correct for he seemed to know exactly what my skin needed in terms of nourishment. Yes, his diet does strictly adhere to 'Zone-like' principles--but so what? It works in terms of better looking skin and in over all good health. Another fantastic bonus benefit? Weight loss.If you can afford them--check out his products. I was lucky enough to receive a few of them last Christmas--and they are wonderful. I was using a popular Shea Butter face cream prior to trying the Perricone grouping, and this was causing black heads and oil build-up. Not so with Dr. Perricone's products. They glide on and offer protection in both dry and cold weather. Along with his food guidelines, they are promoted at the famous Camelback Spa in Phoenix Arizona---used in their facial treatments. As for the supplements, you don't have to buy his--the basic three are packaged in a similar health food supplement blend that you can buy cheaply in your health food store.His ideas make good sense and contrary to the comments of another reviewer, I think his face looks pretty darn good. Lines in your face also reflect your personality---they aren't synonomous with poor diet or skin care. If you are after a blank page look with absolutely no expression,never mind the diet or the supplements, go to your dermatologist for Botox injections.I deducted a star for some of Perricone's obviously self-serving rhetoric."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I have to say that I became hooked on this when my 65 year old mother shed 20 lbs. after years of not being able to lose a pound.

A bit of advice: be sure to SMELL his products before you buy them....stinky!

I went shopping for the first 3 day diet. And that cost me $75 dollars. That's just for 3 days of the diet. I purchased 1 month of the recommended supplements, that came out to almost $200. I had scoured the internet to get the cheapest prices. That's just for 1 month. And the time that you have to spend preparing the food (cooking the salmon etc.) is incredible. You can spend all your time and money just trying to ward off wrinkles. You have to weigh your priorities. I did feel better after being on the diet. But the supplements are just way overkill. My stomach couldn't even handle all of the supplements. My recommendation would be to stick with the diet, but avoid the supplements or scale them down some how. I came to the conclusion that it was just taking too much time to cook the food, and too much money. Unless you are Bill Gates and have a personal chef that follows you around, I cannot recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I absolutely love this book - It is challenging to think differently about all the rules we have been sold about eating.This book helps you understand the chemical processes your body goes through in response to the food you eat. It also justifies the reason why a lot of us gain weight while we are under stress.(I wish my family doctor would have explained it to me!). I have started making small changes and I already feel great... in only ten days, I have taken off 6 pounds. I feel better, and am not craving sugar as I always have.

Much of approach relates to avoiding and reducing inflammation.

I would classify this as a \\"science/ excercise book\\" more than a \\"self-help book\\". It is not a \\"skin care\\" book either. It explains how cells work and how supplements, food, and excercise affect your enitre body, not just your skin. The intended audience isn't looking for a quick \\"miracle\\" cure, it's looking for the real cure and this is it! Knowledge is the most powerful tool to fight acne and this book has lots of it. There is so much information, I decided to take it a step at a time: Step 1: cutting down on coffee and replacing it with green tea. Step 2: taking alpha lipoic acid (actually, I empty the capsules into the green tea, two treatments, one drink). RESULTS SO FAR: 1. I feel healthier! More energy, less toxic. 2. My skin is alot more clear. I still have a break out here and there, but it heals faster. I can't wait to add topical and oral DMAE to the regimen! And after that, there are dozens of more ideas in this book that will probably make me even healthier and clear my skin. I would also like to add that this book contains actual *directions/ illustrations* for yoga and effective information about healing scars, so in addition to clearing your skin, it will save you $ on books."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"Dr. Perricone's diet requires giving up a lot of &quot;comfort foods&quot; like sugars, starches, butter and coffee. But he offers high quality replacements that bring dramatic results in the way one looks and feels. One reviewer criticized all the time it takes to prepare the food, which I don't find to be true at all. Wild salmon is one of the easiest, fastest most versatile foods to cook there is--and can be sauteed or broiled in half the time it takes to prepare fettucini alfredo.Once you experience the profound benefits of adopting Dr. Perricone's suggestions, kicking the foods that are responsible for so many health problems becomes much easier.

Any diet that recommends fresh wild salmon is starting out on the right foot."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"The book is great, I love that his approach considers all aspects of looking and being healthy (food, fitness, anti-aging) and I agree with his inflammation=disease and anti-aging theory. In response to the woman who was looking for feedback about Dr. Perricone's product line, I can honestly tell you they are the only products that have worked, and I have tried everything. I am not quite your age but am in my 30s and was seeing a sagging face that despite my efforts looked dull, and the fine lines were increasing daily, it seemed. As costly as the products may be, I think they are a bargain, and I pay a lot more being from Canada! I've been using them a short time, only about 3 weeks, but the change in my skin and especially the tone and brightness is incredible. I really can't believe the results I'm getting is possible with a skin care product. In fact, I didn't really know what &quot;brightness&quot; meant, I just thought you'd have a slight glow but my skin is actually a different colour and I get so many compliments on my &quot;naturally&quot; great skin. I use 2 face treatments right now plus the 2 eye treatments and I'll never use anything else again. When I catch my reflection in a mirror I can't believe it's me. When I'm tired, I don't look it. The DMAE in his products works amazingly to contour the jaw and cheekbones. Considering there are products minutes from my doorstep that cost from $100 to $700 and still don't do anything other than give you soft skin (which a drugstore product can do), I think I'm lucky to have stumbled upon the Perricone book and website. (Although his supplements are ridiculously expensive and I think I'm fine with a small selection from my local health store.) If you want specifics about the products I've tried, email me at cpa1@gosympatico.ca.

In other words, slathering all the (often expensive) creams, oils and other skin care products on your skin may not make much difference if you don't pay equal attention to what you put UNDER that skin - what you eat. No revolutionary message, here, but not one that many people looking for a \\"quick fix\\" want to hear.But one worth heeding because I've followed this diet, exercise program and skin care regimen and I can testify from personal experience that it can make a huge difference - not only in how you look but how you feel. Not only did my skin look better but I felt better - and isn't that really a huge part of what looking younger and more vibrant is all about? As a bonus, many of the recipes require nothing more than turning on your broiler and they taste good enough that your kids may even eat them (mine did).

All I can say is the first impressions are looking mighty good."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"Perricone's basic idea is that you can rejuvenate your skin more from the inside than the outside. In other words, the best way to keep your skin looking young and healthy is through diet, eating the healthful foods, and avoiding the bad ones, rather than by putting on lots of expensive creams and lotions. I like this idea since there are lots of other reasons why you should eat a healthier, low-fat diet anyway--such as keeping your heart and blood vessels and other organs healthy, keeping your weight down, and so on. Avoiding high-fat, high-calorie foods and maintaining a healthier diet, exercising, and perhaps avoiding stress (I know, hard to do these days) are still the best way we know to live a long, happy, healthy life, so why not apply the same principles to your skin?I would like see some other scientific evidence on the effectiveness of diet in controlling skin aging, and especially on some of the more controversial aspects of Perricone's nutritional theories. For example, he recommends avoiding carrots, long considered healthy because of their containing beta-carotenes and other anti-oxidants, because of their high glycemic index. Fruit, although high in anti-oxidants, also fall into this high-glycemic category, producing an insulin spike from the pancreas, which is bad because you will store fats rather than burn them.My understanding on this was that you should prefer foods containing monosaccarides such as galactose and glucose, rather than disaccharides such as sucrose, because sucrose was hard on the pancreas and caused insulin spikes, but the simpler sugars didn't, being digested and broken down more gradually over time. Also, not being able to eat any fruit is sure to be a difficult recommendation to follow for many people, maybe more difficult for them than avoiding beef, for example. I found his disussion of why you should eat wild salmon as opposed to farm-raised salmon interesting, but again, I'd like to see more evidence on this.I found his recommendation that you should avoid carbs such as cereals and breads interesting since it's what diabetics need to do--they can eat all the protein they want--but they need to avoid sugar and complex carbs. But unless you're diabetic, most experts don't think you need to do this. Finally, there is now evidence that saturated fats and oils such as cocoanut oil, long-considered a real bad guy, don't produce oxidants and free radicals in the body, but that polyunsaturated fats and oils do.Perricone also includes a lot information on vitamins and minerals, which I found to be more helpful and less controversial than his other nutritional recommendations.Altogether, an interesting book with a different slant on skin aging and nutrition in general, but again, I'd like to see more independent evidence on some of the more controversial aspects of his nutritional ideas. His recommendations on exercise, vitamins, and keeping your weight down are hard to fault, however, and overall, I found the book's advice and message to be positive even if I remain somewhat sceptical on some of his nutritional theories."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"Hi fellow antiWrinkle and antiagers!I wrote this before on a different book review.

If you are really really against fish, there is an alternative suggested (flax) but I would try grilling some fresh alaskan salmon before you go that route.Anyway, after the 3 day diet I went into the office and had _everyone_ who I work with say something about how I looked without any prompting, 3 of them actually said I looked younger.I've tried everything before this diet, and the black circles under my eyes I've had since my early 20s are gone now, just gone.Buy the book, follow it (I actually cheat regularily, and still get great results), you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"It is fiddly, it takes some time, it means a change to your basic shopping and lifestyle - it will attract attention in restaurants when everyone else is tearing the bread apart and sipping their wine while you have the big glass of water. I started doing it but didn't really expect anything too dramatic and I'm lazy so I often don't follow it to the letter. I still drink a bit of coffee and sometimes skip breakfast, I use the creams (not all of them) and can't afford the supplements so I make do with some supplements and a few from the supermarket. I still have a weakness for little snacks which involve crackers and crisps too. However, this water, salmon, berries, melon thing and the creams have got something going for them. Recently a stranger said &quot;your skin is incredible&quot;. I caught sight of myself in a window and I was suprised at my high cheekbones and the way my skin looks stronger and plumper and yet more defined. My face looks quite different actually. Hmmm interesting. My body is changing in a similar way and while this is all early days yet and I'm yet to beat some of my lazy habits I intend to keep dropping more of those carbs out of my diet and powering up on all the good stuff. I'd really rather do this than have injections, face lifts and the like at some stage and prevention is better than cure. When I think about how much money I would spend in my younger days on alcohol, cigarettes (when I smoked) and junk food - not to mention all the fashion buys that didn't work out due to body size I think that if you deducted all that from the &quot;costs&quot; of Perricone products etc it's not quite as bad as you think - add in the benefits of feeling amazing and energetic then really you have to be ahead on this one."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"This book undoubtedly gathers a lot of information that is useful and beneficial toward health and good appearance. If I have any disagreeement about 5 stars, it's because some of the products Doc sells are IMHO overpriced. WAY overpriced. Take, as example, the Perricone Polysaccharide Peptide Blend (PEP), sold for a whopping $65 at Cosmetics (make-up) stores. While I think it's good that face paint stores are getting with it in the \\"beauty-from-the-inside\\" health market (you can only cover up so much), they are raping pocketbooks. Why? because the *active ingredient* in this PEP blend is none other than good ol' FLAX SEED oil (in powder form) otherwise purchasable from Health Food stores for $7.99. A little squirt of it in your morning shake, or a couple of capsules, Ladies (or Gents) gives you all 3 Omega Oils that rock, for $60 less than a bag of powder magically marketed with the froo-froo spin.

Perricone's diet is more focused on looking good (anti-aging) and moderately aggressive on supplementation with vitamins, minerals, amino acids, etc. I personally don't care a wit about the beauty and wrinkling stuff - I don't work in a glamour industry. What attracted me was losing weight, more energy and feeling good.It has worked wonderfully for me. I have eliminated sugar and coffee from my diet, I'm drinking a lot more water and I'm trying the supplementation regime and working agressively to lower the costs of it. I'm eating more fish and enjoying it but I must admit I'm blessed by living in Seattle with our access to so much high quality seafood. I'm fitting better into my clothes and now that I have more energy - I'm going to start working out.Perricone has led me to Barry Sears and to a great path to finding higher physical and mental functioning. I'll always be grateful to him for this alone."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"Ok...I really haven't gone insane. I saw this particular \\"diet\\" mentioned on a show I was watching about a month or so ago and the dietitian talked about how the \\"core\\" of the program is actually pretty solid but she thought, by and large the supplement and skin care regimen that he's created is \\"excessive\\" - I think she was one step away from saying it's just too much (money) to be spending and too much to be taking in terms of vitamins and other supplements. If you did everything Perricone said, you'd be taking about 20 vitamins and various other supplements and putting 4-7 lotions and topical creams on your person everyday, twice a day...and most of them are hundreds of dollars apiece if you're buying his brand (and still quite pricey of you \\"shop around\\" for the same thing from another manufacturer). You'd be spending several thousand dollars a month just on supplements and creams before you even got to the food part of this.Reading this and being able to be objective out it (i.e. I'm not looking for a quick fix, I'm looking for additional strategies to add to this whole healthy living adventure thing I've got going on) it's slap you in your face obvious how this guy makes his living because, according to him, everything can be made all better with these supplements and creams. My complaint with this is it's clearly for people who are making a LOT of money...he wants you to eat fish (specifically Alaskan salmon, but a few others are in there too) seven days a week and for more than one meal a day...according to him, that should be the staple of the diet with some chicken and turkey breast thrown in, but never beef. If everyone were to suddenly start eating like this, wouldn't that have a long term negative impact on the salmon population....for the amounts he's recommending, it seems like this diet will coast a lot of $$$ to stick to the letter of the plan. I think I've come away from it with some things I can defiantly work into my plan and it was interesting to read about health and well-being from a dermatologist perspective, but I'm guessing the people who can really embrace and benefit from this type of diet/lifestyle long term are the one's making loads and loads of money. I do give kudos that all the recipes are the embodiment of simplicity, even my 8 year old daughter could make everything listed in the recipe section...he seems to think under his plan you could eat this way for the rest of you life...I think you'd get sick of salmon after a while...no matter the health benefit, eating ONLY one food 95% of the time, in my opinion can be really hard to stick with long term (unless you're fanatical about salmon). Overall, interesting read from a dermatological perspective, but not something I think most people would be able or willing to do for a lifetime. I've come away from it with a few new ideas about supplements (small changes that I can make that won't cost me tons of $$$) and some new (for me) info on bad and good sugars and carbs.

After reading the book, decided to give the supplement program a try. I already eat very healthy (salmon fantatic for years) and excercise 6x a week with weights and cycling. So, the only realy modification was the supplement program. My plan was to try it for one month and if I didn't notice a difference, I would stop the program. Well, that was 7 months ago. Very quickly after I started the program, I noticed a huge uplift in energy levels and in the following months I noticed a major increase in sex drive.I am a male, 42 years old, good shape, and healthy.

After 5 minutes, I had grabbed a pen and was scribbling furiously. All of the skin, energy level and body issues he was describing were me! I ran out to the local supplement shop and bought some of the supplements he recommended and started taking them. I saw an almost immediate dramatic improvement in my skin, memory and energy levels just based upon a few notes on supplements from the program. I put the book on my wish list and FINALLY got it a year later.The book and diet is based upon the premise that by stripping inflammatory 'toxins' from the diet and by beefing up the body with oils and substances that help it create healthy chemicals for the brain, skin and body, your skin and body undergo a 'makeover'. Although the whole makeover bit is appealing to many, in my opinion, it's simply your body 'getting healthy'.The book is fantastic. If you're into having a healthier lifestyle and you want to know the ins and outs of why you should do certain things, this book is for you.The ONLY down side is that the diet isn't as 'accessible' to those who aren't fully dedicated or able to throw themselves behind a diet like this. It takes more prep time than an ordinary meal in a busy household and there are a variety of ingredients.That said, it isn't a reflection on the book. The book is well written with instructions and complete information on every topic it covers - including recipes. Even gleaning what I could reasonably use from this book has made a ton of difference in my life. I have a disorder that benefits from stripping inflammatory substances from my body and this diet did the trick.

The thing is, you've got to love seafood, especially salmon.

The concepts are well presented and easy to grasp. The book includes menus and recipes. My husband (6' 1\\") went from wieghing 209 to 194, and I went from 101 to 96 - perfect for my small 5' frame. (My blood pressure went from 187/95 to 120/80. My husband's dropped as well, but he was already in a normal range.)

Most of the book deals with the effect of diet and supplements on the body, and gives specific recommendations as to which foods and supplements have the greatest healthy and anti-aging benefits. As well, it also approaches the topic of aging in a very well balanced way. For instance, Perricone also stresses the important effects of exercise, sleep, skin care, and lifestyle choices on ones overall health and aging. The Three-Day Facelift outlines an easy three day meal plan to follow to reduce inflammation. The plan is uncomplicated to follow, and the foods he recommends are easy to prepare. I followed this for 3 days and felt energetic and my skin glowed. I repeat this program whenever I need a pick me up (or I want my skin to look great!). This advice in this book are definitely something that I have modified my lifestyle around becasue it is effective, sensible and something that I feel is beneficial to my overall health, in addition to my skin.

One late night I saw Perricone on PBS. I was definitely skeptical, but what he said made sense at least; it didn't come across as a mind-numbing infomercial. Inflammation, insulin reaction, antioxidants, importance of protein vis-a-vis carbs, it was a nice and clean model with enough detail and did not come across as a fad of the month. It was based on off-the-shelf products some of which I was already familiar with. And I was getting desperate physically, mentally, and emotionally and was getting burnt out at work.... I started small and incrementally took what he recommended.It all started with DHA, more water and no caffeine - Costco sells a product called Senior Moments which has that and \\"cerebral phospholipids\\". I felt so poorly that despite the fact that I was once a religious caffeinator, I went off caffeine almost cold turkey within a couple of weeks. The results were astounding and dramatic all within a few days of doing so (the caffeine started to give me an unwanted buzz as I took the supplement, which just got me off caffeine faster). I began to think very clearly again, memory and focus was incredible, and I was multitasking like never before. Plus mood and emotional stability returned ...Another star is alpha lapoic acid (ALA). Talk about skin rejuvenation. My girlfriend took it and within a few days her severe acne problem cleared up entirely without having to use ... expensive skin lotions, lathers, soaps to manage it. Now, she has ...natural products that work much better at 1/10th the cost. With that and a CoQ10 facial cleanser, my skin has turned out great as well.I take most of the supplements Perricone lists (which *is* a laborious process that takes 5 minutes in the morning and another 5 in the afternoon, but combination supplements like Calcium-Magnesium-Zinc and Centrum help a lot... I also eat a bulk of foods as proteins and save carbs for last. Now, I am super energetic, mental clarity (thought process, memory, plain ol' solid thinking) has been astounding, and physical fitness (endurance, strength) has been super-incredible. And, the more I work out and sleep, the better I feel.Plus, the mood swings have gone away, I feel no stress ... I credit most of that to GLA (gamma linoleic acid); the more I have taken, from initially 150mg a day from primrose oil, to now 600mg from borage oil, the more I have been rendered stress free - entirely gone are the back and chest pains, headaches, and emotional up-and-down rollercoaster ride throughout the day.... his book presents in a succinct and necessary way (though the segue between chapters is a little choppy so I could take a star off for that; it takes at least 2-3 reads to understand the big picture more fully) the why's and how's of good health and consequently great skin. You have to have patience to read through a rather dry topic that most people have been made to be rather skeptical of.In any event, I'd imagine the drug companies and fast food companies ...- wouldn't be all that happy if everyone discovered the basics again, and that's what the \\"prescription\\" is. It goes back to basics, and leverages supplements (most of which are already produced by our own bodies, albeit in limited amounts) and ol' fashion good eating habits to reinforce the machinery in our own bodies to work optimally. I make sure to eat proteins first, drink my tea and water too. If only the prescription could be simplified to a one-sentence tagline so more people would jump aboard like me. ... I strongly suggest for those of you with a lot of stress ...), with stress symptoms physical or otherwise, feel lethargic, overwhelmed and have been going through a brain-drain, to go out and get the book. If you're not the book reading type, see about making a pledge to your local PBS station and get the VHS tape. That's a more expensive option but well-worth it - help PBS and getting the info someway, somehow....There's actually a lot of pills, which are relatively cheap if you buy at vitamin shops ... and buy bulk quantity bottles. You also have to work out on a regular basis though workout quantity is not super important. ... Also, be aware the supplements work together and I would suggest an incremental approach. If you get into it, don't get into the fallacy of DHA is for smarts and GLA is for stress. They are, but in reality they overlap. ... There are \\"side-effects\\". You get thirsty more often from a higher metabolism rate (and you eat healtier, lose weight, and muscle builds up more quickly at the expense of fat). First few days of taking a particular supplement, like DHA or GLA, you can feel whoozy or sleepy. You might feel a bit of a \\"sensory overload\\" at first too, in particular with DHA and DMAE.

I tend to believe that this result was produced not only by the physiological regimen, but by a psychological effect. Most &quot;weight loss&quot; books place all their emphasis on the desired goal, i.e., weight loss. We try too hard and are at times discouraged when we don't achieve the desired results. With The Perricone Prescription, the focus is shifted to improving your skin, so the pressure to lose weight is not there. Not only has my skin improved, I've lost weight and have kept it off.Not only does this book deliver sound nutritional advice, it is effective on many levels. I have had a lifelong battle with weight and nothing has worked. This book was an epiphany for me because it details the science of how our bodies (skin included) react to foods and supplements. I must admit that the advice was easy for me to follow since I love fish, particularly salmon, and since I have a Mediterranean heritage, my diet has always included olives, olive oil, and seafood. Getting rid of the high glycemic foods, though, permitted me to turn the corner. NO ONE ever guesses my correct age...everyone thinks I'm at least 10 years younger than I am.I highly recommend this book...sound medical advice from a renowned dermatologist. How can you go wrong?"},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I saw Dr. Perricone on the Today Show and I tend to be a very skeptical person. However, I bought his book (since I just turned 41) ready to prevent wrinkling and perhaps shed a few pounds. After reading the book front to back, I not only FEEL fantastic, I've lost 8 pounds and my skin also looks great. I wasn't too impressed with the \\"before and after\\" photos in his book. But I'm thankful that I didn't let that persuade me out of buying it. It's all about balance and eating smart. I swim every morning for 30 - 40 min. and eat limited amounts of carbs. I now eat certain fruits which I never did before and many more vegetables. I also eat salmon once a day, use olive oil in my cooking, and only drink a half glass of wine a few times a week. I also gave up drinking coffe and replaced it with green tea. As we've all heard, another key is to drink lots of water throughout the day. I basically took every suggestion Dr. Perricone made and because of that decision, I feel and look so much better. I am now finding my size 6 too big and am ready to jump back into my size 4 clothes. I also bought his vitamin supplements, taking them twice a day. His daily suggestions for meals and snacks are easy to follow. His skincare products are also worth looking into although they're NOT cheap! You won't regret buying this book if you're ready to make a positive change in your life! You take away an understanding of how certain types of food react inside your body, which causes you to think twice before putting just any food in your mouth."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"Having read some unfavourable reviews of this book which is not yet available in Australia and having been on the diet for 10 days, I am so pleased with the results that I felt compelled to put pen to paper and give it a support vote.What interested me most about what Dr Perricone promised were the promises of body rejuvenation and, importantly for me, steady insulin levels resulting in more energy.After 2 days I was so surprised to have continuous energy all day. Like everyone, my job is demanding and full on for an average 10 hrs each day.Now after 10 days I have dropped 4 kg, my secretary asked me what have I been doing to my skin as it and my eyes looked brighter and the younger lawyers ( females) in my firm have decided to try the diet based on what they see has happened to me.Notwithstanding that I always loathed salmon and cantelope, I am fast changing my view.Having had two clashes with breast cancer in four years ( I won -touch wood !)steady insulin levels are very NB to me and people like me.Having read the papers of a Canadian oncologist linking steady insulin levels to longer survival rates, I obviously was motivated to find a diet that did just that. I have tried all the popular diets around and this is the first eating regime that is easy to live with and enjoy indefinitely which is critical for long term maintenance of any weight loss.Now, if in the process of being on it , it prevents me from looking like a Bassett Hound in 20 years time then that is a bonus.I would highly recommend this diet and the book and I am so very pleased it looked sufficiently interesting on the Amazoncom menu that I was persuaded to order it, especially given the scary rate of exchange of Australian dollars. The book is the most important purchase that I have made in recent times.Anyone who is run down, time poor, overweight and wanting to improve yourself should buy this book, get organised and try the diet. Just think, psychologists tell us that it takes but 21 days to change a habit, good or bad. So how hard is that.I am grateful to Dr. Perricone as his work has made a positive improvement to my life.Finally, for completeness I will confess to being a lawyer which makes me as cynical and sceptical as they come when grandiose claims are made. However, I am convinced."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"This is the first of Dr. Perricone's books I purchased.

If you buy one of his books, there's really no need to purchase any of the others, unless you plan to share them with friends & family."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I can't recommend this highly enough. I read the reviews around here and started the 3-day diet without even reading the book. It works! The morning after I started it, as in after the the very first day, my dark circles, which I thought were here to stay disappeared almost completely. I have been following recommendations but not religiously. I did give up caffiene. Once I gave it up for the 3-day diet, I just didn't work it back in. I have had no sugar, either. Those are the areas I don't stray from.For me, a busy mother of 3, I do not have the opportunity to follow the recipes in the book, so I have resorted to following its guidelines. It is great, has been about 2 weeks and I have dropped 7 pounds. As an aside, our grocery bills have dropped, too.The main thing is, after I eat, instead of feeling sleepy or full, I feel energized. On a busy day, I eat eggs for breakfast, canned tuna, bagged salad and berries. Oh, and I almost always \\"cheat\\" at night with large glops of natural peanut butter. My husband has definately not been faithful, but has been eating much of what I have and he has lost 6 pounds. Suprisingly, our son, a bona-fide junk-food junkie has been eating some of this with us. At 13, he's had some bad acne and his skin has cleared up dramatically.Now, I really don't like fish. So, I only eat it when it's broiled with just olive oil and topped with some fresh key-lime juice. Salmon has always been my least favorite. Yuck. Turns out the \\"wild\\" salmon does taste much better. I buy my fish at (egads!) Walmart. They have the frozen wild salmon for $4.94 a pound and talapia for $2.97 a pound, as well as orange roughy and more. Several times I bought fresh at our local Central Market and none of the fish I tried tasted better. The fresh salmon was not as good. I think it is because the stuff at Walmart is frozen immediately before transport.Another food note- Olive Oil has replaced butter and other stuff and adds much flavor to things. A great olive oil is essential. I'll recommend several here- Lucini is the BEST. I have found it in all of our local grocery stores, though it is expensive, but the flavor is so delicate and fruity, it is unbelievable. Goya is harder to find for me (Central Market is our only local store) but is much cheaper and has the same full fruity flavor, though it is not as delicate. Another alternative is oils made from Kalamata olives. Believe me, if your food is tasting bland, you are not eating the right kind of olive oil. And key-limes are another flavor-booster.As for the supplements, my approach, again, has been to simplify. I bought Oil of Olay for skin and hair and it has ALA and CQ-10, as well as most of his other recommended general multi-vitamins. I bought it at Walgreens, but saw it tonight at Walmart for about $12.00. I added some extra Vitamin C-ester, some fish oil combo (I got at Costco for $15.00 or so), some ALA and Acetly-LCarnitine, which I got at Walgreens 2 for the price of one. I do not follow his recommendations exactly- again, only what I can work in. Still, my nails are growing like crazy and my hair is super shiny and soft.Lastly, I checked out some of his other books at the library and I think it's in the Wrinkle Cure that he shows you the results of DMAE. I bought some and mixed it in my face cream. My skin feels so much softer and just seems really glowy.In summary, doing this was so easy and I feel so much beter now that I do not intend to leave this eating plan. I also do not mind the supplements and have simplified things down so that they work within my lifestyle. For example, I like to get outside. So, I started by walking each day- even for 20 minutes and am now running. Once I told myself to get out for the sake of my face, I just seemed to be more motivated than worrying about my waistline.Good luck if you read all this! I hope that I have not upset the apple-cart too much by laying out my approach. I suspect, though, that some might be discouraged or intimidated and I say DON'T BE! It works, you deserve it and you will look FABULOUS!!!!"},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"...which I happen to be. Most people aren't willing to change the way they eat and drink -- at least not for more than a few days.However, if you have something of the maniac about you, and are willing to swallow a couple of fistfuls of pills each day (and are good about keeping track of replacing them as you use them up, and shopping around to find the best buys because some of them, like tocotrienol, are wicked expensive) then you should give this Perricone method a whirl.I happen to love salmon (I almost capitalized it just now: What does THAT tell you?) -- left to my own devices (i.e., if I weren't married) I'd eat it 4 or 5 times a week for dinner. The hard part is remembering to drink enough water. No big deal, really, just another thing to remember to do.I saw a noticeable improvement in my skin after about a week. Is it the fish? (I indulge more often now -- doctor's orders, right?) Is it the water? The vitamins? Beats me.

You're taking protein, water, and lots of vitamins either way.Get this book in paperback, in case all this obsessing is more than you can take. (I'm giving the book 4 stars.

I started doing it but didn't really expect anything too dramatic and I'm lazy so I often don't follow it to the letter. I still drink a bit of coffee and sometimes skip breakfast, I use the creams (not all of them) and can't afford the supplements so I make do with some supplements and a few from the supermarket. I still have a weakness for little snacks which involve crackers and crisps too. However, this water, salmon, berries, melon thing and the creams have got something going for them. Recently a stranger said &quot;your skin is incredible&quot;. I caught sight of myself in a window and I was suprised at my high cheekbones and the way my skin looks stronger and plumper and yet more defined. My face looks quite different actually. Hmmm interesting. My body is changing in a similar way and while this is all early days yet and I'm yet to beat some of my lazy habits I intend to keep dropping more of those carbs out of my diet and powering up on all the good stuff. I'd really rather do this than have injections, face lifts and the like at some stage and prevention is better than cure. When I think about how much money I would spend in my younger days on alcohol, cigarettes (when I smoked) and junk food - not to mention all the fashion buys that didn't work out due to body size I think that if you deducted all that from the &quot;costs&quot; of Perricone products etc it's not quite as bad as you think - add in the benefits of feeling amazing and energetic then really you have to be ahead on this one."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I saw Dr. Perricone on PBS and was intrigued by his discussion of inflamation. Since I have ugly spider veins on my face, I figured I'd give the diet a try before I forked over thousands and thousands of dollars to some laser surgeon. In talking to my sister, she wanted to try the diet, too. My friend jumped on board, and we all began the diet on January 13 (just less than two months ago). Results? My sister, 42, has lost 38 lbs (87 to go), has never cheated on the diet, loves it, and has no trouble with prep time though she's a paralegal by day and a full-time law student by night. My friend, 35, has lost 26 lbs (34 to go), cheats weekly, drinks wine daily, and has developed a passion for salmon. I, 43, have lost 17 lbs (33 to go), cheated once, but have a lot of trouble eating as often and as much as Perricone dictates. I find that I stall when I reduce the food or skip snacks.Skin? Each of us has had a dramatic improvement in our skin. My sister's stubborn adult acne has disappeared, my friend's sallow complexion and dark circles have disappeared, and my beet-red face and road map of veins is diminishing.Though the book has discrepancies (he needed a much better proof reader - and I've taken a star off because of it), it managed to motivate me and mine and produced the promised results. That says a lot!"},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I saw Perricone's PBS special, and I noticed that he made many definitive statements, whereas the reality is that the &quot;science&quot; behind many of these claims is subject to interpretation. For example, when you cook salmon, you will oxidize the cholesterol in it, which may be the biggest cause of coronary heart disease. He talked of the dangers of free radicals, yet he did not mention that saturated fats do not generate free radicals, but that polyunsaturated fats (even if they are the &quot;essential&quot; omega 3s and 6s) are very bad in this context, and they oxidize the cholesterol that is in your body, even if you eat no cholesterol. I found physiological studies that support all these claims, and you can do your own search on pubmed on the internet. I've heard claims that coconut oil, very high in saturated fatty acids, is great for the skin, and this makes more sense because such fatty acids do not generate free radicals. Also, his claims about the glycemic index are not without controversy either - I saw him telling people about how bad carrots are because they are so high on this index. Even if he switched to the glycemic load as a measure, the science behind this is not definitive at this point. Raw fruit is very high in antioxidants, but can also be high on the glycemic index, for example. My point here is that his claims are disputed by other scientists, people who have done actual work in laboratories over the course of decades. See Mary Enig's book on fat, for example. Udo Erasmus makes some good points in his book on fat also. Perricone actually seems to be behind in the area of fat, because the polyunsaturated fats seem to be nothing but trouble if eaten in anything but very tiny amounts, though pregnant women may need a bit more DHA (an omega 3) than other adults, for example."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"Perricone is constantly regurgitating information in order to sell his books and overpriced skin care products. He is riding his fame like a wave that is going to crash soon. If you have the Wrinkle Cure then you don't need this book or his newest book, &quot;The Acne Prescription&quot; Most of the information in his books is nothing new or revolutionary. I knew about the supplements he mentions and topical agents long before he started writing books. He is not quite as revolutionary as he seems to think."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I started Dr. Perricone's program after viewing his presentation on PBS.

After 2 and a half months of just doing a few of the things mentioned in this book, I have dropped 10 pounds, my skin is practically oil-free, I no longer break out terribly the way I use to, my acne scaring is almost gone, my pores have shrunk, my face is more toned, smoother, and I have MUCH more color in my face than before (I was real pale and sick looking). I am never letting this book go.I make the suggested meals (in the book) once or twice a week. I don't eat fish (which the book really promotes), so I substitude it with chicken or turkey. No biggy. All the meals the Doctor mentiones are simple to make, even my 12 year old sister can make them. Nothing exotic or strange. Like I said before, you don't have to eat the meals all the time.You really begin to notice a difference after a week and a half.Though, you have to remember: This takes EFFORT on YOUR part. Don't be lazy. Reading the book will not make you healthier or give you better skin; actually DOING WHAT IS RECOMMENDED in the book is what will get you to your goal.It's an easy read (unless you're a part of the large number of adults that read at a fourth grade level).I recommend it for to anyone that wants to improve their looks and health. This book should get a 10 star rating.**********"},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I listened to the audio book, and I must say the program works! I am a health and fitness nut, into weightlifting, running, kickboxing, etc, etc, and I have been for years. Due to this lifestyle, I have researched and followed good dietary guidelines for approx 8 yrs, and specifically, the Glycemic Index, as well as having been a regular olive oil user. I am 35 yrs old, and I am INVARIABLY mistaken for being 5-10 yrs younger than I am! This book will help me to make a few more adjustments to fine tune things. ONE PIECE OF ADVICE: Please, do not try to switch to this diet in a few days, or even a few months. If you do, you will simply experience too much pain, and you will forfeit the benefits of an amazing way to live. Make a plan, and slowly, gradually add the Perricone-recommended foods, supplements, and behaviors to your life. Quite simply, learn to make better choices more often.

Most glaringly, the 28-day program calls for a bedtime vitamin supplement which is *never specified* -- at least not where the morning and lunchtime doses are listed!This author's last book was a bestseller.

I was just perusing the library on an unrelated matter (college subject) and came across it and started to read the beginning chapter. I checked the book out and thought I'd try it out. I even bought the recommended VitalChoice seafood package that came with salmon, halibut and berries in it. I didnt notice any stark changes in external appearance but what I did notice was a stark change in my anxiety levels. They went significantly down. I tend to be stress and anxiety prone and the two week diet helped alot. I was also sleepy by 8p.m. which is rare for me and didnt even need loads of tryptophan to get sleepy! However, unless you like eating fish and cantaloupe together first thing in the morning this probably isnt the best for you as it wasnt for me.

I don't have the worst skin nor the best skin. It's too oily but breaks outs are very rare except on my back which happens more often than I prefer. My complexion is not even and line are starting to develop. So far, I've been on the program for a week and my skin is less oily and lines are slightly less visible.

Unfortunately there is also some good useful information in the book so the uninformed reader will have a difficult time separating the wheat from the chafe. But please realize that sugar containing foods do not cause a cellular inflammation throughout the body. Also the supplementation appears to be oriented towards doing no harm. That is good but much of it will not help either. Unfortunately this book appears to appeal to the desperate who are looking for the magic bullet any magic bullet other than good nutrition. Also, almost any book or doctor or health conscious person can tell you that drinking a large volume of water every day will do wonders for your complexion and skin.

I am a healthy, athletic 42 year-old who tries to eat a reasonably well-rounded, healthy diet. I decided to try the three-day diet along with using most of the recommended supplements for the three days. The first day, I was absolutely starving by mid-afternoon and wishing that the planned dinner included some whole grains, or something carbo-oriented. By the second day, by mid-afternoon I had lost my appetite, except for a craving for dairy products. After I ate the prescribed dinner on the second day, I lost my appetite completely. Shortly afterwards, I threw up a couple times! Blech!!! Needless to say, I am looking a little rough this morning and am very happily munching on a blueberry muffin. Nothing has ever tasted this good! No glow to my skin although I did loose 5 pounds of water wieght. To be fair, I suppose I could have eaten bad fish, cantalope, etc., but I suspect not, because I think I would have had trouble all night long were that the case.

If he could cure and repair wrinkles with dietary supplements, creams and lotions, his products would be classified as drugs and would have to be approved by the FDA. They are not.Freedom of speach certainly produces its share of crackpots."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I read a dog book in the 70s that stated, \\"good coats are bred for, fed for, and cared for\\". Good skin in humans is much the same. Heredity plays an important part, but it's too late to fix that now. The shelves of our bathroom cabinets are laden with products to help us care for our skin (many of which are crap, but that's another book and review). The purpose of the Perricone Prescription is to provide a diet and lifestyle plan that will give you beautiful skin. Only a credulous person would take all the recommendations as gospel. The true believer would not only be exercising regularly and drinking eight glasses of water a day, but also taking hundreds of dollars in supplements each month, using the good doctor's extremely expensive moisturizers, and eating salmon at least seven times a week.There's \\"clinical evidence\\" in the form of lots of pairs of before and after pictures of women who have followed this diet. You be the judge, but without guidance in many cases I wouldn't have seen the improvements or even confused the \\"before\\" with the \\"after\\". Unless you are coming from a diet of celery sticks and a granola bar three times a day, this program won't be a quick fix.The supplement program seems over the top, and a thinking person wouldn't start a bunch of supplements without researching them elsewhere first. The skin care products sold by him deserve a skeptical eye, and the drugstore/department store recommendations are too vague or out of date.Having said that, The Perricone Prescription has some merit. The diet plans I've followed (along the Weight Watchers model) always asserted that \\"Americans eat too much protein\\". Perricone contends that many of the models and actresses he sees are malnourished. I added up the grams of protein I typically eat and it does fall short of the US recommended daily allowance of 55 grams and Perricone's minimum of 65 grams. I may not be thin, but I could feed myself better. It seems like everywhere you turn, the benefits of eating healthy, drinking water, and regular exercise have another benefit. Eating more wild fish, less red meat, more vegetables: these are all good things.

He's just the dermotologist I need for total face rejuvenation, as I am facing having a deep 'pre-cancer' caused by the sun to be cut out in a couple of weeks which will leave a scar, which could only be covered with plastic surgery. Being little and slim, the body isn't such a problem for me yet, and I do look a lot like Jessica Tandy in 'Fried Green Tomatoes' though she was 82 and I am not even near that age. So, this book is for me!\\"Most peole believe that sags, bags, and wrinkles are inevitable on the face and the body.\\" If yo follow this Perricone Prescription with his exercise, diet and skin care program, you can prevent and reverse many signs of aging. That way, you won't need the Botox injections, chemical peels, or laser treatments. I do need that on my birthmark, but hey! I've lived with it this long, what should it matter now? The skin doc who kept my 'pre-cancer' raw for two years with liquid nitrogen and his biopsies told me the only way to get rid of it was to use a plastic surgeon, knowing that no way on earth could I afford one. He even had the audacity to tell me that the liquid nitrogen would get rid of my wrinkles! After leaving a scar and rawness where they put it, I told him in no uncertain terms that the wrinkles don't bother me. I am tired of his making my face look ugly. Thus, I found a dermotologist who will remove the irritating thing once and for all.Dr. Perricone reveals that inflammation is caused by poor nutrition, irritating skin-care treatments, stress, sunlight, and pollution -- all of which I have endured these six years I've been back in Knoxville. Next to L.A., this town at the foot of the Great Smoky Mountains if the most polluted in the United States of America.He gives the reader the tools to fight the inflammation \\"from the inside out\\" while at the same time decreasing the likelihood of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and other degenerative diseases. This program will benefit your entire body and change your life for the better! You'll not only look a bit younger, you will feel younger, too, and won't be afraid to look in the mirror. There are amazing before and after photos included to spur you on and give you the incentive to be the best-looking person around.He has written THE WRINKLE CURE. That's good, but a part of aging which we all have to endure, so what's a few wrinkles in a happy face.

I'm still not sure about carrots, but Dr. Nicholas Perricone's THE PERRICONE PRESCRIPTION is convincing for just about everything else the good doctor talks about, like why he says to drink lots of water, avoid fruit juice, milk, butter, margarine, Corn Flakes, Rice Crispies, and Rice Chex, eat celery, spinach, and yogurt, and to get plenty of olive oil!And unlike most health books, THE PERRICONE PRESCRIPTION's got lots of pictures of people who've tried his program, terrific before-and-after photos of a rogues gallery of people who needed help, and knew where to go to get results!THE PERRICONE PRESCRIPTION IS JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED!!!Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING"},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"So I just had to put my 2 cents in. I borrowed this book from the library and wished I actually owned it. I find myself needing to refer back to it often so thats why I need a copy for myself.Before reading this book, I had chosen to eat salmon and brown rice everyday for lunch and dinner, which was recommended by a manager at a holistic spa I was working at. I just got done with the master cleanse, well I only did it for 2 days, but my manager said that you need to eat clean to detox so salmon and brown rice it was. I had really bad acne at the time, I still do actually because of the choices I make at the moment. I have to tell you I was on that diet for about 2 months. My skin was literally amazing. My acne was fading and my skin actually looked like real skin- pretty skin. Of course fast forward to now and I am in a relationship and live with my bf so I cook for him and we both like to drink beer and have our margaritas and chips and salsa BUT I am slowly trying to get back into the swing of things. I then borrowed this book from the library and tried to follow it best I could. I know that anything I eat directly affects my skin, but looking back to when I ate the salmon and brown rice, I have to credit that, because thats what made my skin so awesome.This diet/concept can work and yes it can seem expensive but its the concept you really need to grasp. Basically, eat protein, a slow digesting carbohydrate and a healthy fat at every meal.Heres a good example:tuna-protein (also has omega 3's)avocado-fat (has omega 6)dark leafy salad-slow digesting carbI usually switch it up all the time so I get a variety going, I do not have the willpower it takes to really go hardcore but it helps. For protein: salmon, tuna, sardines, oysters, shrimp, chicken, boca burger, turkey lunch meat, egg whites (hormel natural kind) for fats: almonds, cashews, flaxseed, macadamia nuts, avocado, olive oil. For carbs: brown rice, millet, quinoa, whole grain bread, whole grain pasta, spinach, eggplant, zuchinni, brocolli, spinach, asparagus, cantolupe, peaches, apples, plums, berries, tomatoes. I also throw in yogurt, kefir and cottage cheese, probiotics are really good for you and cottage cheese has protein in it. Occasionally I eat dark chocolate and although I quit drinking red wine (200 calories per glass!) those two things can be beneficial because for the antioxidant content.The supplements can be expensive, I did the Murad firm and tone supplement for a while, and it was a whopping $140 for 28 days. I couldn't see myself spending all that, Perricone's supplements are pricey as well so now I do this:Carlson Norwegian Formula Cod Liver Oil lemon flavor (omega 3's, Vitamin A & D)B-vitamin Complex-GNCEmergen C packet 1 daily (Vitamin C)Source Naturals Alpha Lipoic AcidSource Naturals Vitamin C EsterNew Chapter TurmericI really want to add DMAE and have been considering it, but I am sure you can find a good brand for a lot less on vitacost dot com.As for the skincare. No need to spend a ton of $$$. Source Naturals, Reviva, Derma E, and Nutribiotic are all brands that have alpha lipoic acid, DMAE and Vit C in their skin products. My personal favorite is Source Naturals, their serum is really good and I really like their moisturizer, if you happen to find it on vitacost, get the one that says kiwi scented. The Derma E brand stinks beyond all recognition but a lot of reviewers like it.Overall great book, great concept, now if I only had the willpower to match, I would be completley successful."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I don't doubt that eating alot of protein, mostly in the form of fish, is beneficial. But when add to that an astounding amount of vitamin supplements, skincare products, and electrical muscle stimulating devices as part of the regime, I'd have to win the lottery to be able to afford this diet! For me, anyway, it's just not practical."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I've just finished reading through a few of Dr. Perricone's books. I was very excited to read this, because it backs up much of what I've learned recently about skin care. The use of Alpha Lipoic acid, alpha hydroxy acids, Coenzyme Q10, flaxseed oil, and vitamins A, C, and E ARE essential for good skin health, and good health overall. His diet suggestions are great and straight forward too. But if you go to his website, his lotions and supplements are WAY overpriced. There is a great alternative in Arbonne.

Instead, he provides only testimonials, exaggerated claims, partial truths, and incorrect statements. He cherry-picks possibly supportive studies from the literature and ignores contradictory studies. He cites lots of lab studies (in vitro or in animals), but few that demonstrate any clinical effects in humans. The diet he recommends is low in calories, and weight loss alone may improve the way his patients look and feel. His advice about tobacco and sunscreens is appropriate, but there is little science behind the rest of his program. He seems to have gathered every nutrient and skin cream he had any reason to hypothesize might work and advised using all of them [and sells them for an exorbitant amount of money to the exclusion of anyone else's]. A more rational approach would have been to first see which ones really worked, and later to see if any combinations of the effective agents worked better than a single agent.\\""},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I don't have a problem with the diet; as far as it goes; it probably won't hurt you. But anyone who thinks this man's work has a basis in research should definitely read the Feb 5 2005 NY Times Magazine article entitled \\"Perriconology\\". You can search for it at www.nytimes.com.Here is an interesting excerpt:\\"It in fact seemed impossible to find any doctor, dermatologist or otherwise, in four different cities, to go on the record when talking about Perricone, pro or con. That he used his medical credentials to sell his diet and products while skipping the peer-review process, seemed, in that world at least, a significant breach. An academic hematologist who has done research for almost 30 years said: 'There is a Pygmalion complex in research where you fall in love with your own work. But the gold standard is, are there objective observers who can verify it? What is the data to support that diet switches off or retards inflammation? Where is the controlled, randomized, independent-observer study? Or is this anecdotal?'\\""},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"THIS DIET WORKS! I have had slightly acne prone skin (with persistent scarring) for about five years. I had heard about the Perricone Diet, but blew it off because I hated salmon. After aquiring the taste for seafood and enduring a few more years of horrid skin that made me cry every morning, I woke up one morning and immediately remembered the diet I had heard about years before. I went straight to the bookstore and bought both the Clear Skin Prescription and The Perricone Prescription. I followed it to the \\"T\\" and within a few days I was able to put all my makeup away! It really does give you the J-Lo glow. Your skin looks alive and fresh and glowing. The first few days of the diet are a bit rough, I found my self just forcing the bland oatmeal and broiled salmon down-but it is worth it. I also used all the products from the Periconne Outpatient Therapy Line (cleanser, toner pads, acne cream, lotion, and concealer) from the beginning and swear by those products. I also used the Nutritive Resoration Cream from his main line and have loved that. It's a little treat each night. The products are expensive, but they realy last (The toner pads are the only product that is harder to stretch out. Once my skin cleared, I started cutting the toner pads in half to make them last even longer). If you are not too bothered by the smells (the products have no added perfumes and the toner pads have a slight \\"fishy\\" smell that dissipates or is neutralized once you apply the lotion), the price is totally worth it. The products are high-quality and soothing."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"The problem with this diet is that Dr. Perricone recommends you eat only wild salmon. I had to ask myself right away what's wrong with eating farmed salmon and why won't Dr. Perricone recommend eating it as an alternative? With all the wild salmon you're supposed to eat, this diet gets very cost prohibitive very fast.If consumers knew what was in farmed salmon they might think twice about eating it more than once a month. Recent studies show that farmed salmon bought at markets on the East and West coasts were found to be contaminated with PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, at an average level far higher than any other protein source, including other seafood. PCBs are insidious and have been identified as probable human carcinogens.This diet works as long as you can afford to eat wild salmon numerous times a week. The consumer friendly alternative is the L.A. Shape Diet - it even recommends some of the same supplements. I have had great results by combining the L.A. shape diet with Perricone's recommended supplements and lotions. Just get smart and find the discount versions of Perricone's brands to get the benefit of great skin without dropping a lot of cash."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"Dr. Perricone wants you to believe his theory that skin aging and wrinkles are caused by inflamation; and inflamation is mostly caused by a lack of protein in your diet. This bogus theory is good news if you own a meat market. Despite his overreaching efforts to categorize this theory as scientific, he fails to mention that no respected scientists agree with him. His only original \\"study\\" of the subject consisted of a few dozen of his coworkers. Many of the \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" pictures he offers are puzzling because you can't tell which is before and which is after! Human vanity is forever hopeful: promise the \\"fountain of youth\\" and someone will buy whatever you are selling.Even though his theory is bad, many people would still see substantial health benefits if they followed his diet and exercise program. He advocates regular exercise. The exercises illustrated are simple and suitable for most beginners. His diet plan proscribes against eating many unhealthful foods including: red meat (except Canadian bacon?), dairy (except yogurt?), coffee, fried foods, and processed grains such as white flour breads, pasta, crackers, pastries, and desserts. Anyone who stops eating those foods is bound to feel better. The foods he recommends to eat are fish, water, legumes, and specified fruits and vegetables. As a vegetarian, I don't agree with his recommendation for fish or for disallowing whole grains. Also, the fruits and vegetables which he includes and excludes seems a little silly, but I won't quibble with him. The conventional diet most people eat contains too much of the foods Perricone prohibits. His diet and exercise program should promote weight loss and better health for those people. Will it cure your skin wrinkles as he says? Don't bet on it.There is more to his program beyond diet and exercise. He has a long list of food supplements and topical creams and potions he recommends. Incidentally, he also just happens to run a company that sells all of the recommended supplements and potions. How convenient! But the supplements are generally available over-the-counter anyway, and at substantially lower prices than he charges.The book title says it is a 28 day program. What happens after 28 days? You must figure that out for yourself. Astoundingly, Perricone never discusses it.Forget the supplements and potions. Forget his theory about skin aging. If you are not doing it now, just follow his diet and exercise program for 28 days. You won't lose any wrinkles, but you'll likely feel better and weigh less."},{"Title":"The Perricone Prescription: A Physician's 28-Day Program for Total Body and Face Rejuvenation","review":"I'd have given it five stars were it not for the discrepancies. He advises avoiding toner yet he sells toner (&quot;splash&quot;) in his product line. What? Don't use it unless he's selling it? Also, throughout the book Dr. P. tells us to totally shun coffee. Then, in his shopping list, he includes low fat milk &quot;for coffee&quot;. The coffee we're NOT drinking anymore? And in the product list(s), the electric upper lip stimulator he extols is listed as being available from Clinical Creations (his company). What isn't included is the caveat that this device is still going through the rigors of USDA investigation and won't be available for another year AT THE VERY LEAST. There's an ambiguous chapter about 'the patient teaching the doctor' that I never quite got. It never states exactly what it was that she taught him. Other than these contradictions/discrepancies, it's a great book. The salmon really works, by the way. I've read both of his books and this one is the better of the two.

(...) I have lost 45 pounds as of March 28, 2003. I have over 80 to go, but this has been an easy program to stick with. (...), I find my expenses (which I track in Quicken) have not changed from my old way of eating. I dine out at places where salmon is available (Carabbas being my favorite), order things prepared how I need them and have not felt deprived once. (I have been on Weight Watcher's, Jenny Craig, Nutrisystems, Nu-Day, Richard Simmons, Tops, Overeaters Anon., and many many more over the years.I work 50 hours a week, go to law school at night and was a Starbucks coffee-head. Now I drink variety of teas, prepare ahead for two or three days at a time and pack an entire days rations with me to work and school. (By the way, it is not the schedule causing the weight loss, as I had a full semester without Perricone and was on the gain). I fit exercise in where I can, mostly in my chair at work doing ab exersises at my desk. I have not eaten one thing that is not allowed and find if I am diligent, I do not suffer any cravings. Though I buy his vitamins right now, I will purchase my vitamins seperate after the weight loss is accomplished. My 72 year old neighbor has lost two sizes in three weeks and loves it as well. The book is a very good tool that provides you with a variety of foods and, though it may seem contradictory, understands that some will not be able to change all of their habits at once and thereby provides additional information with regard to coffee.I don't use much of the skin program, though I use a cleanser (not his), and I put on night cream. I have far less trouble with blemishes...as a matter of fact it is rare now to get one whereas I used to have two or three going at all times. Some pretty bad.This is not an overnight cure, it is a lifestyle change. Don't expect that you can lose weight and then go back to your old habits and keep it off. I have, in two months, integrated this into a habit and do not see myself adding much back in at the end. Lastly, the weight loss and exercises are helping prevent what looked to be certain back surgery, quite a motivation to stick it out!UPDATE: It is July 28, 2003 and I continue to lose... have lost 90 pounds, feel great and continue to follow the rules!UPDATE: As of October I have lost 108 and leveled out and maintained.

Could this be true? There had to be a catch and I was going to find it, or so I thought.Dr Perricone reveals his theory that aging is caused by inflammation at the cellular level and is speeded along with our life styles, such as poor nutrition, pollution and stress, to name a few.He explains how we can change our dietary habits, take in the proper vitamins, exercisecorrectly and totally rejuvenate our body.This was worth reading.He shares with you case studies, shows you before and after pictures, gives you names of vitamins and tells you what they are good for and what the symptoms are if you are lacking these. He even shows you how to exercise properly, all bringing you to a new and healthier body. Very good!The only problem I had with the entire regiment was the diet. I do not like fish, cannot eat it, and that is one of the mainstaples in his food chain.

However, there were some typos, which I will blame on the Editor. I give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"Well, I finally received an advance copy of this book. It was not worth the wait. I saw the movie first (by the same title) and the movie was worth the matinee admission price, but not the evening admission price. Both the book and screenplay are by the same author -- Paul Crouch. Correction to my previous review. The actor playing Alexander Stone is not played by Simon Ward, but by another fine British actor. I do not recall his name, but he is quite famous. While the book was more exciting than the screenplay, both suffered from the same theological errors (In My Humble Opinion). 1. The Rapture of the Saints does not occur before the seven year tribulation period. It hadn't occured by the end of the book at the 3.5 year mark. In fact, the Rapture is not mentioned anywhere in book or screenplay. 2. The book makes a snide remark about the Mormon faith (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) on page 222. The hero of the book, Lane, says: &quot;God told me to search the hills for a cave that had hidden golden tablets to show me the way.&quot; Cassandra: &quot;Did you find it?&quot; Lane: &quot;No, it'd just be my luck that if I did, He wouldn't give me the special glasses to read them so I could understand it.&quot; While I do not share in the Mormon faith/denomination/cult, I see no reason to alienate this group of believers. The members may be misguided, but they still profess a belief in Jesus Christ. 3. In this book, the spirit of the Anti-Christ does not enter into Alexander Stone until he is wounded in the head, dies, and then is resurrected. 4. As a Computer Science professional, I have a hard time believing that the Bible contains a three dimensional holographic computer program. 5. My biggest complaint is non-logical statement on page 180. The non-Christian hero of the book (Lane) says: &quot;Alexander then found his name encoded all throughout the Code's prophecies. When he did what the prophecies said, they came true ... one after another.&quot; This is the usual time paradox of causal events, but handled very poorly. Mark Twain did a much better job in his explanation of &quot;The Boss's&quot; arrival in King Arthur's Court from the future. Twain's &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; has a better written description of that causal time paradox. Final comment: I would buy this book in paperback, but not in hardback. The normally higher hardback price is not worth its contents."},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"I received the book Omega Code on Jan.24,2000 and I could not put it down and I finished it the same day. I have never done that before. The book kept you on the edge of your seat. Would like to read more by Crouch. Keep books like this on your site and I'm a steady customer. THANK YOU SO MUCH."},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"A friend of my mom gave her this book a few weeks ago. I found it yesterday while walking through the house waiting until time to leave to go to work. I picked it up and started reading. When it was time to go to work I didn't want to put it down, so I carried it with me. I work in a hospital in radiology and as is turned out we weren't too busy last night so I finished it all before returning home. I would recommend it to every one. Paul Crouch does a surperb job of taking the writings in Revelation, and elsewhere in the Bible that deal with the end times, mixing it with topics &quot;ripped&quot; from the headlines and ending up with a book that is not only exciting to read but really gets you thinking. I would like to see Dr. Crouch write more Christian Fiction books along this line."},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"Paul Crouch's novelization of the sleeper hit film \\"The Omega Code\\" has many of the movie's strengths and weaknesses. The inherent grandeur and urgency of the plot--the rise of Antichrist in the Earth's last days--coupled with the author's evident empathy for his subject imbues this book with enough power to both entertain and inspire the Evangelical Christians from whose viewpoint the book emerges. The characters are interesting and highly believable, and the storyline, for all its exhuberance, does bear the ring of truth. Unfortunately, Mr. Crouch has not mastered the high art of fiction, and his prose frequently rings badly off key. A careful editing would have helped. Even so, the somewhat spartan style is admittedly much more satisfying than the often overblown writing of more \\"accomplished\\" authors. Another drawback is that the philosophy behind the story is not fully explained within the book itself, so readers from non-Evangelical backgrounds, and especially non-Christians, may have trouble understanding what's going on. But all-in-all, thanks to the author's intense conviction and the raw power of Revelation itself, \\"The Omega Code\\" works not only as novel, but as morality tale as well."},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"I really loved this book and read it in one sitting. If you have seen the movie then you'll love this book. It is fast paced and even if your not Christian like me it's a read anyway.Dr.Crouch makes you visualize what is going on and it is also action packed. A must read in my opinion!"},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"I loved this book. It is a tale that soon we will be living. Perhaps not exactly as it is portrayed by the writing, but the basic idea will be in full bloom.The book is good against evil, the rise of theAnti-Christ, coming to rule the world in all hisungodly fame and glory. The code has been found in the Bible, a code that can be used for good or for evil, the race is on.I believe that Christians will enjoy this read and it might just get a few non-believers to dig a little bit in the Word of God to see what is about to take place in this old world of ours.Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"This is a real attention getter. I could not put this book down. Paul Crouch did a great job. A lot of action drama and confusion. People you expected to be good were bad and the bad were good. Or for the most part some of them were. Action after Action after action. I would give it a five but the ending was a little [bad]. Other than that the story was awesome. I've read it twice already."},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"Having read this book, one question remain: Why did I buy it? I expected a sound novel in terms of writing skill and content but found a book with poorly rendered, or rather shallow, characters, and a story that at best could be described as pre-teen in it's intellectual challenge. As a work of fiction, this book doesn't measure up.However, there may be more to a &quot;prophetic&quot; novel than just the story. Still, the plot deviates from biblical prophecy in various ways, thus indicating that the book ought to be labeled just &quot;science fiction&quot; - not &quot;prophetic fiction&quot;. And as science fiction there may be an ocean of titles preferable to this.Looking for biblical suspense? Go for the Left Behind series, and forget this one. You would get both the story and a biblically based plot."},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"This would be a great story in the hands of an accomplished writer. I'm sure Mr. Crouch is a wonderful person but his literary skills are lacking. I much preferred the Left Behind series."},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"I saw the story in the theater, and was tempted to kill the projectionist. I had to remind myself it wasn't his fault. He was only acting under orders. Actually, the film was so dumb it was funny. I found myself almost laughing at the scary parts, and that's why it's destined to join the ranks of other rank films like Ed Woods' PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE. If it were an animal, however, I'd have to give it a mercy killing. And the book, as I understand, runs pretty close to the film.Besides providing proof that Christian filmmaking has arrived nowhere after more than twenty years, it also revealed the silliness of Hal Lindsey's ideas for the end of the world. Once you see them &quot;fleshed out&quot; on the big screen, the one thing that becomes clear is what a trite end for the world is envisioned by this whole concept. I suggest reading End-Time Prophecies of the Bible, if you want a dramatic look at biblical prophecies for the end of time."},{"Title":"The Omega Code: Another Has Risen from the Dead","review":"This book is pretty asome. It is great because Paul did a good job taking Revelations and taking what it had and apllying it to life today. And the charicters can be some what related to alot of people."},{"Title":"The Mothers the Matriarchal Theory of Social Origins","review":"Robert Stephen Briffault (pronounced \\"Bree-foh\\"; 1876-1948) was a social anthropologist and later a novelist; readers of this volume might also be interested inMarriage-Past and Present. He wrote in the Preface of this 1931 book, \\"In response for the demand for an edition of my work,THE MOTHERS: A STUDY OF THE ORIGINS OF SENTIMENTS AND INSTITUTIONS VOLUME I 1952 (Volume One (I))in one volume it was originally contemplated to issue an abridgement of the book... [but] so many portions of it would, however, have had to be sacrificed, that I have deemed it preferable to confine myself to the discussion of the main thesis which chiefly attracted attention in the original work... Although its material is for the most part extracted from [the earlier work], I have felt free to treat it as an independent work.\\" [NOTE: Page numbers below refer to the 319-page 1931 Macmillan edition.]He observes, \\"Whatever view we may take of the respective intellectual capacities of men and women under modern conditions, they are quite inapplicable to animals, and also to primitive humanity. Masculine intellectual superiority, assuming the extremest view of its nature, has reference to mental spheres which are products... of social evolution. In primitive conditions that superiority has no application.\\" (Ch. I, pg. 21) He notes that among animal groups \\"The male, instead of being the head and supporter of the group, is not an essential member of it, and more often than not is altogether absent from it... When he attaches himself to the female's family his association with it is loose and precarious. He has no functional place in it. The parental relation is confined to that between mother and brood. Paternity does not exist... The mother is the sole centre and bond of it...\\" (Ch. I, pg. 23)He states, \\"The matriarchal theory ... is a theory of social origins. It is not... an hypothesis concerning a form of society existing at some undetermined period of the past in which women, instead of men, ruled... If human society did not develop out of a group in which the male was the dominant member... there is no alternative except ... the matriarchal theory of social origins.\\" (Ch. IV, pg. 100) He suggests, \\"The patrilocal form of marriage thus depends upon a transaction superimposed on the original arrangement whereby a man went to live with his wife's people. If that be so... there is no alternative but to conclude that the practice of matrilocal marriage was the original form of marriage union, and is coeval with the origin of humanity.\\" (Ch. IV, pg. 137-138)Interestingly, he says that the term 'Matriarchy' \\"suggests therefore that ... the women exercise a domination over the men... The speculations of Bachofen [seeMyth, Religion, and Mother Right] encouraged that misconception... in which the respective parts of the sexes were reversed as in a topsy-turvy world... In point of fact there is nothing in the lower phases of culture corresponding to the domination of one sex over the other which characterizes patriarchal societies.\\" (Ch. VII, pg. 179-180) Later, he adds, \\"no great difficulty is found in showing that a matriarchal constitution of society cannot be inferred from the practice of matrilineal reckoning of descent.\\" (Ch. VII, pg. 186)He argues, \\"The patriarchal theory of social origins relied in the tradition of Christian countries upon the pictures of patriarchal pastoralists in the Bible. Yet even the traditions of that typically patriarchal organisation supply indications so definite of its evolution from different conditions ... marriage was with them matrilocal, as is fully illustrated by the Biblical account of the marriage of Jacob... [and] the Song of Deborah, represents the Hebrew tribes under the command of a female 'judge' [Judges 4].\\" (Pg. 274)He says, \\"Fatherhood, in the lower stages of human society does not found a family; motherhood alone does.\\" (Ch. VIII, pg. 226) He concludes, \\"Patriarchal marriage, the patriarchal family, and patriarchal morality are features of our social organization ... [that are] relatively late products of that social evolution.\\" (Ch. XII, pg. 310)Briffault's work was a huge influence upon the women's movement of the 1960s and later, and his provocative ideas retain their fascination even today."},{"Title":"Chronicles of Thanatos the Reaper","review":"I have to say that reading is not really my thing, however this book opend me up to the world of reading.

It is simply a boring rehash of Old Testament stories. The book has no form or flow. The book simply jumps from story to story. It reads like the author thumbed through his family bible and picked various stories and slightly added to them. Not a book I would recommend to someone else. This writer did not even bother to create his own story line. A better book to read would be 'On a Pale Horse' by Piers Anthony. Much more highly recommended."},{"Title":"Chronicles of Thanatos the Reaper","review":"I received this book as a gift and am so thankful for it. Not only was it an easy read but each chapter was a story in itself. I noted that this is the first of a series. I can't wait for the next. Highly Recomended!"},{"Title":"Chronicles of Thanatos the Reaper","review":"For someone who doesn't have much time to read, but loves to do so, this book was a gem of a find. With its short chapters, it was easy to read one or two at a sitting and not feel that you'd be lost if you had to stop before the end of a chapter. Each chapter captivates you in a different way from all the others. Some, the action of the event moves the reader forward, wherein others, the introspective nature of the Angel of Death moves a mere human to sypathy and compassion.This book is wonderful in that the plot and action and descriptiveness of words does not leave you bogged down in philosophy, and yet it challenges the reader more than mere fiction. It made me think of my own mortality and my \\"real\\" view of death, not simply what I say I believe.With such a unique view of history, mankind, and celestial beings, this book is well worth the read. I almost wish there was more - I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Chronicles of Thanatos the Reaper","review":"Coming from someone who loves to read, but seems never to find the time to sit and digest 30-50 pages per chapter, this book was a gem to pick up. With short chapters that captivate the reader with the personality of the man (well, angel) who is Death, it was easy to read one chapter or two a day, and not get lost or have to reread. Of course, that doesn't mean that I WANTED to put the book down.Each chapter delves into the way that mankind, individually or as a global whole, views death and their reaction when they each come face to face with it (him). Questions popped into my mind as I read; questions about my own views with death and how they differ to what I proclaim as my belief or religion. It was a revelatory experience.Thanatos, himself, is an interesting character, differing from the view typically displayed of an angel, in that he sometimes wishes that he could take action, but keeps himself in check under the will of his God. And I asked myself, \\"Am I willing to do that?\\"Even if you aren't into self-discovery, this book is entertaining and energetic. The short chapters keep the action at the forefront; it keeps the reader moving through history. The words are active and varied, but not to show-off the author's large vocabulary at the reader's expense (as I have seen in other books). In fact, my 2 high school aged sons thoroughly enjoyed it.Reading it through again -- Morgan"},{"Title":"Chronicles of Thanatos the Reaper","review":"This book is one of the best in awile.

It starts out assuming you are very good at addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. They give you problems like 6 - (4 + 2) + 8 4 before they even discuss any of the operations used. Look in the table of contents and you won't even find a section on addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Its all covered very minimaly in one section on whole numbers.

The first test in the book tests what you already know overall before studying the information inside, and then each answer is listed in an index next to a label of what sort of problem it is, allowing the reader to pinpoint areas where help is needed.

I did not care for the fairy tale story as it explains each reason for an Algebraic equation. They could have done without the Gremlin parts, but I guess they were trying to make it interesting for young readers--Couldn't they have come up with a better opposition to problems that having a gremlin creature? I guess that is my pet peeve.The first few chapters were great as far as illustrating step-by-step on how to do each equation, then somewhere they lost me as they begin omitting the step-by-step explainations. I am a visual learner and like to see how they arrived at that answer; otherwise, I am just plain lost. Since my exam was fast approaching, I switched over to Painless Algebra by Barron Series and it was overall great. I got a 91 on the Algebra part, permitting me to take Intermediate Algebra. Had I stuck with this book, what I needed for the graphs, diagrams cos, tan, sin, etc. would have passed the College Algebra Part. THIS BOOK LOST ME ON THE FIRST CHAPTER EXPLAINING THESE GRAPHS, ETC. Again, they omitted a step or two because I can not figure how they arrived at their answers. I did find myself skipping sections because of this. Why some chapters did an excellent job of explaining and why others did not is beyond me.Overall, I guess this book is worth buying as there were not too many to choose from and these were the best of the bunch being offered. Better to learn something than nothing.I wish I could find Algebra and higher math workbooks like they offer for children. The DK Math Made Easy series is an excellent children's math book.

He was Jewish by race, but was not religious. Then, at around the age of 50, he became a Jewish Christian.Cassirer's translation is modern and not literal. With the publisher's permission, I will quote a passage from one of the Apostle Paul's epistles in the God's New Covenant translation to give you a better idea of what this version is like: \\"Surely, you know that wrongdoers will obtain no share in the kingdom of God. Do not allow yourselves to be deluded. It is not those engaging in fornication, the idolaters, the adulterers, those acting as partners in unnatural vice, the sodomites, the thieves, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the extortioners, who will obtain a share in the kingdom of God. And such some of you once were.

Scripture comes alive under his efforts and his unique Jewish/Christian perspective shows through. Buy this living word and obey what you hear. Bruce Fogerty"},{"Title":"God's New Covenant: A New Testament Translation","review":"Pros: It reads well and it brings out things in a way that allows the reader to see its concepts and ideas in a new light, from a different angle. One verse that comes to mind is Eph 4:22, \\"There must be a laying aside of that which conforms to your former manner of life....\\" This rendering is very practical; it makes it plain what is meant: you get rid of the bad stuff you messed with before conversion! It also takes out the false verse found in certain otherwise excellent translations (such as the KJV and NKJV) which was surreptitiously added in \\"much later\\" to support the false doctrine of the trinity (see 1 John 5:7).Cons: Although the book is excellent for gleaning deeper meaning in some areas, it is also expectedly lacking in others. One small example is Gal 2:20 where it reads, \\".... Yet I live it by the faith IN the Son of God....\\" It should read, \\"by the faith OF the Son of God\\". Most translations make this error, but it is important. For biblical Christianity teaches that the Christian has Christ living in them via the power of the Holy Spirit, and this is how one overcomes self, Satan and society; being empowered to keep God's law in spirit and Truth.Overall I like it a lot!

Our child was born only three miles from our house and brought to us straight from the hospital. The perseverance and love that gave Sarah Woodard and her husband wings to endure their frustrating trials and then enjoy the ultimate triumph in walking off the plane with their daughter!

Good luck to everyone who will undertake this journey!Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"},{"Title":"Daughter from Afar: A Family's International Adoption Story","review":"I was so absorbed in this book that I completed it in one evening. While this is a slim book, it is a compelling read for two reasons: (1) it contains lots of helpful information that prospective parents would appreciate; and (2) Ms. Woodard is an exceptionally engaging writer. I especially appreciated Ms. Woodard's optimistic, yet realistic, tone ... I have read similar adoption memoirs that take a somewhat &quot;Pollyanna-ish&quot; perspective. Ms. Woodard is very open about her frustration with her daughter's initial adjustments, and I found that reassuring. All in all, this book is a valuable resource for those considering China adoption."},{"Title":"Daughter from Afar: A Family's International Adoption Story","review":"I too read Daughter From Afar in a single sitting. I laughed and cried as Sarah and her husband negotiated each step of the adoption process and she described the uncertainty as well as the understanding that their daughter was meant for them. I found myself reliving the wonderful emotions of our first adoption, something that was filled with many of the same firsts and unknowns as well.Sarah brings the process to life but sprinkles pragmatism and realism into the mix. Her book creates a realistic portrait of a family formed through adoption with the love and challenges that come with taking the leap of faith that is so necessary for adoptive families. I would recommend this book if you are considering adoption or you have adopted. It will make you look at your children and smile as you remember how it all started, or give you an understanding of what could be."},{"Title":"Daughter from Afar: A Family's International Adoption Story","review":"This is a great book recounting the journey of one couple in their quest to adopt from China. They are respectful of the culture, country and the people and feel very real emotions throughout the process. I enjoyed reading about their fears, concerns and dreams concerning their coming daughter, and never once got the feeling that they decided to adopt simply because it was 'expected' of them to have children.I recommend this book to anyone who is adopting from China or even thinking about adopting from China."},{"Title":"Daughter from Afar: A Family's International Adoption Story","review":"What a great story! A Daughter From Afar really lets you know what a family goes through during an international adoption process. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in adopting a child from another country, it was very informative and is a great insite to families who are interested in adopting internationally, but really don't know where to start or what to expect. I would also recommend this book to anyone who loves children.In the US, your main concerns are state oriented. Adopting from another country magnifies everything to global proportions. Sarah really gives you an indepth look at the entire process and the emotional rollercoaster that goes along with it.After reading A Daughter From Afar, you feel like you took the journey with Sarah and her husband. You will laugh and cry as the story unfolds. And applaud when they finally walk off the plane!"},{"Title":"Daughter from Afar: A Family's International Adoption Story","review":"I don't often review books, but as my husband and I find we are going to be starting our very own \\"paper chase\\" to bring our daughter home to us from China, I have been relying heavily on reviews - so here goes mine.This is a great first hand account of what it is REALLY like for this adoptive mom. She tells her story without reservation, and gives you the facts. It was very courageous of her to display her inner thoughts and feelings about the adoption process and how it was for her, and I felt empowered by being able to \\"see into her thoughts\\" while she went through the process step by step. I also like the fact that it was not romantacized in any way, as I've read in a few articles. I want the good, the bad, and the ugly, and I got it (even though there really wasn't very much of the bad or the ugly at all).I also found the information regarding their stay in China while getting their daughter very informative and helpful. I had no idea that the water in China was so polluted that you can't even get any in your mouth at all (they tied a sock over the faucet to remind them not to use it - GREAT idea!) and that you have to shower and keep your mouth closed at all times - yet the babies are completely used to this water.Another aspect that was very beneficial to me is that they are not an infertile couple - and neither are my husband and I. They - like us - just felt the desire to adopt one of these little girls who is in need of a family. I would liked to have known whether they got any \\"flack\\" from anyone regarding the fact that even though they were fully capable of conceiving a biological child, they chose adoption instead (this is something I'm not looking forward to encountering and is also something I'm not sure I know how I'm going to deal with)In genereal, I *appreciate* her story and what it has offered to me, and I'm sure her daughter will treasure it when she is of age to read it and truly understand what it meant to have her as their child."},{"Title":"Daughter from Afar: A Family's International Adoption Story","review":"I'm the very blessed mom of two daughers who became mine through international adoption, so this story was quite meaninful to me. Reading about the journey of another family is both inspiring and comforting. Sarah shares all the dimensions involved in the miracle of adoption in a beautiful way! You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Daughter from Afar: A Family's International Adoption Story","review":"The author dealt with the issues of adoption with a lot of tact and was honest about some of the negative things that her family went through, from bureaucratic delays to their daughter's health problems. I was fully resigned to the fact that it would be a totally sappy story, but surprisingly it was just sweet but not overly emotional, so that's a plus for me. This book is informative not just for those in the adoptioin process (which I am not) but anyone interested in child welfare in general, or just a nice story about becoming a mother. All of the profits go towards the non-profit organization that the author founded so in addition to enjoying this book I am happy to be helping her cause."},{"Title":"Daughter from Afar: A Family's International Adoption Story","review":"I too read this book from cover to cover in just a few hours. It was a wonderfully written story. More importantly, it was an honest account of a couple adopting from China. There were emotional highs, but there were also frustrations, missing the carefree life she'd know before adopting, and months of sleepless nights due to a screaming child who could not be comforted. Sarah Woodard is honest about her exhaustion and frustration with her new daughters bumpy start to life in America and the different routes they used to help her and themselves cope.I've read many books written by adoptive parents. This is the first book I've read that really shared the reality of adopting a child who may have been abused, neglected, and was certainly starving for one on one attention. There is an impact on these young girls and they don't instantly forget their hardships, regardless of their age. It's often a tough road ahead once the paper chase and travel is over.I'm grateful to Sarah Woodard for writing this book. As someone who is also choosing to adopt a child from China for reasons that have nothing to do with fertility problems, I found this book very applicable to my own life in terms of the obstacles and the joys my husband and I will most certainly face."},{"Title":"Daughter from Afar: A Family's International Adoption Story","review":"very good book, could not put it down, great insite into what goes on the the adoption process"},{"Title":"Daughter from Afar: A Family's International Adoption Story","review":"This is a good book for anyone interested in international adoption.

She writes beautifully about some harsh realities. She writes in an easy laid back manner that creates an atmosphere of familiarity and ease. Maya Angelou's pen is as soothing as her deep raspy voice. I began my love of her books immediately following her appearance on Sesame Street. I remember thinking ...I need to get to know more about this person I figured any one who moved me to tears singing with Elmo ( hard to picture isn't it?) was worth discovering...a journey I have enjoyed and found most rewarding"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I'm at a loss as to what to make of this pastiche. Maya has taken a narrow slice of her life and seems to have described events and states of mind at random, without regard for coherence or continuity. She starts out with a gossipy bit on Billie Holiday, then jumps to her first experience of a writing group, and is all over the map from there on. The worst thing of all is her lack of a critical perspective on her life. These events happened over thirty years ago but Maya has made no attempt to place them in a larger context, analyze what she felt at the time as compared to what she feels now; in short, she has a disregard for history. These are really rambling vignettes, and her views on literature and race are embarassingly naive, even for the times. Her opinion of the literary value of the Genet play fluctuates according to whether she's had a good or bad encounter with a white person! Unbelievable. She also makes gross generalizations about African men, black American men, teachers, sons and lovers, and everyone under the sun. These type of generalizations are what you'd expect to find in a diary, not a piece of published writing. Does she have an editor? Does she think that her off-the-cuff opinions are really worth anyone's time? I only was able to keep reading because I was laughing so hard. Good for a laugh, unless you're a struggling writer. You'll be kicking the walls, trying to understand how this got published and your work doesn't."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"This book is a wonderful inspiration for women.

The story begins with her decision to move to New York in the late 1950's when Martin Luther King and Malcom X were the most central political figures of that time. There she begins to write, produces the Cabaret of Freedom, a collaboration of performances given to raise money for the SCLC, becomes employed then by the SCLC in a position only held by men previously. Shortly after she has been working such a prestigious job, she meets and marries an African freedom-fighter who wisks Angelou and her son, Guy, off to Cairo where she knows noone. Maya Angelou appears to create good out of bad, a woman faced with tragedy numerous times throughout her life, yet comes out triumphant and victorious each time. Never did I feel as if I was being led to lament with her difficulties. On the contrary, I felt admiration for a woman who inhabited a strong sense of self and an even stronger zest for living. An inspirational story I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Maya Angelou impresses me. What a life! So many lives at the same: it's crazy. I've just watched a movie (featuring Wesley Snipes) that she has recently directed and which reminded of the kind of woman that I thought she was when I read her &quot;Heart&quot;: compassionate, human...Reading Angelou made me aware of what it is was to be a woman and a mother in America. I've read about fictional characters that had comparable difficulties and faced them with astonishing courage and endurance, but reading Maya made it more real for me. Doing that while one has so many commitments at the same time certainly compels admiration.Words are inadequate to express how I felt to enter the heart of a woman that has so many experiences to share and read a book that is so simply and yet masterfully written.In this review, I didn't want to be academic and all (commenting on the themes, the syntax, the structure, etc.). I just wanted to communicated what Maya's heart has put in my heart. Go for it, it's humanizing and worth-reading."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"The first time I heard Maya A. speak, I had the little hairs at the back of my neck stand upright! I was moved and in awe.I have read several of her works, all of which were cherished. However, after reading &quot;Heart&quot; I felt a deeper awareness. I am a middle class, white woman. I will NEVER understand the hate, fear, and anger experienced by anyone of color- no matter how much I learn, no matter how much I empathize. What I will share with all races is that emotions are emotions, no matter the color. Raising a child, falling in love and then realizing, &quot;Oops, wrong one&quot;...parental love, fear, anger...all make us human. I feel closer to this world for having forced myself to think about past misery and hatred. I wish my children the grace and dignity displayed by a remarkable woman. Thank You for reaching my soul."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"THE HEART OF A WOMAN continues Angelou's autobiographical series that begins with I KNOW WHY THE CAGED BIRD SINGS and continues with GATHER TOGETHER IN MY NAME and SINGIN' & SWINGIN' & GETTIN' MERRY LIKE CHRISTMAS. It is the fourth \\"installment\\" in this series, and, while it is an interesting recounting of Angelou's life into the decade of the 1960's, it will be more instructive for the reader who has followed the series of books in their chronological order.HEART continues in exactly the same vein as the earlier books: The reader sees an Angelou who, despite many unfortunate life experiences, has yet to develop discernment insofar as male companions are concerned. Consequently, she continues as the naive pawn of males who betray her childlike faith and trust in them. After seeing this theme replayed so often in the books thus far, the reader begins to wonder whether Angelou sees herself through some sort of \\"victim mentality,\\" a self-destructive image resulting from an abused childhood. Was she really taken advantage of so often and so consistently in her life? Would a biography written by a thoroughly objective outside observer show us the same Angelou that she herself depicts? Or is the picture that we see in her books one that was painted with the brush of self doubt and inferiority fashioned from the instability of her formative years? The reader should bear in mind that what we are reading may be more of a psychological self-analysis than demonstrable history. That does not make the book any less revealing of its author; it merely means that the reader should be aware of the type of revelation he is viewing.Angelou's racist attitudes persist more or less unabated in HEART. When she takes a role in the play \\"The Blacks,\\" she refuses to believe that a white French playwright could possibly understand the \\"Black struggle\\" in America, nor does she trust the white men involved in the production of the play; at one point, she depicts one of them as a devious, dismissive racist when he refuses to pay her extra for having composed two songs for the play. Perhaps he was, but then we are not permitted to see his interpretation of the situation either. Angelou sees herself as the object of intimidation by white policemen trying to keep order at a demonstration outside the UN building and depicts herself as being saved by cadres of Black supporters who physically rally to her side in the street. Fearing abandonment in Cairo, Egypt by her African consort, referred to as her husband though never legally married, she refuses to consider approaching the American consulate for help because it represents White America. Again, Angelou's descriptions of such occurrences may indeed be quite factual, yet one must wonder whether her interpretation of them is not warped by her own prejudiced view of Caucasians. At one point, she does have the objectivity to quote a Black colleague who points out her \\"reverse racism\\" to her. I believe that it is important to remember that, as we are reading Angelou's books, we are being shown the world as it appeared through her eyes. Whether or not this is identical to the objective world is quite another matter. We must bear in mind that an autobiography reveals more about the mind set of its author than about factual occurrences.This series of autobiographical books is valuable not only for unveiling the thoughts, concepts and opinions of their author but also for showing us how the rest of the world, i.e., the non-Black world, was perceived by a Black woman born into legalized segregation, forced to endure the social and economic inequalities fostered by a segregated society, and exposed to the heady atmosphere of the American Civil Rights movement. Regardless of our reaction to Angelou's personal self at this stage of her life, her descriptions of the world around her are very instructive, but it behooves the reader to maintain his own objectivity and to remember that it is Angelou's interpretation of the world that he is being shown. Next comes ALL GOD'S CHILDREN NEED TRAVELING SHOES, and I am curious to see how Angelou's perceptions of her world will have evolved by that stage of her life."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"&quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot; tells of a courageous woman, Maya Angelou, who maintains a career as a dancer while raising a rebellious teenage son.

This book will inspire everyone to be successful in their everyday living. This great book will also bring out &quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot; in everyone."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I loved the first three books, but this one seems to have been written by someone else; the Maya who wrote I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings has disappeared, and the writer who took her place left me irritated, sometimes offended, and absolutely disappointed. This is the last book of Maya's that I will read, as she has completely turned me off with an arrogance, hatefulness, and extreme sense of entitlement that were not present at all in the first three books.I also had to comment on her frustrating contradictions regarding white people. She often embraces her mother's feelings towards whites, as evidenced by her agreement with the following example: \\"Black folks can't change because white folks won't change.\\" But later, when there are many white people who are diligently and passionately fighting for the civil rights movement and for progressive change to benefit blacks, she chooses to condone and even advocate Malcolm X's beliefs that \\"There are whites who give monely to the SCLC the NAACP and the Urban League. Some even go so far as to march with you in the streets. But let me tell you who they are. Any white American who says he's your friend is either weak or he's an infiltrator. Either he'll be too scared to help you when you need help or he's getting close to you so he can find out your plans and deliver you back in chains to his brothers.\\" So which is it Maya? Apparently white folks can't win, for when they do nothing, they are continuing to enforce black oppression, and when they do something, they are scheming to keep the black man down through evil pretension and sly, malevolent friendship. I couldn't believe it when I read the passage where Maya actually agrees with all of this.Lastly, her marriages and relationships, which disintegrate, are all blamed solely and completely on the men. She is always faultless, the victim, the one who has to leave because she has been wronged, or the one who has been wronged because she has been left! I do not recall a single instance where Maya takes any responsibility for the multiple problems in her relationships with men. She hops to and fro, from man to man (Thomas to Vus is a great example), and seems to expect true love every time, but is then shocked and disappointed to find that the men actually have flaws.There were other things that bothered me, but I will stop because I still have respect for Maya. As I stated previously, I thoroughly enjoyed and admired I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, along with the subsequent two books, and fell in love with the joys and tribulations of Maya's young life. I was in awe of her wit and humor, and the honesty and directness with which she told her bittersweet story. I only wish I had never touched The Heart of a Woman; it is angry, smug, and self-serving, and does not compare in any way to her other work.-Angela Chisholm"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"&quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot; is a continuation of Maya Angelou's multi-volume autobiography. Written a direct and uncomplicated style, this volume opens in 1957, with Maya as a young mother raising her son in California.As the narrative unfolds, Maya moves to New York City, where she becomes involved in the Harlem Writers Guild. The author goes on to describe her experiences in the theater, her involvement in the civil rights movement, and her work as a journalist in Africa.&quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot; is a fascinating evocation of a turbulent era in both American and African history. I was particularly intrigued by the story of Angelou's performance in Jean Genet's play &quot;The Blacks&quot;; Angelou offers some interesting insights into the relationship between artistic and racial issues.

Thus, I've read &quot;Gather Together In My Name&quot;, and &quot;Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas&quot; in succesion. This book is one of the best that I've ever read, and I read alot of books! Her life is so interesting and eventful. Even though she relates her trajedies as well as her joys, you don't feel sorry for her, because through everything she remains true to herself and thereby comes out on top. Her tender devotion to her son is very touching. Through a childhood of constant changes he is depicted as a wonderful human being, equally devoted to his mother. There are parts of the book where I was laughing out loud at situations she gotten her self into and how she handled them. What a woman!

I could totally relate and it was hard to put the book down."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"For Maya Angelou, this line from an ancient spiritual epitomizes the civil rights struggle in 1957, a struggle in which she was intimately involved on many levels. Continuing the autobiography she started with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, she reveals her personal life from 1957 - 1965, drawing the reader into the individual, human costs of segregation and detailing her passion and commitment to end it. It is her additional commitment to the welfare of her son, however, and her determination that he will become a man of honesty and principle that unite the several sections of this book and give it heart.Angelou had overcome a tormented childhood to become a singer/dancer in the show Porgy and Bess before semi-settling in California. In 1957, Angelou, now twenty-nine and a single mother with a twelve-year-old son, decides to move from California to New York. There she entertains singer Billie Holiday for four days (an unforgettable character sketch), just three months before Holiday's death, and meets Godfrey Cambridge, then a New York taxi driver. With him, she organizes a revue in Harlem to raise money for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.Drawn into the orbit of prominent black entertainers and showbiz entrepreneurs during the show, she also meets civil rights leaders, and eventually becomes a regional coordinator for SCLC. Her acceptance as a member of the Harlem Writers Guild leads to the beginning of her writing career. Throughout this period, her son Guy is going to public school, where on one occasion he has problems as the only black child, but when they move to a black neighborhood, he runs afoul of a violent black street gang. As Angelou deals with the big civil rights issues, Guy is a schoolboy dealing with the basic power struggles that underlie and complicate the need for justice in his own life.Angelou is candid throughout her narrative, depicting people she meets \\"warts and all,\\" but she is equally candid about her own actions, her sexual needs, and her impatience with formality and red tape. Her willingness to use her tongue as a rapier gives spice to the narrative and depicts Angelou as a formidable adversary. When she \\"marries\\" Vusumzi Make, a South African Freedom Fighter, and, with her son, moves to Egypt and later to Ghana, she continues her work toward a better life for Africans, while remaining an anchor for her son. In this intimate memoir, Angelou provides insights into the universal civil rights struggle, while, at the same time providing a very human picture of one woman's home life during this tumultuous period of history. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I struggled with this review because I start every book with a positive attitude, but I was shocked at how angry this book made me.It's undeniable that Maya Angelou has led a colorful and interesting life. I stop there because I found her to be extremely unlikable. And very angry. It's difficult to go against a book written about black oppression and racial equality, but Angelou makes that easy by telling the reader how much she hates white people or \\"crackers\\" as she calls them.Nowhere do I see any kind of evidence that she regards all people as human. It's blacks and anyone else of color vs. whites. She holds the reader responsible for slavery, hatred and discrimination. I don't relate to her as a woman or as a human being.And everywhere throughout this memoir there is evidence of poor judgment on the part of Angelou. She claims to have a great relationship with her son Guy, but her child-rearing choices are often shocking. In particular, Angelou brags about how she borrows a gun and visits the home of a gang member who has threatened Guy (a teenager at this point). Her language is ugly and her intentions unclear when she tells the gang member (a teenager himself) that she will kill him if he keeps bothering Guy.Her choices in men are equally foolish. From casual lovers to Thomas whom she almost marries (by the way she meets him in a bar) and then to Vus whom she hardly knows. Is the reader supposed to admire her for marrying Vus because his work is so important?She seems to think the reader will admire her tendency to jump right into situations without thinking, leaving the consequences for later. What do other people see in her writing? Please comment if you can tell me."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"As a reader of this wonderful book, I feel as if a part of me goes along with maya on her journey to survive in a world that is so unjust.As she tells her story, this biography seems to come to life as her powerful words take you, the reader, for a ride.It all begins in the city of New York where she tells of her son Guy and herself living in a small apartment.Her musical ways get her to a place where she feels comfortable as far as living-wise.Her singing and acting career seem to really come out in the beggining of this novel.She tells of performing in the Apolo Theatre, which is a very famous Negro-American theatre.Maya's talent for the stage lands her a job in producing and acting in small caberets and plays.Maya begins to feel that something is missing in her life.That thing she needs is a man to support herself and her son.At a local bar, where she often went to get away form it all, Maya's hopes of having that gap filled seems to come true when she met a nice man by the name of Thomas Allen.They become aquainted and meet more times after. Eventually Maya and Thomas hit it off and become engaged to be married. Frineds along the way such as the killenses, who where the reason in which Maya and Guy moved there in the first place, encouraged them and were supportive of the marrige plans.Life seems to work in funny ways especially for Miss Maya Angelou.A speaker who came all of the way from Africa was at a friends house one afternoon for a party.This famous freedom fighters name was Vusumzi Make(pronounced mah-kay). Maya attended this party that afternon while her fiance was at work.Maya had gotten one look at this man and she knew right then and there that he was the one, he was everything she'd hoped for in a man.\\"...I had not met such a man...\\" said Maya.Make later offered Maya to lunch several times.Maya thinking nothing of it while her fiance was off at work accepted each invitation. She began to have strong feeling for the man.One particular evening, Make asked her to marry him and to move out of this city to Africa where her son would grow up to be a wonderful African man.Of course Maya felt torn and thought long and hard but came to a conclusion in which to accept his offer; but to break the news to her fiance, that was another story.She told him the not so good new and like any person would he was upset and that was it.Maya and Make then got married and now they could make thier plans to move to Africa.They followed through with those plans and started to what they thought was a better life. In fact life does not work that way at least not in Maya's case. Life seemed good for a while having thier expensive apartment with oriental rugs and royal furniture.But as life went on and Vus, Vusumzi, had more job that were not so close to home he would return with the scent of other girl and the make-up smudged all over his collar.Now Maya didn't jump to conclusions right off but after a while she new something was up and confronted about it numerous times.He explained that she was the only one he loved. But finally it got old and vus would come home very late sometimes not at all. This time when confronted Vus confessed to all of those girls in the past.He told her that being an African man he could have more than one wife to fulfill his needs.Maya was more hurt than anything, but she dealed with it like any women would she told Vus that she was taking Guy and leaving him and that she no longer had any romantic feeling for him anymore.Time pressed on and a meeting with friends got Maya to stay for six months. When those six months were up She packed her things and headed off to Ghara.At this time Guy had graduated high school and was ready to go to collge. Maya herf that Ghara's college was a great one and only wanted the best for the one who ment the world to her.Maya would go and work as a writer at the Liberian Depeatment of Info.This all seemed like it would work out after all.Again something threw their planns off this time a little more serious.Guy had been involved in a severe car accident and had broken his neck and was put into a neck, arm and body cast.Guy recovered after in time and he headed off to be a man in college while Maya had to deal with the fact that her little bot was all grown up ready to face the world and to make a difference in someone's life!"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Maya Angelou's &quot;The Heart of A Woman&quot; is written with grace and delicacy. In it Maya undergoes many obstacles as a mother, friend, fiance and leader. Guy, her teenage son faces peer pressure and gets involved with the violence on the street. As a result, Maya baffles with separating work and catering to her fatherless son. The help from many friends like, John Killens, help Angelou to maintain faith. Also, Maya's dedication to the civil rights movements during the mid' twentieth century is a pure example of her being an organized and charismatic person. Maya is a woman who has fulfilled the scripture &quot;faith the size of a mustard seed can move mountains&quot;. What I admire the most is that a lot of the work Maya was handling was volunteer, so as a result she was not getting paid, which meant she was finding other means of survival. It takes a determined person to succeed. Despite of the many tribulations Angelou underwent, she persevered. From Maya I have learned that a leader is caring, devoted and brave."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"This is a very good book. I liked that she just told the truth and did not seem to embellish. She also exposed herself as the true woman that she is. We understood at all times without the use of vulgarity. And last, by the time she was finished, I felt like I have met her personally."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"As an English major at Alcorn State in MS, I have read many books, bur this book has really twisted my stomach into a frenzy. This woman has boldness and strength that a lot of women today do not have. Her words were so enticing and to the point. The book kept me on my toes and urging me to want to read it more and more. I can only say that although this book was a bit biographical, it is very instrumental to the Black Woman under- standing the meaning of her heart!"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I listened to this while on a long car trip and loved it from start to finish!"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I have read all of Ms.Angelou's books and have gained a knowledge of the strength of women.She speaks to all that is revelant in life,then and now.Heart Of A Woman is yet another step closer to total litterary bliss.She decribes with such elegant and understated prose the emotion of motherhood with honesty,and grace.We are all better for having read her work.Thank You Maya"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"One of the best books I have read in a very long time. I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to pick it up again. Her style of writing is poetic and exciting. If you want a great book to read, this one is definitely it."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Maya has led an interesting life! I found this more autobiographical than I'd expected, but her life experience is very entertaining. . . especially her encounter with Billie Holliday. She views her life with such joy and appears to learn from the wrong as well the positive turns that she encounters. This is a good first-read for someone not familiar w/ Maya Angelou's writing."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"The Heart of a Woman is simply excellent. I selected this book because it was part of the Oprah club. I read it (quickly) and since then have read all of her memoirs and had the tremendous privilege of seeing her in Ottawa, Canada when she spoke at our National Arts Centre in June 1998. I recommend this book to ANYONE."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Although I still admire Maya Angelou because of all she accomplished in her life, I could not get past some of the generalities she makes in her book. I found I disagreed on many issues with Angelou, and why wouldn't I? To point out the obvious, I am white, and she is black. But, that doesn't even matter. She is a woman who should reach far beyond me in philosophy and wisdom because I am merely a 16-year old girl. However, when Angelou talked about the mulatto bastards, I could not help being offended. I am not implying that race should be an issue in any way, but it is hard for me to understand why Angelou has this viewpoint. I guess I was hoping for more philosophy out of the book, not a story of her life."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I finally got the chance to read a book my Maya Angelou and loved it! I have heard so many great things about her books. The hype is true. You'll love this book."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I've heard so many good things about this woman, so I went ahead and bought my first book of hers.So impressed with her manner of expressing herself - her sincere ways, her honest fears, her passionate heart, her personal struggles and unwithering determination, and the way she allows the reader to not only identify with her in such a unique way, but also to feel like a personal friend. Reading this book is like sitting down to a cup of coffee (or tea, if preferred) and reminiscing with a good friend you've known for years. Not only do I recommend this book, but I will surely be purchasing more of her work, once I am finished reading this one."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Maya Angelou writes like if a Heart was directly in front of you and you felt every beat of it and also heard every sound of it beating. there is no other way to truly describe her greatness and honesty. she is truly a survivor and you feel every word she says if it was her last. this book takes you back to a particualr time that wasn't kind and also the movement and struggle and her being a Mother raising her son and dealing with the racial politics of the day and times. her words and how she stayed strong through the storm is a great testimony to her drive and will. i love her work and admire her Genius. to me Her poetry is the voice of America. nobody else like her."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Maya Angelou once again proves to be such a prolific writer - every word is designed to make you experience her life as she did. Great read for anyone, whether a teenager or adult!"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Maya has such an impeccable method of penning and conveying her prose!! This was a wonderful installment in her biographical sequence(s). I recommend this book to ALL (those mature and aged enough to handle the sometimes-explicit subject matter) because it brings so many pieces of American history together in such a uniquely stated manner!"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"i was so excited to get this book. it arrived fast and was in good condition. thank you"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I am a true fan of Maya Angelou, but this was not one of her better books. I did read the book in its entirety. It had some exciting moments, but it was not what I expected from Maya Angelou. I wanted to read the book after seeing it on Oprah's Book Club. I truly believe it could have been more exciting."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I would recommend this book to everyone, specially the guyswho lack the understanding of the way a woman feels. The best thing about the book for me is the fact that it has people that I know, which makes me connect to the book even better. I would give this book 4 out of 5 because it kept me interested and wanting to read more and more.Women shows society that when they are pushed down they would always find a way to rise back up; and that should be in every Heart of a Woman.For the longest time, women have been violated against and received no rights. They have been looked down upon and was thought of as only a person that bears children. But women have made they're way to any mans level. Unlike men, they deserve the rights that they have today. Their rights and freedom is something they've worked for and have earned. It was not something that was simply given to them. Maya Angelou helped every single woman receive the rights that they have now."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Once again in her continuing autobiography Maya Angelou allows us into her world. She lets you know that she is just as human as the rest of us. I loved this book. It is well worth the money and I can't believe anyone would want to sell this book for a lousy 1.59 Maya's books should be bronzed and kept forever."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"When I first picked up this book, I thought to myself 'Ah yes another &quot;Go Women&quot; book. I started to read it. The extensive aray of emotions and thoughts this book provoked was amazing. I never thought a book could touch me so deeply. Sometimes, I laughed so hard I needed to put the book down, sometimes cried a river, sometimes threw the book across the room in disgust and anger for all the racial comments of both black and white races. One amazingly breathtaking story. I recently went to see Maya Angelou speak, the topic &quot; Composing oneslef&quot;. The moment she was introduced and came on stage, I burst into tears. It was the most wonderful thing I have seen to date. I highly, highly recommend this book to all who want an amazing story and want to come away from a book with self-confidance, reasurance and re-newed self worth: I am Woman."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"This isn't a bad book. It isn't great either. I don't know what annoyed me more, the constant pointing out of her mediocrity as a singer and a writer (which made the book that much more lukewarm) or the name-dropping. After suffering through several chapters claiming how just okay she is at everything she does, and wondering when the story is going to get interesting, I started to think that maybe she has become so famous just because she placed so many brief encounters with great people into her books. Perhaps time has made such stories un-surprising, but there doesn't seem to be anything ground-breaking and very little interesting in this novel."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I had just finished reading Maya's other book &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; when I started &quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot;. I really enjoyed the first book in the series, so I was very excited to get started on this one. The moment I began reading it, I felt something had gone terribly wrong. Self pity seems to be the underlying theme of this story. I don't want to be forced to feel sorry for this woman who has lived a very incredible life. This story also lacks the small bits of sweet humor that I found so endearing in the first one. If you are looking for the same enchanting storytelling you have found in other Angelou works, you won't find it here. Sorry...."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"&quot;The Heart Of A Woman&quot; tugged at every internal ounce of my very soul where my womanhood as a mother is concerned. I thought of my four sons and my need to mother (guide) them as I read. I thought of my twin daughters also and my need to mother (guide) them too. Recently,as my first son left, heading for college, I thought again of &quot;The Heart Of A Woman&quot;. As he walked through the crosswalk to the airport entrance after kissing me goodbye and thanking me for guiding him over the past eighteen years, my flesh (self) cried and cried. My soul knew that I'd done all that I was capable of doing and that he would be just fine. That's the heart of a woman. Every mother who has ever tried to raise her children through test and trial should read this book. It'll give you the strength to keep on keep'in on!"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Maya Angelou has set an example to all women. Reading this book is like listening to the richness of Maya's voice. It is full of wonder and yet struggle and survival of a woman so strong and yet volunerable but full of strength. Maya leads us by the hand through her world with a grace and style that only she can do. I loved this book and is one that I will share with it with all my women friends and family. It should be a &quot;must&quot; for reading by all women"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Maya Angelou may or may not be a racist these days,,,i have no knowledge of her except that oprah seems to exalt her.....perhaps maya has matured or had some sort of epiphany in the time since shes lived this particular era of her life,,,but certainly she was an out and out racist during this chapter of her existence. But putting aside the constant white-bashing in the pages of this book, its still a book that fluctuates between being compelling, boring, irritating, and exasperating.Its hard to enjoy the autobiography of someone who is smug, obnoxious,narrow minded,racist,mean-spirited, judgemental, over-dramatic, haughty, rash, foolhardy, and impulsive. The best i can say about her is that she had balls, she had good survival skills, and she always landed on her feet no matter what wrong turns she took in life.It would be nice if this book could appeal to all people, or even all women, but her viewpoint at that time was so narrow and unenlightened that i suspect only a very small portion of the black population would be able to identify with her outlook."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"Maya's continuing story, helps me to realize that although life may be happening all around us, we all have inner strengths. If we deal with life as we see it, and not allow others projections of how they would like our lives to be, infect us...then we have no choice but to grow. I liked the references to the real life people who worked towards change, and I liked the descriptions of their character, and what made them unique, yet sometimes foolish. Maya's writing flows so well, it's easy to get swept away and find yourself polishing off this book in one setting."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I am a young white female, and I did not find that I was able to understand or relate to this novel. I was certainly privileged to be able to read Ms. Angelou's writing as she certainly is a wonderful writer. However I did not find that the book was able to reach out to those other than the ones living in her footsteps."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I was born and raised in India on the wrong side of the caste system. I worked hard to become educated and to come to America. Perhaps in the 1960s, America was not as fair as it is now, but it was still better than anywhere else. I find books like this, where people whine about the amount of melanin in their skin, offensive. Angelou comments often about how much she hates white people. This is stupid and it shows how uneducated she still is.If she had written this in the 1960s, in the throes of it, it might be interesting as a historical piece, but now it just shows how racist she it. I'll bet she hates Asians, too. Even when she was abandoned in Egypt by a man she wrongly called her \\"husband,\\" (even though they weren't married,) she wouldn't go to the American embassy for help because white people worked there. Every slight in her life, she attributes to white people being racist because she is black.This book is filled with name-dropping and smug anger.Minna"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I read the last sentence and smiled, wow, what a lady. It is nearly impossible to believe that a person can live through such adversity and rise above it all. . . . then again, that's been the story of African American people since our captivity and subsequent slavery in the United States. Where did Maya get the strength to continue on, I asked myself, then I recalled my mothers struggle. . . continued struggle and I know that is through strong will, determination, and the all out grace of God that we are able to move forward in the face of such adversity. How fortunate Maya was to have been able to see the Motherland and come to know the struggles of the people of Africa while knowing and have experienced the struggle of African Americans. Maya did an excellent job of identifying how the two struggles were different, and yet the same.When I finished this book I felt, uplifted (I actually reread a copy of &quot;And Still I Rise&quot;), rejuvenated, exonerated,! ! educated, emancipated, knowing that here lives a African American who continues to rise . . . . and so shall I.

As a white woman, I am so grateful for the light Ms. Angelou sheds on the thinking and psyche of an African American woman. Until we, as whites, come to better understand this group's challenges and see the privilege we take for granted, we (whites) will continue to oppress. Thank you for a great story and many wonderful lessons. I will take them with me."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I have just finished The Heart of a Woman and I could not put it down once I started it. Angelou lays bare for all of her readers her heart, her life and her truth. What an amazing life she has lived. I read some reviews that criticized her for her honesty in regards to whites during the 60s. It was the 60s, racial barriers where still up strong and bared anyone of color from living the lives they so richly deserved, why should she be criticized for this? Would it be better that she lied and said how wonderful life was for blacks in this country during that time? It wasn't and that is the point that she is making in this book. That is the point that she is making as an African American woman, called to the forefront in the battle of discrimination.I had to look on the cover to see when she wrote this book, it was 1981, how sad that in 26yrs we still see white America carrying the flag of superiority! I am truly glad that Angelou is still walking this earth to see that though the gains for civil rights are slow coming they are coming,regardless of what her criticizers are saying. Because if they are criticizing her for telling it like it was, then there is still a long path to journey to get us beyond the need for civil rights.If you want to know what the 60's Civil Rights movement & Aparthied in South Africa was about this book will give you an accurate picture of one womans involvement. Two thumbs up for Angelou!"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"What a brave woman! That's all I have to say.

I have always said that give me ten random paragraphs from different authors and I will always tell you which one is by Angelou. It's a very interesting story. It's a good read. However, I have read works by her that are better, which is why I give it 4 stars. She narrates about her life in Egypt, Ghana, and America. We are also given a closer look at her relationship with her son, her trials and difficulties. Go get it!"},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"This book makes note of Maya Angelou's life and struggles during the 60's. She discusses her membership to the Harlem Writer's Guild, her singing/theatrical career, and her lively travels to Africa. She discusses marriage, her relationship with her son and her mother. I recommend this book to everyone woman who is learning, while experiencing the ever-so-changing journey that life will take you on. After reading, you will be prepared to overcome all fears and achieve your dreams."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"The Heart of A Woman touches the hearts and souls of women of all color. Ms Angelou never tries to evoke the sympathy of her readers, she encourages them to celebrate their obstacles and reach for goals which may seem far out of reach. Before reading her latest book, I as a woman of color, must admit that I considered obstacles I encountered to be indigenous to who I was. I now know that we as women are all the same color when it comes to what we hope to accomplish in our lifetime. Ms Angelou continues to teach the legacy which Martin Luther King started, that we all must come together as people and not as race. I recommend this book to everyone. It is truly a celebration of life."},{"Title":"Heart of a Woman","review":"I loved this book. It didn't read like you would expect an autobiography to.

Using Literature in the Secondary Content Classroom","review":"As teachers rush toward their academic goals, the pleasure of learning is often forgotten or regulated to last place. Richardson shows that read-alouds bring reading from a &quot;have to&quot; chore to a &quot;want to&quot; experience. Read It Aloud! is a short easy book to read with many good ideas. The book encourages teachers to think about how to bring a variety of literature into the classroom without losing class time. Perhaps more importantly, it emphasizes helping students connect the classroom experience with the everyday world. Richardson gives four principles for selecting read-alouds: (1) Selection should &quot;tie reading to pleasure, not pain&quot; (Chandler,l997). (2) Selection should encourage discussion and application of content material. (3) Selection should make the content &quot;come alive.&quot; (4) Selection should encourage further reading and inquiry. Richardson encourages teachers to use a variety of genres that the teacher personally enjoys. The book includes principles for selecting, locating, and using great &quot;read-alouds.&quot; The author emphasizes that reading aloud spreads the joy of reading. High school teachers should want to share the pleasure of reading with their students, showing them the connection between content topics and pleasure reading. Remember everyone enjoys having someone read to them."},{"Title":"On bended knee: The press and the Reagan presidency","review":"ON BENDED KNEE: THE PRESS AND THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY is (now) a historical snapshot and a thorough analysis of that emerging picture. The focus of attention is upon the exact relationship between (not surprisingly) the press apparatus of the Reagan Administration and the press itself. And his conclusion -- that Reagan faced a press that rarely even thought about trying to draw blood -- is something that any Reagan supporter would find hard to argue. After all, author Mark Hertsgaard even gets some quotes from Reagan Administration officials who basically agree with his argument.ON BENDED KNEE was published in 1988 (the book mentions the on-going Presidential campaign of that year, but seems blissfully unaware of its conclusion), and the main feature separating this political book from political books of today is that there appears to have been actual research put into it. While some modern books seem content to rest their conclusions on the backs of half-remembered interviews on CNN or from rumors they gleamed off the Internets, Hertsgaard interviewed over 175 persons. Persons from both the press and the Reagan Administration.It's these interviews that drive the book. Hertsgaard's technique is to proceed chronologically, letting the quotes build up an individual story, and then inserting his own analysis to show how these specific events fall into an overall pattern. Hertsgaard spends time analyzing both the construction/distribution of the Reagan \\"message\\" and how that message was parsed by the media. The pattern seems eerily similar to the post-9/11 coverage of today's government and those parallels will seem obvious and ominous.I found this to be a very convincing argument. Hertsgaard obviously has a point of view (negative on both the Reagan policies and on the press coverage they received), but he's very logical and meticulous in laying out his case. People looking for how the Reagan people played puppet-master with the press may be disappointed, as the overwhelming attention is placed on the self-censorship that took place within the press itself with little need of any influence from the Administration. However, he does take some time to show how the Reagan Public Relations circle manipulated news and images to place their man in the best light possible.It's interesting to read about the birth of many awful aspects of the media which were new at the time, but which are now depressingly ever-present. The author looks at the Presidential Election of 1984 and points out how the media focused more attention on the horse-race, on the latest polls and on the question of who will win at the expense of covering where each candidate actually stood on the issues and whether those positions were wise or foolish. Hertsgaard correctly points out how such attention on trivia rather than issues does a disservice to the audience and, ultimately, the politicians themselves.Many of the book's subjects are still hot topics of political conversation today. The blurring of news and entertainment. The fact that more news outlets are owned by fewer and fewer companies and individuals. The timidity of a press, terrified at the thought of doing anything that might be considered \\"liberal\\". Still important issues, this is where many of them had their beginnings.Unfortunately, such reporting is commonplace nowadays. I'd love to see a follow-up from Hertsgaard written today, analyzing the trends he first noted here. It would probably be a depressing and predictable read, but it would have to be an important one. ON BENDED KNEE may be discussing events of twenty years ago, but the points he raises still have resonance today."},{"Title":"On bended knee: The press and the Reagan presidency","review":"The cover of this book has a picture of President Reagan in front of about 10 reporters. This is about the same ratio of press verse political coverage in the book itself. This book was recommend or mentioned in a number of other books I have read covering the Reagan Presidency or how the media deal with the White House. Thus, I thought it would be an interesting book on how the Reagan image machine worked. I just came away a bit disappointed because of the heavy amount of reporting on the press. I guess I thought the book would be more balanced and have a deeper look at what the Reagan administration did with the press and how they put out information to the press. Basically, I wanted to know more details on how the political people control the media.If you are part of the population that does not believe in the \\"Liberal Media\\" chant so many conservatives have been going on about for years then this book will add many new examples to your cocktail party debates. This book is a great pre book to Alterman's \\"What Liberal Media\\" The authors really dig into how the press viewed partisan or the appearance of partisan coverage during the 80's. It almost came across like most of the press where more worried about how there paper was viewed by the White House image team then by the readers. The author gave example after example and quotes galore from media types that talked about how stories were rewritten or pushed further back in the paper due to the subjects. There were also some very interesting examples about how the White House used terrorism and the Middle East to first sell American involvement and then excuse American withdrawals. It seemed to me that the current White House may be using some of these same tactics.One last comment on the book. I do not know if I can correctly explain this, but this author had a very dense way of writing. It almost seams as though you need to take about twice as long as you normally would to get through a chapter. It was not dull nor wooden. It just seemed to take more energy yet I did not come away thinking this was a great book. Maybe it is just me. Anyway the book is interesting and gives you a lot of nice information about the press and the Reagan Administration. If you are at all interested in either the media or Reagan then I bet you will enjoy this book. I would warn you though that the author does not sugar coat the truth and he has no problem pointing out Reagan's mistakes or weaknesses. If you are a fan of Ron then you may be aggravated with many pages."},{"Title":"On bended knee: The press and the Reagan presidency","review":"This is one of the best books ever written about the modern news media"},{"Title":"On bended knee: The press and the Reagan presidency","review":"When I first saw this book, I was intrigued by the hypothesis but once I got into it, I couldn't help but notice the book is mostly just out-of-context quotes blended with some conspiracy theories, and loaded with venom. Hertsgaard is certainly unqualified to judge the press because he is so committed to his agenda it clouds his mind.Even though he's short on facts and lacks a basic knowledge of how things work at the networks and big newspapers, Hertsgaard obviously spent a lot of time interviewing people and there are some interesting quotes from people in the press and in the reagan administration. If you don't mind reading every few paragraphs how evil and stupid Ronald Reagan was you can get some interesting quotes from people."},{"Title":"Bird Of Prey (Don Pendleton's Mack Bolan : Stony Man)","review":"I've read a lot of Mack Bolan books over the years - most of the Executioner and Stony man series, and this BOLAN proved to be a typical quick read that is full of \\"shoot em up\\" action. If you've read others in this series, this one will not disappoint. I prefer these \\"thicker\\" Bolans over the Executioner books because there is usually more of a story associated with the action.Not a challenging, suspenseful literary novel by any stretch, but a good way to pass some time and be entertained."},{"Title":"The Lilac Fairy Book","review":"In the late 19th century, historian, scholar, and anthropologist, Andrew Lang, began publishing collections of fairy tales from around the world. The first volume was \`The Blue Fairy Book' published in 1887. Lang was not a true ethnologist, like the German Brothers Grimm. He was far more the \`translator' than collector of tales from the source, stories transcribed from being told by people to whom the tales were passed down by word of mouth. In fact, many stories in his first volume, such as Rumpelstiltskin; Snow White; Sleeping Beauty; Cinderella; and Hansel and Gretel were translated from Grimm's books of fairy tales. Some of his \`fairy tales' were even \`copied from relatively recent fantasy fiction, such as A Voyage to Lilliput, the first of the four episodes in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.My inspiration for commenting Lang's series of fairy tale books is for the sheer quantity of tales, the wonderful woodcut illustrations, some few of which may have become almost as popular as the tales (although not quite in the same league as Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for Lewis Carroll's great fantasies), and the fact that I had these when I was young.With twelve of these books, with between 30 and 36 stories in each book, this gives one about 400 different stories. If I were to recommend anything as standard equipment at a grandparents' house, it would be a complete set of these books.Needless to say, there are a few \`warnings' to accompany books assembled over 100 years ago. You will encounter a fair number of words with which even an adult may be unfamiliar, let alone a five year old. For example, on the second page of The Princess Mayblossom in The Red Fairy Book, a character puts sulfur in a witch's porridge. This requires at least three explanations. What is sulfur, what is porridge, and why is sulfur in porridge such a bad thing. More difficult still is when a prince entered the town on a white horse which \`pranced and caracoled to the sound of the trumpets'. In 19th century London, caracoling (making half turns to the right and the left) was probably as common and as well known as \`stepping on the gas' is today. But, if you're a grandparent, that's half the fun, explaining new words and ideas to the young-uns.There is another \`danger' which may require just a bit more explanation, although in today's world of crime dramas on TV, I'm not sure that most kids are already totally immune to being shocked by death and dead bodies. In these stories, lots of people and creatures get killed in very unpleasant ways, and lots of very good people and creatures suffer in very unpleasant ways. It's ironic that the critics in Lang's own time felt the stories were 'unreality, brutality, and escapism to be harmful for young readers, while holding that such stories were beneath the serious consideration of those of mature age'. The success of a whole library of Walt Disney feature length cartoons based on these stories is a testament to how well they work with children. But do be warned, Uncle Walt did clean things up a bit. Lang's versions hold back on very little that was ugly and unpleasant in some of these stories.The down side to the great quantity of stories is that even when some come from very different parts of the world, there is a remarkable amount of overlap in theme, plot, and characters. But by the time you get to another story of a beautiful young girl mistreated by a stepmother, it will have been several month since you read Cinderella or the Little Glass Slipper in The Blue Fairy Book. The other side of the coin is that you can play the game of trying to recall what that other story was with a similar theme.There is one very big word of caution about buying these books through Amazon or a similar on line outlet. I stopped counting when I got to twelve different editions of The Blue Fairy Book, or a volume including several of these books. Not all of these editions have the original woodcuts and even worse, not all have a table of contents and introduction. The one publisher which has all twelve volumes is by Dover. Other publishers, such as Flying Chipmunk Publishing (yes, that's it's name) also have all the original illustrations, table of contents, and introduction, but I'm not certain that publisher has all twelve volumes. Dover most certainly does, as I just bought all twelve of them from Amazon.While I suspect these stories may have been \`old hat' for quite some time, it may be that with the popularity of Lord of the Rings, the Narnia stories, and the Harry Potter stories, all of which have their share of suffering and death, that these may be in for a revival. Again, the main attraction is that for relatively little money and space, Grammy and Grandad get a great resource for bonding with children."},{"Title":"The Lilac Fairy Book","review":"This particular sample of Lang's collections is another treasure, as always, expanding beyond the more well-known stories (although they are certainly not ignored!) to Arthurian legends and Indian tales.

This book contains tales written by others, but which Lang collected. He says he is much like Adam, who Mark Twain said superintended the work in the Garden of Eden, while Eve did the work. Actually, he corrects himself, the tales were originally not written, they preceded writing. They are tales invented by ancient, probably Egyptian grandmothers who told the stories to their grandchildren. The Greek Homer knew the stories and gathered them together and made up his book \\"Odyssey\\" out of many of them. Shakespeare also used these stories for his plays. People who invent new fairy tales, he writes, never succeed. The stories in this volume come from Asia, Ireland, Portugal, and other countries. Most of them were collected and translated by Mrs. Lang."},{"Title":"The Lilac Fairy Book","review":"I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie.

I highly recommned it as a good primer!"},{"Title":"A Search for the Truth","review":"There is an interesting chronology that is worth discussing here. The mid-sixties was a period later designated as the opening salvo of several waves of spiritual energy that would lead up to a quantum leap of consciousness yet to happen in the beginning of the twenty-first century, the so-called New Earth. A speed-up of time began which got an extra boost every decade.The most visible contenders at the starting gate were Ruth Montgomery, Jane Roberts, Mark Prophet and Helen Schucman (whose ACIM work took about 10 years and was published in 1975)A lesser known trumpet from the UK, Ruth White, was the channel for Gildas Communicates. Each of these authors brought dramatically new and fresh channeled material to public attention.Though Gift of Prophecy was written in 1965, it was primarily a book of reporting that would convince NY publishers of the author's potential to deliver metaphysical content.This rather neglected lesser-known Search for Truth from Ruth in 1967 is an introduction to what later developed into a rather daring and glamorous career as a metaphysical writer and channel. In this work, subtitled \\"A noted reporter discloses her own remarkable experiences in the field of psychic phenomena and finds a new dimension of life--and hope--for all\\" Ruth confides her early skepticism. She had actually written debunking material that she intended to publish, but was told by spirit not to. An interview she conducted with Arthur Fold led her to try her hand, quite successfully, at automatic writing. The rest is history, her guides have been feeding her material ever since.The book is 285pp and was published by William Morrow and Co., NYTable of ContentsA born skepticA doubter's dilemmaThe pencil writesA spirit goes house-huntingMy psychic friendsThe golden doorTrue time existsThe selfishness of griefAn eagle on his shoulderA do-it-yourself lessonThe man in the next roomLove one anotherWalk with GodMystery stories of the nightThe meaning of ChristmasA spirit's nose for newsThe ancient wisdomVoices and visitations\\"Intimations of Immortality\\"This wonderful psychic worldGlossaryAfter this work in 1967 came Here and Hereafter in 1968 followed by more than a dozen other popular titles spanning many metaphysical topics. Ruth had a name-recognition and credibility advantage of being a nationally syndicated columnist and was clearly the leading \\"New Age\\" author to break ground in introducing channeled material to the masses. Her material is still uplifting and of educational value to this day. Without her advance preparation the channels that followed would have had a much harder time gaining the acceptance momentum that she provided."},{"Title":"A Search for the Truth","review":"This is one of my favorite Ruth Montgomery books. She is an award-winning, entertaining, easy to read, and engrossing author.This book is about her beginning path in the exploration of the metaphysical world. She visited psychics of all kinds with the intention of writing a debunking article for the newspaper she worked for back then. She was well-versed as a journalist in the political arena prior to her exploration of this field and covered the terms of four presidents.Amazingly enough, she became a convert, and from this book forward writes about different aspects of the healing world. Every book she writes is just awesome. My other favorites are Born to Heal (the story of Bill Gray) and A World Beyond (after Bill Gray dies, she channels him through the process of automatic writing. They write a book about what happens on the other side after we die.)If you are a non-believer, this may help you understand the other \\"weird\\" people out there. Ruth does her research and checks out every fact she can when she writes."},{"Title":"A Search for the Truth","review":"A good book for those who are open minded.

Now that I am nearing 50 hard-won years I wanted to know if I had \\"slowed down\\" to a measurable degree. I had always done well on standardised tests in school (PSAT, ACT, GRE), plus I had qualified for both MENSA and INTERTEL when much younger. So I took all four tests. The results were in the range that the more formal tests always yielded (except that the first was a little low- 119, 142, 163, 140.) On the basis of this I have to assume that, 1) these tests compare favorably with the formal, professionally administered versions, and 2) no, I don't really seem to have lost much of my old ability. On that basis I recommend them._As for the tests themselves they include \\"odd one out\\" problems, language tests, calculation, and pattern logic. They test your powers of deduction, reasoning, and innovation. All the tests are timed- and that is an important factor in their accuracy._There is a section describing the MENSA Society (founded at Oxford in 1946) and giving contact addresses for chapters in the UK, Australia, Canada, the USA (obsolete), and International.One word of caution- if you qualify, don't let it go to your head. Nothing is more irritating than an intelligent person that thinks that their uninformed opinion is consistently infallible. You can be quite conventionally intelligent, yet extremely ignorant in an almost infinite number of areas. Remember Socrate's words: \\"I know that I don't know.\\" Now that is intelligent AND wise..."},{"Title":"Test Your IQ (Test Your Intelligence) (Bk. 2)","review":"The book has 10 tests with 40 questions each, and with a time limit of 90 min. While I by no means am an expert in IQ books, I think this book is a little annoying. I am not sure that the tests have been really standardized, and there is no chart for calculating an IQ apart from a relative scale. In general I do not think that the tests appear to be 'culture fair'. People who do not have English as first language can forget about solving the questions where English is needed. All together the tests and questions are varied, mistake-free and well thought, but I think that the average person would find other books more interesting. This book is for people who as 'sport' has IQ testing and the authors, well-known IQ writers, must also be said to belong to that category. The questions are certainly challenging and in the upper end of what one finds in IQ test books. I recommend the book but it is not for the beginner."},{"Title":"Test Your IQ (Test Your Intelligence) (Bk. 2)","review":"As a curent MENSA member, I find this book completely irritating and inaccurate!

The book is well written and provides examples from around the world! ^_^"},{"Title":"Strategy in the Contemporary World: An Introduction to Strategic Studies","review":"This introductory textbook of strategic studies covers four main themes: the enduring issues of strategy, the evolution of joint warfare, twentieth-century theories, and contemporary issues of grand strategy. The book is written from the perspective of \`Western security interests', but even so, studying strategy helps us to think clearly about the ways in which states and others use organised force for political ends.The writers all refute technological determinism: new weapons - artillery in World War One, tanks in World War Two, guided missiles in the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, precision bombing and superior ground force technology in the Gulf War - were none of them unbeatable. They show that the basic principles of conducting land warfare have hardly changed in the last hundred years. Armies need to combine their arms, defend in depth, keep large reserves, use cover and concealment, and integrate movement and suppressive fire. In particular, Stephen Biddle shows that, contrary to many claims, the USAF air war in the Gulf did not destroy all the Iraqi armour. Possibly 4,100 armoured vehicles later fought the US ground forces, but they did not fight according to the basic principles, so they were beaten.However, the editors err in dividing what they call \`20th-century theories' - deterrence, arms control, terrorism and \`irregular warfare' (national liberation struggles) - from the \`contemporary issues' of technology, weapons of mass destruction, and humanitarian intervention. These are all still live issues. Further, the editors could have presented them in the livelier form of debates.As with any collection of pieces by many hands, the quality is uneven, but generally the better essays are more grounded in the realities of 20th-century military history. The worse ones try to discuss, for instance, the causes of war in terms of biology or psychology. As a rule, strikingly individual expressions of one person's views, like Colin Gray's Modern Strategy, or Bernard Brodie's War and Politics, provoke more thought than compilation textbooks"},{"Title":"Strategy in the Contemporary World: An Introduction to Strategic Studies","review":"The book is written very well, the organization is easy to follow.

However, for some of the best first-person storytelling from the Civil War era, this is a treat. Read it again and it rates 5 stars."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"When I first saw this book I was very excited about its possibilities and the prospect of a great and enlightening read. I have been a student of the Civil War for many years and hoped that this would be a star performer of the documentation of the conflict.Whenever I set about a new work on the subject, I try to stay as objective as possible, but this book tried my patience from the start. There were a lot of first hand accounts and primary sources cited in the work and this offered some positive points, at least at first. This unfortunately, was the high point for the book.From the beginning, it read like a first draft of a technical report with a very rough and confusing narrative. Even people who know the battle well have a hard time following the disjointed nature of the story. There was no analysis offered, just a dry account of one piece of action after another.The maps - which appear to be hand drawn over the basic National Park Battlefield map - are not well executed and alas, not very useful.I am afraid that I could not recommend this work when there are so many other well written, organized and worthwhile studies in existence."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"the way that Mr. Priest's book is written, allows you to follow the war through the eyes of the soldiers who fought there.

It would be very helpful if it was available on the Kindle.Thanks...."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"This book focuses on the experiences of individuals and regimental sized units, and describes them in great detail. Generally, the various battlefield locations (East Woods, Middle Bridge, etc.) are described in a well organized manner, geographically and in time line. It is an excellent example of war history from the individual point of view. One small detraction is the maps. Unlike many books there are plenty of them, but they are somewhat hard to follow, and too frequently adjacent text refers to units that are not to be found on the maps. Overall, however, this book gives an excellent feel for the horror of this most terrible one day battle in the War."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"I've read Mr Priest's book twice and I think it's the best account on the Battle of Antietam that I've read. Mr Priest drawing from quite a bit of untapped sources presents this battle from the soldier's perspective. It's as close to being there if you weren't. I've read Sear's book Landscape Turned Red and I don't think it was quite as good. His book deals with more of the General's and political ramifications as well as the broad outline of the battle. In the end, if you like Francis O'Reilly, Gordan Rhea, and Peter Cozzens, then this book's for you. Hats off to Mr Priest."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"I am not an expert on the Civil War much less on the battle of Antietam but as a read about the substance of battle for the muscat-holding soldier in any Civil War engagement, Priest's book is about as good as is available. The wealth of primary sources-letters, diaries,newspaper articles,anything that illuminates this battle from the viewpoint of the average soldier, is brought into his examination. The result is a compilation of incidents that gives essence to the terror and, in modern view, numbing bravery of the action's soldiers were ordered to undertake as a matter of course-not as something only asked under extraordinary circumstances. The reader must ponder the nature of the glue that bound men to do things that any sane person would find impossible-yet the impossible was normally asked and just as normally undertaken. Antietem: A Soldier's Battle should be read by any person unfamiliar with the Civil War as the first book they read because it will give the reader a grasp of the nature of the conflict from the receiving end of muscat volleys and cannonballs in full sight bouncing along the ground ready to shatter any living creature in its path. I had not encountered any book from any period of history that cast any light on the subject of animals in war-specifically the horses that pulled the artillery or provided transport for officers. Again, Priest's book was very illuminating in these dark corners of often forgotten history. Read this book-you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"Wether you are a student of the battle or just a &quot;weekend warrior&quot; this book is a must if the reader wishes to grasp the scope of the battle and a feeling of &quot;being there&quot;. Mr. Priest uses a combination of first hand accounts and excellent maps to relate a minute by minute story of the battle. This is the only book I have read that gave me a true understanding of the sequence of different actions that made up the entire battle. Mr. Priest demonstrates a &quot;second to none&quot; knowledge of this conflict"},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"One message that rings clear from reading this book is that Antietam was not a well planned battle, and the reader certainly gets that impression from reading about the confusion through diaries and letters of what the ordinary grunts in the field had to go through. The descriptions are quite vivid and let the reader get a true feel for what it must have been like on the battlefield of Antietam during those fateful days. This is a book you'll have a real hard time putting down until you've finished it."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"Micheal Priest has taken a new look at covering the battle of Antietam. Priest likes to chronologically present the fighting from each army from their perspective as the action unfolds. Priest may present the Confederate views and manuvers from the West Woods while the next paragraph may contain Union movements from the East Woods. Priest takes the entire battle beginning to end and presents it in a unique way often not seen in books on the subject. The details of the fighting and graphic accounts of the battle is excellent and at times very descriptive. This book is not an ordinary account of the battle. It simply captures the immediate action without covering the politics or reasons as to why Lee invaded Maryland or why McClellan refused to follow Lee after the conflict. I was impressed with the quick, &quot;jump into the middle of the action&quot; style Priest presented in this rare format. Priest used many maps to help explain the regimental movements throughout the book although I found them ill drawn and confusing at times. Priest style of jumping from one event to another during a phase of the battle could be a bit twisting upon the reader and one should know that this book may not be for those who never read about the battle before. I recommend this book for the more experienced person of knowledge concering this battle as a beginner or novice may be a bit overwhelmed or distracted by a different presentation."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, the more I read the less I enjoyed it. In the end, I cannot recommend it.The idea behind the book is to describe the battle from the perspective of the soldier. Thus the book dispenses with the usual discussion of strategy and situation and jumps into the soldiers' descriptions. While this is a noble concept, Priest does a poor job in tying all together. What you end up with is a kaleidoscope of images that convey an exaggerated feel for the battle with little real understanding. If you are not thoroughly familiar with the battle, you will have a hard time wading through this book.The first chapter dealing with the incidents prior to the battle was excellent. Priest did a great job of knitting together some well known first hand accounts (such as Private David Thompson's account published in Battles and Leaders) as well as some obscure sources to paint a palpable scene of fear and apprehension. However, like the battle, the subsequent chapters grind on, wearing the reader down, until by the end, the reader, like the poor soldiers in the book, has little energy to finish.Antietam was a confusing battle with many attacks and counterattacks. To understand the tactical ebb and flow requires good maps showing the situation over time. Priest attempts to do this with many maps interspersed through the book. Unfortunately the maps are terrible. In the text he will often refer to a particular map, and then proceed to describe a unit or location that is not on that map. Thus one has to flip back and forth through previous maps to try to find the location or unit cited.In many instances he uses geographical references such as Millers Cornfield, or the \\"cornfield near Mummas\\", or a \\"swale by Dunker Church.\\" However, none of these features are marked on the maps. For example, none of the maps indicates where Miller's famous cornfield was. The maps show various symbols to represent fields, but there is no key. If I did not already know the locations of these features from previous study and visits to the battlefield, I would have been hopelessly lost.It seems that to maintain purity, Priest relied on the same the references the troops used to locate themselves as described in their memoirs. After all, most of them did not have maps and few knew exactly where they were. But it is the job of the historian to hunt down the clues and put together a cogent picture. Here is where Priest lets us down.Because he relies on soldier's accounts, Priest seems to adopt their hyperbolic terminology. According to Priest, every volley \\"caused men to fall like windrows.\\" Every shell explosion created \\"great gaps.\\" There are at least ten references to \\"bloated corpses\\". Such language may be acceptable in letters home and in personal memoirs, but does little to convey the actual events. For example, just how effective was a line of muskets fired in volley fire? To believe this book, the weapons of the civil war were so deadly, that soldiers had to be either stupid or suicidal to fight the way they did.Priest relied on many sources with copious footnotes, yet on the few occasions where I checked the source of a particular comment, I noticed that he had cited other secondary sources. There are a few errors in the book, particularly in the order of battle where he claims that one of the NC regiments had 700 men. That's the brigade total, not the regimental total.In conclusion, I can only recommend this book to the dedicated civil war historian that might extract a gem or two that lies within the broad rough. Casual readers or beginning students of the war must look elsewhere for a definitive treatment."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"Priest has written a meticulous journal of America's bloodiest day of war from as seen from the eyes of those who earned that title for the Battle of Anteitam.This book portrays the Civil War in all of its horror. Glory is left on the parade ground as those who witnessed and received the anonymous carnage of the cannon, grape and cannister, as well as the more intimate destruction of the infantry ball, tell of their experiences in minute by minute accounts from around the battlefield. The compellation and writing is so good that the fear and horror of those waiting in the ranks to charge or receive the attention of their enemies dominates the book.For anyone looking to read of what it was &quot;like&quot; in Civil War battle, this book is about the best.I would recommend that the reader first take a standard account of the battle, such as Sears' &quot;Landscape Turned Red.&quot; Priest does not attempt to portray strategy, the situation that led both armies to Anteitam or the macinations of much of anyone above the rank of Colonel. Not a criticism, since he is not attempting to cover the whole battle, but it may leave the uninitiated at a loss to understand why men are engaged in places like the East Woods, Bloody Lane or Lower Bridge."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"The American Civil War was unprecedented in the sustained ferocity and magnitude of casualties endured over a four-year period. Even in the ACW, Antietam earned unique respect. At reunions after the war, even old veterans of Gettysburg bowed in deference to the veterans of Antietam. Killed and wounded in one day at Antietam totaled more than all those killed in the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Mexican War and Spanish American War combined. Statistics alone do not even begin to tell the story - the violence, the horror, the effect on the participants and the nation's collective psyche. Priest's great book helps us to understand, on a more personal level, the events that transpired on the rolling farmland between Antietam Creek and the town of Sharpsburg on September 17, 1862. As the two great armies prepared for conflict, gradually collecting on opposite sides of the meandering creek, from South Mountain, Boonsboro, Harper's Ferry and Sheperdstown, and then the red day itself dawns, Priest leads us on using the words of the participants. The soldiers who fought, unfortunate souls who descended for what must have seemed an eternity into a nightmare realm, newspaper correspondents, civilians caught in the fray, nurses, all give testament to the human carnage. The book is at times as dis-jointed as McClellan's attack, but this is not a standard historical treatment nor is it approachable subject matter. The opposing armies advanced and retreated so many times through Miller's cornfield, leaving dead and dying behind with every attack and counter-attack, that afterwards no man could say for sure &quot;how many?&quot; When we visit Antietam Battlefield now and try to understand the conduct of the battle, we have Priest's great work to help us try to understand what it must have been like to be there, on that red day. This book is a rare combination of first rate historical research and a creative, intelligent presentation approach. A model for future like efforts."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. Prior to visiting the Antietam battlefield, I read Sear's Landscape Turned Red to get an overview. But then after seeing the battlefield I was eager to read more. Priest's book was just what I wanted. It is a compilation of first person accounts that puts you right in the middle of the action. You'll feel the shells and bullets flying all around. I've now read this book at least ten times, learning and understanding more with each read. I've also recently revisited the battlefield to help me put everything together."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"I &quot;fought&quot; (and won :) the battle of Antietam in junior high as part of my American history class so this battle has always been particularly interesting to me. It is a shame that it is usually lost among some of the more famous battles of the Civil War (like nearby Gettysburg) in most histories becase it wasn't stratigically important. It was the bloodiest single day of the war and this book brings home the true horror of battle and the incredible heroism of the combatants in a very well researched, hour by hour account of the fighting. This book is put together from the individual accounts of the soldiers on the ground placed into the framework of the overall battle. In reading this book I was constantly amazed at the bravery and stamina exhibited by the farmboys and shop clerks on both sides throughout the course of the battle. This isn't a casual read. The author is long on detail and lets the accounts of the soldiers provide the drama. Oh, and if you are ever out in western Maryland go see the battlefield (and take this book). There is no development out there and the area isn't much changed from 150 years ago. If you see it after reading this book I can guarentee that you will get chills up your spine looking out over the cornfield and realizing that you could walk its length by only stepping on the bodies of the fallen."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"In \\"Antietam: The Soldiers' Battle,\\" author John Michael Priest tells the story of the American Civil War's bloodiest day using a compilation of eyewitness accounts. The book also includes no less than 72 sketch maps of the battle. Between the plentiful maps and the chronologically-arranged accounts, the reader can easily follow the ebb and flow of the battle.The book contains surprises, such as a mention of Gen. Robert E. Lee harassing Confederate stragglers, the soldiers' nearly universal dislike of shelling and occasional acts of cowardice or outrageous bravery. It's astonishing how close together opposing units were when they fired at one another. The author claims that Confederate defenders of the Bloody Lane fired at Max Weber's Union brigade at a range of 60 feet!My favorite vignette concerns the half-crazed Swedish commander of the 20th New York Regiment, Col. Von Vegesack. When a Maine colonel helpfully suggested that the 20th's colors be lowered because they were drawing too much Rebel fire, Vegesack ranted, \\"Let them wave. They are our glory.\\"While many historians write about Antietam in broad strokes, this book gets into the details. For example, every student of the battle knows that Gen. John Sedgwick's Union division got ambushed and cut to pieces in the West Woods. Priest's book shows exactly how this disaster unfolded and where each unit was positioned. Most historians criticize the clumsy commitment of Col. William Irwin's VI Corps Union brigade. Yet, this unit -- which included the 20th NY -- defeated a Confederate thrust that threatened to retake Bloody Lane.It's easy for armchair strategists to say that the Union commanders should have done this or the Rebel commanders should have done that. But, the general impression from reading this book is how difficult it must have been to impose any sort of control on a large battle like Antietam. This book should serve as a handy and useful reference for students of the battle."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"Terrific book. Unique in its approach of using first person accounts to describe in detail one of the most horrific fights of the ACW. Priest puts you in the thick of the action. Contains numerous great maps as well.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys military history, and consider it one of the best written on the Civil War."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for the serious Civil War buff interested in Antietam. Priest gives you the battle from the perspective of those who fought it, in the actual chronology of the battle.The many maps are some of the most detailed I have ever seen of the battlefield - you can locate within a few feet where a particular company stoodat a particular time. In addition, Priest simply tells what happened - again, in great detail. He thankfully does not editorialize or moralize (unlike Sears in &quot;Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam&quot;). This book ranks up there with &quot;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War&quot; by Johnson and Buel as one of the truly great, unbiased works about Antietam....Priest has also written a book on the few days preceeding Antietam, called, &quot;Before Antietam: The Battle for South Mountain&quot; - another gem!"},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer that Priest's book works best with a general Antietam book like Sears's. My approach to understanding Antietam was to (1) read Sears's Landscape Turned Red; (2) visit the battlefield (this is key to understanding the numerous references in Priest's book to &quot;Mumma's swale,&quot; &quot;the high ground 600 yards south of the Dunker Church,&quot; etc.--with a mental picture everything fits together better); (3) buy a topographic battlefield map, such as the one by Trailhead Graphics (for sale at the Battlefield's Visitor Center); and (4) read this book. My only criticism of the maps is the lack of a small-scale &quot;finder&quot; map that shows the battlefield and the area around Sharpsburg. As for the author's large-scale &quot;handdrawn&quot; maps, I found them very useful, and they are placed well, usually never more than a page or two from the action they refer to (I read the original 1992 edition, so I'm not sure if the maps are placed as well in this 1994 edition from a different publisher). As for the text, it's wonderful: well edited and even well indexed. The emphasis on the more &quot;minor&quot; actions on September 17, 1862 that a more general book would breeze over or ignore because of space limitations is appreciated."},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"I enjoyed this author's other book 'Before Antietam: The Battle of South Mountain' so much that I had to read this book as well and I was not disappointed. I found it hard to compare this book with Stephen Sear's book 'Landscape turned Red' as I enjoyed that book just as much if not more. The two authors present this battle in their own way and I would not say one book was better than the other, I'd leave that to the individual to decide. This is a still a well researched and well written book, the narrative flowed along gracefully with numerous maps to assist the reader in locating each action and the flow of the battle. The only criticism which I found in this book as well as his other was the standard of his maps, I think they could have been better. Other than that this is a great book of a terrible battle, buy it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Antietam : The Soldiers' Battle","review":"John Michael Priest \\" Antietam: The Soldier's Battle\\" is like deja vu. The Minnie balls are fast and thick and the double canister cut down your men. Of the 226 men you led into the cornfield (1st Texas) that warm day of 17th of Sept 1862, only 40 men came out.This book reads just like you were there. AWESOME and highly reccomended.

I screen for two things--books that are too &quot;spiritual&quot; and books that are too &quot;Christian&quot; (&quot;Christological,&quot; to be more precise). As far as spirituality goes, I feel fully cabable of having my own spiritual or devotional response to the Psalms. I don't need books to tell me how to feel. (One of the truly amazing things about the Psalms is that they evoke different responses every time one reads them.) Nor do I need books that explain away the uglier aspects of the psalms, such as the powerful vengeance motif found in Psalm 137:8,9 (&quot;Happy are those who pay you [Babylon] back for what you have done to us--who take your babies and smash them against a rock.&quot;) Similarly, while I enjoy hearing psalms read in church and understand that part of what Christians know and believe about Jesus Christ is based on the way the first Christians read and understood the Psalms, I do not have a compelling need to see every verse of every psalm as a one-way vector pointing to Christ.Sarna's book consists of a short introduction (20 pages) and commentary on a mere ten psalms (1, 8, 19, 15, 24, 30, 48, 82, 93, and 94). But as limited as this selection is, Sarna is able to introduce us to a good range of biblical themes and to equip us to continue our exploration of the Psalms on our own. Sarna is an excellent biblical scholar and the author of the Genesis and Exodus volumes in the Jewish Publication Society's Torah Commentary Series. He appreciates the psalms as ancient texts that share traits with other writings from the ancient Near East. Any intelligent, open-minded Jew or Christian looking for a way to deepen his or her own experience of reading the psalms need not fear that Sarna has an agenda to dismantle their faith and debunk everything they treasure. The grounding and context that Sarna provides will only enrich your psalm-reading experience.If you have never read the Psalms all the way through, start with this book. It's only 200 pages long (excluding endnotes), but it tells you everything you need to know to get started. Hopefully, one day Sarna will publish commentary on the other one hundred forty Psalms."},{"Title":"On the Book of Psalms: Exploring the Prayers of Ancient Israel","review":"Another reviewer has already described the book's format and brilliance, so I won't do that. But what struck me as unique about this book is how Sarna compares Psalms and pagan equivalents -- that is, how Jews took the old bottles of pagan concepts and figures of speech, but filled them with the new wine of monotheistic theology. For example, Sarna points out that Mesopotamian prayers speak of pagan sun gods as resting at the end of the day, and as a runner traversing heaven and earth. Psalms 19:5-7 similarly describes the sun, but makes it clear that the sun's &quot;running&quot; and &quot;resting&quot; is one of the miracles of God's creation rather than the behavior of an independent sun-god. Reading Sarna, I could almost imagine the lights going on in Hebrew heads as they thought: &quot;Well, it's all very well and good for my sun-worshipping neighbors to say that the sun runs around the sky -- but who created the sun?&quot;"},{"Title":"On the Book of Psalms: Exploring the Prayers of Ancient Israel","review":"I must study ps82.This book was very good conference.Thank you."},{"Title":"On the Book of Psalms: Exploring the Prayers of Ancient Israel","review":"The content is likely written by an expert, but provided commentary on only selected portions of the biblical Psalms book.

But there are potential problems with this method. I will use a representative verse to demonstrate such problems, quoted from the GNB and the more literal New King James Version.The NKJV renders the first part of Romans 1:17 as, &quot;For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith.&quot; Meanwhile, the GNB has, &quot;For the gospel reveals how God puts people right with himself; it is through faith from the beginning to the end.&quot;First, &quot;it&quot; has been changed to &quot;the gospel.&quot; This is probably what &quot;it&quot; is referring to, but God inspired Paul to write a pronoun, not a noun.Second, it is true the Gospel, &quot;reveals how God puts people right with himself.&quot; But, this rewrite misses the emphasis on God's righteousness in this passage. It is because God is righteous, and we are not, that we need the Gospel.Third, &quot;from faith to faith&quot; could be one of the statements Peter was referring to when he said that in Paul's epistles, &quot;are some things hard to understand&quot; (2Peter 3:16). There are several possible interpretations of this phrase. The GNB has chosen from among these and rendered the phrase in such a way that only one of these is possible.Maybe the GNB's interpretation is correct, maybe it isn't. But one would not know the GNB has in fact already interpreted this difficult phrase for its readers unless a more literal version like the NKJV is consulted.So due to its dynamic equivalence style of translation, the GNB significantly alters the text. And worse, it actually interprets the text for its readers. As such, the GNB is more of a commentary on the Bible than a true translation of the Word of God.The above was adapted from my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions.\\" My book contains more on the GNB, along with reviews of over 30 other versions of the Bible."},{"Title":"Good News Bible: English Version- Flex Burgundy","review":"Some folk dislike a bible that is different from the King James Version because they think that it has to be inferior. The truth is that the translators of the KJV knew that they had not produced a perfect translation and that their work would need to be improved in the future. Well here we are, about 300 years after the KJV was first published and we NEED new translations because English has changed so much from its state back in 1611 when the KJV was translated.The Good News Bible is an excellent bible for reading in public and reading in private. It is an accurate translation with numerous 'helps' for a modern bible reader. And What's more, it makes the gospel of Jesus Christ comprehensible. The scriptures speak to us most clearly when they speak to us in our own language. It was that thought that led the translators of the KJV to produce their translation and that thought is still important and still valid for us today. We need a bible in OUR own language; the language that we speak and that we write in today. And with the Good news bible we have that kind of bible.

There will always be skeptics. I say as long as a translation of the Bible does not distort the message of God's Word, if a person reading it can grasp the meaning, then use the translation that is best for you.If we allow the Holy Spirit to speak to us individually and reveal the meaning of what God is saying, then there wouldn't be so much skepticism in the Body of Christ.

It wasn't bad or hard to follow I could just tell it seemed longer. It's a light mystery and has the usual romance that takes to the very end of the book to fill out the question of will he or she or won't he or she and who exactly is going to propose to whom. I love that about it. Kind of predictable but still a pleasure especially because you could be wrong. So is someone after Peregrine? Who is it? The uncle that Judith's father (his brother) never trusted or someone else? Does Peregrine end up deceased? Judith who has a fortune has turned down many suitors. Do any truly appeal to her? What about that cousin? Is he trustworthy or not? If you kidnapped someone to protect them where would you stash them? Is Lord Worth going to propose or is it his brothr Captain Audley? whew....so much to think over in so many pages. Hysterically funny dialogue as usual tho' in a few places.

She wrote Regency romances (in fact, some say she invented the genre) and historicals, as well as mysteries. When you try to pin her down, you'll find one book she wrote, or two or several, outside what you might think is a typical Georgette Heyer novel.Regency Buck, in my opinion, is her greatest Regency romance. The most detailed. You can go crazy with Wikipedia looking up the things she references.I loved this book when I was a teenager. Decades later, I've read it again, and I enjoy it in a different way. It's true, Lord Worth is a bit of a prig (but an honorable man) and Judith Taverner is senselessly wayward, but it's a fun country dance the novel takes you on."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"Liked it until the ending. Heyer weaves a 19th century romance of the Jane Austen type but without the Austen sensibility and subtlety. But, she does create an atmosphere of the 19th century with the drawing rooms and card playing and wealth that pervades the upper classes (with nary a glance at the poorer types). If you want to be wrapped up in upper class English society in the classic story of the rich girl with many suitors trying to determine who to marry, this one fits the bill.Judith and her younger brother Peregrine decide to move to London a year before Judith attains her majority despite their guardian, Worth's, disagreement. Their father has died and left them in the care of Worth, a man they have never met, rather than their uncle because the Uncle is such a bad character. So, the two main men vying for Judith's care are the Uncle's son and Worth himself. But as is typically the case, Worth and Judith to not get along at first because of their strong personalities and Judith finds herself spending more and more time with her cousin.To add to the plot, someone is attempting to murder Peregrine, supposedly so that when he marries Judith the entire inheritance will be all his. This part of the plot is very poorly developed, and Peregrine is so shallow that at times it's hard to care whether someone murders him or not (in fact, there are times when it seems like it might be a good decision. He's a silly boy who imitates all the latest fashions, gambles far more than he has, engages in cock fighting and horse racing but Heyer still tries to maintain his honor (not very successfully from my perspective).The story is predictable--you know who will win out in the end. But this is okay. It's still somewhat engaging to watch how it unfolds. What makes the ending so unsuccessful for me was that it has this typical detective story ending where all the little leads are nicely tied up in this rather anticlimatic scene where the bad guy runs off with Judith and is rescued by the good guy (who also tediously explains what most readers already know)."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"Not all of Heyer's humorous romances set in Regency England follow the same pattern -- there are notably original exceptions like Grand Sophy -- but, like any successful franchise, most of them do adhere to a more or less predictable underlying formula. The most common aspect of this is that whatever irritating and unpleasantly egotistical male the heroine first runs into is going to end up being her Prince Charming. In some of her books, including this one, that outcome is decidedly less convincing than in others.The set-up here is that Miss Judith Tavener and her slightly younger brother, Sir Peregrine (a newly minted baronet following their father's recent death), both being minors -- and both being extremely wealthy -- are traveling by chaise from their provincial home in Yorkshire to London to meet with their guardian, Julian Audley, Earl of Worth. (They've never before visited the capital, which I think unlikely, even though their father was a recluse.) There they find that their father, being rather sloppy about such things, has screwed up his will, putting them in the care and under the authority of his old friend's son, not the father -- a guardian not much older than they are. And that they already are acquainted with Lord Worth, having had an unpleasant couple of encounters with him on the way to town. Worth, as the male lead seems to be in nearly all these books, is fierce, grim, cold, and sardonic, and Judith, being of an independent turn of mind, bridles at being told exactly how to live her life and not being allowed to make her own decisions even in personal matters. She has a cousin, though, the son of her uncle, the Admiral, who takes her part in the continuing tension-filled relationship with her guardian, and so she comes to lean on him. Peregrine comes up against their guardian's uncompromising will a few times, too, but he's much more willing to go along -- as long as he can acquire a typical wealthy young man's playthings, and as long as he is allowed pursue the girl who has taken his fancy. The thing is, if young Peregrine should die without an heir, most of his share of the inheritance will go to his sister -- which someone else appears to be aware of, as well, because attempts begin to be made on his life. Worth has as much as told Judith that he intends to make use of his authority to marry her himself; could he be the one trying to bump off her brother? There really aren't that many viable suspects and most readers will have figured out who the villain is long before the last chapter -- but it isn't the semi-mystery that matters here, of course, but the romance. If you can call it that, because it's difficult to see how Miss Tavener could ever undergo her very abrupt change of heart with regard to her guardian.Another small difference with this story in comparison to most of her others is that a number of real people Heyer brings in as active participants in the plot, including George \\"Beau\\" Brummel, who undertakes to advise Judith on her entrance into Society, and the Duke of Clarence, younger brother of the Prince Regent. Clarence, in fact, pursues Judith with the object of matrimony (his ten bastard children by Mrs. Fitzherbert notwithstanding), and reassures her that there are several people ahead of him in the succession and that she therefore needn't be concerned about the future -- though, of course, he later became king as William IV, and one supposes there could have been a \\"Queen Judith.\\""},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"So, this Heyer is my favourite. Truthfully, I think it one of her best. The characters are hi-def and real, the descriptions are amazing, and at times I could hardly keep from laughing out loud (and several times I did). Heyer is witty and humorous at all times, but this is one of her better efforts. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"Judith Taverner, 20, has finally taken it upon herself to head to London with her brother Sir Peregrine,19, to visit their guardian.

Since she is an heiress, Miss Taverner meets several suitors and her cousin Mr. Taverner.I was a little hesitant to read this book due to the low ratings but I was surely suprised on how captivating it was. It is very descriptive, clean, mysterious and I couldn't put it down until I finished it."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I love GH books and this one is my favorite so far. It starts out a bit slow but it turns out to be a page turner and absolutely hilarious. Some of the scenes and conversations made me laugh out loud if not just grin from ear to ear.

I plan on buying it to add to my collection for future reading enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"The nice thing about the earlier Heyer heroines is that they could be frivolous without apology. The downside is that the plotting of these earlier efforts is often a bit strained. For my money, \\"The Grand Sophy\\" and \\"The Unknown Ajax\\" are the best (albeit essentially the same concept), but almost all of Heyer is worth reading, and \\"Regency Buck\\" is no exception. The battle of wills between Judith and Worth is genuinely entertaining, but what makes this book a must for any Regency fan is that Heyer takes us more in-depth into topics which in later books she merely alludes to--topics such as men's clubs, the sport of boxing, or the mysteries of snuff. Heyer was deeply versed in the social life of her chosen period, and even if she sometimes seems to be showing off what she's learned, she always makes it a pleasure."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"This book is not one of those romance novels with ripping bodices and hot and heavy scenes. The most that happens is they kiss twice. But it's wonderfully sweet and romantic. Judith Taverner is strong willed and loves to go against anything her guardian says. her guardian holds her life in an iron fist. It's wonderful to watch her affection for Julian change through the book until the satisfying end. Every girl should read this book."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"Having gone through a list of Heyer books recently (I can't seem to get enough of them, and I thank Arrow publishing for those nice covers so I can read them in public without people eye-rolling at me), this is definitely one of them that had me thinking for a while.

Love this one!"},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"Although I didn't particularly like this book, I'm giving it five stars, just because giving Georgette Heyer anything less would be sacrilege. That said, this was not a very fun book to read. The mood throughout was quite somber, though there were delightful moments, such as Judith's first meeting with Beau Brummell. His presence in this book was one of the saving graces for me, because I really had to force myself to finish it. I just never warmed up to any of the characters at all. The adventure was interesting enough, but when all is said and done, I just found myself not caring who Judith ended up with, and still not liking Lord Worth very much. Oh well. Heyer is still incomparable!"},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"Just a great read, from start to finish.. You have to laugh out loud at some of the scenes , as they play out in your mind...So reminds me of Jane Austen... Thank you, Mrs. Hayer"},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I loved this book. It is my favorite Georgette Heyer novel (OK, I haven't read them all, but so far this is the best).I found myself caught up in the story from the beginning. Then I found myself wondering, who is the good guy, who is the bad guy, etc. I couldn't decide if I'm suppose to love the Regency Buck or hate him because he might be evil not good.There is a good amount of suspense in the whole book. Heyer does a great job of detailing life in the Regency period for two young adults whose parents have died. They now travel to London and are thrown into society without any great hints of what they should do. I was amazed that Heyer included so much about boxing in her book. I thought this was suppose to be a romance novel, not a boxing and gambling review. Thus you have to love Georgette, she tackles many different venues in her book.The tension throughout the book of who will fall in love with who is great. The tension about who is trying to kill who is even better. Then the question of why would anyone in this book want to poison anyone else keeps you guessing.Yes, that's right, romance, gambling, attempted murder, kidnapping, horse racing, etc. How do you put all that in one book and make it worth the read, easy, just read Regency Buck and you will know why it is a fantastic read and why Georgette Heyer is worth falling in love with.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I love this book, can't remember how many times I have read itI love the relationship between Judith and Lord Worthlove at first sight for him, hatred from her, very beautifullydone by Heyer.

What attracts me is the way she uses her deep and accurate knowledge of the language and mores of early 19th century England to recreate that world in careful but not over-obvious detail.Romances are not usually my cup of tea, but the characters Heyer creates more than make up for the usually formulaic nature of her plots. Whenever I begin to reread one of her books, it's like happening on old friends that I always enjoy visiting and if they are a bit predictable, that's only part of the fun.That said, I have to say that Regency Buck differs from much of the rest of Heyer's work in having a plot that keeps you guessing until practically the end of the book. It is clear that there is a villain at work, but it could be one of two of the main characters. Since either suspect could be the villain, both remain somewhat mysterious, which is quite unusual for Heyer.This book is not my favorite, but it is a good read for those who enjoy the period."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I have had this book on my bookshelf (maybe the original copy) since it's original publication. Having re-read it recently confirms my earlier opinion - Heyer's charachters are amazingly deep and fleshed out, the plots interesting, and the meticulious attention to detail gives this and all her books a gloss which few contemporary imitators can come close to.Ok..there is no sex. Get over that. However, the detailed plot, the rich primary and secondary charachters, all add up to a yummy read.If you can't get enough of them, they are seen again in \\"An Infamous Army\\" a more truly 'historical' novel."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"This isn't one of my favorite books by Heyer. I fell in love with Heyer just two weeks ago when I read \\"Lady of Quality.\\" The other two books I've read (The Corinthian and Cousin Kate) were also good. This book however seems to be lacking some things and full of others. For example there is an abundance of detailed descriptions of boxing matches, cock fights, the Regent's home,etc. I skimmed through pages that I felt were too full of detail and was about to stop reading the book altogether, but I figured I would look at the reviews once again, and these reviews encouraged me to forge ahead. The ending was satisfying, however getting there wasn't as triumphant as it had been in the other three books that I had read previously. This is mainly because there is no real development of the relationship between the two. So far this is my least favorite of Heyer's books, although it is kind of fighting a spot with Cousin Kate. Actually, in \\"Cousin Kate\\" their relationship developed quite clearly. You know what I think it is about this book, we are intentionally led astray. We are given mainly Judith's point of view and aren't given access to the mind of cousin Bernard or guardian Worth - and what snippets we are given about each of the men is misleading. But I guess in Heyer's defense, this is a good mystery story. It is more mystery than romance I feel.OK, I'm done blabbering now."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"The Kindle version of Regency Buck is riddled with flaws. Many missed spaces, extra spaces, oddly hyphenated words, oddly unhyphenated words, and other strange goings-on. It was very distracting to have an error or two per page.If you cherish fluent reading, this is not the version for you.Shame on the publisher/amazon for inflicting this on the unsuspecting reader. Extra care should have been spent on the Kindle formatting conversion. At the very least, someone should have read this version on a Kindle and attempted to fix the formatting flaws.Shame."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I love Georgette Heyer and am quickly reading through her entire works. Most I love and read over and over. There are a few that I just make it through. This is one that I could not even finish. I could not get over Lord Worth's arrogance and overbearing demeaning behavior. And that Judith would fall for him at all! Maybe I missed something. It has been a while since I read this book, but even after all that time, I still felt as if I had to write something. I did not like him and could not watch poor Judith fall in love with him. There are so many other wonderful Georgette Heyer books (try Arabella) that it is a shame to waste any time on this one. Or at the very least, save this one until last to read."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I am a great Heyer fan but this was definitely not one of my favorites. It was not as light hearted as most, at times it was almost depressing. Judith was strong-willed but she never seemed to get the best of her guardian.....not once...and after a while it becomes annoying. One could almost pardon Worth's superiority if it was lightened with a sense of humor, but he seemed devoid of any sense of humor, fun, or adventure. It is a good book of course.......Heyer wrote it.....but not as good as many others."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I have read all of Georgette Heyer's books, and Regency Buck remains my favorite -- after a few dozen readings! The mysterious plot, the wonderful dialogue, the splendid Regency settings, the chemistry between the impulsive heroine and the sardonic hero -- all these add up to a Regency masterpiece and the ultimate rainy night comfort read! (I did not, however, enjoy the audio-book version read by Flo Gibson; she makes all the characters -- even the magnificent Lord Worth -- sound odiously prissy)."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I'm an avid Georgette Heyer fan, &amp; I'll say this of her-among all the Regency authors, she's the best!! With her its not just romance alone, but humour,sarcasm,wit all get combined to produce a novel to captivate the reader. This book tells about the vivacious heroine Judith Taverner &amp; her battle(of wits)against Lord Worth. It also has a little pinch of mystery- who wants Peregrine dead? But if i tell u the answer to that, u won't read it, will you? so i'll keep mum, &amp; go ahead, buy this book. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"Georgette Heyer has no equal when it comes to that wonderful brand of regency fun and laughter. Her research is so true to that age I feel as though I am riding in Hyde Park with the characters, or on the battlefield at Waterloo, Regency Buck lead me to read &quot;An Infamous Army&quot; And many of her other wonderful books. I have had to hunt in second hand book shops, and garage sales for the books I now have. Most are really dogged eared, and faded, and have pages falling out. I can&quot;t tell you how happy, I am to be able to buy NEW - UNREAD - copies..where I am the first reader to leaf thru the pages of these wonderful stories. I hope to be able to purchase all of her works. She was one in a million."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I'm not much of a fan of romance novels, but i must say that Georgette Heyer's books are pretty good. Regency Buck is certainly one of her best. Judith is a strong willed, stubborn girl who's come out for the season with her brother against the judgement of her profoundly disliked, but actually never met, guardian. The very first time she meets him is when her carriage got stuck in a ditch or something while she was on her way to london. They both seem to dislike each other from the moment they meet, although Judith has no idea who he is at first. Regency Buck has lots of fun and humorous scenes that would make you laugh. As always from what i've seen of Heyer's books, the ending is a pleasant surprise and a happy one. It makes you believe in love all over again."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"This book is nowhere near as good as the other Heyer regency romances I've read. Part of Heyer's charm and strength lies in her characters, but in this novel the characters were entirely lacking in sympathetic characteristics. Lord Worth is irritating and completely without humility to the very end, despite the fact that his overbearing and arrogant behavior throughout the novel seems to demand some sort of conciliation on his part in order to endear him to the reader. Judith, who I liked at first, also quickly grated on my nerves (mainly because the novel provided no clear reason for her growing affection for Lord Worth, who is -- as I've already stated -- a toerag). The romance between the two quickly became tiresome and even aggravating. The mystery aspect of the book was also lacking; by the time Lord Worth (who was annoyingly styled as the detective-figure in the mystery of who was targeting Judith's brother Perry) figured it out, I was two steps ahead of him, and I hated him too much to be impressed in any case. Don't bother to pick this one up -- go for \\"The Grand Sophy,\\" \\"Cotillion,\\" or \\"Friday's Child\\" instead."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"Nearly forty years ago I bought this paperback, after staring at it at Woolworth's for several weeks, for the whopping price of 75 cents. There began my love affair with all things Regency, and Georgette Heyer's Regencies in particular.I am knocking a star off this because, though Heyer's writing craft is divine, her two main characters, in retrospect, are not very appealing. Worth is overly arrogant and Judith is childishly temperamental.What I will give is props to Heyer who, with the exception of the immediate Worth/Taverner family connections, used historical figures as filler. What a tremendous amount of research she must have done! From Worcester to Poole to \\"Poodle\\" Byng, she used real people of the Regency Era to flesh out the rest of her tale.Brava, Georgette!"},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"There are less than a handfull of regency romance (with a dash of mystery) authors that could be considered on par with Heyer's stellar writing, but even though she is in a class of her own, if you have never read Heyer before, I beg you not to read this one first - truly, it is better than most regencies out there but is a fair disappointment when compared to many other's of Heyer's works (my very favorite being These Old Shades.)Here, the dialogue is witty but just not AS witty. That said, my biggest annoyance lies with the heroine - immature, petty and judgmental; perhaps we can forgive her these not-pretty qualities as she is a great beauty and a great heiress, a situation which we assume resulted in her being overly pampered and quite sheltered from reality. As well, Heyer obviously endeavors throughout the book to show us that her young heiress is not without conscience and she does grow as the book progresses - she just doesn't grow fast enough for my liking! :)I also feel that too many of the tense situations that occur in the book are due to the much dreaded plot contrivance of \\"the misunderstanding\\". I do hate this contrivance more than any other, and at some point, after enough \\"misunderstandings\\", I as a reader feel like throwing in the towel.And yet, despite these criticisms, you must wonder why I rate this so well as 4 stars? Alas, even a disappointing Heyer (yes, there are maybe one or two others in addition to this one) deserves no poorer a rating, for a dull gem in her collection becomes a shiny diamond amongst drab pebbles when compared to the whole of the genre."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I only recently discovered Georgette Heyer, and have read and loved The Grand Sophy, The Black Sheep, and Faro's Daughter, all of which were witty, funny, and light. Despite its title, which led me to expect it to be similarly light, Regency Buck is comparatively dark and serious. Only at the end did I laugh, after the evil had been overcome. I enjoyed it, and was glad to have read it, but it wasn't what I expected and I prefer the enormously amusing books like The Grand Sophy."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"Regency Buck has one of Heyer's fantastic heroes - The Earl of Worth - with his sardonic humour, clever conversation and social position. The romance between him and Judith Taverner, his ward, is not necessarily the major thrust of the book. Although the slow-burn romance between them is there in the pages, there is a great deal more to keep your attention. In fact, if I had any criticism of the book it is that we are not there when Judith's sentiments change towards her guardian; presumably it's when she spends Christmas at his house with a group of people, but it's left to our imagination; most of the scenes between the two of them are arguments.The setting of the book, in London and Brighton, is of course flawless historically. It's fascinating reading of travel in Regency times - the journey from London to Brighton by curricle taking 4 hours and listing all the posting houses and towns that they travel through. I loved reading the detail of the Royal Palace at Brighton and the Royal Dukes and their behaviour. Many of the characters are historical ones and it set me off reading up on their history - not many novels can get me doing that.The threat to the life of Peregrine Taverner is a side-plot which works reasonably well but it was always clear to me that Lord Worth wasn't trying to kill his ward, and therefore that his cousin had to be responsible. However, it was fun reading the scrapes that Perry gets into, and his enthusiasm over sailing at the end is great fun.It has also been interesting to read An Infamous Army, a sort-of sequel to both this book and Devil's Cub as it contains characters from both. Captain Charles Audley who features in Regency Buck is the hero of An Infamous Army, but it is good to see Lord Worth and Judith after three years of marriage - that the spice to their relationship is still there, and the witticisms of Lord Worth haven't been dimmed. However, Peregrine and Harriet do less well in that book; whether that is a background comment about marrying too young from Heyer I don't know.Regency Buck is certainly worth adding to your Heyer library. It's perhaps not as immediately engaging as some of the other books but it's detail and the strength of the characters are well worth the time spent with them through these pages."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I have read every single Georgette Heyer book, mysteries included, more than once but this has to be my very favourite (sorry I am English). I am on my third paperback edition as the others became too yellowed and tatty with age (oops! giving away secrets) and have now purchased the Kindle edition which I hope isn't as badly edited as a previous reviewer said. I enjoy most of them, especially 'Sylvester', 'Talisman Ring', 'The Reluctant Widow', 'An Infamous Army' and 'The Conqueror', but my second favourite would probably be 'Devil's Cub' and third 'Behold here's Poison'. Compared to her later works such as 'Cousin Kate' and 'Frederica', which are very light, 'Regency Buck' is deeper and more satisfying as it makes you think. Besides giving you a real insight into life in the Regency period, such as foxhunting, boxing and cock fighting and gaming as well as the balls and men's clubs, there are many interesting real life characters in the book: Beau Brummell, The Prince of Wales (he ruled my country!!) and Lady Jersey being just a few. Lord Worth is a wonderful hero watching over his wards' welfare, even Peregrine's whom he doesn't even like, and helping them establish themselves in society. He reminds me of Mr. Darcy (my all time favourite) in that he comes across as a stern, unlikable character at first but ends up as a very loving and caring one. I can't understand the people who hate the book and don't even finish it as it is such a super book; simply the best as Tina Turner would say!"},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"I read most of Georgette Heyer's novels back in the mid 60s and after all these years I have been having a very enjoyable time rediscovering her work, thanks to Amazon. While I will have a very hard time deciding which one of those I have reread this year is my favorite, I can write definately that Regency Buck, first published in 1937, is my least favorite Heyer novel! RB was Georgette Heyer's 7th novel out of an eventual 56 or so, and while it is the first true \\"Regency\\" with events occuring in 1811 the first year of the Prince Regent's reign, its tone and plotting most nearly fits in with Heyer's Georgian works including The Black Moth, Powder and Patch, These Old Shades, Devil's Cub, The Masqueraders, The Convenient Marriage, etc. where intrigue and mystery almost overtake the romance plot. As with those novels that proceeded it, both historically and in terms of publication date, Regency Buck is quite lacking in the delicious sparkling humor and wit that characterizes Heyer's later more successful regencies such as my personal favorites Cotillion, Sylvester, or the Wicked Uncle, Frederica, Arabella, The Unknown Ajax, False Colours, Lady of Quality and The Nonsuch. Neither does it have the saving grace of original plots and interesting characters that those earlier Georgian's had. Regency Buck does introduce Charles Audley (Worth's brother) who is the love interest in An Infamous Army (takes place in 1815) that is the final book in the Alastair series (These Old Shades and Devil's Cub), so it is necessary reading (I suppose) for that reason alone.In Regency Buck, Sir Peregrine and his sister Judith Taverner, orphaned, wealthy minors, travel to London against the advice of their guardian Lord Worth whom they have never met. During their trip they pause in a town where a prize fight is being held and have several unpleasant encounters with an arrogant unnamed gentleman who is evidently the \\"Regency Buck\\" of the title. Eventually arriving in London they discover to their horror that their guardian Julian St John Audley, Fifth Earl of Worth is this self-same arrogant fellow. The plot is further complicated by apparent attempts on Peregrine's life which mystery Worth solves. Like all romances, the happy ending is a foregone conclusion, so it is no spoiler to say that Judith & Worth end up together.I would have been quite happy with this novel and its plot if the two main characters and the several supporting characters had been more likeable or if the mystery part of the plot had been less boringly predictable. We are 'told' there is a romance between Judith and Lord Worth but there was absolutely *no* chemistry between the two. In fact, I would say that there was darn little evidence that they even liked one another. Worth was an arrogant humorless jerk and Judith was an immature humorless shrew. Meanwhile, the \\"murder\\" mystery was no mystery at all (very unlike the identity mysteries in These Old Shades or The Masqueraders). From the moment it became clear that Peregrine's life was at risk, the villian was obvious (it could not have been Worth after all.)Had Regency Buck been written by any other author than Georgette Heyer, I would not have finished reading it. Actually, if it had been by any other author than Georgette Heyer, I would not have purchased it in the first place as I have not read regencies other than those written by Heyer or Mary Balogh since the mid 80s. I suggest that any newbies to Heyer skip this one in favor of the *dozens* of better works by Georgette Heyer (or at least download the free sample before deciding whether or not to purchase.)"},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"Mostly wanted to just leave a rating rather than a review.I have read many GH books and, for me, this one was ok but not one of her better stories."},{"Title":"Regency Buck","review":"The Earl of Worth becomes the guardian of the wealthy and beautiful Judith Taverner who has captivated London with her charm and grace.

Sadly, though, the book says absolutely nothing new on its own; that is to say, there are no new thoughs presented. The work is now seriously dated, as well. The text itself is quite poorly presented; the constant peppering of pages with words and phrases in myriad languages is not only confusing, it's just plain annoying.It is not all bad, however.

Crusty and judgmental, Joop's outlook on life is at odds with almost everyone he comes into contact with, especially his devoted and long-suffering wife, Emma. Although unconventional, I was really rooting for Joop to finally be happy and satisfied with some aspect of his life.The writing style, as translated from the Dutch, is somewhat \\"choppier\\" than we Americans are used to, but I didn't find it distracting. The author's dry sense of humor is prevalent, especially when he points out something ridiculous about Joop. A character study of a dysfunctional family and a humane and forgiving treatment of an emotionally empty individual, \\"Daalder's Chocolates\\" was a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Daalder's Chocolates: A Novel","review":"This book starts out in a very promising manner--good storyline, interesting situation, an intriguing main character. About halfway through, though, the story gets predictable & dull, the main character (Joop) becomes a cardboard cutout of a despicable human being who lives only for his own passion for making chocolate, and the story just goes downhill. I started skimming quickly through the book just to see how it ended. The book just ends, leaving you with a bad taste in you mouth. Chocolate shouldn't do that! This book could have been excellent if the level of writing had continued throughout & the author had not reverted to stereotypical characters and a plodding plot line. Maybe next time!"},{"Title":"Daalder's Chocolates: A Novel","review":"At the start of this entertaining and uncompromising novel, Daalder's Chocolates in an old storefront on St. Clair Avenue in Toronto is being closed to make way for a larger parking lot for its modern competition across the street, a gourmet megadeli. You'd think that the result would be a sentimental, nostalgic trip into the beauties and wonders of a marvelous old store, driven out by crass American tastelessness.Then we flash back through all of Joop Daalder's life, from his birth as an unwanted and unloved child in a family that cares for music and literature but not a whit for food, his \\"First Supper\\", when he realized what food could be, his time in college studying art history by day and learning to cook by night. Fortuitously offered an apprenticeship by master chocolatier Jerome Sorel in Avallon, France, he turns his back on his family (and they on him) and learns the craft from a man who treats most of his customers with contempt and lives only for his chocolates. When Joop wonders if Sorel has other plans for him as well, he distances himself from his master and runs into a beautiful woman whom he at first thinks is a married French mother whom he calls Nathalie, but who turns out to be a single Dutch au pair named Emma who had called him Marcel in her dreams. He and Emma conceive a child (eventually to be named Marcel) and when he rejects her, Sorel kicks him out of his apprenticeship. He leaves France and returns to his homeland, marries Emma and is resigned to a life of slavery as an employee of a terrible Dutch chocolate maker, revered in The Netherlands but a joke to one who had learned from the great Sorel.Joop's chance encounter at his father's funeral with a cousin who had emigrated to Canada changes his life, and he and his small family move to Toronto where he opens his own shop. But his emulation of Sorel leaves his wife unhappy, himself lonely and apart from the vast new country, and his son so alienated from his upbringing that he changes his name to Mark, takes up hockey and seeks to emulate the lives of their wealthier bourgeous neighbors. At a Thanksgiving dinner, Joop insults his hosts by making fun of their turkey and Canadian wine.Daalder's Chocolates does begin to prosper because Canadians take his insulting treatment of them and their tastes to heart, but then the new competition becomes the flavor of the month. Joop enters the new store, intent on having it out with the people who had taken away his passion, only to discover that they and their customers are not such terrible people, but that he is. His attempt at reforming his ways, however, is unsuccessful with Mark, who has moved on to other interests and leaves for Texas with his family, including one granddaughter who clearly has her grandpa's tastes and interests.What moved me about this book is the way that Joop is portrayed without a hint of sentimentality. Yes, the Dutch lack certain refinements, but that does not excuse the way he dismisses their tastes. Yes, his parents and sisters are cruel and indifferent, but he is no better in the way he reacts to them, particularly his refusal to say a word at his father's funeral. Yes, Emma doesn't understand him, but she caters to his every whim and does not accept a customer's advances, while Joop accepts the shop assistant (until he finds his relationship with her yet another absurdity and rejects her). Joop is, in the end, a man who was unloved as a child but unlovable as an adult, and the irony of his son's rejection of him in the end makes this a novel that is closer to real life than the usual tidy story. A good read and an excellent study of a difficult character."},{"Title":"Lee's Lieutenants: A Study in Command, Volume 1 - Manassas to Malvern Hill","review":"Douglas Southall Freeman, historian, journalist, and newspaper editor, was the author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Confederate General Robert E.

This is old school biography, focused on the general officers who served in what became Lee's famed Army of Northern Virginia, in the context of their times and without significant regard to other issues such as state's rights, slavery, economics, or even the Union side of the fighting. Freeman had the advantage of living and writing at a time when the Confederate leaders and their battles were still in living memory.Volume One covers the Confederate Army in Virgnia from the Battle of First Manassas in 1861 to the Battle of Malvern Hill, at the close of the Siege of Richmond in 1862. PGT Beauregard and Joe Johnston would initially command this force, before Lee took charge during the battles outside Richmond. The officers who fought at First Manassas and on the Virginia Peninsula, and the key leaders involved in Stonewall Jackson's famed Valley campaign of 1862, get most of the emphasis. This was an army and a collection of leaders who were learning their trade, and Freeman admits their many mistakes and their lessons learned. The Confederate Army that got bloodied at Malvern Hill was not yet the lethal instrument of war it would become in later campaigns; Freemen explains why.Freeman draws heavily from the official record, letters, and recollections to weave a highly readable narrative of Lee's army. Lee himself is usually in the background, as his new generals struggle to learn their leadership roles as commanders of brigades and divisions. Some would thrive; others would fade from the scene. Volume One of \\"Lee's Lieutentants\\" is very highly recommended to fans and students of the Civil War for its many insights into Lee's leaders."},{"Title":"The Persian letters (Meridian books)","review":"Persian Letters (Lettres Persanes) was first published in 1721 when Montesquieu was 32 years old. The book is about three Persians: Usbek, Rica, and Rhedi, who set out for Europe to study it's manners and institutions. Rhedi stops at Venice, while Usbek and Rica continue on to Paris. Very soon after their departure, there begins a brisk exchange of letters between the Persian visitors, and their wives, servants, and friends at home, as well as between the visitors themselves.One visitor, Usbek, a Persian lord, must keep in close contact with his harem of wives in his seraglio, as well as the eunuchs who guard the wives. When disorders break out in the seraglio, the eunuchs try to restore discipline by administering to two of the wives, \\"that chastisement which begins by shocking one's modesty, involving the deepest humiliation and takes one back to the time of her childhood.\\" Montesquieu however, uses this framework to comment on a very wide amount of subjects. The book also attacks errors and vices that will last as long as humanity. It is sometimes witty, sometimes profound."},{"Title":"The Persian letters (Meridian books)","review":"This was one of the books I read in my History of the Enlightenment Class my junior year of college. Our brilliant professor didn't assign all of the letters to read, though, and later I went back and read all of the book, not just the ones we'd been assigned to read for class. A lot of books about the politics and philosophy of a certain period in time don't age well, but this one, for the most part anyway, sounds just as fresh and entertaining today as it did in the eighteenth century. And using the pretence of this being a collection of real letters he intercepted from some Persian houseguests, Montesquieu was able to communicate the new exciting beliefs of his age by having them be told through the so-called eyes of Usbek, Rica, and Ibben, who were experiencing this all for the very first time and having to get adjusted to a real clash of values. This also worked to his advantage in a few cases, like where Usbek is talking about how there is a magician even greater than the King of France, saying &quot;This magician is called the Pope&quot; and going into a whole scathing litany about the Pope. He was able to attack the King and the Church by pretending that foreign travellers were writing and believing these things.The subplot is very interesting too. While Usbek and his friend Rica are away in France for seven years soaking up the Enlightenment, Usbek's wives, concubines, and slaves are getting more and more restless. While the cat's away, the mice will play, and the guiltiest party is the one the reader least suspects. This brings up the Enlightenment question about personal freedom, and how someone might react in such a situation. These women, and these male slaves, have never questioned their total subservience to Usbek until it becomes clear he's not going to be back for quite some time. They give in to their natural human instincts, wanting greater personal freedom and realising they don't have to be these obedient little automatons with no personal wishes or desires of their own apart from absolutely pleasing Usbek in all things. And by the time Usbek gets wind of this from his faithful eunuchs, the women and the slaves have already tasted freedom and will not go back to how things used to be without a fight. (Though I was surprised that the eunuchs never got into this rebellion against the restrictive rules too, and wondered where Zephis and Fatme, two of the other five main wives, went, since they aren't mentioned in the Chief Eunuch's first letter to Usbek telling him of the &quot;horrible sins&quot; which his women and slaves have been engaging in without him around.)This book is great not only as history, but also as fiction and philosophical, political, and religious commentary, ringing as true today in many respects as it did nearly three hundred years ago."},{"Title":"The Persian letters (Meridian books)","review":"There are many reasons one might choose to read this work, including reasons associated with one's studies at University, or for its historical interest, or for its views on law and justice. But, the compelling reason for me is that it provides a level of elegant discourse with such wit and charm that I would recommend it for its value as an entertainment alone. On the Spanish &quot; Those Spaniards who do not get burnt seemed to be so attached to the Inquisition that it would be churlish to take it away from them.(p156)&quot; On History &quot; Here are the books on modern history.

Relax and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Persian letters (Meridian books)","review":"Montesquieu's &quot;Persian Letters&quot; consist primarily of the collected correspondence of Usbek and Rica, two Persian travelers abroad in Europe in search of knowledge. For those familiar with Said's theories of Orientalism, this is an exemplary text to see how 18th century France thought of its Ottoman rivals, and how those views reflect the state of French society.Usbek, Rica, and their various correspondents discuss matters touching on gender, politics, the nature of the self, history, religion, and culture. While these letters make up the majority of the novel, the few letters Montesquieu inserts from Usbek's wives and eunuch servants are by far the novel's most interesting pieces, and unfortunately, the most frequently overlooked.As Usbek sojourns across Europe over the course of many years, contemplating universal issues, his wives and eunuchs bring a sense of stark reality to the &quot;Persian Letters&quot;. In these letters, we see all too clearly the domestic unrest arising out of even enlightened monarchy. The neglected wives, locked away from society in the harem, and the pitiable eunuchs, who must guard them, offer profoundly personal opinions on the causes and effects of a rigid class structure.&quot;Persian Letters&quot; is a valuable text for the layman interested in gauging the currents of thought in the early 18th century. A best-seller in its own time, Montesquieu's most abstracted philosophies are rendered accessible through story and fable, showing his authorial range. For the casual reader, the letters are for the most part very short and quite entertaining. For the scholarly-minded, this is a work with seemingly limitless critical appeal."},{"Title":"The Persian letters (Meridian books)","review":"With the psuedo naive eyes of Persian tourists,Montesquieu depicts the French society of thebeginning of the 18th century through acorrespondance with relatives and relationswho stayed in Persia. As a modern Socrates,he plays the innocent to challenge noblesand courtisans of the French court.The mostsurprising element of this book is the accuracyof the underneath analysis of the French society.Those &quot;letters&quot;, written about two hundred yearsago, always seem to be up to date."},{"Title":"The Persian letters (Meridian books)","review":"This enlightenment work is hard to peg. In some ways, it is a novel; in some ways a philosophical treatise; in some ways, a 'travelogue'. It works well as all three, to tell the truth.Montesquieu - who later wrote 'Spirit of the Laws&quot; - published this collection of fictional letters between two Persian brothers roaming Europe, anonymously. And, yes, the book did cause a decent amount of controversey as M was denounced as an unbeliever. To be sure, this book is some of the most thrilling satire on Western European ideosyncracies I've ever seen and, to be fair, christianity - religion in general - is not exempt from M's jibes.While the novel can be read as quasi-fiction, there is no story line between the letters (161 letters and 6 unpublished fragments in all). Each letter, is more like a condensed essay reflecting on some subject - the nature of governments, some religious tradition, a behavioral trait of a certain people; there are even some letters thrown in from the brothers relatives, wives, and eunuchs pertaining to the goings on in Persia. Truth be told, one could read these letters in a random order and be fine (with exception of a few necessarily linear 'chunks').All in all, the 'theme' is the quest for universals, as these Persian brothers are seeing the Western world through Persian eyes (hence the ability for satire on Western traditions). While I'm not sure there is an answer made to this question (as Montesquieu is always talking through his characters which may be right or wrong), it is an entertaining effort, and a brilliant encapsulation of some enlightenment ideas, particularly on religion and government. Even his later &quot;Spirit of the Laws&quot; is prefigured here."},{"Title":"The Persian letters (Meridian books)","review":"Any book that has the staying power that this title has had will have merit. Published nearly three hundred years ago (in 1721), Persian Letters by Montesquieu is an epistolary novel that traces the fictional correspondence between two eighteenth-century Persians and their countrymen as they travel through the occidental world for the first time, eventually settling in Paris for a decade during the remaining years of Louie XIV's reign. The book illustrates what we would now call today culture shock for the two main characters as they try to make sense of their new surroundings and the colorful people that enliven their day-to-day soir&eacute;es and sojourns into European life at the onset of the Enlightenment.This compellation has more than a few witticisms and biting criticisms of the times. Reading it today, three-hundred years later, it is obvious that Montesquieu used the fictional characters as a cover for his own criticisms. Though which critiques actually parallel his thoughts is open to question, this ambiguity, I think, actually making the piece more enjoyable to read. I cannot verify the accurateness of Montesquieu's portrayal of these Persians--would they have really have reacted the way they had?--but a quick glance at the introduction to any modern reprinting of the text will tell you that Montesquieu used the best available resources at the time to capture what they would have likely reacted. Sometimes, you have to wonder though if he is working off imaginative stereotypes more than anything. The character development of the Persians is slight and the plot that Montesquieu throws us is light until the last few letters when events seem to pick up and then rush towards an interesting finale. However, I think it is better to judge the book on its playful musings and witticisms. I can imagine that much of what this Frenchman wrote would have been shocking, maybe even scandalous at the time.The most entertaining features of the book come from the main Persian's communiqu&eacute; with his seraglio back home. His many wives under lock and key in his desert harem, their hinted-at misadventures in lesbianism and infidelity, and the dictatorial African eunuchs who relentlessly keep watch over them--all of that fun stuff kept the book moving forward, and, consequentially, was my favorite part as well.Another entertaining element to the piece was, of course, Montesquieu's musings on everything from government, virtue, law, morality, taxation, metrology to religion, particularly the Catholic Church. The best quotes from the book come from his thoughts on religion. One of my favorites:\\"I believe in the immortality of the soul periodically. My opinions depend entirely on my physical condition. According to whether I have greater or less vitality, or my digestion is functioning well or badly...I know how to prevent religion from disturbing me when I am well, but I allow it to console me when I am ill.\\"Speaking of quotes, that is one thing that I feel I ought to warn against. I imagine that I am not the only one who will be reading this text in anticipation of Montesquieu's treatise The Spirit of the Laws. I found myself enjoying the book much more when I read it as literature and not when I was hunting for witty quotes to be used later on for the inevitable research paper I will have to write for my political theory class.I think it is best to compare the novel to something from its own era, and the person's writing that first comes to mind to someone who is largely ignorant of that time period in French literature is, naturally enough, Voltaire. Like me, you will have probably have read Voltaire before tackling Montesquieu, which there is good reason for since I believe that Voltaire is much more readable than Montesquieu. If we compare Candide to Persian Letters, Candide comes out the winner easily: stylistically, for it imaginativeness, and hilarity. That said, I did enjoy the Persian Letters and recommend it for anyone who wants an entertaining reflection on early eighteenth-century France."},{"Title":"The Persian letters (Meridian books)","review":"Persian Letters is a political satire written in a form of correspondence between Usbek and Rica (two Persians who decide to leave Persia and discover the Occident with all its faults and glories) and their eunuchs, wives and friends back home. They travel through the Ottoman Empire and Venice to arrive in Parris as the centre of knowledge and progress. Through Usbek and Rica, Montesquieu unveils his take on the socio-political environment of the time - which must have been the most interesting aspect of the satire at the time it was published. However the Lettres Persanes have become somewhat of a historical source on which Saidian Orientalists refer their arguments to describe Western imaginary perceptions of the Orient and the creation of the Eastern 'Other'. In reality, Montesquieu's knowledge of Persia was certainly not a pure product of the imagination, he was inspired and borrowed heavily from Jean Chardin who visited Persia in the seventeenth century and left a very vivid account of his travels there. Easy read, funny and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Persian letters (Meridian books)","review":"Montesquieu's Persian Letters represent a wonderful confection of ideas, social satire and social commentary. It is no wonder they are still in print and are retranslated from time to time. For me, the charm of these works is that they relate to a time when a person of lively curiosity delighted in picking up a book of an evening and reading a chapter or two; then reflecting on what had just been read. Montesquieu's book has received many very well-considered reviews on this page: mine is intended to add 'freshness' to the virtues of the earlier ones.I would warn that the sweep of domestic household events is Persia will be tragic: Montesquieu is speculating on where a too-repressive society will lead and it seems to lead to the antithesis of 'family' love and social order that the noble traveler Usbek intends. Usbek is, in theory, the absolute monarch of his household, even as he travels, but Montesquieu also sees his travels as an abdication of social responsibility that has horrific consequences. Aside from that, Usbek has an irrepressibly curious relative, Rica, whose penetrating intellect observes and comments on cornerstones of European and French society. Of course these Muslims are also very curious about the practices of Christianity. Enlightenment criticisms of Catholic practice find expression here in a whimsical way. Rica is able to offer a devastatingly funny essay on the workings of the French Academy, showing the overblown deference the French cultural elite gives to their opinions. A great deal is said about 'life in a state of nature' through a group of essays about a 'Troglodyte' nation. These and other essays show the positive effects of a moral society and a cooperative community. Such subjects are addressed in lighter ways and in more palatable doses that one finds in Montesquieu's great work, Spirit of the Laws.Readers of 'the Old School' of intellectual life will be delighted by these essays disguised as letters."},{"Title":"The Persian letters (Meridian books)","review":"Mr Montesquieu poked fun at French socity.

James Roeder's volume on the 357th FG, 8th AF is yet another in that long line of quality publications.The 357th was one of the most illustrious 8th AF fighter groups. Flying its first combat mission on 11 February 1944, it finished the war with 595.5 air kills, ranking third in terms of ETO fighter groups. It was awarded 2 DUCs including one for its record-setting 14 January 1945 engagement wherein the Group downed 56.5 e/a, the best single-day score for ANY WWII USAAF fighter group. The 357th also had the most aces (42) of any 8th FG. Sixty pilots were KIA/MIA; an additional 54 ended up as POWs.357TH FIGHTER GROUP includes a 13-page history of the Group but the main section - 20 pages - is given over to single-page biographies of various Group aces, pilots and ground crew. Included in that section are 'Bud' Anderson, Don Bochkay, 'Kit' Carson, Frank Gailer, 'Tommy' Hayes, 'Obie' O'Brien, Merle Olmsted and, of course, Chuck Yeager. Don Greer contributes eight pages of gorgeous color side-views depicting 40 of the Group's P-51Bs and -Ds. And there's also 134 black & white and color photographs as well. Quite a package!!Merle Olmsted's magnificent 2004 volume - TO WAR WITH THE YOXFORD BOYS - is THE definitive book on the 357th. It's worth every penny of its $64.95 price tag.

To me, Egan did not make a distinction between pulp reporting - in a medium that is read and immediately tossed, recycled or used to wrap garbage or line a litter box - and writing an enduring full-length, non-fiction book.Like a news reporter, he protected his sources to the extreme. His citations are scanty, and he omitted footnotes and bibliography. His descriptions of some historical figures are glib [Isaac Stevens, Chief Seathl]. Some of his data derive from popular myth - not from scholarly research - so the myths are perpetuated. He also comes across as an Anglophobe.Shame on his editors and advisors. Shame on him. If his sources were cited, his work might be a convincing treatise for ecologists and historians. His shortcomings are maddening."},{"Title":"The good rain: Across time and terrain in the Pacific Northwest","review":"This book is crap. Mr. Egan should stick to essay and opinion rather than delving into history. After enjoying &quot;Lasso the Wind&quot; I was bitterly dissapointed with this effort. This book, which purports to weave a tapestry of Washington State history is nothing more than a collection of revisionist, Seattle-centric, urban biased cliches and, often, folk tales masquerading as fact. His environmental views are as un-original as they are irritating. His standing on an Olympic peak and blaming the lousy Puget basin air quality on logging slash fires is typical. Presumably the fact that he drove there from his Seattle home in the real culprit, his automobile, is either totally lost on him or simply dramatically inconvenient. I can't say that I actually finished the book. After the chapter in which he tries to cast convicted racketeer, pedophile, and attempted murderer Bob Satiacum as an oppressed Native American activist, I literally threw this junker against the wall (thankfully my wife at that point took it away from me and replaced it with Isabel Allende's excellent &quot;Paula&quot;-best trade I ever made!). If you're a transplanted green paint style environmentalist, living in the trahed urban hell of Seattle and loving the myopic view therefrom, you will love this book. If on the other hand, you are interested in the rich natural history, and the complex political and human history of your wonderful State, you will recognize this as a piece of fluff. There are way better choices out there."},{"Title":"The good rain: Across time and terrain in the Pacific Northwest","review":"His love the trees - hate the people who raise them as a business attitude is so distorted that it taints the book.

It seems to be poorly written when put alongside the research.I also found it humorous that he writes for a newspaper, and publishes a book, but hammers on the timber industry though out said book."},{"Title":"The good rain: Across time and terrain in the Pacific Northwest","review":"This is not a history of the Pacific Northwest, nor even a comprehensive contemporary profile of this region. It is one man's often very personal view of his home, the place where he grew up, and the political, social and economic issues that underlie everyday life there. Egan makes no attempt at cold objectivity; he is writing about something he loves, and this comes through in the text. He also makes abundantly clear what he doesn't like. Thus, this book is controversial and thought-provoking. Although \\"The Good Rain\\" is ostensibly about the Pacific Northwest, an area that at its widest extent includes Washington, Oregon, most of British Columbia in Canada and even the northern parts of California, Egan focuses mostly on parts of Washington, which is good, because this is what he knows best (even though the chapter on the Siskiyou forests of Oregon is very well written and informative). The book is well organized, and Egan selected the main topics for his chapters well; they cover the principal socio-economic and political concerns of the region: timber and loggers, salmon, fruit-growing, urban development, the local Native Americans, the Columbia River, etc. He also did a good deal of research on the region's history upon settlement (or conquest) by the Americans and the British, and his writing makes these often dry facts come to life. Probably the main theme of Egan's argument here is that as the Pacific Northwest makes its transition into a vital part of the Pacific Rim, it needs to discard the central resource extraction element of its economy which marked its early years of development (after the Indians were pushed aside). The author here makes no secret of his distaste for the rapacious timber industry (even though he is not anti-logger or opposed to sustainable use of forests) and the Army Corps of Engineers (which is still intent on damming up the last untouched parts of the Columbia and destroying the remaining significant salmon runs). Although it was written ten years ago, \\"The Good Rain\\" has lost none of its freshness and relevance. Perhaps my only criticisms would be a) Egan often omitted citing dates even when dealing with specific events (so that there is reference to e.g. something taking place \\"in Seattle tonight\\") and b) he relies too much and sometimes depends excessively on a book by Theodore Winthrop, a New Englander who traveled through the region in 1853. Nevertheless, this book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The good rain: Across time and terrain in the Pacific Northwest","review":"This collection of essays by Seattle native and New York Times journalist Timothy Egan is stuffed to the gills with facts about the wildlife, water and land in and around the Pacific Northwest.

Although with a preachy style that would make Rachel Carlson proud, Egan is a fantastic storyteller with the ability to meld anecdotes, facts and opinion in such a way that every chapter is absolutely engaging. The Good Rain contains an abundance of information about all things environmental, and is at least as useful and relevant today as it was in 1990 when it was first published.

I plan on reading another of his books soon because I found this one fascinating."},{"Title":"The good rain: Across time and terrain in the Pacific Northwest","review":"I think that this was a great book to read, to grasp what the Pacific North West is all about.

Egan's best work, by far."},{"Title":"The good rain: Across time and terrain in the Pacific Northwest","review":"A good book if you can filter out the evil white man vs Noble Red Man and Mommy Nature bias. To read this book you would think that no indian ever used a nylon gill net and that every inch of Western Washington outside of the National Parks is barren clear cut.

Gossipy enough to tantalize, but grounded in a real understanding of the state's culture and history. My only beef with the book? I'm a fan of lean, but expressive prose and I felt that Egan too frequently used twenty-five cent words when a ten cent one would do. Still, this book is high on my list of great gifts for friends who live in the Northwest."},{"Title":"The good rain: Across time and terrain in the Pacific Northwest","review":"Anyone who is interested in the Pacific North-West - whether its history, ecology, geology or native Amaericans - should read Timothy Egan's excellent book. It is well written and totally absorbing. He speaks up for the natural life of this beautiful area, charting and bewailing the short-sighted despoilation of landscape, wildlife and cultures and arguing for a different approach for the future. You don't have to have visited the area before reading the book - indeed, it provides in itself a fascinating itinerary for the visitor. But if you know Washington,Oregon and Idaho you will relate to this book. It makes you think, understand and most of all, come to love this unique area."},{"Title":"The good rain: Across time and terrain in the Pacific Northwest","review":"The Ladies' Literary League of Leschi gives this book one of our rare 4-star ratings.

Unlike most history books, this actually told one man's story about his life growing up in the Pacific Northwest. He tells tales that he heard from his grandpa, and begins by finding the perfect place to lay his grandpa to rest in his home country of the Pacific Northwest. This book grabs your attention from the start, and it makes you want to keep reading because of the historical \\"stories\\", not historical information.

I like the range of subjects and the &quot;traveling sense&quot; or the sense of place you get as he shares his experiences one area at a time. Very well written, uplifting, and pleasurable reading even to people who have not lived in this region but at least got a sense of it on short visits. Suddenly, visions of Mt. Baker looming on the horizon over Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands spring up!"},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Hondo is the typical western that has become extremely popular. Louis Lamour is famous for western books and this is one of his most famous. Hondo has been made into a movie that starred John Wayne. The movie is similar to the book except Lamour is able to bring out the landscape and characters in a way that film cannot reveal. Lamour makes the reader notice the size and beauty of the landscape and at the same time how barren and lonely it can be. The book is about Hondo Lane, a heroic cowboy. He is best described as a middle grounder. He is the type of guy that everyone respects, Indian and cavalry. The way he can communicate with both sides while still being loyal to the cavalry is one of the most admirable qualities about Hondo. He has an ability to tell both sides how it is and still get along with them. The story starts by Hondo losing his horse to Indians and coming to a farm ran by a woman and her young son. The process of losing his horse makes it evident early that his instincts and reactions are better than a normal mans. Hondo stays at the farm for a night as the guest of Angie Lowe and her son. Angie's husband had left but Angie said he would be back. Hondo departed the next day leaving Angie and her son at the will of Indians that were on the warpath. They stayed in Hondo's mind though and he returned to them after reporting to the cavalry of the restless Indians. He is not a trooper but is hired as a scout for the cavalry. When he returns Angie has had an encounter with the Indians and was only spared because of her son's bravery. Hondo stays with them and rescues them from the Indians that become savage after their chief is killed. Hondo Lane is like many western heroes in the classic western. He is stronger and quicker than everyone else is, but most importantly he is smarter. He knows how to survive in the violent west. He shows some of this knowledge with Angie's son and it allows the reader to get a feel of the true Hondo Lane. Angie is the woman that captures Hondo's heart. Hondo does not fall all over her but is very quiet about his feelings and it draws Angie even more to him. She is awed by the way he handles himself and everyone around him. She falls in love with the man that is not big into talking but action. Hondo is an interesting book and it keeps the reader involved. It is the traditional western with the heroic cowboy. Hondo Lane is the stereotypical male hero in many classic westerns. He is strong, instinctive, independent, and has a great understanding of people and land. Angie is the stereotypical woman that is independent but needs a man to be complete. It is a classical western that keeps the tradition of gunfights and a great cowboy hero."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"The western myth over the years has slowly become the American myth. The old west has come to represent the ideal American characteristics of independence, heroism, and ruggedness. So, too, the cowboy has been given an almost god-like status in the mind of America. In the book Hondo, Louis L'amour captures both the qualities of the west and of the cowboy. This book has rightfully become an American classic. It has been read by thousands, but still finds a place in today's world of political correctness and multi-culturalism. But, how has the book not only survived but thrived through the years? For the answer, we need only analyze three things: the main characters, the descriptive use of the west, and L'amour's writing style. The main characters of Hondo and Angie are the back bone of the book. It is through the development of these two characters that L'amour is able to keep the reader's attention and entertain, as well. Hondo contains just about every masculine characteristic that is viewed by American eyes as desirable. He is truly a man's man. He possesses great physical strength and mythic-like reflexes. He is rugged and independent and as with most heroes, in the end, he gets the girl. Perhaps his most important characteristic is his tendency for both good and evil. He is a true middle grounder who is able to exist between the two worlds of the Indians and the settlers - the worlds of chaos and order. Angie falls in love with him for these characteristics, and so does the reader. We admire him because he is fixed, right or wrong; he is what he is. Angie tends to have all the desirable characteristics of a woman as well. L'amour portrays Angie in a manner which allows the reader to choose how Angie is seen. She can be seen as a strong, brave, independent women who survived the west on her own and became involved with Hondo out of want and not necessity. Or, she can be seen as loyal, domestic, and allowing herself to be swept off her feet by a handsome cowboy. By leaving the interpretation of Angie to the reader, L'amour can capture both sides of how the west is viewed. On one hand, the west is a place of opportunity for independent survival and on the other, it's a place where one can find true love and romance. Hondo and the scenery are paralleled throughout the book. Much like Hondo, the west is shown to be rugged, rough, and brutal. L'amour does not describe the west with great detail as other cowboy novel authors have, such as Zane Grey. This fact adds mystery of the west. Leaving the west as an unknown, L'amour is able to accentuate the frontier qualities associated with the west. What little description he does give is simplistic in nature. L'amour's writing style in general is very simplistic. Some critics have labeled this a negative aspect of the book; however, I feel it only adds to it. The cowboy myth itself is very simple in nature. In its purest form, it is the ability to survive independently, not relying on anything or anyone else. By keeping the language simple, L'amour is able to convey that myth and use it to the advantage of the work. The reader able to easily identify the feelings associated with both the west and the cowboy. Louis L'amour has given us a very entertaining work with Hondo. The western has become more than just another form of literature. The western myth has become the American myth. It sums up the qualities and characteristics of our nation. As Americans we have all come to identify ourselves with certain concepts such as individuality, independence, and resourcefulness. These qualities are all shown by our hero Hondo. L'amour and other western writers have given us a median in which we find an American at his best. We can all find aspects of the cowboy in our daily lives and that is precisely one reason why Hondo has lasted so long."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"i picked this book up out of shear curiosity. Seeing about a billion Louis L'Amour books throughout the course of my life on store bookshelves i decided to break down and read his debut novel hondo. It is very simple yet entertaining. I would recommend this book for people who just want to spend an evening reading a novel that wont require a lot of serious thought or time. This is not to say that it was a poorly written novel, but its not exactly War and Peace either. The storyline is pretty straight forward, it tells of a mans adventures (Hondo) over a short period of time in the Arizona territory during the 1800s. The story moves quite quickly, and divulging any of the plot in this review might ruin the book. Bottom line: if youre curious dive in, but dont expect to be blown away."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"From a female perspective, I have never read a western. I was familiar with the books of Louis L'Amour because my brother had all of his books on his shelf when we were growing up. So I assumed these were all cowboy and indian books only suitable for boys or men.Little did I know that Louis L'Amour excels at describing the prairie wilderness and nature with the soul of a poet. This is the part I enjoyed the most: his description of sunlight on the desert, the cottonwood trees, the sun playing on the water of the river. However, L'Amour never lets the description get in the way of the narrative. I like that too.I never realized what a feminine and romantic soul lurked in the writing of Louis L'Amour. This is a man who loves women and is kind to animals and children. What a gentle soul. Even with the fights, ambushes and killing of Apache and pony riders, I absolutely loved this book. EXCEPT, when the Apache chief Vitoro says to Angie, \\"You have great man. Treasure him.\\" We get the idea that Hondo is the hardened, hardtack cowboy with a heart of gold and we don't need the local chief to tell us so. That was the one bum line in the book. (Which I listened to as an audio book.)If you only ever read one Louis L'Amour book, this is a great pick. Though I am kind of hooked on him at the moment and am about to start \\"Last of the Breed.\\""},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"An extremely riviting book by the all time master of western liturature.

Untypical of Hollywood. So glad because in my opinion, this book is L Amour's best. Decided to purchase the Kindle version. Still a great read and now conveniently on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"If you want to read the best Western ever, read \\"Lonesome Dove.\\" If you want original characters, read Elmore Leonard's Westerns. If you want to read something plain, relaxing and uncomplicated, then just about anything by Louis \\"L'Amour will do, including \\"Hondo.\\"As I joked in the title of my review, it's more of the same -- a grizzled, tough lonely cowboy (in this case Hondo Lane), a lonely woman with an absent (or dead) husband (Angie Lowe) and her son (Johnny), all of whom L'Amour finds a way to get together and make life less lonely in the Old West. And, to make this story a bit different than \\"Conagher,\\" Hondo has a dog.L'Amour doesn't do much nuance. Hondo is wide of shoulder, slim of hip, a great fist-fighter and enough of a gunman to make other men go, \\"Don't mess with him, that's Hondo!\\" That said, while he's not as snappy with the dialogue as Leonard or Larry McMurtry, L'Amour gets the job done well enough.Add in some Apaches (particularly a couple named Vittoro and Silva) and L'Amour is in his element, weaving a tale. And it's not an unpleasant one. While I enjoy the other writers I've mentioned, if I were out in a sleeping bag near a campfire for a night or two, I'd rather take along a book like \\"Hondo.\\" It's just more down to earth.If you are a L'Amour fan, then buy this book. If you are a person who likes easygoing Westerns, buy this book. It may not be worthy of a Pulitzer, but it is worth the read."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Louis L'amour wrote a short story that was made into the movie \\"Hondo\\". The movie was based on a screenplay ,not written by L'amour, that was quite a bit different from L'amour's short story, for instance the screen writer is the one who came up with Hondo Lane and the dog Sam. When L'amour wrote the novel Hondo he worked from the screenplay. According to Robert Weinberger's book \\"The Louis L'amour Companion\\" John Wayne told him he had never read the novel Hondo and didn't remember ever meeting L'amour, his endorsement was just for the screenplay. That being cleared up this is a pretty good western. There is a couple of laugh out loud parts in this novel. One is when one of the Apaches is telling his chief that Hondo knows their language and how much he had been insulted by Hondo in Apache. The other is when Sam his dog has been killed, to help get over it he is telling how ugly and mean the dog was he says he almost had to eat him up on the powder river once and he hadnot looked forward to it or something to that effect, you have to read it to see the humor. L'amour's best western novel \\"Conagher\\" is also a must read."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"I don't read westerns very much, usually I find that they have the same basic plot, no matter who the author is. However, I have always heard of Louis L'Amour because my brother used to read his novels. When I heard that John Wayne did a movie based on one of L'Amour's characters in a novel he had written, well first I saw the movie, which I liked, then I read the novel, which I really enjoyed.Hondo is a very entertaining novel. It has vivid descriptions of the harsh desert life where Hondo lives. It describes the tough life of a woman who is surviving on a desert ranch along with her young son. The novel also tells about the true desert warriors the Apache Indians. Mix all of these together with a very tough yet tender cowboy such as Hondo and you get a great novel as a result."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"A great story, if you love westerns do not miss this one. It is timeless."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Louis L'Amour is the author of Hondo, and exciting, action-packed western. Hondo is the cowboy of the story; fighting off Indians, killing betrayers, and rescuing Angie and her son Johnny. This story fits the sterotype of westerns with all the gunslinging and violence. Hondo, the character, is the typical cowboy. He never shows his feelings to others, is courageous, rugged, and appealing to the women. Angie, whom is a damsel in distress, depends on him to get her and her son out of the danger that surrounds them, and she trusts him. She is attracted to his exciting and dangerous life; the violence is what makes him so appealing to her. The violence in his life represents his masculinity as a cowboy. Killing Indians and surviving in the desert shows how much power and control he possessess, and the power he has makes him even more masculine in Angie's eyes, therefore increasing the attraction. This book is full of action and constant excitement, and it is simple to read. The positive side to reading this book is that it is entertaing to those people who like westerns. Hondo gives an adventuresome, interesting version of the stereotype of the &quot;old west&quot;. The book seems to fly by as one is reading it. However, if a person does not enjoy action books, this may not be the correct choice for them."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"There are stiff and clunky spots throughout Louis L'Amours best work, yet the tug to keep reading is right there. The prose style is a bit outdated in spots, pure poetry in others. His stories are palate-cleansers from the over-complicated, self-important thrillers of today. The pretenses are low, although in \\"Hondo\\" we get more than a few stern lectures about the appropriate way to die in the face of the enemy. \\"Hondo\\" is a classic for a good reason--all the classic elements of conflict. Man against nature, man against himself, man against an enemy and man against the Apaches, who are both fearless killers and, at times, reasonable negotiators. There are big choices to be made. \\"Hondo\\" jumps out of the shoot with a nifty bit of survival in the Old West. \\"Hondo Lane could smell trouble, and he knew it was coming, for others and for himself.\\" There are circling buzzards, curious lone coyotes, a Winchester in the scabbard, \\"the gray bones of a long dead tree.\\" Within pages of the start, Hondo has taken on two Indians and, of course, won the day. The main action of involves Hondo's interaction with Angie Lowe, a rancher stuck out in the desert with her son Johnny. Of course Angie needs a man, son Johnny needs a father figure. Angie's husband is gone--although the given reasons, at least to Hondo, don't quite fit with what he sees around the ranch. Soon, of course, there are Apaches and Hondo is in the middle of a series of colorful and dangerous situations as the pressure mounts. Hondo is on the run, concerned about \\"those hard and tireless desert fighters.\\" The desert backdrop is key. It's a land \\"where all life is born with a fire, a thorn, a sting.\\" Good stuff."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"This western classic is based on the author's short story, \\"The Gift of Cochise\\", and further developed into one of the genre's most popular stories. Louis L'Amour's love of the west, its great lands, the Indians and the settlers who followed comes alive in this rugged tale which has interesting characters and a touch of romance. Army dispatch rider Hondo Lane happens upon an isolated ranch and befriends Angie Lowe and son Johnny, both abandoned by a ne'er-do-well husband and father. The Apaches are on the warpath and the pony soldiers are out on patrol to put down the Indian uprising. John Wayne was the star in the excellent 1953 film which portrays the Apaches as a fierce but dignified warrior tribe. It is young Johnny who is the main point of interest of both Lane and chief Vittoro who want the boy grow into manhood despite the enmity between the Apaches and the soldiers. L'Amour is said to have been one of President Eisenhower's favorite writers and enjoyed reading his tales of the old west. Actor David Strathairn is the narrator of the audiobook and expertly recreates this story for audiobook listeners."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"This is one of the best western stories ever written. Hondo Lane is a hard and lonely man accompanied by Sam, a mongrel dog as fierce as he is. Riding as a scout for the U. S. cavalry, he is in Apache country at a time when the Apaches are on the warpath. Having lived with them for years and having had an Apache woman as a wife, Hondo knows their ways. His horse is killed in an encounter with Apaches and he walks to a small ranch. Angie Lowe and her young son have been living there alone since her husband departed for parts unknown. They strike up a friendship and there is an immediate attraction, even though Angie is repulsed by Hondo's reputation as a gunman. Hondo purchases a semi-wild horse from Angie, tames it and then rides away after kissing her.When he gets back to the fort and reports to the commanding officer, Hondo has a run-in with Angie's husband Ed Lowe and Ed and a mercenary cohort follow Hondo out into the desert. In a major altercation between the cavalry and the Apaches under war chief Vittorio, the cavalry unit is completely wiped out. However, being a man of principle, Vittorio grants Angie and her son safety on their ranch, even though the guerilla war is wiping out nearly all the other white settlers.Through it all, Hondo's thoughts are on Angie and her thoughts are on him. Their relationship proceeds along many sidepaths, but eventually through the war and other difficulties, they are united and are literally riding off to greener pastures. Although there is gunplay typical of westerns and the violence of the frontier war, the primary point of the story is the loneliness of Hondo and Angie and the unusual way they manage to be united in a relationship of love and companionship."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"The area of this novel is southeastern Arizona in the area of the Chiricahua Mountains during the Apache wars. The main character is Hondo Lane, riding dispatch and scout for General Crook. He has a companion who sides him, \\"a rough-looking mongrel dog,\\" named Sam.Most of the reviews herein show ample evidence to the enjoyment and value of this novel. Most give it either 4 or 5 stars. Not too many, though some exist, are negative regarding this story. So it's safe to say this is a very good western. I think it possibly the best Louis L'Amour ever penned. I've read the book more times than I can count, having several hardcover and softcover on my shelves. It's a quick, engrossing read, but such an entertaining one, too.One of the elements that strike me, is the number of people who cannot separate John Wayne from this story. They seem linked together forever. I recall seeing the picture back in the 1950s, yes the story is that old, and the movie was shot in 3-D. If you are of a certain age you will know what that means, and also what a dud 3-D turned out to be. Considering John Wayne, I think the movie did him a great service as a starring role; and though I have a large piece of artwork from the movie on my western wall, of John and his faithful dog, Sam, directly behind him, I never forget that the short story, and book came first. Not the other way round.So give Mr. L'Amour the credit, for without the story, no movie. But again, they do seem inseparable.Though this book can stand along side \\"Shane\\" I think the two very different books. The subject matter and time frame doesn't match either. Hondo Lane belongs to a time of seizing the land, Shane belongs to a later time, when gunfighters are quickly becoming obsolete, and 'sodbuster' settlers are seizing the land.One last interesting element for me is the various thoughts and glimpes each reader receives from Hondo. Read the reviews, and you will see that the book is truly a universal western, meaning many things to many people.Louis L'Amour's own words may describe it best, \\"...American stories, the stories I wish to tell, and if I have not told them well, I shall have tried.\\"Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Good solid story. I've liked most of Louis L'Amour's books. I first saw the movie, and then went and got the book. From there I tracked down some more of his stories. This is a fast paced plot with strong characters. One thing I've liked about Mr. L'Amour is his attention to detail, the respect for the culture of American Indians and the strong female characters he uses."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"gotta be one of the best westerns of all time. It is a classic Lamour and certainly a good book to start with if you haven't read a Lamour before.Lamour is very knowledgable about life on the American frontier and has spent many years researching this niche of history. This fact easily becomes apparent during the reading of Hondo. He has a very visual way of writing that makes you feel hot and dry in the desert and cold and alive in the mountains.This book certainly helps you to understand why he was awarded the Gold Medal of Honor by the US Congress and later recieved the presidential Award of Freedom."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"No writer of westerns has ever done it better than Lamour and this is one of his best.

I enjoyed this book very much. The characters were well fleshed out and the writing appeared to be faithful to the lore of that period. I appreciated the character of Hondo Lane, to me he epitomises the true western character. A loner, but a straight shooter with a gentle side. I also liked the fact that the author did not show the Native American in a stereotypical light. I am also a sucker for the friendship and regard for a man and his dog, and horse.The only true negative that I could put forth is that the author did write a largely static,romance between Angie and Hondo but still I found it to be an easy read, strangely compelling. I can see why there are so many fans of this author's work."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"There are no bad Louis L'Amour books, but Hondo is one of a hand full of the truly great westerns by L'Amour.

Louis L'Amour is THE BEST western writer of all time. and this one was made into a movie with John Wayne. Who can beat that!!! great read."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Novel or novelization? That is the question one has to ask oneself. Did Louis L'Amour write it or did he follow James Edward Grant's screenplay? The back cover of the original publication--which I have--has a John Wayne quote, \\"The best novel I have ever read\\" and that's quite a feat considering the book wasn't \\"written\\" until after the movie was made. But either way, this was the beginning of one of the longest and most successful publishing ventures ever---Louis L'Amour, a phenomenon in the literary business. And without a doubt is one of his best works. The short story upon which the movie and this book is based, The Gift of Cochise, is probably better in the real scheme of things but then short stories have to be judged quite differently than longer works. And as with most novelists, LL's early works are his best with a few exceptions. I recommend you read the book and watch the movie and decide which you like better."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"How can Hondo possibly be as good as it is? Certainly not because of its plot. Everything that actually happens in Hondo has happened in five hundred books before it and five hundred more since: lone drifter finds lonely woman, the Apaches rise up, the cavalry get ambushed. And certainly not because of its conflict; in this novel, as in far too many of L'Amour's works, the villains are so overmatched by the hero that they're instantly forgettable - except for Vittorio, but Vittorio is not really a villain and is not meant to be.And yet, Hondo is one of L'Amour's most memorable and moving books. In a sense, it is not a story so much as a love poem: a love poem to the American West, to its land, to its virtues, and to its vanished people. All of L'Amour's books show his love for the West, of course, but here that love is almost the main character in itself. Every word does its best to mirror the beauty that L'Amour sees in the land and its people. At times it has the power and majesty of a hymn, of a nearly religious love. Hondo Lane and Angie Lowe's growing love mirrors and amplifies L'Amour's love, and makes for what is surely L'Amour's most heartfelt book."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"What?

Every one is still in print. Quite an accomplishment. I've read dozens of his books and Hondo is unquestionably my favorite.L'Amour has been described as a good storyteller, but a mediocre writer. When you start late and publish over one hundred books, it's difficult to maintain the quality required to get a first novel published. Hondo, published in 1953, was his first novel and proves that L'Amour could write well when he paid attention to his craft. Unusual for a Western, Hondo is a love story, reminiscent of The Virginian.L'Amour loved of the West and it comes through to the reader in his stories."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"This is the No. 1 classic of all Louis Lamor's novels.

I've been asking real friends, FaceBook friends, dead friends, and Twitter friends, but they either couldn't give me a good title OR they would recommend something I've already read. Booklover, heal thyself; I took that research magnifying glass that I use for my bookstore customers and turned it on myself and I went on a lion hunt . Now, I've seen Louis L'amour's books and I've heard very good things about them, but I've never read anything by him. Until now. While Mr. L'amour has about a million books, I wanted to start with one of his \\"best\\". And to be honest, even his \\"best\\" was up for debate. I'll get to those later, because this go round I chose \`Hondo'.Based on this one book... I see why people adore this man so. He can tell a story and THAT (at least for me) is the single most important thing that endears this book hound to authors. Louis obviously has that with his fans. This book was written wwwaaaayyyy back in 1983 so (thankfully) political correctness hadn't fully reared its ugly head, so Louis uses words like \\"white man\\", \\"brave\\", and \\"squaw\\". Nothing wrong with these words mind you, but we both know how the cowardly passive-aggressive PC crowd can be. My assessment? I really enjoyed \`Hondo'. I mean I really, really enjoyed \`Hondo'. The only... weird... part for me was the interaction between Hondo and Angie. At times as I was reading about them it almost felt like a romance. Right up until Hondo has to fight a brave, then it gets back to the burly, sweaty, dusty, and violent West that I love reading about. Not sure if it was just this book but I'd be curious to see if this is how he writes about relationships between a man and a woman.That being said, this book is 99.9% wonderful western and .1% crazy booklover probably reading too much into nothing. If you're looking for a good western, don't take as long as I did, choose this one."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Like great comedy films, L'Amour's books don't always get the critical accolades they deserve. This one is especially great. It's well paced. No wasted words. Great plot w/ great characters. Did they make a movie of this? They'd never get it right now. Why did someone Like Norman Mailer get taken seriously and not L'Amour? When L'Amour is on, it's like Hemingway, but better. The only great thing Mailer did was Executioner's Song and his co-writer did most of the work. That's when he wasn't pimping himself out to Esquire for nonsensical profiles of celebrities. Yikes. While Mailer was shmoozing at another NY cocktail high society party L'Amour was churning out another quality book. Who's the real writer? Remarkable."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Those who know me know I have little regard for Louis L'Amour's talent as a writer. I find much of his work laconic and unable to focus on emotional interchanges between characters in a believable way. I mean, you might as well be reading Max Brand. Brand is another writer who tells stories that are forgotten the day after you finish them. Fun, sure, and easy to blow through, and a pleasant enough time-waster. But there's not much literary meat there. Studying them won't add anything appreciable to your own growth as a writer.L'Amour's early success stems from the fact he burst onto the scene from a marketing strategy implemented by Bantam Books. They forced independent distributors to buy his books in lots of 10,000 if they wanted to get other Bantam titles at wholesale prices. They swamped the market with his stuff and it drove other western titles off the shelves and spinning racks. Once that monster got going, it shambled onward under sheer momentum. By all accounts, and sheer sales numbers, it was a successful business model.Okay, so he's not a good writer and even he recognized there was room for improvement. He once said: \\"There's bits and pieces of books that I think are good. I never rework a book. I'd rather use what I've learned on the next one, and make it a little bit better. The worst of it is that I'm no longer a kid and I'm just now getting to be a good writer. Just now.\\"You gotta give him credit. But whatever literary skills he lacked, he WAS at times a darn good story teller, and Hondo proves it.This is a good novel and it deserves classic status. It has thin spots, the ones we come to expect from L'Amour. But he knows the culture of the west, has a deep respect for Native Americans and their culture, and no one besides Zane Grey expresses such a love for the outdoors and captures it so perfectly on the page.The story itself is simple enough, and a retelling of his early short story \\"The Gift of Cochise\\" but expanded. Hondo Lane is a reserved man who was raised by Apaches. He meets a woman on the frontier and they fall in love. (There's no underlying reason they fall in love, it's the plot point L'Amour wanted.) Her young son looks up to Hondo. That's the basic story and there are lots of good, rich detail mixed in including some battles.If you haven't read this novel I urge you to give it a try. Trust me, you could do a LOT worse than Hondo."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"A classic western complete with horses, guns, Indians, and of course a hero."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Hondo is the best story I ever read.

Look in any fast food place and it's packed, So we know why the truck drivers and landscapers and sanitary engineers are reputed to read Looie. But somebody should at least complain. Here is a master of false suspense, unsound motivation, stepping out of character, acts of God, and a need for copy editing (which he didn't allow after he becdame famous). Here in Hondo we find the first in the series of books in which his publisher invented &quot;the man who walks the land he writes about.&quot; As someone or other asked, &quot;Why didn't he 'ride' the land if he was such a hellacious Westerner?&quot; It occurred to his publishers (and perhaps him) rather late that he should and we saw those hokey TV Commercials where his stand in furiously rode a horse down a hill at risk of life and limb for both him and the horse. Then they thundered dirctly into the screen like a 'silent movie' freight train, the rider dismounted in a huge cloud of dust so you couldn't see him, and we see Looie standing, arms resting on top rail of a corral wearing a hat right off the rack. (And probably Gucci loafers, but the camera carefully stayed away from that part of him - as the cameras should have with Jack Dempsey posing as a welder in WWI, wearing spit polished shoes - but Jack wasn't a big hokey faker - it was actually him in the ring).So give us a break arreddy! In both the book and movie Hondo arrives somewhere in never never land after walking only fifty miles or so across the desert, packing his saddle. Ever pack a Western saddle? Even John Wayne who played the movie role couldn't have packed one a mile. C'mon. Give us a break. And after years of Looie PR hoke, we wonder why he didn't carry his dead horse to give it a ceremonial burial, as he carried his parched camel fifty miles to a waterhole in his bogus biographies, when he wasn't wrestling gorillas like Tarzan.If yer not a Looie reader, don't start."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"I've really got a thing for these Louis L'amour books at the moment. They hardly take a moment to read, but they are well-crafted and excellent reads. Hondo seems to be the ultimate Western man - he has lived at least part of his life with Apache, is a scout for the Army, and comes up against the Apache both as friend and foe.Hondo comes across a farm run by a woman and her son, she lies to him and tells her that her husband is away in the hills rounding cattle - Hondo knows that isn't true as there are no tracks leaving the place. He tries to convince her to come with him to the safety of the fort but she refuses. She has always been friends with the Apache and wants to remain on the property even though her husband has gone and is probably dead.Returning to the fort Hondo realises that things are bad and the woman and boy out there alone will probably die so he returns against orders, but not without the tacit consent of the fort's commander.He is tracked from the fort by two men intent on killing him - one of them is Ed Lowe, the woman's husband. Unfortunately for them group of Apache track them to the springs and the two men die trying to ambush Hondo - Hondo manages to kill two of the indians along with Ed Lowe. HOwever one indian has escaped to raise the alarm - and now Hondo is in danger, tracked by one of the vicious roaming Apache bands.This is very much the story of a man who knows his own code of justice and righteousness and is prepared to live and die by that code. His dog, Sam, is like him. A loner, but one who is loyal and trustworthy.What I really liked about this book is that most of the characters in it were shades of black and white rather than all good or all bad - for instance Vittoro, the Apache cheif - he was not all bad - as was Hondo. Both respected one another because theirs was a code of fairness rather than hatred. The characters who simply hated got their come-uppance.It moves along at a cracking pace, and although I like some of the later more humourous heros, I still really enjoyed this book - a great read."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"The best Western novel I have ever read. -John WayneHey look, I'm not about to argue with the Duke. Louis L'Amour is probably the best-selling Western writer of all time and Hondo his first big, and perhaps his best, novel. It is reminiscent of Shane (see Orrin's review) and Riders of the Purple Sage (see Orrin's review), but with Apaches on the warpath taking the place of hostile cattle ranchers or intolerant Mormons. Hondo Lane is the gun fighter, Army dispatch rider, hero who, along with his feral but loyal dog Sam, meets Angie Lowe and her young son Johnny who are homesteading in Apache territory in late 1800's Arizona. Angie has been abandoned by her low down snake of a husband, but refuses to leave her land. Hondo must ride back to the Fort to warn the Cavalry that the Apache chief Vittoro is on the move, but then returns to help defend woman and child.If the story does not quite reach the lofty literary heights of Shane--perhaps because the focus is so much on what Hondo needs from Angie and Johnny, as opposed to the way in which Shane was the object of the Starrett family's affection--it is still quite enjoyable. Three elements that really stand out and offer a contrast to the easy caricature of the genre are the respectful portrayal of the Apaches, the centrality of the romance angle to the story and the blithe depiction of the difficulty and brutality of frontier life. Even in so formulaic a tale as this one, the American Western demonstrates a level of maturity and nuance that critics seem bent on denying.With the possible exception of the romance novel, there is perhaps no other genre of fiction which the critics and academia take less seriously than the Western. But consider the fact that by the time of his death L'Amour had sold over 200 million books and among his avid legion of readers were two of the most decent men ever to become U.S. Presidents, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan. It seems to me that the failure of the intelligentsia to reckon with Western reflects poorly on themselves, rather than on the literature. L'Amour says at one point:No man knows the hour of his ending, nor can he choose the place or the manner of his going. To each it is given to die proudly, to die well, and this is, indeed, the final measure of the man.It is easy, too easy, to dismiss the ethos of the Western as a kind of macho posturing. But those lines and the general &quot;code of the West&quot;, however much it may be a fictional construct, reflect a concern with reputation which, when observed, has had a salutary effect on men. In an excellent essay on &quot;The Greatness of George Washington&quot; (Virginia Quarterly Review, Volume 68, Number 2) historian Gordon S. Wood traces Washington's greatness and his stature among his peers to what our generation would perceive as an overweening concern for his own reputation. But this same zealous regard for his own name and place in history motivated Washington to lead a life of exemplary moral rectitude and he created in himself the ideal man to lead a nascent and fragile democracy, a man capable of resisting the temptations of power because reputation was more important to him. It is no surprise then to find that two of the only other presidents we've had who can even approach him in stature immersed themselves in this idealistic and rigidly moralistic fiction. God knows what Bill Clinton reads (actually one book we know he enjoyed is Vox by Nicholson Baker, see Orrin's review), but rest assured, it ain't Louis L'AmourGRADE: A-"},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"The events of this very solid and compelling story are clearly based on, or at least loosely inspired by, real events in Arizona in 1861. There are many parallels with the Boscom affair and the kidnapping of Mickey Free, events that led to the Apache Wars and the campaigns of Cochise. It's L'Amour's comprehensive knowledge of the history and landscape of Arizona that helps to make this book special. The writing is consistently good, occasionally sublime; &quot;...the tips of the cottonwoods turned gold, like the sun-tipped lances of a moving army.&quot; L'Amour is particularly good with dialogue, a skill which is sadly lacking among most Western writers, making Zane Grey for example, almost unreadable. The only thing preventing &quot;Hondo&quot; from being great literature is the paper-thin characterization. Hondo Lane is an idealized, 'Hollywooden' hero and the villains lack any redeeming features that would make them credible. The depiction of the Apache is sympathetic, even to the extent that they too are often idealized (&quot;No Apache ever hit his child&quot;). The author's attempts to describe the developing feelings of the hero and heroine for each other are particularly gauche. L'Amour, it seems, cannot write l'amour. But, so what?

It is doubtful that it was planned that way, given that such matters are usually scheduled a year or so in advance. However, the interest in &quot;Deadwood,&quot; a graphic and gritty presentation that is not your daddy's &quot;Bonanza,&quot; will hopefully rekindle interest in the Western genre in general and L'Amour in particular.While L'Amour's name is known and revered to fans of the Western genre, he was in the somewhat unenviable position of having his work better known than he was to the general public. This was due primarily to the adaptation of his fine novels to epic films, such as How The West Was Won, The Shadow Riders and, of course, Hondo.L'Amour's HONDO is inexorably intertwined with John Wayne, who played the lead role of Hondo Lane in the 1953 film. It is hard to believe that the book of the same name was L'Amour's first full-length novel. L'Amour had confined himself to the magazine market up until then, honing his craft by refusing to sacrifice quality at the expense of quantity, writing for reliable publications such as Argosy (recently and brilliantly revived) and creating word paintings on a huge, adventurous canvas. The quality of HONDO demonstrates this for all time. Though over fifty years has passed since its publication, L'Amour's prose sparkles and shines with a brilliance that transcends time, place and fashion.Hondo is a mystery man, a loner, whose background is only roughly sketched throughout the novel in a passage here, a sentence there. He is a dispatch rider for General Crook, traveling through an Arizona desert that he knows as well as his own name. In his lifetime, he has lived among the Apache and the white man, usually uncomfortably. Hondo is a legend among both, a roughhewed individual who will live in peace if he is permitted but who will kill without hesitation if he is attacked or disturbed. As the novel begins the Apache are leaving the reservation, beginning a rebellion that will ultimately lead to their inevitable destruction.Hondo is on his way back to General Crook to bring him word of the uprising when he stumbles across a small ranch in the desert worked and defended by Angie Lowe and Johnny, her young son. Angie Lowe has been deserted by her husband but is not about to desert the land and small ranch that her father left to her. Lowe and Hondo find themselves attracted to each other following their brief meeting, and after Hondo completes his mission he is compelled to return to Lowe in an attempt to persuade her to leave the ranch in the face of the deadly Apache uprising.Vittorio, the chief of the Apaches, is also aware of Lowe, and respects her courage and that of Johnny. He desires to bring them into his tribe of Apache warriors. While he respects Hondo as well, there are those in his tribe who do not. One is Silva, who is motivated by hatred rather than nobility, and who has set his sight upon Lowe and her son in order to wreak a terrible vengeance. L'Amour painstakingly but quickly draws these disparate people and elements together, and if one anticipates the conclusion it is only because it is a classic one that L'Amour had a hand in creating.The ending of HONDO, in its way, is perfect: one is left wanting more, to learn what happened to Hondo Lane and to Angie Lowe, and yet what is revealed is enough. And while HONDO is firmly and finely steeped in the Western genre, its subject matter, and L'Amour's resounding skill as a wordsmith, transcends classification. HONDO is ultimately a necessity for any bookshelf, published in the edition that it has earned and deserves.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"This was the first full-length novel by L'Amour (1910-1988) and it was voted in 1977 as one of the top twenty-five western novels by the Western Writers of America.

The greatest Western writer and the greatest Western star, combine for the greatest Western ever."},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"I've always liked Westerns better in the movies than in fiction. What makes for good mythic archetypes on the silver screen often makes for something less than that on the printed page. Still, Louis L'Amour's Hondo worked for me. It's a tale of the tall silent loner, hard on the outside and a sensitive soul deep within, the kind of archetype first given us by James Fenimore Cooper's Hawkeye character in Last of the Mohicans. Since then writers of Westerns have reworked the character again and again. And L'Amour does it, as well, with Hondo Lane. He creates a supremely likeable loner who is equally at home with the Apache Indians as with the white settlers, and who is suddenly thrust into a situation in which he must worry about a lone settler woman and her six year old son living in Indian country as the Apaches rise up in rebellion at the broken treaty foisted on them by the white man. Vittoro, the old and implacable Apache chief, takes a shine to the woman's son when he shows unexpected pluck and extends his protection over the boy and his mother. But another Apache, Silva, balks at this, even as Hondo is heading to the homestead to rescue the mom and her son, the woman's ne'er-do-well husband hot on his heels, intent on murder and mayhem. Hondo must fight his way back to the woman and boy, despite the harsh enmity of the Apaches, and balance the demands of his army employers with the needs of the little family he has decided to adopt. It's a good, fast moving story though it hasn't much depth to it. Nor are the characters, who are mostly well drawn, very deeply portrayed. In the end its the drive of the narrative and the rich evocation of the Arizona desert that carry this one. L'Amour worked the Western myth as well in print as many contemporary filmmakers sometimes managed to do in celluloid. -- SWM"},{"Title":"Hondo (Louis L'Amour)","review":"A story that you can't stop reading it until it's finnished.A PIONEER WOMAN, THE GUNMAN, AND THE APACHE WARRIOR ARE CAUGHT IN A DRAMA OF LOVE, WAR, AND HONOR."},{"Title":"The Classic: 2 (The T.

And his relating it to ' classic works' which surely precede those of Vergil, what Arnold calls the Hellenic and Hebraic.As for the question of what makes a work one which all subsequent generations wish to read and reread, I believe this touches upon a question Kermode does not raise, i.e. What constitutes true literary greatness?'"},{"Title":"Think Light","review":"This is one of the most concise books I've read about dieting and healthy eating and, believe me, I've read them all.

Actually not all the photos are American, three were taken in Cuba in 1932. I prefer the second section with thirty-seven photos of buildings and the man-made landscape in the eastern part of the country. Several of these are regularly reprinted, year after year, in books, magazines and now on the net in blogs or sites dealing with architecture.The history of this famous book is quite fascinating. Over the years there have been four editions. Originally published by MoMA in 1938 (the five thousand copies were letterpress printed) to coincide with an exhibition of a hundred of Evans photos. Oddly forty-seven of these don't appear in the book and thirty-three in the book didn't make it to the exhibition. Even photos that appeared in both had different cropping or were from different negatives of the same event.The second edition, in 1962, was again published by MoMA in an edition of four thousand copies, letterpress printed from the 1938 plates. The third edition, with the photos now out of copyright, was published by the East River Press. This edition is best avoided because it was printed by offset-litho from pages in the 1938 book rather than from the original prints.This, the fourth edition, was again published by MoMA to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary in 1988. The eighty-seven photos here are printed as duotones, using a very fine screen, with prints made from the original negatives, but one exception which was made from the printed photo in the 1938 book because the negative had been destroyed.The original 1938 exhibition photos have long been forgotten, (though if you are interested they are shown inWalker Evans the Hungry Eye) so it is this book that carries on his legacy.

BUTTERFLIES is his largest collection of work to appear in English, but apparently there are nine others on deck ready to roll, and which have already been gladdening the hearts of Slovenians, who take it all in all must be a very literate population. What other books have blurbs from both Quebecoise genius Nicole Brossard and USA professional horndog Timothy Liu? We all remember Nabokov's butterflies, as symbols of the politically exiled nomad, thrust out of one land on a gentle or withering breeze, and pinned down later with cruel scholar's pins on a cork board under plexiglass. For Jack Spicer, butterflies were images of a gay love born in childhood, a tentative brush with the beautiful, a lesson in courage: \\"With our cupped hands we used to catch them/ And they answered us with a soft tickle/ For they never stopped flying.\\"For Mozetic, the butterflies might well be the words themselves that gather then scatter across the breadth of the page as though in some imaginary sylvan pasture. In the middle of the horror, a flash of vivid color. \\"Life lifts you, drops you like a drug,/ confused you turn your eyes, asking/ what's going on, it can't end like this,/ where is sense, where is history.\\" Translator Ana Jelnikar does an admirable job of turning Mozetic's complex verbal rhythms into an equivalent music of English, though we miss some of the harsh nasalized consonants and the acerbic vowels of the original.Something druggy and violent underlines this world vision, for Mozetic takes off from late Yeats and never really loses the thread. This volume is arranged as a long poem in 95 segments--shades of E E Cummings, whose \\"95 Poems\\" was the last book of new work the American modernist poet offered during his own lifetime (published 1958, the year of Brane Mozetic's birth)! It's a complicated eye-line: \\"through the window, they watch/ the cherries blossom, all crisp and red.\\" The \\"red\\" surprises even though, afterwards, you tell yourself, well, duh."},{"Title":"Earth Light : The Ancient Path to Transformation - Rediscovering the Wisdom of Celtic and Faery Lore","review":"This is the second in a series of books by R. J. Stewart on Celtic &amp; Faery Lore, The Underworld Initiation is the first in the series. It gives a basic outline and understanding. Earth Light starts putting those principles into action. The third book Power Within the Land is the companion book to Earth Light which the author states in the Introduction of Earth Light. He also states in The Underworld Initiation that it was an early work and written way before Earth Light and Power Within the Land.Anyone who plans on working with the Fae, These 3 books should be at the top of your list and should be read in this order to get the most out of them.

Stewart--without pomp and circumstance, without sequins and neo-pagan drag-shows--has laid out for the contemporary seeker an empowered articulation of a viable, profound, and transformational spiritual path that is as ancient--truly--as humanity. Drawn largely from Celtic, as well as pre-Celtic sources of visionary tradition, R.J. writes in a very down-to-earth manner about a stream of visionary tradition that a great many cultures have known and continue to know--a tradition that lies like a subterranean kingdom beneath what we take to be consensual reality. EARTH LIGHT is a masterful introduction to an ancient way of seeing that influenced the Druids, various Scottish seers, as well as a plethora of wisemen and wisewomen who defy an easy label. EARTH LIGHT is the first of three books I recommend reading together, the second being Power Within The Land, and the third one being The UnderWorld Initiation.

Many years ago Francis Turner Palgrave, a professor of poetry at Oxford, compiled a highly respected anthology of English lyrical poetry.I clearly recall my excitement in my first reading of Palgrave's collection. I have since become familiar with several other good anthologies, but Palgrave's remains my favorite.Palgrave's remarkable anthology of English lyrical poetry is found with various titles: \\"The Golden Treasury of the Best Songs and Lyrical Poems in the English Language\\", or &quot;Palgrave's Golden Treasury from Shakespeare to the Present&quot;, or \\"Palgrave's Golden Treasury\\", or simply \\"The Golden Treasury\\". Sometimes one title is found on the book cover and another on the title page.Palgrave's \\"The Golden Treasury\\" has remained continuously in print since 1861, with Oxford University Press editions in 1907, 1909, 1929, 1940, 1964 (Section V added), and 1994 (Section V1 added). New printings occur every few years.Today this remarkable anthology is now nearly 700 pages. The font size is large and easy to read.Palgrave's somewhat sparse footnotes are only available for Sections I-IV. Many readers may need a good dictionary for occasional archaic words and unfamiliar references to Greek and Roman mythology. I have found it quite helpful and entertaining to have a copy of Bulfinch's The Age of Fable nearby. Whichever edition and printing that you acquire, I hope you enjoy Palgrave's selections as much as I did. Cheers."},{"Title":"Palgrave's Golden treasury (Everyman's library)","review":"There's lots of good stuff in this book. It's very sturdy and has a poem for every mood.But sometimes, it felt like it was missing some of the classic poems I was looking for, but I'm not a hardcore English or poetry studier.

I recommend it as a good starting poetry anthology. =)"},{"Title":"Palgrave's Golden treasury (Everyman's library)","review":"This is a beautiful collection of poems from many eras and includes some very well-known favourites as well as a few more obscure ones. It is one of the most comprehensive anthologies and an old favourite for returning to again and again. Beautifully compiled and so much more uplifting than many modern anthologies!"},{"Title":"The Making of Modern Irish History: Revisionism and the Revisionist Controversy","review":"This collection of articles represents a political point of view about the politics of modern Irish history, not always to my personal taste, but carefully done, all the same.What I found most valuable was the 13 page introductory essay by the editors. It was worth the price of the entire book to me, as I can now follow much more readily discussions I encounter at home and on-line - who's revisionist, who's counter-revisionist, or why so-and-so is anti-revisionist.There are 10 essays by authors from several countries (including Wales and Australia). Each explores a topic; 18th century Ireland, the Act of Union between Britain &amp; Ireland, The Famine, Irish Nationalism, Irish Unionism, Home Rule and others. The editors' expressed intention is for a &quot;common thread&quot; of &quot;revisionism&quot; to link them all not only to the debate within Ireland, but to the international debate on methods of historical interpretation.As a 3rd generation Irish American, I was particularly interested in &quot;Revising the Diaspora&quot;, by co-editor Alan O'Day, which I found quite fascinating, as my ancestors arrived both pre- and post- Famine, having very different experiences here in the US. It also flourishes extensive footnotes (as do they all) for further exploration.If you're interested in modern Irish history, or in the methods and practice of history globally, this scholarly yet emminently readable book is well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Making of Modern Irish History: Revisionism and the Revisionist Controversy","review":"I am not sure why the previous reviewer only gave this book three stars when the review was quite positive.This book is really essential reading for any serious student of Irish history.

It's kind of a shame that between 1993 and 1997 Patrick Rogers wrote only six books (OMEGA series 3 books and Stony Man #21, 25, & 31) for GOLD EAGLE books, if SKYLANCE is any example his books would all be great reads.The \\"old enemy\\" is of course Japan, who is now at war with the U.S. in an economic war possibly to soon change to become a hot, shooting war. Mack Bolan and David McCarter are the two main characters involved throughout this story set mainly in the (Indonesian controlled) Baliem Valley, New Guinea, while others such as Barbara Price, Hal Brognola, Jack Grimaldi, Raphael Encizo, Gary Manning, Calvin James, and Gadgets Schwartz are involved as tangential backup throughout the story. The plot involves an American high tech, super airplane, one that can either fly as a normal plane or in fact go to deep space into orbit.Somehow the plane is knocked out of orbit by a \\"Buck Roger's\\" electrical discharge ray one which becomes clear that both Japan and Indonesia are involved. (A Japanese conglomerate calls the shots while the Indonesians supply most of the ground troops.) I found this 'death ray' to be a bit of a reach, too 'star wars' in design but this is fiction isn't it. Again when Grimaldi flies this 'crash landed' plane out to safety, another bit of a reach since the plane had earlier crashed landed and it's hard to believe the Japanese could quickly have repaired Skylance to a point of Grimaldi's, without any training, being able to fly this baby to safety. Then the action between Grimaldi and the four F-15s is a bit of a reach also.There is, however, much less 'padding' in this STONY MAN than with most, including the Super Bolan books, so the story flows smoothly along. My small criticisms of aspects of this book's believeability aside, I thought this was a very good read. The first part attempted rescue of Captain Mary Clark, U.S.A.F., on land and the second part of another rescue at sea kind of divided this book into two separate yet interesting parts. All items in the plot fit together and the book is a tightly written adventure story to please almost every GOLD EAGLE reader. Having hundreds of these GOLD EAGLE adventure series books on my shelves since the mid-1980s, I can vouch for the strength of this book. Again most readers, be they new or older ones, will enjoy this story. Another great read from the GOLD EAGLE-Worldwide library. Plus the cover art fits the book and its story, the cover shows a U.S. Navy nuclear attack submarine (USS Sam Houston 609 in the story) with fly over by a Skylance type plane.As Mack would say: Live large........Stay hard.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Skylance (Stony Man, No. 25)","review":"First, I've been big on the Bolan stories for over a decade, and have built up quite a collection. Yes, I even reread them as time permits. Well, I saw that one called Skylance was coming out, so, I *had* to read it... A: Bolan book, B: I've been using the Skylance name for a while before that... Well, this was a great book, exceding both the reputation of the series, and my expectations based on history and name! great action and plot development, and some minor twists along the way which allowed for future adventures to follow some threads from this episode. I like trilogies and series, and I like one-shot ended episodes. However, I liked how this one concluded nicely, without much hint of continuation, which allows for a greater depth of storyline development! Also, great work went in this story to introduce TJ Hawkins the newest member to Phoenix Force. We see the rise of David McCarter to team leader, the addition, and blending of the &quot;rookie&quot;, and the fact that our former PF commander Yakov Katzenelenbogen now has a new position back at The Farm. Great way to keep him involved!"},{"Title":"Night of Masks (Dipple, Bk. 3)","review":"Night of Masks (1964) is a standalone SF novel in the Dipple universe. A decade after the war, the Displaced Persons center remained on Korwar. Some inhabitants of the Dipple found their way out by working as casual laborers in Tikil, others by shipping offplanet in frozen sleep and a few by buying membership in the Thieves Guild.In this novel, Nik Kolherne was one of the unlucky ones who stayed behind in the center. He had been evacuated from his planet on a space freighter that was forced down by the enemy. Most of the crew and passengers had died in the crash, but Nik was saved from the wreck.After the rescue, the Dipple medical staff tried to regrow the torn and burned flesh on his face, but the attempts were unsuccessful. His disfigurements disturbed possible employers, so he cannot find a job on the outside. He even habitually hides his features from his fellow residents.One day, Nik is settling down in a warehouse to listen to another fantasy escape tape when he overhears three men discussing an illegal operation. Although he stays as quiet as possible, one detects his presence and lifts him out of his hiding place. Another hits him and knocks him unconscious.When Nik recovers, he finds himself in the home of Stowar, a man with connections and one of the conspirators. Captain Leeds -- the spacer who had discovered his presence -- recruits Nik for a risky proposition that will entail replacement of his face. Nik will do anything for a new face.In this story, Nik is inserted onto the villa grounds, appearing to Vandy as a fantasy hero from the child's dreams, and conducts him to a lifeboat that will take them away from Korwar. They travel in stasis and Nik does not recover consciousness until the LB is about to land. Vandy becomes frightened by the pressure and seems to be questioning the Hacon identity, but Nik calms the boy until they have landed.Dis is a planet of a red dwarf that doesn't emit visible light. The infra-red starshine leaves the world in perpetual darkness. The man who meets them after landing is wearing cin-goggles to transform the IR light to something human eyes can see. Fabic takes them to a set of native ruins that have been converted to human quarters. On the way, he blasts an attacking carnivore out of the sky.Later, Fabic takes Nik to meet Orkhad, the local veep. Orkhad is a suequ weed smoker, which tends to make the user believe himself capable of any feat. Orkhad doesn't seem to have a high opinion of Leeds, but is willing to let Nik remain just to keep the boy peaceful. During the conversation, Orkhad says several things that contradict the story told by Leeds.Vandy is very upset with the whole situation and conflicted over his feelings toward Hacon, the fantasy hero. He tries the door and finds it locked. Later he tries the door once again and finds it unlocked. Nik holds him back to plan their actions and then leads the escape.They find one pair of cin-goggles and a pair of blasters in the living quarters and then sneak out through the tunnels. Far from their former quarters, they discover a hole to the outside. Nik leads them into the Dis darkness.This story shows the adventures of Nik and Vandy under the dark sun. They find various forms of dangerous birds and beasts and are followed by several pack animals having more than usual intelligence. With only one set of goggles, Nik wears them most of the time, but passes them to Vandy as needed.They use and lose their store of emergency rations and try to eat a native fish. Vandy has a violent reaction to the meat. Nik decides that he must risk their safety by returning to the tunnels.This tale shows more about the Thieves Guild and their spacebased subsidiary, the Brethren. However, the author is still developing the Thieves Guild subculture. Later works will flesh out this skeleton into a separate subculture.Recommended for Norton fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of strange planets, future criminals, and high adventure.-Arthur W.

The Better Homes & Gardens cookbooks are generally pretty good, at least to the extent that I almost always find a number of recipes to try, and several that go into my recipe file. This book is divided into the obvious sections -- soups & stews, meat dishes, poultry, and sides -- plus sections on sweets (they're trying to hard with some of them, just to be able to include them in a slow-cooker book) and party snacks & beverages. I enjoyed the \\"Corn and Sausage Chowder\\" (except that it calls for turkey sausage -- yech! -- and I used smoked beef sausage) with French bread, and the \\"South of the Border Steak Beans\\" was good (flank steak, bell peppers, pinto beans, and feta cheese, with lots of spices and served over rice). Things like buffalo wings and mini-meatballs do really well in a slow-cooker and you can keep them hot at a party. I've also made hot cider for Christmas get-togethers in a crockpot, and there's an interesting variation of that here, too.

He interviewed old time racers and their families to give you a look at what there lives where like. Stories about Curtis Turner, Fireball Roberts, Tim Flock, Maurice Petty and many others capture your attnetion for hours. This book is an absolute must have for any true NASCAR fan."},{"Title":"The Last Lap: The Life and Times of NASCAR's Legendary Heroes, Updated Edition","review":"Peter Golenbock first became involved in NASCAR with American Zoom, an oral history of the sport up to the 1992-3 seasons. Zoom was a superb look at the sport as seen from a variety of personalities. Golenbock, though, has outdone himself greatly with this superior oral history.Golenbock interviews a variety of people involved in the sport since its 1949 inception. Featured are Tim Flock, in one of his last interviews before his passing; the widows of Curtis Turner and Dewayne &quot;Tiny&quot; Lund; Buddy Baker; Harry Hyde's nephew Tommy Johnson; Ralph Moody; Maurice Petty; and on.The insights provided are often immortal. There is Maurice Petty's take on his brother Richard's career; he gives interesting insight into the factory wars of the 1960s, particularly Ford's involvement. &quot;Ford (was) able to win the.... championship in 1968 because they threw a lot of Fords out there, a lot of drivers. They just kept throwing them out there....&quot; Thirty ye! ars later, Ford's &quot;buy-the-starting-field&quot; tactic is still paying off.The most heartbreaking section is Wanda Lund Early's story of her relationship with &quot;Tiny&quot; Lund, the 1963 Daytona 500 winner, who was killed in a horrendous pileup in the 1975 Talladega 500. In a cruel irony, Lund had not even qualified for that race, but when Grant Adcox's chief mechanic Gene Lovell died of a heart attack the day before the race, Adcox withdrew, and Lund - the first alternate - got his spot.Wanda's relationship with Tiny got off to a decidedly bizarre start. &quot;He turned me over on his knee&quot; and spanked her &quot;like a two year old. Then we were an item after that.&quot; She relates how Tiny had not particularly wanted to race at Talladega that day, but had given his word to owner A.J. King. Wanda's retelling of the gnawing trepidation that kept her from even listening to MRN Radio's call of the race that day leave's the reader sweating.But the mos! t fascinating chapters are those of Lou Larosa. An engine ! builder with some of the best teams the sport has ever seen, Larosa gives a tremendously interesting insight into the evolution of the sport from the early 1970s to today. He relates the rise of drivers Darrell Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt, and is quite harsh on some of the sport's biggest names.Some of Larosa's insights are genuinely surprising: one would never have thought that the Rod Osterlund team with which Earnhardt and Larosa won the 1980 Winston Cup title would have almost closed down even before the 1980 season began. Yet it was winnings from race purses that carried the team until sponsorship from businessmen Warner Hodgedon and Mike Curb came along in May of that year.Larosa also gives a sharp insight into modern factory politics. When he and Earnhardt joined Richard Childress Racing in 1984, a top Chevrolet official told Larosa that they were, in essense, forbidden from winning the championship: &quot;That's Junior Johnson's territory.&quot; Despite that,! RCR Enterprises won 25 races and two championships spanning 1984 through 1988.But the politics continued. The 1988 season was a very frustrating one for RCR. For one thing, Pontiac, working with the Brodix company, had developed a hnew cylinder head that provided 25 extra horsepower, yet Chevrolet forbade its teams from using Pontiac/Brodix heads until late in the '88 season. &quot;The bottom line was that they weren't going to let me use something that wasn't made by Chevrolet. &quot;Instead of Chevrolet saying, 'We're getting beat, we need to go to work,' they were still saying, &quot;Our parts are the best.'....Chevrolet was fat, dumb, and lazy, had no competition per se, until this other stuff came along.&quot; It is telling that, several years later, GM merged the racing programs of its divisions together under Chevrolet leadership and in effect destroyed non-Chevy GM programs. It helps explain the growing lack of wins by GM teams in Winston Cup today.Larosa ! saves his greatest fire for crew chief Larry McReynolds. M! cReynolds had criticized Larosa and his engines in American Zoom, and Larosa gets even with a vengeance, detailing incidents of such jaw-dropping incompitence on the part of McReynolds that it is a wonder that the man has any kind of racing job.Larosa is no less harsh on people he had to deal with in what turned out to be his last engine building job, with Darrell Waltrip's now-defunct team. His most stinging criticism is aimed at Waltrip himself. &quot;Darrell and crew chiefs and Darrell and engine builders don't get along too well. Because it's never Darrell's fault. It's never him. It's ALWAYS someone else.....Darrell hated (crew chiefs and engine builders)....because Darrell has always been a follower, not a leader, not an innovative person. (Even as a driver in the 1970s and '80s) he was a follower, and you can't win races following what other people do.&quot;The collapse of Waltrip's team came after he signed a sponsor that had already been bankrupt for man! y months. &quot;But Darrell was susceptible to that sort of person, the people who blew smoke.....it's because deep down he doesn't have faith. He says he does, but he has never had faith in his own people. Instead, he's always belittled them.&quot;Larosa delivers an indictment of modern racing: &quot;Racing has turned into a commercial. It doesn't matter whether he wins anymore. All that matters is that he's a good spokesman for the sponsor. And Dale Earnhardt can deny it - they all can deny it - but the T-shirt sales and the souvenirs are more important than the race team. They'll say, 'We want to win.' Bull.....Where is the priority when you make $4 million racing and $40 million selling souvenirs?&quot; True blooded racing people are &quot;getting pushed to the side to make room for the b.s. people with computers.....they can take their computers....because that ain't racing like it used to be.&quot;At Texas Motor Speedway in April of 1998, track presiden! t Eddie Gossage promised to sell T-shirts marked, &quot;Shu! t Up And Race.&quot; Gossage got hammered for it. Reading this excellent book, one is hard pressed to disagree with him."},{"Title":"The Last Lap: The Life and Times of NASCAR's Legendary Heroes, Updated Edition","review":"At first, I was hesitant to pick up this book, as Golenbock is not exactly one of the most popular names in NASCAR writing. His last work on NASCAR - American Zoom - was filled with glaring errors and misinformation about the history of the sport. However, after sitting and reading merely a few pages from The Last Lap (...), I could tell this book was much different. Golenbock tells the history of NASCAR from a driver's standpoint instead of merely describing races and race results. Each era of racing is related to a different driver. He also tells the stories of several lesser known drivers who happened to have lost their lives prematurely. If you are a racing fan, I recommend this book.

The protagonist (Kemp) may possibly be less humble and more rebellious than a person of his birth would be expected to behave, and the behavior of the nobility less autocratic than they actually were, but all-in-all, it's a very good read.I recommend it without reservation for those interested in this genre."},{"Title":"Principles of tax-deferred exchanging","review":"this information saved us a lot of legal work and had excellent ideas for complicated exchanges."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"I am new to William Lashner and the Victor Carl series, but after reading this novel I know that I will go back to check out the previous ones and I will keep checking for his future works. There are several aspects I enjoyed about this author's work, some of them related to the plot and others to the writing style.For example, I liked reading a story told by a hero that is imperfect. He is not the tough guy that beats everyone up when needed to, or the super successful lawyer that always has all the answers and knows how to proceed. Victor Carl is an average man, who works as a lawyer, and whose fate will involve him with a mysterious character named Dr. Bob. Lashner starts the story when Victor is in a bar with Bob and when the latter goes to the restroom, Victor takes his glass and puts it in an evidence bag. This is an example of the kind of tools the author uses to pique our interest.Victor then proceeds to tell us the story of how he got to that situation with Bob, the dentist. The events that are part of this narration are complex and as a result the novel possesses plenty of twists and turns. It all starts with Francois Dube, a Frenchman accused of killing his wife, and with the vast amount of evidence the district attorney has against him. Victor dislikes his client but needs the money, so he takes the case. Also, he loves fighting for the underdog, and this situation qualifies perfectly. When Victor experiences a toothache, and someone recommends Dr. Bob, the story gets really interesting.In my experience, I have determined that when mystery novels have side plots they are more riveting. In this case, Victor is assigned a pro bono case involving a kid named Daniel Rose, and he has to make a recommendation on the adequacy of the kid living with his mother. This will lead to a meeting with an enigmatic old man that pushes him to dig to the core of the issue. This side plot works well with the rest of the story, helping to keep the pace up.Lashner has clearly and successfully won me over. He has done this through his clever writing and his ability to create three-dimensional characters that make reading a pleasure. The fact that he knows how to use humor through Victor's comments is an added benefit that makes the book even easier to read and to enjoy. As I mentioned, I have not read the previous installments in the series, but I believe this book stands well on its own. So if you are considering trying out this author, my recommendation is to go ahead, I believe you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"This one of Lashner's lesser efforts. Dull and slow paced. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Stop now. Get this book. You can stop searching for a bit and settle down with this one. Take the phone off the hook. Give yourself the gift of a day and don't break the spell. Trust me on this.Lashner IS the answer to your prayers plus he is a MORE than just a \\"good mystery writer.\\" He is that miracle of miracles, the writer who transcends stereotypes and grips your heart, wakes you up, makes you realize that genre writing can be made special by the right writer. This is the book to give your friends who THINK they don't like mysteries....or, for that matter, who think they don't like reading.Now- about this PARTICULAR book, Falls that Shadow. Yes, it IS a crime/mystery/suspense novel. But it is also far, far more than that. On the surface, it is the story of Victor Carl, a lawyer who does his jobs and leaves ethics and morality to others.But when a beautiful woman is slain and a mystery \\"watcher\\" insinutates himself into Carl's life, he is thrown into a case which forces him to explore hidden aspects of the human heart and drags him (reluctantly) to come to grips with some of the shakier aspects of his own values and ethics.This book is likely to have you saying \\"Wow!\\" ---- between bouts of stopping your reading for a moment and thinking (deeply) about the issues brought up by Lashner.If you like Grisham, you deserve to treat yourself to the next notch up in legal writing. Lashner is that...and more. I hope he writes something besides legal thrillers. I'll be on the lookout for WHATEVER he writes. The man is a master of his craft and I'll bet he's going to go even farther, come out with a book that tops THIS one. I hope so. I hope he's still honing his skills, although he's plenty good enough already.Want another clue to how good the guys is? Fine, don't just take my word for it...Consider this: \\"mass market\\" paperbacks on Amazon typically are sold by Marketplace sellers for a penny or or so within weeks of release. At the time I wrote this review, the lowest price was $1.67. That speaks volumes about how much readers value this writer, how they savor his words and how they're willing to pay $1.67 (plus shipping) for a book that retails for $7.99. In other words, the price isn't dropping like a stone, as is typical for mass market paperbacks here, even new ones. That ought to tell you THIS is a writer worth checking out, a guy who deserves to be on the bestseller lists and whose books are so special they ought to be collectors' items.I'm rereading this one. Its worth savoring again."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"This latest sortie from William Lashner is not quite as eggregiously boring as Veritas. The latter has to be one of the worst books ever written. The experience of reading it was akin to wandering through a muddy field wearing a sodden macintosh. Heavy, heavy going. I have run across second hand booksellers who confessed to me they couldn't even unload it fo $0.50 and ended up resorting to using it as a doorstop.Falls the Shadow doesn't rise to the masteful storytelling of Hostile Witness - still one of my favourite books - but it does have its moments and characters. Horace T. Grant is almost someone you know or have met. And nearly every human with teeth has been through the dreadful experience of sitting in a dentist's chair.Yet for all of that and the usual biting observations from Mr. Lashner the story doesn't resolve satisfactorily. Not quite as bovine as a Hawaii 5-0 episode where 5 minutes before the ending McGarret pulls out a file and all is resolved; and not as absurd as some science fiction material, nonethless the ending can be said to be utterly stupid.The kind of book you wonder why bothered reading.I am going to leave it on my shelf alongside Bitter Truth, Fatal Flaw and my cherished Hostile Witness. But if Mr. Lashner wants to keep eating cheese steaks at my expense he is going to have to do better than this silly denouement of blaming the dentist. It's totally idiotic."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"I was wonderfully surprised to read that some fans of Lashner's consider this his weakest book. It's the first one that I've read and if this is the worst, then I have a lot to look forward to.This is the stylish tale of a Philadelphia lawyer whose sense of self-esteem is low, but whose sense of self-interest is very high indeed. Stripped of any pretenses to altruism, he's able to give us readers a cold-blooded, although always very funny account of his doings.(for a comparable P.o.v., seeTruth or BareThere are, as in much good detective fiction-two overlapping plots here. One involves a criminal appeal, the other a child-welfare case. It's unlikely that anyone would get too excited about these tales in themselves, but Lashner's eye for the ridiculous, his ability to put together the slightly mad scene and the droll dialog are quite enough in themselves.For those readers with a literary jones, there are two characters at the edge of each plot, a dentist and a chess hustler who have a Graham Greene-like presence that engages the curiosity and lifts this book well above its genre.

He knows he's venal, but he also knows he has a heart. In a way, Lashner is too good, in that all of his characters crackle with wit, are capable of the double entendre, make trenchant observations on their fellow men and the state of mankind.

Read it for the dialogue. Read it for the humor.Just read it."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"This was my first experience with Victor Carl, an admitted benefactor of his own self-interests and ambiguous values. He also possesses an amazing wit, ever at hand with a wry remark or trenchant observation. Thanks to the good nature of his partner, Beth Dillinger, Carl takes on the appeal of Franoise Dube, a man previously found guilty of murdering his estranged wife. When the lawyers uncover grounds for an appeal and Dube is granted a new trial, Victor is less than thrilled, although the delivery of a hefty retainer does much to improve his mood.The office is buried in case files as Victor and Beth prepare for a new trial. An assortment of bizarre characters await: the murdered woman's sister, Velma, who is bankrolling the appeal; Seamus Dent, an apparently not-so-innocent bystander who placed Franoise at the scene of the crime in the first trial; a hard-boiled but soft-hearted detective who tries to save one of the desperate souls in his path; Dube's former attorney, now so wrapped up in his own dance with death that he turns a blind eye to the truth; Horace T. Grant, a curmudgeonly old man who directs Victor on the path of righteousness; and the ubiquitous dentist, Dr. Pfeffer, whose tentacles are everywhere, a self-proposed do-gooder who has no personal constraint when manipulating the lives of others.There are some choice moments to savor along the way, like the three crones gossiping on their apartment house steps, cackling like the three witches from Macbeth, karaoke night at the Elvis bar, King's Dominion, Carl's out-of-body experience while enjoying a romantic dalliance with a beautiful woman whose directions are more like a game of Twister than affection and the attorney's assorted torturous ordeals writhing in the avid Dr. Pfeffer's dental chair. Lasher knows how to stage a scene, eccentric characters, moody atmosphere and all.This engrossing mystery is a microcosm of life in the real world, where money and power hold sway and the ill-prepared, under funded everyman is the lowest rung on the food chain. But this lesson is taught with great panache, subtle twists of fate that prove, again and again, how precipitous arrogance can lead to a long fall. A great sense of the humorous, edgy dialog and a dynamite plot with plenty of complications add up to a story well worth the price of admission. But if you haven't been to the dentist for a while, some of the gruesome procedures described may keep you away for a few more years.Lashner is a master of cunning and innovative plot twists; a defense attorney, the author well knows the intricacies of circumstantial evidence and facile testimony, the easy deception inherent in human nature. In other words, he writes what he knows so well, trial law: the good, the bad and the ugly, all together in this highly imaginative novel that will set your teeth on edge. Luan Gaines/2005."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"When you achieve a certain level of success in writing, you become the exemplar against whom all others are compared. In horror fiction, this would be Stephen King. In fantasy it would be Tolkien. For legal thrillers, this ideal would be John Grisham. That is not to say Grisham is good (or that he's bad), but he is the standard by which all are measured, and by this standard, William Lashner is not only better than Grisham, he is one of the best in his field.Falls the Shadow is Lashner's fifth novel about Philadelphia lawyer Victor Carl. Carl aspires to be a completely mercenary lawyer but despite his best efforts, seems to be plagued with integrity and a conscience. In this story, he takes on the case of Francois Dube, currently in prison for the murder of his estranged wife, Leesa. Not only has he been found guilty (despite having a top-notch lawyer), he has exhausted many appeals. The evidence is so clearly against him, the reader knows he must be innocent. Carl has no such doubts, but as long as the check clears, he's willing to handle the case.Besides looking for possible avenues to a retrial, Carl also must contend with some significant dental problems. In the course of his investigation, he is referred to Dr. Bob Pfeffer, an odd fellow who may be a good dentist but also seems somehow entangled in the Dube case. Is Pfeffer a good guy or a bad guy? Determining this will help solve the mystery as to who killed Leesa.There is more that Carl must contend with. His partner, Beth Derringer, seems to have developed an irrational attraction to Dube, a man who - even if innocent of murder - appears to Carl to be a sick human being. In addition, he has been forced into a pro bono case (the worst sort of case for Carl because it doesn't pay); he is to represent a four-year old named Daniel who is in a bad family situation. Carl is further drawn into this case when it appears Daniel has a missing sister.As with the other Victor Carl books, Lashner has done well with this one. It has a good plot and as always, the story succeeds because of Carl's witty narration. If you enjoy legal thrillers, this is one worth reading."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Anytime you want an exercise in reading good writing, writing that will cary you into the wee hours of the night, writing that will have you wondering how on earth it all turns out, writing that will give you fits of envy if you harbor any ideas of authorship yourself, then I recommend you slip into a William Lashner novel and his most recent is as good a place to start as any.Victor Carl has no illusions about himself. He would like to be witty, charming, a dragon in the criminal court room, a lion in the bed room, a fashion plate, and without fear. Alas, while he is far from being the schmuck he would like you to believe he is, life is a struggle for our hero.This episode starts with Victor and Beth Derringer, the smarter and better looking half of the team of Derringer and Carl interviewing a convicted murderer. He has paid them $500 for the opportunity to talk to them and to try and convince them to take on his quest for a new trial because, what else, he is innocent. A review of the basic facts of the case convince Carl otherwise and he has no intention of becoming involved, until he is asked \\"How about if I arrange for you to be paid whatever money you require?\\" When the sum of $10,000 is promised, Carl notes in an aside to the reader, \\"See, sometimes it is just that easy to fall down a hole.\\"And down he falls. Perhaps no one since Alice in Wonderland has had such an adventure from such a fall.The first problem is to find grounds for a new trial. It will not spoil the read to disclose that finding the grounds is the least of Carl's problems. With the new trial secured Carl starts on an adventure that seems to be a true Don Qixote quest. As the trial suffers through various twists and turns there is a sub-story involving Carl's involuntary pro bono work in the family court. It is funny, touching, poignant and slightly interwoven with events that are transpiring in the larger issue in his life.Some years ago there was a movie entitled, \\"What About Bob?\\" This book could have had the same title and if that sounds like a non sequitur, then you need to read the book to find out about Bob. Carl describes Bob to the reader by noting that \\"...every so often, I run across a force of nature that shakes my sublime self centeredness to the very roots. Soomething that tears through the landscape like a tornado, leaving nothing but ruin and reexamination in its wake. Something like Bob.\\"I assure you the read will be worth the time and that if you are not a Lashner fan yet, you will be."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Leesa Dube was shot in the chest in her own home, the picture of her estranged husband Francois clutched in her hand. The couple was in the middle of a bitter divorce fighting for custody of their daughter. In his home they found a bloody towel and a blood spot on his boot, a perfect match to Leesa's blood. A jury convicted him of murder and sentenced him to life in prison.Three years after his conviction Francois hires attorney Victor Carl and his partner Beth to get his verdict overturned and to obtain a new trial. To Victor's surprise he finds suppressed evidence that earns the con a new trial. While preparing for the legal battle of his life, the courts appoint Victor to work pro bono representing four year old Daniel who is taken out of his home because of his mother's neglect. Weaving throughout Victor's life is his dentist Bob, who has a Messiah complex and works in the shadows to right the world's wrongs. Victor is not sure whether Bob is a Good Samaritan or a master manipulator with adulating followers who carry out his desires whether they are good or evil.Anyone who has a dental phobia will never want to visit a dentist after reading about Dr. Bob and the lengths he will go to in order to make the world a better place even if the methods he uses turn out to be illegal. Victor tries hard to remain uncaring and cynical but his nurturing nature propels him to lend a helping hand when he is needed. Readers will admire him and more so William Lashner who is one of the best writers of legal thrillers on the market today.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"A extremely interesting courtroom drama that introduces one of the most different characters I have seen - Dr. Bob. The author briefly introduces Dr. Bob at the beginning of the story. Dr. Bob gives the appearance of being a nerd but he can transform in a second.The story then follows Victor Carl, an attorney who is asked to represent a convicted murderer for his appeal. The convict offers no new information but offers to pay Victor to represent him and that is enough for Victor to do so.Victor is able to convince a judge through a technicality to overturn the original trial for the convict (Francois) and get a retrial.The story seems to grab you as Victor tries to clear Francois, help locate a missing girl for whom he is working pro bono, while the mysterious Dr. Bob seems to be the link to everything that happens in the story. I really enjoyed this one and will look for more books by the same author."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Setting his 5th thriller in Philadelphia (where he lives) was a good move for author Lashner as it enables him to accurately paint his setting, and give listeners much to smile about as he describes some of the nabobs in the City of Brotherly Love. Saying Lashner made a good move isn't exactly a news flash. Readers of his 2004 best seller, \\"Past Due, know that he seldom errs.Another of Lashner's better choices is the creation of defense attorney Victor Carl who isn't known for his strict observance of law and morals. Carl has a mind that won't quit and an ego that matches. He's also one of the most intriguing protagonists on the printed page.Carl has taken on the task of trying to get a new trail for convicted murderer, Francois Dube. Obviously, Dube is French; he also a chef and his supposed murder victim? His very beautiful wife.Almost as an aside, although it turns out to be much more than that, Carl develops a painful toothache for which he seeks relief from Dr. Bob. Now, Dr. Bob isn't just your ordinary drill and pay dentist, he's someone who very much wants to help his patients in every aspect of their lives. Very much wants is putting it mildly - Dr. Bob is obsessive about meddling and making changes in others where he feels they should be made.In true thriller fashion it soon appears that there is tie-in between the determined dentist and Dube's late wife.What a treat to enjoy enjoy Lashner's ever present humor, intricate plotting, and charismatic characters.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Just for the record, I'm a big fan of William Lashner. \\"Past Due\\", \\"Fatal Flaw\\", \\"Hostile Witness\\" - gripping legal drama all, rising above the pack of this tired genre on the strength of Lashner's witty dialogue and his self depreciating lawyer-hero Victor Carl. So in view of the unblemished string of five-star reviews, cut me some slack if I tell you that \\"Falls the Shadow\\" is not up to the Lashner standards we've come to expect.This is by no means a bad novel. Many of the strengths of earlier Lashner - the gritty Philadelphia neighborhoods, characters with more depth than the average cardboard cutout, storylines running from the unusual to the bizarre - are all here. Told in the first person, the story unfolds as easily as if Carl were telling it to the reader over a brew at a Philly watering hole. But this time around, the story feels tired, forced, lacking energy as Victor Carl grinds through familiar haunts feeling like one of \\"The Hollow Men\\" of the TS Elliot-referenced title.We find Carl and partner Beth Derringer taking on the case of Francois Dube, already serving time for the murder of his wife. Dube, an insufferable French chef, maintains his innocence and, with financial backing from the equally obnoxious gold digger Velma Takahashi, convinces Carl, against all odds, to pursue a retrial. True to Lashner's offbeat form, a meddling dentist, \\"Bob\\", plays a key role in the mystery of the Dube murder, as well as in a side plot involving a reluctant Carl's role in a pro bono case of child neglect. Maybe it's the combination of annoying Frenchmen and of uncomfortable time in a dentist's chair. Or maybe it's the absence of the brutal color typically provided by Carl heavy Phil Skink, or the unnecessary tension between Carl and Beth. Perhaps it's the rather contrived climax, or the confluence of too many players with too many stories trying too hard to deliver too many morals. But whatever the source, when all the drama has finally played out and the enigma that is Dr. Bob is unraveled, \\"Falls the Shadow\\" simply misses the mark. A better-than-average legal thriller, for sure, but one that ultimately fails to generate passion, falling short of Lashner's uncommon talents."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Why would a man,already once convicted and refused appeal in the brutal murder of his wife, deserve another trial?In William Lashner's Falls the Shadow, criminal defense attorney Victor Carl is presented with the unenviable task of defending Francois Dube. It starts when Carl mysteriously receives a retainer and an invitation to meet Dube. Carl's certainty that there will not be another trial--and any appeal he may present will be denied--is confounded by his partners' own confidence that Dube is not guilty of the crime for which he has been sentenced to life in prison.Victor Carl is a cynical, wisecracking attorney that has seen too much and been flayed so many times by clients that his outer shell it grown hard. Yet, the ethical baselines he adheres to for his clients are truth and honesty. He does not break the rules, occasionally to his chagrin, but uses every ounce of his mettle to work on his client's behalf. Francois Dube evolves into a character that proves to be as nauseating a person as one could meet, but Carl does not waver in his assertion that his client be given the best shot at proving his innocence.This novel has some brilliant twists and turns. Just when you think Victor Carl has the solution, the plot twists takes a hard right. When it looks as though the perpetrators of the main and subplots have been discovered, Lashner throws a curveball and resets the story.The cast of characters will rapidly draw you into this intriguing legal thriller. William Lashner introduces and develops them in such a way as to bind you into the story with your own thoughts of ethics. The main antagonist, a dentist of all things, yes I thought that brilliant, proves to be more than a match for Victor Carl as he unbinds a thoroughly unnerving tale of personal saviors working outside the law and legal systems to the benefit of those that would never have a chance for a better life.Armchair Interviews asks: Need a book for the beach, cabin, lake, desert, mountaintop or lonely iceberg? Falls the Shadow will serve you well."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"All of the Victor Karl books have been very good. But this one is a major leap forward. Lashner's writing keeps getting better and better, especially his pacing through the book. We meet a character named Bob in the opening stages, and when Lashner brings him into the book later on it is such a great setup that I laughed out loud. It is wonderful to read a book that is so well written. Even a mediocre story can be palatable if well written, but this has everything. If you have read his earlier books you will want this. If you are new to his work you might want to go back to the start and watch the progression of not only the characters but his writing. Probably one of the better books I read in the past few years."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"How nice it is to see a William Lashner novel once again. Since FATAL FLAW, Lashner has been publishing on an annual basis, increasing quantity and quality in direct proportion. 2004's PAST DUE contained one of my favorite passages of that year, a description of a crime scene that paralleled a Nativity display. FALLS THE SHADOW, Lashner's latest effort, similarly has a memorable passage, a long, dark description of a slim, slow fall from grace for three individuals and the redemption of two of them.As with Lashner's other novels, FALLS THE SHADOW features Victor Carl, an eternally struggling defense attorney whose considerable courtroom acumen is not matched by his office management talents, or lack thereof. There are several stories that take place here; front and center is Carl's defense of Francois Dube. Dube has been tried and convicted of murdering his estranged wife, and retains the reluctant services of Carl and his partner, the not-so-reluctant Beth Derringer, in his efforts to obtain a second --- and hopefully exculpatory --- trial. Dube looks guilty as guilty can be, given his fiery relationship with his wife and the presence of the murder weapon in his apartment. There also is the inescapable fact that Dube is...well, he probably belongs in prison even if he didn't kill his wife.Carl, however, is compelled to joust at windmills, and when he discovers that one of the chief witnesses against Dube --- a young man now deceased --- had a history that goes to the issue of his credibility, he decides that there might be something worth pursuing in this case. But his unease is almost palpable, and the fact that Dube seems to be exerting an almost Svengali-like influence over Derringer doesn't help matters.At the same time Carl finds himself appointed as guardian ad litem for a troubled child whose difficulties are much worse than they appear on the surface. Carl is not exactly guardian material --- and he is the first to admit it --- but, as has been so subtly demonstrated in Lashner's past novels, there is much to admire in Carl, once one gets past his wisecracking facade. Indeed, Lashner plumbs heretofore unseen depths of Carl's personality, and the result is --- dare I say it? --- ultimately heartwarming. But don't tell anybody.One would think that the foregoing would be enough to carry two novels, but Lashner, as always, gives his readers more. FALLS THE SHADOW also introduces Dr. Robert Pfeiffer --- Bob to his patients --- a dentist who fancies himself as a fixer, and who does not limit that description to teeth. Dr. Bob is an interesting character, so interesting in fact that he threatens to hijack the entire novel away from Carl. If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, one can easily visualize Dr. Bob standing there, smiling, laying the brick and mortar and glad for the opportunity. I predict that Lashner's ever-increasing legion of readers can reasonably expect to see more of Dr. Bob at some future time, perhaps in a forthcoming Carl novel or even in a nightmare.FALLS THE SHADOW is yet another in an unbroken string of memorable novels from Lashner, a worthy successor to last year's PAST DUE. If you have never been introduced to Lashner or to Carl, now is the time to jump on. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Throughout Lashner's Victor Carl series, the lawyer-hero Carl is, by his own (frequent) admission, self centered and venal and sometimes dull-witted, a sharp contrast to his steady, centered, partner Beth Derringer. Both lawyers play against character in this outing, with Victor being insightful and altruistic (to the point of self endangerment), while Beth is starry-eyed and delusional. The proximate causes of these changes in character are two children in dire need of love and a flawed Frenchman who attracts love as easily as honey attracts flies. Over the course of this adventure, we find out --- roughly simultaneously with Victor --- that an improbable master puppeteer, Bob, is pulling everyone's strings. It takes roughly 400 pages of extensive dental work, struggles with drugs, a couple of torrid affairs, more than a couple of Sea Breeze cocktails, and the usual assortment of beclouding false trails and clarifying epiphanies to sort out the truth --- and Bob's role in it. I would not make this my first Victor Carl book, but once having made the gent's acquaintance, I would not miss this chance to renew my acquaintance with Victor and Beth."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Defense attorney Victor Carl is wary of representing Francois Dube, a chef convicted of murdering his wife. Although Francois claims innocence and wants a new trial, all evidence points to him as the culprit. Plus, Francois had a motive: he and his wife were in the process of divorcing and bitterly arguing over custody of their young daughter at the time of the wife's murder. Victor doesn't think there's much of a chance of winning this one, but his partner, Beth Derringer, seems enamored of Francois and pushes to take the case. As Victor begins investigating, into his life steps Dr. Bob, a dentist who not only fixes his broken tooth but inserts himself into Victor's life and begins to cause changes in Victor's life. Good things, such as a new girlfriend and better wardrobe. But before long, Victor discovers that Dr. Bob is tied to the events that led to the murder of the wife of the man he is now defending.This is one of those books the reader doesn't want to end. William Lashner has a penchant for delivering delicious witticisms that leave the reader laughing and wanting more. Victor Carl is a Jewish attorney with attitude and refreshing self-deprecating view of himself and his life. Dr. Bob is the ultimate character, a man outside the bounds of sanity who sees himself as protector of the world while inadvertently destroying others.

As the investigation continues, Victor uncovers layers to the mystery where people aren't always what they seem. A real page turner."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"This book was much better than I expected, much better even than the book cover's description or the reviews from other readers! The book's description suggested that the protagonist, attorney Victor Carl, was unconcerned with ethics and morality. The story certainly doesn't bear this out!Victor Carl is a dedicated non-conformist, yes. Within the legal field, a rebel with no sense of style and very little of what normally passes for ambition. He marches to the beat of his own drummer, possesses an irreverent sense of humor, as well as a whole lot of heart. I just loved him!The murder mystery at the heart of this novel is complex and a little far-fetched, but almost believable due to the many well-drawn characters and the author's legal knowledge. There's also a good deal of humor which I thoroughly enjoyed. I couldn't put this book down.This was my first William Lashner novel and I'm really looking forward to reading all his others."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"This is the first book I've read by Lashner, but I intend to get caught up with his past ones. I enjoyed the sardonic sense of humor. I'm just not sure if I was supposed to figure out where the story was going as early-on as I did."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Forget Grisham and Turow. Neither of them can do half the job Lashner does in bringing a courtroom drama to life. Victor Carl, the main character and narrator, is a one-of-a-kind lawyer, and for that we readers should rejoice. Carl is a self-deprecating attorney who takes on cases and gets involved in situations that compel the reader to keep turning the pages. The laughs generated by the story are genuine, the supporting characters well-drawn, and the courtroom scenes are entertaining. This story's villain is the most creative and entertaining character I've encountered in many years. This was a brilliant novel!Lashner, Sheldon Siegal, and David Ellis are writing some of the best legal thrillers out there, and if you haven't discovered any of these authors you have some great books ahead of you."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"You can't go wrong with a Lashner book, that's all there is to it. This guy ranks in my top 5 favorite authors in this genre, & I won't bother to bore you with re-hashing the storyline, but ...what about Bob??? Is he a character or what? Suffice to say, the pace of this book is break-neck, the characters are endearing (especially Victor, of course) as well as infinitely interesting, the plot plenty \\"thick\\", the dialogue realistic with humor in all the right places. I found myself anxious to get back to the book at every moment possible to see what would happen next. What more could you want? You really need to read this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"I stumbled across William Lashner through some Amazon.com reviews and found his books at my local library - boy am I glad I did!Falls the Shadow is a wonderfully entertaining novel that will keep you interested throughout the book. The lead character is a money hungry, cynical, wisecracking barrister who you will really enjoy getting to know. An unlikely chess playing sidekick turns up, who is equally cynical and quick with a put-down.All in all, this is a great suspense legal thriller type book, and you will certainly be glad you picked this one up."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Remember those noir mysteries of the 40s? The wise-cracking, cynical private eyes, the sultry women of mystery and the wonderfully bleak view of the world?Hello William Lashner and his creation Victor Carl. Welcome a world of sleaze and crassness where nary a hopeful day is seen.Victor Carl is retained to seek a new trial for a chef now sitting in prison for the murder of his wife. Carl is a cynic, a man seemingly defeated by the very concept of optimism. He operates a creaky two-person law office with his partner, a woman named . . . oh, she's forgettable, so forget it.Most of the other other characters are equally forgettable, but no need for concern, because Lashner's dialog propels the story. It's crackling good, filled with dark humor.One of the best characters - and a central one - is a dentist who seems determined to save the world. He knows everyone. Helps everyone.Interleaved with the murder mystery is Carl's suprising attempts to help a pair of young children as their involuntary pro bono lawyer. Lashner's creation of this scenario is a stroke of genius, levelling out the cynicism of Carl's character.Overall, a wonderful read and a pretty good mystery.Jerry"},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"This was my first exposure to William Lashner. I picked up \\"Falls the Shadow\\" while browsing through the library and I am glad I did. The book is not only an engrossing tale with colorful characters; it is also extremely well-written.The protagonist, Victor Carl, is a basically honorable attorney who is not above admitting that he is self-centered and out for a quick buck. In the course of this novel, he deals with two totally separate cases - a murder trial in which he takes on the case of a convicted man who wants a new trial and a child welfare case, which he reluctantly handles pro bono. It is to Lashner's credit that he juggles both cases effectively, introducing in each one very colorful and totally believable characters.But, as good as the two plotlines are, it's the writing that hooked me. Victor Carl is a very clever creation with a cynical world view; this leads to delightful asides about the human condition as he meanders his way through the situations in which he finds himself. Lashner is a superb writer who maintains a solid pace but never at the expense of character and witty dialogue. I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time.As soon as I finished \\"Falls the Shadow,\\" I immediately got my hands on three of Lashner's previous Victor Carl novels. I am looking forward to them. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"This book was one of the best detective stories I read in quite a while. Mr. Carl could be obnoxious but his heart was in the right place."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"I liked this novel and I liked the protagonist, Victor Carl. He was funny, witty, and seemed to be an all around good guy. I even liked the story premise and how they got to where they were going. I did not, however, like the ending. Blah! Don't get me wrong, I will probably read another of William Lashner's novels, but the ending of this one just really left me flat. Except for one thing . . . the portrayal of Dr. Bob, the dentist, was funny to the point of I may never go to a dentist again! LOL"},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Great writing, hilarious portrayal of Dr. Bob and his nurse. Give a copy of this one to your dentist"},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"My fifth Victor Carl book(?) all of them excellent. Like the others a little more but still a great read, and the character Dr. Bob, a great one. Victor's time in the dentist chair is priceless. William Lashner is becoming one of my favorites. Read this series. Great court room drama"},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Another outing for lawyer Victor Carl, a clever, witty guy whose apparent self interest hide a heart of gold.Here he and his partner Beth take on a review of a convicted murderer while Victor also has to contend with a child custody case and a spot of toothache. Once again Lashner writes very well and makes Victor an engaging and interesting character. Victor does not like this case or his client, but once he gets his teeth into something...And, talking of teeth, don't read this if you need a dentist as Bob the dentist plays an interesting part in this story which blends a lot of themes including one of redemption and the idea of \\"pay it forward\\". But it moves at pace and if the conclusion is not quite what we expect, it is somewhat thought provoking.Another good one from a talented writer."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"Good story, with good twists... until the completely awful, unrealistic, STUPID ending. Its actually annoying to have wasted so much time to come to such a completely fabricated and totally contrived finale. Its so utterly dumb."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"This is my 3rd or 4th Lashner book and I continue to enjoy the stories very much.The plotlines are clever and twist about in unpredictable, but credible ways. There is ample and quite funny dry humor - sometimes it makes your groan, but more often it makes you laugh.Victor Carl, the protagonist lawyer, is a bit Columbo-like, everybody underestimates him and he likes it that way. And his partner, Beth, is a good egg who carries things along so Victor can meddle around here and there in ways that get to the truth eventually.The stories are always a fun ride and hard to put down once you get engaged."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"I loved it. This book had mountains of entertaining characters, an engaging storyline, and was very smoothly written. Like butter to my eyes and imagination. I've read 3 of Lashner's and working on my 4th one now - Marked Man."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"I eat legal thrillers -- and this was the best that I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Falls the Shadow","review":"I have been reading William Lashner since his debut novel Hostile Witness, which is one of my favorite books. I enjoy lawyer Victor Carl and the rest of the regular characters. I look forward to each of Lashner's books, but I have been less satisfied with his most recent efforts, mainly because I feel like he is stretching to reach a certain page count. Falls the Shadow is interesting, but bloated. The story takes way too long to unfold. If the writer had been anybody but Lashner, I would have quit reading before page 300 in this 516-page effort. I'll continue to read Lashner, hoping for a return to the writing of Hostile Witness or the first 100 pages of Fatal Flaw."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],W={key:0},x={key:1};function C(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",E,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",x,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",W,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const M=u(B,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-d3068ea4"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/62.md","filePath":"guide/62.md"}'),L={name:"guide/62.md"},R=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{q as __pageData,R as default};
